To the Board of Regents:
The Executive Committee beg leave to report that since the last meeting they have appointed Mr. Duane R. Stuart, A. B., a graduate student
here, an Assistant in Latin, without pay.  They took this action owing to
the congested condition of the Latin classes, in which the sections were
unduly large.  Mr. Stuart is to teach one section an hour a day.  They
ask your approval of the appointment.

Regent Cocker presented and read the following report
from  the special committee appointed to consider the feasibility of the University doing its own printing.
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
Your committee have had under consideration the subject referred to
them by you at your last meeting, and beg leave to report that as a result
of their inquiries they are led to believe that, if the University owned and
operated a press adequate for all of its work, the present expense of its
printing, $3,500.00 per annum, would be increased rather than diminishedIn what way more extended and more minute inquiries would affect this
belief on their part they are, of course, unable to foresee.  On this account
the report now submitted might, if the Board desires, be considered a
report of progress. Very respectfully,
R. C. IAVIS,
ISAAC N. DEMMON,

degree who has not a knowledge of French and German sufficient for the
purposes of research."
SECOND RESOLUTION.

Courses I, 2; or (b) for those who entered with French, eight hours
of advanced work.

in the Calendar without anything to indicate that any particular group is
prescibed for any particular degree in the University.
III. That a student who has satisfied the requirements for admission
in any one of the four groups be regarded as a member of this Department of the University in full standing, with the privilege of working for

ANN ARBOR, November 19, I896.
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN:-It is necessary to make immediate provision in the Law
Library for the books that have been purchased with the Buhl Bequest.
Four new cases like those now in the Library should be provided. I submit
herewith a bid from Luick Brothers of $29.40 for each case.
A large part of the new purchase is of foreign books, and after they
are in it will be necessary to rearrange and classify our foreign collectionl
It seems desirable to the Law Faculty that the Law Librarian before attempting this work, should visit the State Library at Lansing, and learn as to the
method of arrangement and classification in use there; and I am requested
by the Faculty to ask that the Board authorize such a visit.
Respectfully submitted,
H. B. HUTCHINS, Dean.

The   following   communication     from   Professor F. W.
Kelsey was read by Regent Barbour:
ANN ARBOR, November I6, 1896.
James B. Angell, LL. D., President, University of Michigan:
DEAR DR. ANGELL:-Would it not be well to ask the Board of
Regents to make formal acknowledgment of the following gifts to the
University:
I. Of the gift of AMr. James E. Scripps to t/he Library. The great
value of this gift lies not only in the cost of the collection, but also in the
fact, that, owing to the long term of years over which the publications presented extend, and the small size of the editions, complete sets are coming to
be more and more difficult to procure and will soon be impossible to secure
at any price. In case it should seem desirable to have a list of the publications printed in the minutes, I enclose a copy.
II. Of the Graduate Fellows/zip, presenzted this year by Mr. Frank D.
Bennett, of Jackson. The holder of the Fellowship, named by the donor,
is William I)exter McKenzie, a graduate from the classical course of the
University of Michigan in I896.
Yours truly,
FRANCIS W. KELSEY.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1896.

Regent Fletcher presented and read the following report
of the director of the Gymnasium:
REPORT OF THE GYMNASIUM DIRECTOR.
The Gymnasium was first opened for exercise November I8, I394. The
880 lockers were soon rented, and more were gotten from time to time until
now there are 1,240.
Regular classes were begun on the opening day. It has been the
purpose of the director to make this part of the work so simple, so beneficial,
and so popular, that it would gain and keep the interest of the largest
possible number of students. The system taught is made up of the best
exercises of all systems, classified and adapted to the American character
and temperament by the veteran teacher, Robert I. Roberts, of Boston.
The class work has been, from the first, a great success. Practically
every one takes it, and, in point of numbers, no such classes have ever
before been seen in this country. Mr. Roberts, who has taught for twentyfive years, has never seen more than 150 men in a class, yet the classes here
have averaged more than that, and frequently they numbered more than
200. Classes of 225 were seen more than once in the Waterman gymnaseum in I894-95.
The physical examinations were begun November I, I894. They
were made as simple as possible, without interfering with their effectiveness,
so that the director would be free to give as much as possible of his time to
the actual work on the floor.  No measurements were taken for their
abstract or scientific value. No measurement was taken where it was
impossible to hope for an alteration. The taking of measurements which
are of no value to the person measured, but which are supposed to have a
purely scientific value has been done for a long time, and it is certainly
true that enough have already been taken to form a basis for all necessary
scientific deductions. For this purpose 40,000 or 50,000 measurements are
as good as,000,000o. The measurements taken by Dr. Seaver, of Yale, are
free to any one to serve as data for any other purpose, and Dr. Hitchcock,
of Amherst, has, within a few years, given to the world his measurements of
Amherst students, extending over a period of twenty years. It is simply
stating the truth to say that from this labor of nearly a quarter of a century
not a single fact of scientific interest has been deduced.
In 1894-95, 820 examinations were made. Of these, 644 were of men
and 176 were of women, the latter made by Dr. Annie Ives. A sample of
the simple card used that year is submitted. It was found possible to
make the examinations of benefit to the medical department by allowing a number of medical students to assist at them. This is done every
year.
In 1894-95 the Board of Control passed the important rule that no
student should be a member of any University team who had not been
pronounced physically sound by the director of the Gymnasium. In this




DECEMBER MEETING, 896.


year, also, was begun the annual competition for all-round excellence in
gymnastics. The prize, a silver cup, given by members of the Faculty, was
won at the first competition by Rudolph F. Flintermann, of Detroit.
The total membership of the Gymnasium in 1894-95 was about 1,500,
of which about 1,250 were men and about 250 were women. The average
daily attendance was between 400 and 500. The number of lockers rented
was 1,082. Of course the difference between the number of lockers rented
and the total membership is explained by the fact that many of the
lockers were used by more than one person.
In 1895-96 the total membership was about the same as in 1894-95.
This means a considerable increase in the number of men, as there was a
decrease of about Ioo in the number of women, owing principally to the
difficulty of taking gymnasium  work during the morning hours. The
classes were slightly smaller, due, I think, not to any failure of real interest,
but to the fact that after the first enthusiasm aroused by the new gymnasium had somewhat subsided, the students found it advisable to systematize
their work, to come, perhaps, fewer hours in the week, and to give a fair
amount of time to their special needs. The number of lockers rented was
1,182, an increase of Ioo. The number of examinations made was 449, of
which 352 were of men and 97 were of women.
It is as yet too early to give any definite figures regarding the work of
I896-97.  It is certain, however, that owing to the enforcement of the rule
concerning the use of lockers, there will be a falling off in the membership
of between 200 and 300. It seems incredible that the small fee charged
could make this difference, but such is the case.
Owing to the fact that there was no such rule previous to this year, it
is impossible to give the Board any figures as to the proportion of the
attendance by class or department. The attempt has been made to get
these figures this year, and they will be given to the Board in a future
report.
As to the relation of the director to athletics. He has had a certain
supervision and control of all forms, excepting Base Ball, until the present
year. His assistant in the gymnasium trained the Foot Ball and Track
teams, accompanied them on their trips, and carried out whatever suggestions were given him by the director. The present assistant was the choice
of Mr. Fitzpatrick and myself, after having considered all the candidates,
and having in mind all the duties he would be expected to perform. It would
seem that we were in the best position to judge as to his fitness, and that
our choice would have been gladly accepted by the students. They saw fit,
however, to go to the expense of engaging a special trainer for the Foot
Ball team, and by so doing took all supervision of it and all responsibility
for it out of the hands of the director.
The generous allowance for the gynasium made by the Board has
enabled the director to keep the apparatus in repair and to add to it from
time to time as seemed advisable. The present needs of the gymnasium
are increased bathing facilities, gas in locker rooms, and a swimming bath.

JANUARY MEETING, 1897.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, )
ANN ARBOR, January 27, 1897. 
The Board assembled in the room of the President at o1
o'clock A. M.
Present-Regents Barbour, Cocker, Cook, Dean, Kiefer,
Fletcher, and Butterfield.
Absent-Regent Farr.
The Secretary read the minutes of the last meeting, which
were, on motion of Regent Dean, approved and ordered
printed.
Sundry papers which had reached the President were
placed in the hands of appropriate committees of the Board
for consideration.
On motion of Regent Butterfield, the Board went into
executive session.
Regent Butterfield, chairman of the special committee
appointed at the last meeting, to whom was referred for
consideration the communication of Dr. D. A. MacLachlan
and others in relation to the removal of the Homeopathic
Medical College to Detroit, submitted the following report:
REPORT.
At a meeting of the Board of Regents, held December
i6, I896, there was presented to it the following petition:
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan:
"Whereas, the Supreme Court has established the valid"ity of the Act to remove the Homeopathic Medical College
"to the city of Detroit (Senate Bill No. 455 of the Public




20


JANUARY MIEETING, 1897.


"Acts of the State of Michigan, 1895), and whereas, the profession is favorable to the said removal as therein provided,
"and is practically unanimous in this desire as shown by the
"accompanying resolutions addressed to the President of the
"State Society, and signed by the leading Homeopathic phy"sicians of the State:
"Therefore, we, the Board of Control of the Homeo"pathic Medical Society of the State of Michigan, do hereby
"urgently request your Honorable Board to take such action
"at your next meeting, as in your wisdom      seems best, and
"report the same to us at an early date."
Attached to the above petition were several documents
similiar in character, signed by seventy persons and addressed
to the President of that Association, a former member of the
faculty of the Homeopathic College. In these documents the
subscribers urged the Board of Regents to remove the college
and pledged themselves to use their personal influence to
accomplish the result.
The method by which this personal influence is to be
utilized is apparent from   a circular circulated through the
mail, and which is as fellows:
" DEAR DOCTOR-Four years ago an attempt was made to 'amalga"mate' the Allopathic and Homeopathic departments of the University, that
"resulted in very nearly wrecking our College, and two years ago a bill was
"introduced at Lansing to abolish the College. Thereafter, at the request
"of the Homeopathic profession, the legislature enacted 'That the Board of
"'Regents of the University of Michigan are hereby authorized and directed
"'TO ESTABLISH A HOMEOPATHIC MEDICAL COILLEGE as a branch or de"'partment of said University, which shall be LOCATEI IN THE CITY OF
"'DETROIT.' It also directed the Regents to discontinue the chairs at Ann
"Arbor, and transfer them to Detroit, appropriated $25,00ooo for building
"and equipment, the profession agreeing to provide a site, and the trustees
"offering the use of Grace Hospital.
" In due time the bill was declared constitutional, the site was tendered
"the Regents, and they were urged to comply with the law. They refused.
"Homeopaths asked for a mandamus to compel them, and the Supreme
"Court ruled that the Regents might obey the law or not, as they chose.
"The College is still in Ann Arbor, with a reported total of 42 students.




JANUARY MEETING, I897.


21


"The Legislature convenes January Ist, and Homeopaths must be up
"and doing, if they finally secure what they undertook two years ago, viz:
"to rectify the fatal error made 20 years ago in locating the College at Ann
" Arbor. While they are about it they should go further and place it beyond
"the power of the Regents to hamper or suppress the College. As is well
"known, a 'rider' upon the University appropriation bill is the only and a
"certain means to enforce compliance with the law, and to secure the wish
"of the Legislature and the profession. Two years ago the legislators said:
"'Whatever Homeopaths agree upon, they shall have,' and they were true
"to their word. The profession were a practical unit in asking for the
"removal bill and the Legislature equally a unit in granting it. The situa"tion is the same now. If every Homeopathic physician will give prompt
"and affirmative answers to the questions on the enclosed postal card, the
"work of seeing that the removal bill is complied with is as good as done.
"The members of the profession in eight of the chief cities of Michi"gan have already pledged themselves to this end, only one having declined
"the request to sign. Taking this as an indication of the sentiment through"out the State, a unanimity greater even than two years ago seems likely
"to prevail. The request is again made to each and all members of the
"State profession, and it is hoped that not one will failto respond cordially
"and at once. If so, a new era will dawn upon Homeopathy in Michigan.
"Fraternally and truly yours,
"D. A. MACLACHLAN,
"President State Society.
"P. S. â€”It is thought best to have a joint committee, comprising the
"Board of Control of the State Society, and one for the whole profession.
"*    *    *    *    *    If names suggested on the enclosed postal
"don't suit, erase and insert the names you wish."
Your committee appointed to consider the question involved in the above documents would respectfully report as
follows:
From the best information at hand, we believe there are
in the State of Michigan about five hundred Homeopathic
physicians.   Under the circumstances your committee can
scarcely be expected to accept a petition signed by seventy
persons as evidence of the unanimity of the entire profession
of the State.  But whether the petition represents a majority
or a minority, it demands and is entitled to receive a fair and
frank answer, and, in discussing the question, we shall con



22


JANUARY MEETING, i897.


sider not only the statements in the petition, but those in the
circular accompanying the same.
I. The first statement in the circular is that four years
ago an attempt was made to " amalgamate" the Allopathic
and Hoineopathic departments of the University, and that it
resulted in nearly wrecking the Homeopathic College. The
facts are as follows:
About the time mentioned the then Dean of the Homeopathic Department suggested to the Board a plan by which
there should be one Medical School in the University to be
known as the Medical School of the University of Michigan.
That in that school both schools should be represented by
professors as to the chairs where the teachings were diverse.
That all students should be permitted or obliged to hear both
sides, be graduated as students of the Medical College of the
University of Michigan, and be left perfectly free to adopt
after their graduation the practice of either school as they
preferred.
After consideration the Board decided that so radical a
change should not be made without action of the Legislature,
as the Homeopathic school was dependent upon special legislation, and thus, so far as the Board was concerned, the matter ended, and the gentleman who made the suggestion has
since ceased to be a member of the Faculty, not, however, for
that reason. In the opinion of your committee, the personal
rivalries and dissensions which divided the Homeopathic
Faculty at that time, and which paralyzed its efficiency, had
a great deal more to do with the falling off in the attendance
of the Homeopathic College than the discussion of this resolution.
2. A second statement is that two years ago a bill 'was
introduced at Lansing to abolish the Homeopathic College.
Your commlittee have no present means of verifying this statement, but they are certain that no such action was ever taken
or approved by this Board. Nor had the Board any information on the subject, nor is it in any way responsible for it.




JANUARY MEETING, 1897.


23


3. The statement is made that the Board refused to
comply with the law. At the last session of the Legislature
of this State an Act, No. 257, Public Acts I895, was passed,
directing this Board to remove the Homeopathic College to
Detroit on condition that prior to such removal a suitable site
for the location of the buildings of such department should
be donated to the State in fee simple, and on the further condition that an arrangement be made with Grace Hospital for
the use of the same on such terms as to the Regents shall seem
appropriate, without expense to the State.  As the Board was
advised by its counsel, and as was apparent from the Act
itself, it was not only not the duty of the Board, but it had no
right, to take a single step until the conditions were complied
with, and it could not do this without being in danger of a
claim being made that the conditions had been waived. That
these conditions were exceedingly important is apparent, and
that bv the force of the Act itself the duty was laid upon
the Board of not removing the department until they were
complied with is also apparent, and yet these conditions have
not been complied with, nor has either of them. No site has
been procured or offered to the Board of Regents, nor have
the Board had any assurance that any fund existed anywhere
with which such site could be purchased. No arrangement
has been made or suggested, or offered to be made, whereby
the use of Grace Hospital free for a Homeopathic College
could be secured. It has been well known that for many
years Grace Hospital has run behind in its expenses, and in
order that the Board might be safe, and the people of the
State might be safe, in incurring the expense incident to the
removal of the Homeopathic Medical School to Detroit, some
guaranty should be given that the hospital would be sustained
in the future without expense to the people of the State. Not
only has this not been done, but, so far as your committee are
advised, no action whatever has been taken to secure that end.
Suggestions and applications have been indeed made to this
Board, but they have been in the nature of requests to do




24


JANUARY MEETING, I897.


something, or permit something to be done, different from
what is required by the conditions of the Act, and the doing
of which might have placed the Board in the position of assuming the burdens without receiving the benefits contemplated
by the Act.
To have removed the College without the fulfilment of
these conditions would have been to disobey a law of the
Legislature of this State and to betray a trust imposed by that
body upon this Board. From the passage of that law to the
present time, there has not been a moment when the Board
could have complied with the wishes of the gentlemen who
signed that petition without betraying that trust and violating
that law, and the petition in question is in substance a request
that the Board do both. Shortly before the case referred to
in the circular was brought, an application was made to the
Board for the making of some arrangement so that at the least
expense the question involved in the Act could be passed upon
by the Supreme Court of this State and settled.  It was admitted that the Act had not been complied with, but it was
claimed that it was a hardship upon the friends of the movement that they should be required to go to the expense of
procuring a site and to the trouble of making the arrangement
with Grace Hospital until that question should be decided.
And they asked that as a matter of courtesy the Board would
give to them an opportunity to test the law. The Board were
advised that if they should pass a resolution refusing to consider any offer made by the friends of the movement, a technical ground would be laid for an application to the Supreme
Court. The only offer made was a statement by the attorney
of those favoring the movement that they had secured an
option on a lot in Detroit. It was scarcely claimed that this
was in compliance with the law, and yet for the purpose of
enabling the question to be raised and as an act of courtesy to
them, the Board passed the resolution indicated. This is the
only attempt at the tender of the site made to this Board, and
since the decision of the Supreme Court no communication




JANUARY MEETING, I897.


whatever has been received by the Board upon the subject
from those favoring the movement, except the petition in
question.
It is true there are now 42 members of the Homeopathic
School. It is also true that the average attendance during
the past five years, prior to the present college year, in that
school has been only 41; and that a little over one year ago
the present Faculty took the school, without practically any
attendance, and by their industry, and their ability, and by
united action they have already brought it to its present condition in the face of the opposition of a number of Homeopathic practitioners in this State, who seem not so anxious that
the principles of medicine which they claim are the true ones
should be taught as that they should be taught in a certain
place.
The circular, however, outlines a scheme of action by
which the Board of Regents of this University are to be deprived of the discretionary powers which the people of this
State have vested in them by the organic law of the State-by
presenting to them the hard alternative of the abandonment
of those rights, or the starvation of the University. It becomes, therefore, not only proper that unjustifiable attacks
upon the past action of the Board should be repelled, but
that the question should be frankly and fully considered as to
what should be done for the future. In order to fully understand this question it is necessary to consider the position of
the Homeopathic Medical College in the University at the
present time. It has always been admitted that except as to
a very limited number of subjects the teachings of the students
of the Homeopathic College and of the College of Medicine
and Surgery are the same. All the Homeopathic profession
has ever asked until lately is that instruction in those few
subjects should be separate. For the first two years of the
medical course in the University, the students of both colleges take the same course, listen to the same lectures, and
work in the same laboratories.  In this way a very large




26


JANUARI Y AMEE 7zVG, 1897.


amount of expense has been annually saved to the State.
Apparatus, laboratories, libraries, and museums have been
used in common, which in case of a removal to I)etroit it
will be necessary to duplicate. This has for many years met
with general approval. Lately, however, there has been a
constant cry from a part of the Homeopathic profession in
this State for the institution of a Homeopathic College with
a full four years' course, separate in equipment and in all the
teaching chairs.  The Board has hitherto not yielded to this
demand, first, because in their judgment there was no reason
why the State should be put to the greater expense necessary
to the change, because it did not believe that the efficiency
of the college would be thereby increased, and second, because it was impossible for financial reasons to accede to it.
Medical education under the most careful, conservative management is always very expensive, changes are continually
being made in expensive apparatus, and in the construction
and equipment of hospitals; and the working force of the
college itself is more difficult to supply and at a greater
expense than in almost any other branch. It is felt that it is
an education that deals with life and death and that nothing
which really tends to its efficiency can be regarded as unnecessary. With the limited means at its command the Board
has never been able to meet many of the demands of the
medical faculties which it felt were reasonable. It is now
proposed in addition to what has hitherto been demanded to
remove this whole school to Detroit, and, for practically building up a new medical college, an allowance has been made of
$25,000. In the judgment of your committee $25,000 is not
enough for a building for from 5o to Ioo students if the lecture rooms, laboratories, and offices are all to be included in
it. In our opinion such a building would cost at least twice
that amount after the site was given to us.  The cost of
equipping the laboratories after the buildings are provided
would probably be from $4,000 to $5,ooo apiece.    The
following laboratories will be needed:  i. Chemical.  2.




JANU(AR Y MlEE ING, 1897.


27


Electro-therapeutical.  3. Biological.  4. Histological. 5.
Physiological.  6. Anatomical.  7. Pathological, including
Hygienic and Bacteriological. It is claimed that men can
be found in so large a city as Detroit who will act as professors in such a school free of charge and that the expense
would not thereby be increased. There are many branches,
such as chemistry, biology, etc., in which the instructors must
give their whole time to the work and cannot be medical
practitioners at all. These must all be paid wherever the
college is. In the present state of medical education specialists are demanded for the several chairs, and these are to
be procured only by selection from a wide field. We do not
believe that men of that class will be found who are willing
for any length of time to fill the chairs, without a salary. The
experience of this Board has been that while volpnteers might
be secured for advertising purposes to take appointments
temporarily, their continuance was only secured by the payment of the usual salary.
It is to be considered that in the removal of the Homeopathic School to Detroit, the Regents are expected to embark
on a serious enterprise and one which might have to the University at large very serious consequences. By the Act known
as the one-sixth mill bill from which the University derives
its revenues from the State, it is provided that the several departments shall be maintained as they then existed. If, therefore, this department should be once removed to Detroit,
those interested in that special school might and probably
would insist that the same facilities for education by way of
teachers, libraries, and laboratories as are now afforded at Ann
Arbor to their school should be furnished at Detroit. And to
accomplish this either the State must each year add more than
$25o000 to the income of the University in addition to the
large expense of the instalment of the college, or else the other
departments of the University must be weakened and the
efficiency of the University as a whole sacrificed to this one
school. If the people of the State desire a separate school of




28


JANUARY MEETING, I897.


Homeopathy at Detroit, they should at least understand in
advance the magnitude of the tasks they are undertaking and
they should not ask this Board to accomplish impossibilities.
In view of the wide differences of opinion which exists between
the promoters of this enterprise and this Board as to that expense, we would suggest that in case such school be established,
it be established under a separate board so that no claim can
be made that the school is not treated fairly in comparison
with other branches of the University, and the state may be
able to ascertain the actual cost of such an institution. It will
then appear whether this Board is correct or not. So far as
the Homeopathic College itself is concerned, we believe that,
like every other department of the University, it is stronger
and more prosperous because it is a part of the University, not
simply in name but in fact, and that students and teachers are
drawn to it, and retained in it, because of the University life in
which they may thereby participate. There are numerous and
important incidental advantages arising from the presence of
the other departments of the University, which whould be
almost wholly lacking in the new school. There are many
scientific lectures given here during the year which are helpful
to the students which would not be given there, and the stinulus and helpfulness of life in the atmosphere of the University
would be missing. There would be simply the narrow, special,
and technical work by the school itself to furnish training for
the students.
Your committee has thus far considered mainly the mere
question of dollars and cents. Behind all these and above all
these is the more important question of its effect upon the
University.  Long ago the people of this State abandoned the
idea of a University with separate branches in its different
cities, and adopted the policy of centering all its departments
in its present location. There, as we have already said, where
each department has added to the development and growth of
all the rest, it has grown to its present position of eminence
among the universities of the world. If it is proper, to satisfy

a few of the members of one of the great professions, to remove
one of its departments to Detroit, it is, on the request of other
of the citizens of the State, proper to remove other departments to other cities, and, once commenced, there is no visible
opportunity for pausing in the process of disintegration.  It
would be the beginning of the end. In the opinion of your
committee, to grant the prayer of the petitioners would be not
only a most flagrant breach of the duty laid upon us by the
Legislature of this State, not only impossible with any funds
within the control of this Board, and not only unadvisable for
the real interest of the school itself, but dangerous as the first
step in a policy which, once entered upon, could not easily be
abandoned, and which would ultimately lead to the destruction
of the University,
In view of these considerations, as well as many others
that might be urged, your committee reconmmend that the
prayer of the petition be denied.

FEBRUARY M~EETING, I897.


To THE HONORABLE THE BOARD OF REGENTS:
GENTLEMEN:-Having been appointed by the Board to ascertain the
value of certain property devised to the Board for the use of the University by
the late Dr. Anna Eastman Marsh, of Greeley, Col., with conditions annexed
to said devise, I beg leave to report, that I have corresponded with the administrator of the estate and with Dr. Marsh, the husband of the deceased. By
the terms of the will, a charge of $300 per year is laid upon the property
devised by said will in favor of Dr. Marsh, if he shall need the same. Also
one in favor of a sister of said deceased to procure her admission to the Old
Ladies' Home in Detroit. I find the property devised of the value of less
than $3,000. It is wholly unproductive. Dr. Marsh refuses to release his
annual charge and suggests that the property be left to him, and, at his
death, to revert to the University. I deem it very unsafe to accept the trust
as in the will provided and offer the following:
Resolved, That the Board decline to accept the bequest of Dr. Anna
Eastman Marsh and hereby renounce the same, for the reasons above given,
believing it beyond our power as a Board to assume the responsibilities and
conditions in said will provided and created.

To THE HONORABLE THE BOARD OF REGENTS:
GENTLEMEN:-On behalf of the committee charged with the editing and
printing of the volume commemorative of President Angell's Quarter-Centennial Celebration, I take pleasure in reporting that the entire edition of five
hundred and thirty-four copies, all neatly bound in cloth, has now been received, and that the total cost is as follows:
Printing............ $178 36
Binding..........     128 o2-$306 38

REGENT H. S. DEAN, ANN ARBOR.
DEAR SIR:-I hand you herewith a letter from Lieut. R. E. Peary, U.
S. N., in regard to skins of the North Atlantic walrus.
The opportunity here presented is a very unusual one. Full data
accompany each skin, and the careful measurements make the skins especially valuable. Our museum is entirely lacking in animals of this family,
and we are anxious to fill out serious gaps in our collection of typical mammals as rapidly as possible. A pair of walruses would not only add greatly
to our collection from a scientific standpoint, but would make a very striking exhibit, and these specimens would be especially interesting to many of
our visitors from the circumstances under which they were obtained.
The price at which they are offered is extremely low, the lowest price
quoted in any dealer's list being $I20.00 to $I50.00 for a single skin. Wal



50


APRIL MAIET TING, 1897.


rus skins are not ordinarily to be had at any price. Dealers who list them
do not usually have them in stock.
We ought to avail ourselves of this opportunity and secure a pair of
walruses while we can do it on such advantageous terms. Can the necessary funds be provided?      Very respectfully,
D. C. WORCISTrIR.
Approved-JAcoB REIGHARD.

Regent Butterfield presented and read the following
communication from Professor Levi T. Griffin.
Ann Arbor, Mich., March I2, I897.
TO THE HONORABLE, THE BOARD OF REGENTS, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
I submit herewith my resignation as Fletcher Professor of Law to take
effect Oct. I, I897, that being the month of my commencement of service.
It is possible, and perhaps, in the opinion of some, highly probable that the
infirmity which has overtaken, and still clings to me, impairs my efficiency
in my work as a member of the Faculty, and it is my desire to relieve the
Board of any embarrassment.
I beg to assure the Board that I shall ever maintain and cherish an
interest in the Department, and shall wish for it a continuance of that
increasing prosperity and usefulness, which fortunately has steadily attended
it since my connection therewith.
Thanking the Board for consideration extended under the circumstances.                      I am very respectfully,
LEVI T. GRIFFIN.

Regent Barbour presented and read the following communication from    the Librarian, relating    to establishing a
Circulating Library:
Ann Arbor, June 28, I897.
TO THE HONORABLE, THE BOARD OF REGENTS:
GENTLEMEN:-The subject of this communication can best be stated
by quoting a paragraph from President Angell's last report.
"As the number of volumes in our General Library is now about
85,000, I desire to urge the Regents to consider earnestly the feasibility of
setting apart a certain number of books, which students may be allowed to
draw from the Library and take to their rooms for a limited period. Believing that such use of certain books will be much more advantageous to the
readers, I have long looked forward to the time when it would be practicable for us to permit it. I have always thought that when the number of
volumes approached roo,ooo we might safely give this larger liberty to
students under certain restrictions. * * * * The expense of service
at the desk may be a little increased. The risk of loss is perhaps somewhat
enhanced. But after all proper weight is given to these facts, we have to
remember that the library is the great central power in the instruction given
in the University, and that the books are here not to be locked up and kept
away from readers, but to be placed at their disposal with the utmost freedom compatible with safety and with the general and equal convenience of
all students. The Library Committee have given some consideration to the
subject, and can doubtless soon furnish you with the essential facts, which
you may require in order to determine when, if at all, the change suggested
should be made in the administration of the Library."
The recent acquisition of a large number of duplicates-particularly
from the Felch bequest-has made it possible, with a moderate outlay, to
put this circulating department into operation before the end of the next
college year.  The removal of the statuary from the east wing affords
space. Shelving for 5,000 volumes can be supplied for about $soo. The
cataloguing and other preparation of the books would cost about $300.
Some appliances, not necessary for our reference work, would be required
for registering loans, but the cost of these would not exceed $25. This
would make the cost of putting the department into operation and completing the year, $425. We should then be in a condition to state with




JUNE MEETING, 1897.


91


some exactness the cost of operating it in the future. At present I estimate
that cost at $200 a year.
The subject has been presented to the Library Committee of, the
Faculty and that Committee recommends to the Board to authorize the
experiment, if it can be done without encroaching upon funds already
appropriated to other uses. They do not recommend it if it shall seem
necessary to draw the money to carry it out from the fund for the purchase
of books.             Respectfully submitted,
RAYMOND C. DAVIS, Librarian.
Regent Barbour moved that the matter lie on the table
for the present, and it was so ordered.

and Grounds, presented a schedule of repairs and alterations
which should be made during the summer.

NOVEMBER MEETING.
UNIVERSIT\ OF ' MlICII(;AN, 
ANNx A'Rt:t<, November 17, 1897. 
The Board assembled in the room1 of tle Pr'esident at o1
o'clock A. M.
Present, Regents Barbour, Cocker, Cook, Dean, Kiefer,
Fletcher, and Butterfield.
Absent, Regent Farr.
The Secretary read the minutes of the two previous meetings, which were on motion of Regent Barbour approved and
ordered printed.
Sundry papers which      had   reached the   President were
placed in the hands of appropriate comnmittees of the Board
for consideration.
Librarian Davis presented and read his annual report
which was as follows:
To THE HONORABLE, TllHE BOARD OF Ri(;.N'S O(F THEi UNVIVE1SITVY O
MICHIGAN:
GEN'rLEMEN. â€”The date for closing the year in the libraries of the
state is June 30th, apnd the library statistics compiled by the state librarian
are for a year ending at that time. It has seemed best to me, on this
account, to close our library year at that time rather than on September
30th, which heretofore has been the time for clo)sing it.
This report, therefore, covers only the nine months from October Ist,
I896, to June 30th, I897.
There were in all of the libraries of the University, June 30th, 1897,
113,990 volumes, 17,555 unbound pamphlets, and 1,275 maps. Of these
there were in the General Library 91,12 volumes, I6,o65 unbound pamphlets, and 1,275 maps; in the Iaw Library, I3,849 volumes; in the Medical
Library, 7,762 volumes and 1,490 unbound pamphlets; in the Library of the
Dental College, 817 volumes; and in the Library of the Hlom(epathic
Medical College, 450 volumes.
As stated in my last report, the books of the Hlomceopathic collection




/26


NlO VEBE'IIi''R AIEETINVG, 1897.


have hitherto been counted as a part of the M\edical Library. Their erection into a separate library makes a reduction of 325 volumes in the count
of the Medical Library.
During the year 625 periodicals were regularly received, as follows:
In the General Library, 450; in the Medical Library, 131; in the Iaw
Library, 12; in the Iibrary of the Dental College, 13; and in the,ilbrary
of the Homceopathic Medical College, I9. 'Fen daily and I5 weekly newspapers were also regularly received.
TIIE GENERAL LIBRARY.
ADDITIONs.-The additions to the General Library during the nine
months were 6,414 volumes, 45 unbound pamphlets, and 78 maps.
DISBURSE:MENTS. â€”Tlhe total amount of bills certified to by me for
this library was $7,849.52. Of this sum, $6,644.95 were paid for books,
pamphlets, and maps, and periodicals received irregularly, and $I,249.57
were for annual subscriptions to periodicals.  Certain miscellaneous
expenses, incurred for catalogue cards, readers' slips, etc., and paid from
the current expense fund, amounted to $49.35.
IMPORTANT Pl'RCHIASES. â€”Orders were given for a number of important sets of books, but comparatively few of them had been received before
the time at which this report closes. The following were received:
Bulletin de la Societe botanique de France. 40 vols............ $125.36
Bulletino di bibliografia e di storia delle scienze matematiche e
fisiche.  20  vols. and  Index.......................  73.00
Chetham Society Publications. 147 vols.......................  I25.00
Corpus scriptorum historiae Byzantinae. Ed. Niebuhr...........  75.62
Oncken's Allgemeine Geschichte.  46  vols.....................  50.00
Annales de l'Observatoire de Paris. Observations. 40 vols......  304.00
Berichte der deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft.  Second copy
for  laboratory  use.  --  vols.............................  244.75
Deutsche  Literaturzeitung.  I6  vols...........................  53.40
Baring-Gould's Lives of the Saints. 15 vols...................  I5.00
SPECIAL COL.ECTIONS.-Of the special collections that have been for
some time a part of the library the following have never received, or have
ceased to receive, additions:
The Parsons Library of 4,325 vols. and 5,00ooo pamphlets.
The Hagerman Collection of 2,260 vols.
The Dorsch Library of 1.676 vols. and I48 pamphlets.
The additions to the McMillan Shakespeare Library since the last
report have been 353 vols. It now numbers 4,354 volumes. The additions
to the Goethe Library were 35 vols. This collection now numbers 940
volumes.
Under this head of special collections I will place also the gift of Mrs.
Morris and the bequest of Hon. Alpheus Felch, received last year. A brief
reference was made to them in my last report. The former, which is to be




/2l
NOVElMBER MEE 7TING, 1897. 
known as the Morris Philosophical Library, has now been put in order for
use. When this collection was received it was estimated to contain I,I00
volumes. Inasmuch as a great deal of it was unbound it was difficult to tell
just how many there would be when they had undergone the operation of
binding. The unbound volumes are now bound and it is possible to
state just how many there are. The collection actually contained I240 volumes and I55 pamphlets.
Not long before his death Professor Morris made an effort to secure
for the University, through the aid of the older alumni, a memorial of President Tappan which should take the form of a collection of philosophical
books. The effort resulted in failure. The money received was only sufficient to buy oo00 volumes. It has seemed best to me to add these volumes
to the Morris Collection, which, thus reinforced, numbers I340 volumes.
The University has great reason to be grateful to IMrs. Morris for this
gift. It is both a valuable addition to the resources of the University
Library and a memorial of one whose connection with the University has
added much to its fame.
Equal progress could not be made with the Felch collection. About
700 volumes have, however, been catalogued and placed in their appropriate
classes on the shelves. The terms of the bequest did not' require that these
books should form a separate collection. When all have been catalogued a
typewritten list of them will be made and bound. This will show the nature
and extent of the bequest. In this list will appear also all additions made
to the collection by the children of Gov. Felch.
Besides permission to place the books with others on the same subject
in the library, permission was also given to dispose of duplicates that it was
not desirable to keep. Many of the duplicates were such as we greatly
needed; others are not needed and these we are disposing of as opportunity
offers. If other books are received in exchange for them they are added to
the collection; if money is received it is devoted to the purchase of books
to be thus added. In making purchases preference is given to American
history.
It gives me pleasure to add that the opinion expressed by me last year
in regard to the value of this bequest has been confirmed by all of our subsequent handling of it.
GIFTs.-From  the Duke of Lonbat was received a copy of a PreColumbian Mexican Book, known as the Vatican MS., No. 3773. This copy
was made by the chromo photographic process. An explanatory treatise
accompanies it. It is most interesting as showing the form of book in use
on a part of this continent at the time of its discovery. W;e are under obligations to Mr. Harlan I. Smith, of Washington, for presenting the claims of
this University for a copy of the work to the Duke of Lonbat.
From His Highness, the Maharajah of Jeypore, through Col. S. S.
Jacob, Superintending Engineer, six portfolios of Architectural Drawings
were received. These drawings were chiefly from old buildings at or near
Delhi and Agra.   Students of architecture cannot fail to find these
inspiring.

through Mr. Ferry's generosity, Io5 volumes and 25 pamphlets.
Mr. Jas. E. Scripps, of Detroit, made provision for the purchase of
books illustrative of Roman Archeology for the Department of Latin. Of
books of this nature there have been added at Mr. Scripp's expense, 144
volumes. It is a most valuable reinforcement to the art literature of the
Library.
Gifts were also received from President Angell, Dr. Herdman, Dr. S.
A. Jones, E. B. Pond, Esq., Mr. H. C. Ryan, a former student, Dr. S. A.
Green, of Boston, Dr. L. G. Doane, of New York, Professors Demmon.
Hinsdale, Walter, Kelsey and others.
As one of the depository libraries of the country this library receives
the documents of the general government: it is, of course, in receipt of all
Michigan documents: it is also supplied with such documents of other states
as are of value in the work of instruction, or are desired by patrons of the
library.
THE ENDOWMENT FUNDS.-The income of the, Coyl bequest of
$10,ooo.oo, available July I, 1897, was $796.76. Certain books were ordered
by the Committee to be paid for from this amount, but the orders had not
been filled at the time this report closes. The income of the Ford-Messer
bequest of $20,000.00, of which $12,000.00 have been paid in, was, July I,
1897, $638.13. None of the income of this fund has vet been expended.
USE OF THE LIBRARY. â€”The following statistics are taken from the
report of Mr. Finney on the use of the library:
Recorded reference circulation for the nine months,  -  I28,398 vols.
Drawn for home use by members of the Faculty,  -  -      7,000 "
Total,      -        -                         135,398 vols.
This is an increase of 2% over the twelve months of I895-96. This
"recorded circulation" represents about one-half of the use of the library.
*The daily average of readers in the Reading Room was I60. As


*Of this average of I60, 88, or 55 per cent., were men, and 72, or 45 per cent., women.
Statistics in regard to the character of readers show that 95.90 per cent. were University
students; 2.40 per cent. High School students, and 1.20 per cent., others.




/Z3
VoVE'     ER' M:EET7'IN GC,,897. 89
happened last year the seating capacity of the Reading Room (2I0) was
frequently overtaxed.
The privilege of consulting the books in the Bookroom was granted
to 75 students.
During the two semesters 360 students were admittted to the Seminary
rooms as follows: 80 to the East Room for the study of History, Political
Economy, Philosophy, and Pedagogy; and 270 to the West Room for the
study of English, French and German Literature, and Greek and Iatin
Literature and Art.
CONDITION OF THE LIBRARY.-Books subject to so much use as ours
are must give evidence of it. Every year it is necessary to retire some be
cause they are worn out, and every year a few are lost. On the whole the
books are in good condition as books. This, however, is not true, and has
not been true for several years, if by corndition is meant the shelving of the
books and their accessibility. We have a close classification, with a fixed
location of the volume. When shelves have become full, as all of ours are
now, practically, and a new book is received, a great many changes are
necessary to get it into its place in the classification-not only changes of
volumes on the shelves and their marking, but also changes of the shelf
numbers on the cards of the catalogue. Only those who have done work of
this nature can fully appreciate its difficulties. In the present crowded state
of the Bookroom it has become impossible to make these changes any
longer. The classification cannot be preserved, and with so much, and such
various, temporary shelving as we now have, the marking becomes unintelligible to all except those who have devised it. When your attention was
called to this state of things last May, and the desirability of a change from
a fixed location to a relative one pointed out, you made an appropriation of
$200.00 to begin the change in the summer.
THE WORK OF THE YEAR. â€”As has already been said the Morris Iibrary
has been put in order for use, and a small part of the Felch Library disposed
of. In October of last year the Alpha Na  Literary Society announced an
intention of disposing of its library which consisted of about I,o00 vols. I
was authorized by the Library Committee to offer $200.00 for the whole
number, and the offer was accepted. The collection was not in good condition as to completeness of sets, and as to bindings, but contained some
scarce editions of American authors and a good many duplicates needed in
the work of instrauction. These books have been catalogued, but they are
yet to be classified, and many of these will require the services of tie binder
before going into use.
In order to afford some relief to the Bookroom and at the same time
to make the books of common reference more accessible to readers, I recommended in the spring the construction of some cases to stand outside of the
delivery desk in which these books might be placed. On your authorization
these cases were made, and the books of reference most in demand have
been removed to them. As the work of reclassifying goes on they will be
filled.
In this connection I may properly call attention to the large numbler




NVOVEMBER MEETING, 1897.


of books received and disposed of-a greater number than have ever before
been added to the library in an equal length of time.
THE LIBRARY FORCE FOR I897-98.-The only change in the permanent force is the appointment of Mr. 11. O. Severance as general assistant
in the place of Mrs. M. W. Loomis who retires on account of ill health.
The desk attendants will be Frank I)iehl, A. A. Crawford, E. F. Carey, and
and R. P. McMaster. Mr. A. C. Adams will have charge of the East Seminary Room and Mr. Fred Heffelbower of the West Room.
THE WORK OF THE COMING YEAR.-When the regular purchases and
the gifts are taken care of and readers served, not much time will be left for
other work. As far as we can plan now, all the spare time we have will be
devoted to carrying forward the change in classification.
EXTENSION OF THE LIBRARY.-An extension of the Library Building
has become a necessity, unless we are willing to see its growth in usefulness
arrested. I think there is no doubt of this necessity in any quarter. The
shelving capacity of the Bookroom, including all the temporary shelving
that it will contain, has been exhausted. To dispose of the overflow outside
of the Bookroom, rooms needed for other purposes have been occupied. If
more temporary shelving can be provided, we can better our present condition, but the congested state will still remain, and the conditions for adininistering the library, which are now hard, will be very hard.
We already have a good deal of matter that is rare and valuable, and
some that is unique. It is impossible under present conditions to guard this
against indiscriminate handling, and consequently from injury, or loss.
There should be rooms that are of fire proof construction where this can
be preserved from danger, and yet made accessible to any who may need to
consult it. Having such conveniences for the safe keeping of especially
valuable material would greatly increase our chances of securing more of it.
The present methods of conducting advanced work in literature, art,
philosophy, language, and the political sciences have come to be called
"laboratory methods."  There must be actual contact of the teacher, the
student, and the illustrative matter, as books, periodicals, maps, diagrams,
models, and pictures. This cannot be done successfully in recitation rooms
distant from the place where all this material is housed. The rooms must
be a part of the Library Building. These advantages for advanced work
are enjoyed in many of the Universities now, and all are working in that
direction.
What lies in the way of this enlargement is lack of funds. The Iegislature can be appealed to for help, but can a reasonable hope of timely help
from that quarter be entertained? If it were to be the sole request made it
is not impossible that it might be granted, but if coupled with others, as it
would almost necessarily be, it is impossible.
In going over the possible ways of obtaining help the following has
seemed to promise most. That it contemplates several things rather than a
single one, increases, it is thought, rather than diminishes, the prospect of
success. An appeal to the Alumni is proposed. The several objects are:




NOVEMOBER MilEE TING, 1897.                    X
i. A practical object, viz.: an extension of the Bookroom sufficient to
relieve the present pressure and provide for the increase of fifteen or twenty
years.
2. Another practical object, viz.: to erect at the end of the extension,
and as a part of it, a building to be known as Alumni Hall. This is to be
devoted to the work of the Graduate School, and provide a home for that
now, and hitherto, homeless branch of the University.
3. A sentimental object, viz.: to make this Alumni Iall a memorial of
the students of the University who died in the civil war. This memorial
feature may appear in a general way in the architecture of the building, and
specifically in some portion of it, open to the public, where the names of the
fallen may appear in mural inscriptions and where their devotion to their
country may be symbolized in appropriate statuary.
The probable cost of the whole would be $Ioo,ooo.
The propriety of some kind of a memorial has been discussed somewhat among the Alumni at various times and is referred to as something
that ought, at some time or other, to be accomplished.
THE OTHER LIBRARIES.
MEDICAL LIBRARY.-The additions to the MIedical Library were 577
volumes. Of these 390 volumes were bought, 36 volumes were presented,
and 51I volumes were the results of binding periodicals. The total of bills
certified to by me for this library was $I,912.04. Of this sum $I,385.06
were for books and periodicals published irregularly, and $526.98 were for
annual subscriptions to medical periodicals.
LAW ILIBRARY. â€”There were added to the Law Library I,785 volumes.
This large increase over the acquisitions of former years is due to purchases
made with the Buhl bequest of $So,ooo.oo, of which about $8,000.00 were
expended. Inasmuch as these purchases have been largely in the line of
rare books and sets of books that are of great value and interest I desired
Mr. Vance, the Iaw Librarian, to make a brief report in regard to them.
lte reports as follows:
During the past year important and valuable additions have been
made to the Iaw Library. These additions have consisted of such English,
Irish, and Canadian reports as were necessary to make the respective sets
complete; also of a full set each of the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
reports, and a very full collection of the Scotch reports. These additions
have made the library so far complete that almost the whole body of the
case law may be found upon any given point from the earliest time to the
present â€”from the Year Bocks to the current decisions of the English courts.
The Library also contains practically complete sets of the decisions of the
Courts of all the states, the reports of the Supreme Court of the United
States of which there are the official edition, and the Iawyers' Co-operative
edition, and also the reports of the other courts of the United States as
reported in official editions, and in the " Federal Cases," and in the Federal
Reporter.




NOVEM BER'        E EETING, Sc9)7.
This statement shows that the library provides the means necessary
for original investigation, and assures the student that he will find everything
in the shape of case law that he seeks."
This state of completeness of the collection to which Mr. Vance refers
results, as I have already said, from the expenditure of the Buhl bequest.
A very careful study of the needs of the library was made, and these it was
found possible to supply to a great extent.
DENTrAIL  IBRARV. ---Forty-two ( 42 ) volumes were added to the
Library of the Dental College. Eight of these were bought and 34 were
the results of binding periodicals.  l'he total of bills certified to by me for
this library for the nine months was $36.25.
IHOOM(EOPATHIC IBRARY. ---In my report for last year I said that I
designed in the future to consider the Hommopathic books as forming a
separate collection. The reasons given for so doing were that they were
bought with money specifically assigned by you for that purpose, and that
they had become sufficiently numerous to justify such a step. A careful
count of them was accordingly made, and there were found to be 325 volumes. This number (325) has been deducted from the whole number of
volumes in the Medical Library, as given at the beginning of this report.
The number of volumes added to the Homceopathic Library during the
nine months was 125. The total of bills certified to by me was $216.87.
THE BINDERY.
The nine months of additional experience with the bindery has not
materially altered the views that were entertained in regard to it when my
last report was made. It has been necessary to add to the expense for
labor on account of the number of unbound books in the Morris Collection,
and an unusual influx of other unbound matter. Of the Morris books alone
there were 592 unbound volumes, which have been bound in leather or
cloth, and are in excellent condition for use. The cost for additional help
was, for the nine months, $I24.00.
It will be necessary to employ some additional help the coming year,
also, to put certain unbound portions of the Felch Library into condition
for use. If the additions to the library become greater for each succeeding year, and the use of the books becomes greater, it is evident that more
binding, rebinding, and repairing will be necessary. If there is this increase
of books, and their use, as we hope there will be, the bindery will be an
economical feature, for it is when the amount of work is the greatest that
the most is saved to a library by owning and operating a bindery. The
actual outlay for the bindery for the nine months was as follows:
Labor....................................................  I,o I9.00
M aterials................................................  343.75
T otal...............................................  $1,362.75


The following table, prepared by Mr. Finney, shows the number of

DECEMBER MEETING.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, )
ANN ARBOR, December 22, 1897, 
The Board assembled in the Dean's office in the Law
Department at 0o o'clock A. M.
Present, Regents Cocker, Cook, Dean, Kiefer, Fletcher,
and Farr.
Absent, Regents Barbour and Butterfield.
The Secretary read the minutes of the last meeting which
were, on motion of Regent Kiefer, approved and ordered
printed.
The President stated that his annual report had been
prepared and was subject to the wishes of the Board. The
Board expressed a desire to hear the report read, which was
done. The report is as follows:
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
By request of President Angell, I have prepared, and
beg leave to present to you, the President's annual report for
the year ending September 30, 1897. In the performance of
this duty, I have labored under considerable embarrassment
by reason of the fact that during the year that the report
covers, I was identified with but one department of the University and had only a limited opportunity for observing the
work of the University as a whole. For the most of this
report I am indebted to the heads of the different departments, who, at my request, have kindly furnished me with
necessary information and with suggestions as to pressing
needs.
Appended to the report will be found a list of the
appointments, reappointments, and resignations of members




134


DECEMBER AMEETING, 1897.


of the Faculties during the year; a statement of the degrees
conferred since the last report; a summary of students in
attendance, and a list of the examinations for advanced
degrees held during the year.
As will be seen in the summary of students in attendance,
the total enrollment of the year, exclusive of Summer School
students, was twenty-eight hundred and seventy-eight, a slight
falling off from the attendance of the previous year, which
was twenty-nine hundred and twenty-two. In most of the
Departments, however, the attendance was larger than ever
before, the decrease being mainly in the Department of Law.
But this was expected, and was due to the change in that
Department from a two to a three years' course. It should
be noted in this connection that the attendance of the present
year exceeds that of any previous year, it having now reached
the unprecedented number of 3,090. It is probable that the
total enrollment of the present year, exclusive of Summer
School students, will reach 3,150. One fact in connection
with the attendance of the last few years must especially challenge attention, namely, that the number of Michigan students has been steadily gaining. During the years I893-4,
1894-5, I895-6, and 1896-7, the attendance from Michigan
was, respectively, 1,400, 1,551, r,632, and 1,747. The University of Michigan belongs to the people of the State, and
that there is a growing appreciation among the people of the
advantages offered here is certainly apparent from the increasing attendance of Michigan students. With over sixty-five
per cent. of 'our students coming from Michigan homes, it
cannot be doubted that the influence of the University is
rapidly permeating every part of our commonwealth. But
while we are gratified with this proof of local appreciation,
we should not forget that our non-resident contingent contributes much to the strength and influence of the University.
It is certainly a matter of congratulation that the non-resident
attendance continues to be so large and that so many States
and countries are represented in our student community.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


135


During the last year the non-resident students numbered
I,I3I, coming from forty-four different States and territories
and from the following foreign countries and provinces:
China, England, Japan, Germany, Hawaiian Islands, Austria,
Barbadoes, Bulgaria, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Ontario,
and Quebec.    Illinois sent us the largest number, 307.  The
number from Ohio was i99; from Indiana, 102; from Iowa,
82; from New York, 70; from Pennsylvania, 68; from Missouri, 39; from Wisconsin, 33; from Massachusetts, 30; from
Kansas, 24; from California and Kentucky, each 23; from
Minnesota, 19; from Colorado and Utah, each 17; from Montana and Nebraska, each i3; from Washington, II. Ontario
sent us I6 students, and 63 came from the New England
States.
The number of women in attendance was as follows:
Department of Literature, Science, and  the Arts.............................. 55I
Department of  Medicine  and  Surgery...........................................  7I
Department of  Law...............................................................   6
School  of  Pharmacy.................................................................  7
Homoeopathic Medical. College..............................................  7
College of  Dental Surgery....................................................   5
647
In the last report of the President, the number of women
in attendance was given as 6oi.    The increase of 46 was
mainly in the Literary Department, although, with one exception, there was a slight increase in all departments.
The notable event of the year was the appointment of
President Angell to the Turkish mission.  Three times before
during his long and brilliant service as chief executive of the
University, he has been summoned by our General Government to public duties of great delicacy and responsibility.
And in the discharge of these public trusts he has always
brought signal honor to himself and to the University.   His
learning, his natural temperament and abilities, together with
his large experience in public affairs, so eminently fit President Angell for diplomatic service that his selection for
further labors in that field met with a generous and universal

approval.  Although regretting the temporary withdrawal

necessitate, and the loss to the University that would inevitably come therefrom, the members of this Board were of the
opinion that the wishes of the Administration and the public
should be respected. They, therefore, unanimously granted
a leave of absence.
In the general work of the Literary Department during
the past year there was little that calls for special comment.
The different courses were given as announced, and it is the
universal feeling that the best of results were realized.  In
some lines of work the instructors labored under serious
embarrassment by reason of the large classes that they were
compelled to conduct. In lecture courses, the size of the
class is a matter of small importance, but in courses in
which the scheme of instruction contemplates that the student
shall receive individual attention and drill, if substantial
advancement is to be made, it is of the highest importance
that the sections be of a size that will admit of personal
work with each student at each exercise. My inquiries have
led me to the conclusion that in the departments of modern
language particularly the classes are over-crowded, and that
relief should be afforded by enlarging the instructing force
as soon as the necessary funds are available.
The Professorship of Philosophy, which had been vacant
for nearly two years, was filled at the January meeting of
this Board, in 1896, by the election of Professor Robert M.
Wenley.   He entered upon his duties October I, 1896.
Under his direction the department was reorganized during
the past year and more fully equipped. Provision was made
for instruction in physiological psychology, and, by reason of
the increase in the instructing force, the department was
enabled materially to enlarge its field of work. As a result,
a new impetus was given to the study of philosophy and
larger numbers were at once attracted to the courses.
During the past year there were eighty-six students doing

graduate work in the Literary Department. Five of these
were studying in absentia for the Master's degree and five,
although candidates for an advanced degree, were enrolled in
other departments. The enrollment of the previous year in
the Graduate School was seventy-four. This slight increase
in attendance is encouraging, but the growth and prosperity
of the Department are not what they should be, or what they
would be if the necessary funds for its development were forthcoming. Our first duty as a State University is undoubtedly to
the undergraduates. This is emphatically true so long as the
State makes no special appropriation for the equipment and
maintenance of a graduate department and the department is
without private endowment or support. Under existing circumstances, we can conduct graduate study only in connection with the undergraduate work and as incidental thereto.
No professor can give his undivided attention and predominant energies to graduate students, and no professor should,
under the present conditions or unless specially engaged for
that purpose. In this University graduate instruction should
never, in my judgment, be given at the expense of undergraduate instruction. But this advanced work must be done
in some way, if we are to retain our place as one of the leading universities of the country. There are other reasons,
also, for its encouragement, and not the least of these is the
wholesome influence of a graduate department upon undergraduate work. There is, moreover, a demand for advanced
instruction, and we should not forget that, in providing for
this, we are serving the commonwealth, for we are supplying
in some measure the pressing and increasing public necessity
for young men and young women who are thoroughly equipped
for expert work in the higher departments of activity  It is
pertinent, I think, that I should quote briefly upon this subject from President Angell's last report: "It would," he says,
"be a grave mistake for the Regents or for the State to fail
in appreciation of the great value to us of the vigorous prosecution of the advanced work of graduate students. The




138


DECEMBER MEE TING, z1897


presence of such a body of mature and aspiring students is
uplifting and inspiring in its influence on the undergraduates.
Moreover, if we are really to prepare men and women for
conspicuous positions, we must carry them beyond the boundaries of the undergraduate curriculum.  Especially is this
true of those who are aiming to occupy prominent places as
teachers. There is in almost every field of activity a call for
a certain number of men so thoroughly trained that they may
justly be called experts in their special departments. The
institution that is unable to furnish this kind of training can
hardly aspire to the name of a university. It is the proper
and the necessary function of this University to supply this
instruction. Else the sons and daughters of Michigan must
needs go elsewhere to find it. We do not believe that the
State desires that they should be compelled to go elsewhere.
But it should be understood that this advanced teaching
makes great demands on the professors. Each teacher can
profitably instruct only a small number. The teaching must
be largely personal, that is, specially adapted to the needs of
each individual student. It is, of course, more expensive
than undergraduate instruction. The question, therefore,
with which this University and the other large State universities is confronted, is this: Are the States willing to furnish
the means for providing this kind of instruction? Just now
there is no more important question concerning higher education to be passed on by our western States." It is certainly to be hoped that the people of the State of Michigan
will in the near future answer this question in the affirmative
and come to the aid of the University in its effort to supply
the demand for graduate instruction, or that some of our
wealthy citizens may liberally endow the department. It is
a most worthy object for private benefaction, and a gift for
this purpose would be of inestimable value not only to the
graduate department but to the University as a whole. It
would also be a graceful and enduring testimonial to the
cause of advanced scholarship in the west.




DECEMBER MEETINVG, 1897.


139


At the January meeting of this Board in l896, Dr. Eliza
M. Mosher was elected Professor of Hygiene and Women's
Dean in the Department of Literature, Science, and the
Arts.  This was a step that had been for some time contemplated, and the wisdom of the action was at once recognized.  The expected completion at an early date of the
Women's Gymnasium emphasized the necessity of provision
being made at once for the superintendence and direction of
the physical education of the women of the University. Dr.
Mosher entered upon her duties October I, 1896. She at
once organized a course in Hygiene.    This was made
elective but was very generally attended. The first semester
was devoted to a consideration of Personal Hygiene; the
second, to Domestic and Municipal Hygiene, including
School Hygiene. It was the aim of the instructor to make
her teaching so practical that it should make its own appeal
for adoption into the lives of those taught.  Dr. Mosher's
duties as Dean include, in addition to those which ordinarily
belong to that office, a general physical examination of each
new woman student and a registration of her physical history
and condition upon beginning her course of study in the
University. This examination, in addition to the incidental
use that it serves in connection with the granting of excuses
for absences, enables the instructor to decide as to the advisability and safety of gymnasium work for each student.
It also brings her into close relation with the women of the
University in the early months of their student life, thus
giving opportunity for personal counsel at a time when it is
often much needed. During the year one hundred and fiftythree women were enrolled for gymnasium work.  Careful
physical measurements of nearly all were made and a chart
was prepared for each. In this way the instructor was able
to estimate at the close of the year the degree of development attained.  As planned, the gymnasium  course for
women extends over three years, the work of each year being
more difficult and demanding greater skill and self-control




140


DECEMBER MEETING, rS97.


than that of the previous year. In a communication to me
upon the subject, Dr. Mosher states that the gymnasium
work was interrupted and made more difficult by reason of
irregularity in attendance, and suggests that in her judgment
the highest success can be gained only by including the work
in that required by the University or by placing it upon the
credit basis. The experience of the past year has, in my judgment, demonstrated the necessity for the new chair and the
fitness of the incumbent. It is to be hoped that the way will be
opened in the near future for completing the women's gymnasium, as in its present unfinished state the work of the department must necessarily be more or less imperfect and incomplete.
The gymnasium work with the men was carried on during
the past year without any particular change. But a special
effort was made to interest the students more generally in the
physical examinations.  Improved physical measurements
were adopted which show at a glance, by means of a chart,
the general condition of the student examined and also his
relation to the average student. These charts are furnished
the students free of charge, and they are proving quite successful. The total membership of the gymnasium for men,
as shown by the lockers rented, was ten hundred and thirtytwo, divided among departments as follows: Faculty, six;
Literary, three hundred and ninety-seven; Law, two hundred
and forty; Engineering, one hundred and fifty; Medical, one
hundred and thirty-seven; Dental, seventy-four; Pharmacy,
twenty-three; Homoeopathic, five.  The  average  daily
attendance is reported by the Director as having been about
three hundred and fifty.  The number of classes daily was
three. Many lockers were rented by students simply for the
purpose of having access to the baths, and this, I am
advised, continues to be the practice. It is a very general
feeling among the faculties that some means ought to be
devised for awakening a more extended interest in regular
gymnasium  work.  Under the present regulations which
leave the taking of the courses and attendance at classes




DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


141


entirely at the option of the student, the Director must
necessarily be seriously handicapped in any efforts that he
may make to reach large numbers or to bring about regularity
in work. In many universities certain classes of students are
required to report regularly at the gymnasium for assigned
exercises, and in others, when a student has once elected the
work, he is required to attend regularly and complete the
course unless excused by the proper authority. The matter
has been considered by the Literary Faculty and by the
Senate at different times, but such consideration has never
resulted in the adoption of definite requirements. It is to be
hoped that some scheme will be formulated whereby the
opportunities offered by the gymnasium may be taken advantage of by larger numbers and particularly by those who
are most in need of physical training and development.
The separation of. the Department of Engineering, two
years ago, from the Department of Literature, Science, and
the Arts, of which it had so long been a part, brought the
engineering instructors more in touch with the students, and
it became possible to look more carefully after matters of
administration and discipline.  The engineering students
still have the same privileges of choice of the different
branches given in the Department of Literature, Science, and
the Arts so far as is compatible with the amount of required
work in their chosen lines; and in social and class matters,
they are regarded by the literary students as classmates. As
the young men come from the same schools, at the same age,
it has been felt desirable to foster and encourage a mutual
respect for literary and technical studies.
The revised and moderately increased requirements for
admission to the Department of Engineering, already accepted
by this Board, go into effect next year. Good results are
expected from the change. After a long and careful discussion, and with the approval of the Board, the scheme of
required work has been recast, some new subjects added, and
the number of hours of work prescribed for a degree increased




142


DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


from one hundred and twent, to one I/zndr-ed acnd thirty. The
prescribed work of the first year has been made the same for
all students. This change necessitates the postponement by
the new student of the definite choice of a particular branch
of engineering for a year, when, it is thought, he is better
able to select the line of work for which he is suited.
The shops of the Department are now busy and crowded
through both semesters, and any material increase in the
number of students will necessitate an increase of shop capacity, unless the required work is cut down.
More room is needed in the Department of Electrical
Engineering, as it is without a drafting room, and there is
but one lecture-room for both Physics and Electrical Engineering. The experimental work in steam and mechanical
engineering should also have enlarged quarters. Some of
the apparatus has to be set up and taken down each year to
make room for other experiments. Consequently the number of students that can work in experimental lines is seriously
limited. The quarters occupied by the Electrical Engineering Laboratory are also very restricted. A new building for
experimental work in these two departments is very much
needed and should, if possible, be provided in the near
future.
Some short courses in Electrical Engineering will hereafter be offered to students in Civil and Mechanical Engineering, and some of the courses in drafting and experimental
electrical work will be extended. These additions have been
made possible by the employment of another instructor.
There seems to be a growing disposition for students to
extend their course so as to include both Mechanical and
Electrical Engineering.
Attention of the Board, I think, should be called to the
fact that frequent inquiries are made for a course in Architecture and also for a course in Marine Engineering or Naval
Architecture. If facilities in these lines could be offered,
they would undoubtedly attract many students.




DECEMBER MIEETIWNG, 1897.

Duriig the past year the Department of Medicine and
Surgery experienced a large degree of success. In I890 this
Department began the first obligatory four years' course
demanded by any medical school in the United States. The
friends of the Department and of the University in general
were very much afraid that the increased requirements for
admission and the increased length of the courses of instruction would greatly diminish the number of students. That
this fear was altogether groundless, is shown by the fact that
the number of students enrolled last year was greater than
ever before in the history of the Department, with the exception of a few years directly after the close of the war, when
many young men who had been in the hospital service of the
army crowded into the Medical schools. While success is not
by any means to be measured by the number of students, but
rather by the excellence of the work, it is gratifying to know
that the men and women who intend to enter the medical
profession are willing to spend more time and more money in
getting their professional education, provided they feel confident that they are obtaining the best that the country
affords.
The number of students in this Department is as large as
can be accommodated with the present equipment. In fact,
all the laboratories are crowded to their utmost capacity and
there is urgent need of liberal appropriations from some
source in order to enlarge and improve the facilities. Medical education has made great advances within recent years,
and if the University is to maintain the position that it has
won among the great medical schools of the world, we must
have improved facilities. It is to be hoped that the Legislature and the people will appreciate these facts and that provision for the pressing needs of this Department will be
forthcoming.
During the past year only about fifty-six per cent. of the
patients applying for admission to the University Hospital
were accommodated inside the building.  The number of




144


DE CEMBER MEE TIVNG, i8 97.


beds should be largely increased. The University Hospital
is a great medical charity; it is worthy of the support of the
State. The majority of patients coming here are people who
can well afford to pay the small fees demanded for board and
room, but would not be able to pay for expert medical attention. Hundreds are saved from the pauper classes each year
by the work of this institution. An examination of the list
of patients for a number of years past shows that the majority
come from the rural communities of the State. The farmers,
more than any other class, reap the benefits of the hospital
facilities given by the University. The last Legislature apparently appreciated these facts, and made an appropriation
for keeping the hospitals open during the summer. Two or
three bills were also passed which will better provide for
those who need the care that can be given here. This Board
has done what it could with the limited means at its command,
to improve the hospital facilities.  Sun-rooms have been
added, and a building is now in process of erection for the
accommodation of nurses. This building will also furnish
dining-room  accommodation for patients.  But the other
improvements indicated are in the nature of pressing needs,
and it is hoped that the way for making them will soon be
opened.
I am pleased to be able to report that the last year was
a successful one in the Department of Law. For the first
time the three years' course was in full operation. Its success has now been thoroughly demonstrated. As was expected, there was a slight falling off in attendance last year,
but that it was only temporary, and due entirely to the lengthening of the course, is apparent from the fact that this year
the attendance is very much larger than ever before in the
history of the Department. The increase is particularly significant when we remember that, in addition to the lengthening of the course, the requirements for admission have been
materially raised, and that the new requirements went into
effect for the first time this year. With three large classes in




DECEMBER MEE TING, I897.


145


attendance, the accommodations for this Department, as this
Board well understands, are entirely inadequate. The failure
of the Legislature at its last session to make an appropriation
for an addition to the building, made it necessary for us to
resort to some temporary arrangement for the accommodation
of the increasing numbers. The old chapel in the central
building has been temporarily assigned to this Department,
and is now in constant use for law classes. But the expe
dient is far from satisfactory. The room was not designed
for lecture purposes; with reference to the Law Department
it is inconveniently located, and it is much needed at times
for exercises of the Literary Department. Furthermore the
mingling of large classes from different departments in the
same building is liable to result in more or less confusion and
disorder. With the increased attendance the library accommodations of the Department are far from adequate. I am
well aware of the fact that the Board understands fully the
necessity for an addition to the building of this Department
and that the needed improvement will be made as soon as the
means therefor are available.
During the year there were some changes in the Faculty
of this Department. These are noted in Appendix A. The
practical work of the Department was materially strengthened
by the addition of a course in conveyancing and by the provision for a professorship in this subject. As stated by the
Librarian in his report, a large part of the Buhl bequest has
been expended for additions to the Law Library, principally
for foreign reports, in which the collection was noticeably
weak. The Library is now one of the best in the country for
law school purposes and with a comparatively small additional expenditure could be made practically complete. The
expense of keeping it up, however, is considerable, and it is
hoped that some friend of the Department will provide a
permanent endowment for that purpose.
Under arrangements perfected during the past year, it is
now possible for a student to carry on, to some extent and




146


DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


under certain conditions, collegiate studies and studies in
law at the same time, and thereby shorten the combined
courses by one year. Students taking this combined course
are subject to the special direction and control of a joint
committee from the Literary and Law Departments. This
step, I think, is a most desirable one. Already quite a large
number of students are taking advantage of the opportunity,
and the result will undoubtedly be that many will be attracted
to collegiate work who otherwise would pass directly from
the high school to their law studies.
In the School of Pharmacy the course of four years is
steadily gaining ground, both in the number of its students
and in the opportunities of its graduates.  The research
work has received, in the past two years, the support of a
fellowship granted by the liberality of Messrs. F. Stearns &
Co., and now continued for another year.  Of still larger
advantage has been the employment in the laboratory of the
school of graduate workers in research upon the Revision of
the Pharmacopoeia of the United States. This employment
of our graduates, now authorized for another year, embraces
both experimentation in the laboratory and compilation in
the library, the resources of the latter being fully taxed to
meet this demand.   The highest awards for investigation
have been accorded lately by the American Pharmaceutical
Association to work done under the fellowship in this school.
During' the past year the laboratories of the Chemical
Building provided for an average number of about three
hundred and thirty students working at the same time. Of
these about one hundred and forty were students of the Departments of Literature and of Engineering, one hundred and
twenty were students of the Medical and Dental Schools, and
over seventy were students of the School of Pharmacy. The
number of different students taking laboratory courses during
the year was six hundred and seven. And over seven hundred students of the University were enrolled in the various
chemical lecture courses within the year. These numbers,




DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


147


and the advanced character of various parts of the work,
make severe demands upon the building and its outfit, as
well as upon the teaching force.  Many portions of the
building are greatly in need of thorough renovation, as well
as better lecture -room provision. The limited expenditures
made for these needs a year ago gave much relief. Until
there is permanent renewal of the ceilings, interior walls,
and floors, temporary repair is a necessity of common
cleanliness.
The Chemical Building, its outfit, and its teaching force
are factors in the education of the students of the several
departments of the University, as enumerated above. And
on these factors will depend almost wholly the graduate work
in pure chemistry and the advanced work in chemical technology, interests which together have drawn a fair number of
enthusiastic students, and which represent many active
chemical alumni.  These interests so closely concern the
industrial advantage of the State with its great natural
chemical resources, and so affect its educational credit in
the world, that they may well be commended to the wise
judgment and the supporting hand of the State and to the
benefaction of private individuals.
The Homceopathic Medical College enjoyed a year of
unusual prosperity. The attendance, although small as compared with other Departments, was much larger than the year
previous, nearly double in fact. The year gave promise of
the increasing prosperity of the present year. The Department is now well under way. It has an able Faculty, is free
from internal discords, and with the aid of the extensive laboratories of the University and its well-equipped hospital, it
certainly furnishes to its students a professional education
that is not second in completeness and thoroughness to that
given by any homoeopathic school in the country.  The
books of the superintendent show that the hospital patronage
in this Department last year was greater than ever before,
and that the hospital came nearer paying running expenses




148


DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


than ever before. The new and increased facilities given by
this Board in the way of a pharmacological laboratory for
the proving of drugs are fully appreciated by the Department,
as are the additional teaching advantages that have been provided for in pathology, clinical dermatology, and obstetrical
clinics. The training school for nurses established in connection with the Homoeopathic Hospital, had a successful
year and is doing a good work.
There was nothing in the affairs of the College of Dental
Surgery during the past year that calls for special mention or
comment. The attendance was somewhat larger than the
year before, and the work was prosecuted with the earnestness and thoroughness that have from the first characterized
this Department, and that have gained for it an international
reputation in the profession. The largely increased attendance of the present year is taxing to the utmost the accommodations and equipment of the Department.
From the report of the Librarian, already presented to
this Board, and which covers the nine months from October
I, i896, to June 30, 1897, I make the following extracts:
"There were in all the libraries of the University June
30, 1897, 113,990 volumes, 17,555 unbound pamphlets, and
1,275 maps. Of these there were in the General Library,
91,I12 volumes, 16,065 unbound pamphlets, and 1,275 maps;
in the Law Library, 13,849 volumes; in the Medical Library,
7,762 volumes and 1,490 unbound pamphlets; in the Library
of the Dental College, 817 volumes; and in the Library of the
Homceopathic Medical College, 450 volumes. During the
year 625 periodicals were regularly received as follows: In
the General Library, 450; in the Medical Library, 13I; in
the Law Library, 12; in the Library of the Dental College,
I3; and in the Library of the Homceopathic Medical College,
I9. Ten daily and fifteen weekly newspapers were also regularly received."
The Librarian reports the following additions during the
nine months covered by his report: To the General Library,




DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


149


6,414 volumes, 45 unbound pamphlets, and 78 maps; to the
Medical Library, 577 volumes; to the Law Library, 1,785
volumes. This large increase in the Law Library over the
acquisitions of former years was due to purchases made
from the Buhl bequest. To the Library of the Dental College, 42 volumes were added, and to the Homceopathic
Library 125 volumes.
The Librarian reports the following gifts: "From the
Duke of Loubat was received a copy of a Pre-Columbian
Mexican Book, known as the Vatican MS., No. 5773. An
explanatory treatise accompanies it. It is most interesting
as showing the form of book in use on a part of this continent at the time of its discovery.  We are under obligations
to Mr. Harlan I. Smith, of Washington, for presenting the
claims of this University for a copy of the work to the Duke
of Loubat.
"From His Highness the Maharajah of Japan, through
Col. S. S. Jacob, Stuperintending Engineer, six portfolios of
architectural drawings were received.  These drawings were
chiefly from old buildings at or near Delhi and Agra.
Students of architecture cannot fail to find these inspiring.
"The Government of Her Majesty the Queen of England presented a set of the Report of the Scientific Results
of the Challenger Expedition, 44 volumes. These volumes
are of first importance for the work in Zoology and the other
natural sciences.
"The purchase of a copy of the Third Folio of Shakespeare, 1664, was authorized by the Hon. James McMillan at
a cost of $38I.75. Mr. McMillan at the same time authorized the expenditure of $1oo.oo more to make additions to
the Shakespeare Library.
"Mr. D. M. Ferry, of Detroit, provided means for
making additions to the Library in the specialties of English
Literature and the works of the early Christian writers.
* * * * In all there were added to the Library through
Mr. Ferry's generosity o05 volumes and twenty-five pamphlets.




150


DECEMBER MEE TING, 1897.


"Mr. James E. Scripps, of Detroit, made provision for
the purchase of books illustrative of Roman Archaeology for
the Department of Latin. Of books of this nature, there
have been added at Mr. Scripps's expense I44 volumes. It is a
mostvaluable reinforcement to the art literature of the Library.
"Gifts were also received from President Angell, Dr.
Herdman, Dr. S. A. Jones, E. B. Pond, Esq., Mr. H. C.
Ryan, a former student, Dr. S. A. Green, of Boston, Dr. L.
G. Doane, of New York, Professors Demmon, Hinsdale,
Walter, Kelsey, and others."
The following from the Librarian's report in regard to
the necessity of increased library facilities is of special importance, and I commend it to the thoughtful consideration
of every alumnus and friend of the University:
"An extension of the Library Building has become a
necessity, unless we are willing to see its growth and usefulness arrested. I think there is no doubt of this necessity in
any quarter.  The shelving capacity of the book-room,
including all the temporary shelving that it will contain, has
been exhausted. To dispose of the overflow outside of the
book-room, rooms needed for other purposes have been
occupied. If more temporary shelving can be provided, we
can better our present condition, but the congested state will
still remain, and the conditions for administering the library,
which are now hard, will be very hard.
"We already have a good deal of matter that is rare and
valuable, and some that is unique. It is impossible under
present conditions to guard this against indiscriminate handling, and consequently from injury, or loss. There should
be rooms that are of fire proof construction where this can
be preserved from danger, and yet made accessible to any
who may need to consult it. Having such conveniences for
the safe keeping of especially valuable material would greatly
increase our chances of securing more of it.
"The present methods of conducting advanced work in
literature, art, philosophy, language, and the political sciences




DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


151


have come to be called "laboratory methods."  There must
be actual contact of the teacher, the student, and the illustrative matter, as books, periodicals, maps, diagrams, models,
and pictures. This cannot be done successfully in recitation
rooms distant from the place where all this material is housed.
The rooms must be a part of the Library Building. These
advantages for advanced work are enjoyed in many of the
universities now, and all are working in that direction.
"What lies in the way of this enlargement is a lack of funds.
The Legislature can be appealed to for help, but can a reasonable hope of timely help from that quarter be entertained?
"If it were to be the sole request made it is not impossible that it might be granted, but, if coupled with others, as
it would almost necessarily be, it is impossible.
"In going over the possible ways of obtaining help the
following has seemed to promise most. That it contemplates
several things rather than a single one, increases, it is thought,
ather than diminishes, the prospect of success. An appeal
to the Alumni is proposed. The several objects are:
i. A practical object, viz., an extension of the bookroom sufficient to relieve the present pressure and provide for
the increase of fifteen or twenty years.
2. Another practical object, viz., to erect at the end of
the extension, and as a part of it, a building to be known as
Alumni Hall. This is to be devoted to the work of the
Graduate School, and provide a home for that now, and
hitherto, homeless branch of the University.
3. A sentimental object, viz., to make this Alumni Hall
a memorial of the students of the University who died in the
civil war. This memorial feature may appear in a general
way in the architecture of the building, and specifically in
some portion of it, open to the public, where the names of the
fallen may appear in mural inscriptions and where their devotion to their country may be symbolized in appropriate statuary.
"The probable cost of the whole would be $Ioo,ooo.
"The propriety of some kind of a memorial has been




152


DECEMABER IMEETING, 1897.


discussed somewhat among the alumni at various times, and
is referred to as something that ought, at some time or other,
to be accomplished."
I heartily concur in the foregoing, and I desire to express
the hope that some way may be found in the near future for
providing for the necessities of this important department of
the University.
Several changes were made in the Museum during the
past year. The mineralogical collections were removed to
Tappan Hall, and the space thus vacated in the south wing
utilized for a museum lecture room for classes in Zoology,
Geology, and Botany, thus obviating the necessity for carrying the specimens needed for illustration about the campus.
Electricity was brought in for the stereopticon, and the room
provided with opaque shades, making a good lantern room
with a seating capacity of about a hundred and fifty.
Room 4, in the fourth story, was provided with adjustable shelving for the reception of the collections of alcoholic
material formerly scattered in part through the museum and
in part stored in the zoological laboratory. Possible danger
from fire was guarded against by providing an adequate system of overhead sprays, and a metal covered floor, inclined
toward a discharge pipe opening on the outside of the build-ing. The water can be turned on from the outside, and the
whole room instantly drenched.
The work of identifying and labelling the bird collection
has been completed, and the record reduced to the form of a
card catalogue. The specimens are catalogued both under
their scientific and their common names, and a system of
numbering adopted which shows the exact whereabouts of
each individual specimen so that any specimen desired can
be found at once. A large number of duplicate specimens
have been removed from the exhibition cases, and the space
thus gained has been utilized for the installation of a number
of bird groups, each of which is intended to illustrate an
important fact,




DECEMBER MEETIVNG, 1897.

No gifts of importance were received during the past
year, but two noteworthy additions were made to the mammal
collection by purchase. The Museum has been fortunate
enough to secure a fine pair of walruses, collected by Lieutenant Peary, and a group of fur-seals from the Pacific.
At present, work upon the collection of shells is in
progress. This valuable collection, which has been long
stored away out of sight, is being identified and catalogued
and a series of specimens prepared for exhibition.
Reference should be made to the following gifts that
were received during the year besides those mentioned in the
Librarian's report: The F. D. Bennett Scholarship Fund of
$I50.00; a contribution from the class of I896, in the
Literary Department, of $200.00 to the Archaeological Fund;
and a Class Memorial Fund of $I35.34 from the Literary
Class of 1897.
The electric light plant provided for by the last Legislature has been practically completed, and bids fair to give
excellent satisfaction. It was a much needed improvement
and is most thoroughly appreciated.
During the past summer arrangements were made with
the State Board of Agriculture whereby different professors
from the University are to address farmers' institutes in
several counties of the State during the present year. They
will speak upon practical subjects that will be of special
interest to farmers, and it is hoped and expected that mutual
benefit will result. Twelve or fifteen men from our different
Faculties will engage in this work, but in such a way as not
to interfere materially with University duties. The carrying
out of the plan will be without expense to the University.
A notable event in the history of the past year at the
University which cannot fail, I think, to result in great good
to the institution, was the amalgamation of the alumni societies of the different departments into one University Alumni
Association.  The movement has met with unqualified
approval from the alumni and friends of the University in




154


DECEMBER MEETING, i897.


all parts of the country.  Already an enthusiasm that is
quite unprecedented is manifest, and the outlook is most
encouraging. A paid Secretary has been installed in quarters
provided by the University, and he is expected to give his
entire time and predominant energies to the work of the
Association. The plan contemplates among other things the
formation of local associations in different parts of the State
and country, where they do not now exist, and a continuous
attempt to keep the alumni interested in the University by a
systematic distribution among them of the journal of the
Association and the various University publications.  The
movement is certainly one of great significance, and it means
much, I am sure, to the University.
In gathering the data for this report, I have been impressed, as you doubtless have in listening to it, with the
many pressing needs of our great University. From one
point of view the conditions may seem discouraging. But
they are far from being so; for we should remember that our
necessities are a sure indication of our great prosperity.
They arise from our remarkable growth and development.
To provide for them, is not beyond the power of the people
of this great commonwealth, aided, as I am sure they will be,
by the generous efforts of our devoted alumni and friends.
That they will be fully met and that the University will continue to be in the front rank of our great institutions of learning, I most confidently predict.
In closing, I desire to bear testimony to the high ideals,
the unselfish devotion, and the unwearied enthusiasm of the
members of our instructing force. Throughout her entire
history, Michigan University has been signally fortunate in
the many learned and inspiring men that she has had upon
her faculties. No more striking illustration of the truth that
men and not buildings make a great University, can be found.
Respectfully submitted, for the President, by
HARRY B. HUTCHINS,
Acting President.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


165


On motion of Regent Kiefer the report was accepted
and adopted.
On motion of Regent Fletcher it was ordered that 0o,ooo
copies of the President's report be printed in pamphlet form
for the use of the Alumni Association, and 5,000 copies for
the use of the Board, by the following vote.
Ayes-Regents Cocker, Cook, Dean, Kiefer, Fletcher, and Farr.
Nays-None.
Dr. Dock called the attention of the Board to the fact
that the University Hospital was overheated the most of the
time and that no provisions had been made enabling the
officers to control the temperature in the wards.     The board
instructed the engineer to give the matter his careful attention.
The following is the report of the committee of the Literary Faculty in response to the resolution of the Board of
October 2oth, asking that body to report some general plan
for getting University news before the people of the state.
ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, December I6, I897.
To the Honorable Board of Regents.
At a meeting of the Board held on October 20, 1897, a resolution was
adopted calling on the Faculty of the Literary Department to report some
general plan for getting University news before the people of the State.
The request was referred by the Literary Faculty to a special committee of
five, including the Acting President and the Dean; to which the Acting
President added on his own motion representatives of the Law and Medical
Departments. This committee have now given consideration to the subject and have agreed to present the following recommendations:
First, that some member of the Literary Faculty be appointed by
your Board to organize, under the direction of the President, a Bureau of
University News; the said appointee to be known as University Editor, and
to receive such compensation as may be commensurate with the extra labor
imposed.
Second, that with the consent and co-operation of the Board of Directors of the Alumni Association, the University Editor be placed in charge
of a certain portion of the Alumni News; and that this portion of the paper
be regarded as an official publication of the University.
Third, that the University undertake to issue every other week during
the college year, a small bulletin or news-letter for distribution among the
editors of weekly papers throughout the State, the contents of the said bul

DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


letin to consist each week of matter which will appear the following week
in the official columns of the Alumni News. The probable cost of such a
bulletin, together with some information regarding methods in vogue in
other universities, is given in the appended memoranda.
With reference to the choice of editor, the committee will venture a
suggestion. It may be urged, and with some show of reason, that no member of the Literary Faculty ought to accept the office of University Editor,
inasmuch as it would result in a diversion of energy from the instructor's
proper field of work. Of the greater part of the members of the Faculty
this is doubtless true, but your committee would point out that there is one
department of instruction in the University to which such work as the
organization of a Bureau of News and the preparation of a news-letter may
be said properly to belong, namely, the Department, if it may be called
such, of English Composition. In certain advanced courses in this subject,
a considerable amount of work such as would be necessary in the preparation of matter for the proposed bulletin, has from time to time been undertaken by members of the class, and some of this matter has been published
as correspondence in lQcal papers. This practice could be pushed a step
farther. By reorganization of the department, a small class of advanced
students could eventually be organized to report systematically, under the
direction of the instructor, the various interests of the University. The
material thus collected could be sifted by the instructor and the best of it
edited for the bulletin. In this way the tedious labor of news gathering,
which no member of the Faculty should be asked to undertake, could be performed to some extent by members of the class as part of their regular work.
The committee cannot close their report without expressing their
sense of the importance of such a plan as is contemplated by the above
recommendation. They are of the opinion that the advantages resulting
from the awakening of interest among the editors of the State, and from
the wide distribution of facts calculated to increase the prestige and influence of the University, will repay many-fold the small cost of putting the
plan in operation; and they are confident that the plan will, if rightly carried
out, lead ultimately to the establishment of a strong and lasting bond of
union between the University and the people.
Respectfully submitted,

2. Methods in Vogue in Other Universities.
In several of the western universities plans have recently been adopted,
or are at present under consideration, for arousing public interest in these
institutions by publishing at intervals authentic bulletins of university
affairs. In answer to inquiries, President Thwing, of the Western Reserve
University, writes that university news is collected and edited in the office
of the President, and thence sent out to the newspapers of the State. Chancellor MacLean, of the University of Nebraska, reports that steps are being
taken to furnish such items as may be of general interest to a newspaper
union for use upon the 'patent insides' of the country weeklies. President
Swain, of Indiana University, expresses himself as holding it " a very important matter that the public should have adequate knowledge of the
worth and workings of our colleges," and says, further, " We have encouraged our students to write to their home papers and have had a committee
of the Faculty to keep the run of college news and place it at the disposal
of these correspondents; and we occasionally have a little slip printed and
sent out to the papers of our own state. While these are not always printed,
enough of the papers publish them to make it worth while." President
Jesse, of the University of Missouri, writes that any bit of important university news is embodied in a little bulletin of a page which is mailed to the
editors of the state; he is anxious for the Trustees " to print a weekly newspaper in the University, to be edited by the Faculty, with some aid from
the students. This paper would, by exchange, be laid on the desk of every
editor in the state and would pay handsomely as a medium of advertisement."  He adds that he expects to see it established within a year.

DECEMBER MEETING, i897.


But of the various plans employed by the universities which have furnished information upon the subject, the one best matured and most successful
has been in operation during the present year at the University of Wisconsin.
Here the Secretary of the University Extension department collects and
edits in an attractive manner such items concerning the University as have
both educational interest and news value. This matter is then printed by a
local paper and mailed every two weeks to the editors of about 700 newspapers throughout the state. The extent to which the items of the Bulletin
are used by these editors is indicated by the statement of the Secretary:
"It is getting so that almost every issue of every newspaper in Wisconsin
contains one or more items about the University, taken from one of the
Bulletins." The printing and postage for a year's issue costs the University $200.
On motion of Regent Cocker the report was accepted,
and Professor F. N. Scott was designated University Editor
for the purpose of gathering and editing proper University
news in accordance with the general plan set forth in the
report of the committee, and $Soo was appropriated for the
purpose of inaugurating the work.
The vote on Regent Cocker's motion was as follows:
Ayes-Regents Cocker, Cook, Dean, Kiefer, Fletcher, and Farr.
Nays-None.
The Treasurer presented and read his annual report,
which was on motion accepted and ordered printed in the
minutes, and also bound with the President's report.
THE TREASURER'S REPORT.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


On motion of Regent Dean it was voted that the expense
of maintaining the Homceopathic Department, except the
$6,ooo received by Legislature Act of I875, be charged to
the general fund.
On motion the Board took a recess until 2 o'clock P. M.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
The Board reassembled at 2 o'clock p. M. in executive
session.
Regent Fletcher moved that $I50 be appropriated for
the purchase of pipe covering and an oil filterer for the heating plant.   It was so ordered as follows:
Ayes-Regents Cocker, Cook, Dean, Kiefer, Fletcher, and Farr.
Nays-None.
The President presented the following proposition from
Regent Levi L. Barbour:
Know All Men By These Presents, That I, Levi L. Barbour, of the
City of Detroit, propose to the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan that they proceed to acquire and unalterably set apart for the specific
object herein designated a fund amounting to at least One Hundred Thousand Dollars and therewith proceed to make, or cause to be made, on the
grounds of the University now owned by it, or hereafter acquired for that
purpose, at the City of Ann Arbor a building proper for and devoted to the
display and promotion of art in connection with said University.
And I further propose to said Board of Regents to contribute to the
formation of said fund a property valued at Fifteen Thousand Dollars or
more and consisting of premises in Detroit described as follows: Block
Seven (7) of Fyfe, Barbour & Warren's Subdivision of that part of Private
Claim 260 lying between Horatio Street and Warren Avenue, in the city
of Detroit and Township of Springwells, Wayne County, State of Michigan.
But this proposal is made distinctly on specific terms and subject to
given limitations, that is to say:
First.-Said Board of Regents shall within five years from the date
hereof acquire and hold for use and ready for use in making or causing to
be made the said building a sum at least Eighty-five Thousand Dollars over
and above the value of said premises.
Second. -Shall pay and discharge all taxes and assessments, ordinary




DECEMBER MEETING, 1897.


179


and extraordinary, which may be charged upon or against said premises or
any part thereof after the year 1897.
Third.- Shall within six years have begun, building and expended
thereupon and out of said fund of Eighty-five Thousand Dollars a sum not
less than Twenty Thousand Dollars.
Fourth.-The said Levi L. Barbour reserves the right to enlarge at
his election the time expressed for raising said Eighty-five Thousand Dollars and the time expressed for beginning said building and expending
Twenty Thousand Dollars thereon; but no such enlargement shall be recognized unless made in writing and signed and acknowledged by him and
delivered to said Board of Regents.
Fifth.-In case the said Board of Regents shall have strictly observed
and carried out the very terms imposed on them by these presents, as well
in regard to time as to other things, then and thereupon, and on the written request of said Board of Regents, and not otherwise, the said Levi L.
Barbour will grant said premises in fee simple to said Board of Regents or
to any other one they may appoint to take said grant.
Sixth.-In token of her assent to what is proposed herein and of her
purpose to join in any grant or dedication contemplated hereby, Harriet E.
Barbour, wife of said Levi L. Barbour, doth subscribe these presents.
Seventh.-In case the terms and limitations hereof are not fully and
precisely observed and obeyed by the Board of Regents, this proposal to
donate said premises to them shall cease and have no force or obligation in
law or equity.
Eighth.-In case the said Board of Regents shall fail to be entitled to
said premises and the purpose of said Levi L. Barbour be therein disappointed, then and thereupon the said premises shall stand dedicated to public use as and for a Park or Square of the City of Detroit; provided that in
case said City shall fail for one year to accept said dedication then the offer
to dedicate here contemplated shall stand completely revoked and withdrawn.
In Witness Whereof, the said Levi L. Barbour and Harriet E. Barbour
have hereunto set their hands and seals this I3th day of December, A. D.,
I897.

were adopted by the full vote of the Board.
WHEREAS, the Hon. Levi L. Barbour and Mrs. Harriet E. Barbour,

executed, and acknowledged, be made a part of the records of this Board.
And be it further resolved, That the thanks of this Board be and are
hereby extended to Mr. and Mrs. Barbour for their generous proposal, and
we trust that the future will demonstrate our ability to make it effective in
the erection of a building that will not only be an ornament to the University, but that will stand as a lasting monument to the noble friendship of
Mr. and Mrs. Barbour.
Resolved further, That copies under the seal of the University be
made and forwarded by the Secretary to Mr. and Mrs. Barbour.
[MEMORANDUM:-In accordance with the foregoing
resolution the President and Secretary subsequently executed

Professor Pettee, who was appointed to audit the ac*counts of the Treasurer and Secretary, presented and read
his report, which was on motion, accepted and placed on
file.
Regent Dean presented the following communication
from the Librarian:
ANN ARBOR, December I5, I898.
To PRESIDENT HUTCHINS:
DEXR SIR:-In the year I894, through the generosity of a gentleman
who withheld his name, the Library became possessed of a copy of
Description de l'Egypte, on recueil des observations et des recherches
qui ont ete faites en Egypte pendant l'exp6dition de l'armee francaise.
Deuxieme edition. Paris: Panckoucke; I820-I830. 24 tom. in 26 vol. in
8vo, et II vol. in fol. des planches.
This work is, as its title indicates, the report of the corps of scientific
men that accompanied the French expedition under Napoleon to Egypt in
-1798. In the early days of the campaign these men were subjects of cen

sure and ridicule on the part of the rank and file of the army and were
classed with the asses that carried the baggage. The command, " Asses
and savants to the rear," given when a battle was imminent, has become
proverbial. Notwithstanding this, the report of these men was the most
substantial fruit of the expedition. The text is full of information and the
plates are remarkable both for their fidelity and for their execution.
The work is dedicated to the King, Louis XVIII, and while there is a
brief reference to Napoleon in the long Preface historique he is not once

APRIL MEETING, 1898.


N11


such, respectfully request that you grant to us the permission to lay such a
stone.
At the same time we suggest that the following are, in brief, the ideas
we have in mind:
I. The stone to be laid on a day agreeable to the contractors, so as
not to delay their work.
2. The stone to be same size as the short cornerstones, 14  x30
inches, so as not to change or in any way alter the regular plan of the
building.
3. This cornerstone to be cut from New Westerly Granite, a granite
of pink shade, and to bear the following inscription:
JUSTICE. LAID BY LAW CLASS OF I898.
PROGRAM OF EXERCISES.
I. Some distinguished lawyer of the state to make a short address,
say twenty minutes, and a few remarks by the President of the '98 class
three or five minutes, and some music.
In the stone there is to be a receptacle in which shall be placed such
records as may be most preferred, including the names of the present Board
of Regents, Law Faculty, and members of the '98 class. The box for these
records is expected to be 9xI2x5 inches, so it will hold the U. of M. catalogue and other papers, etc.
Trusting this request will meet your approval, we await your convenience in reply.
We are very respectfully,        G. H. WILKES,
W. E. STOWE,
R. L. WEAVER,
Committee of '98 Class.

MIAY IMEtL'ING, 89gs.                   '2)
The President presented      and read the following conmmunication from Parke, Davis & Co., of Detroit:
DETROIT, Mich., MIay i, 1898.
Prof. Harry B. Hutchins, Acting President, University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, Mich.
Dear Sir. â€”Referring to your conversation with our President ant
General Manager on the occasion of your welcome visit to our Laboratorv
in company with Professor Freer, on May 5th, we now write to express our
entire willingness to devote the sum of $500 for the collegiate year I898-99,
to the continuation of the Parke, Davis & Co. Fellowship in Chemistry,
which was established in 1895, and the support of which we were constrained to suspend by causes previously explained.
While we cannot make engagement beyond the single year, we hope
that no cause will arise to demand retrenchment on our part, and thus
prevent our continuing the appropriation in the future.
May we not avail ourselves of this opportunity to explain that while
we do not desire to impose on the support of the Fellowship conditions
which would detract from its usefulness to the University, it would vet he a
source of great satisfaction to us if it could be applied to the investigation
of important drugs or to the elucidation of some problem which is distinctly
pharmaceutical in its character?  We need scarcely point out that the
results of such researches would profit not our house alone, but all manufacturing and dispensing pharmacists; and that they would ble to us a source
of much greater satisfaction than we could hope to derive from investigations bearing but slightly on the field in which naturally we take the (lee)est interest. So many interesting questions remain to be settled in coinnection with important drugs, such as Ergot, Digitalis, Canna)is Indica, (Convallaria Majalis, and others, that we hope you will be able to utilize this idea
in a manner that will appeal to us more strongly than can the determination
of the chemical nature or composition of some substance or compound
possessing only a theoretical importance.
The foregoing is not prompted t)y any desire to tie your hands or to
dictate harsh conditions-it is merely a frank expression of our ovwn preferences submitted for such consideration as you may be alle to accord it in
the light of your greater familiarity with the needs of the University.
Sincerely trusting that our decision will be a source of personal satisfaction to yourself and to Professor Freer, and that it will benelfit the University, whose value to the commonwealth of Michigan is almost beyond
estimate, we remain,          Very sincerely yours,
WM. M. WARREN, Gen'l Manager.          PARIKE, 1)AVIS & C(.
On motion the President was requested to convey to 'arke,




2 3):1.4 1  J   / '7 A'(;, /, S'.
Davis &: Co. the cordial thanks of the Board for their rreat
generosity in establishing a Fellowship in Chemistry.
On motion of Regent Kiefer, Professors Vaughan, Prescott, and Freer were appointed a committee on the ParkeDavis Fellowship) to select the candidate, and arrange the work
along the lines indicated by the donors.
On motion the Board adjourned to June 9, at IO o'clock

ANN ARBOR, June 8th, I898.
To THE HONORABLE BOARD OF REGENTS:
In the budget of June, I897, there was allowed the sum of $75 to each
of five departments for the purchase of a projection lantern for the Medical
Department. The lantern was ordered and received in September, I897.
Owing to delay in installing the electric light plant the apparatus could not
be tested until January, I898. It was then found to be unsatisfactory in
some of its accessories, and these parts were returned to the makers for
alterations. There has been considerable delay in making the changes so
that the whole lantern has not as yet been received. Nothing has as yet
been paid on the apparatus.
The five departments concerned therefore request the Board of
Regents to extend the time of the appropriation until the entire apparatus
has been received, tested, and found to be satisfactory, or in the event of its
not meeting the requirements, until such time as may be necessary to procure a proper apparatus from some other maker.

GENTLEMEN-I hereby tender my resignation as Professor of Law in
the University, to take effect at the beginning of the next college year.

two or three years past I have been more and more conscious of this,
and have continued to teach against my own judgment at the earnest wish
of the Dean of the Department. In asking leave, at the end of five years'
service, to retire from the Faculty, I beg to express my appreciation of the
consideration with which I have always been treated by all officers of the
University, as well as my colleagues in the Law Faculty.
Very respectfully yours,
ALEXIS C. ANGELL.

interests of the University in the Bates will case, submitted
the following report, which was accepted and ordered printed

SEPTEMBER MVEETING, 89S8.


GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Sept. 13, 1898.
GENTLEMEN OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS:
Mr. Hanchett having declined engagement in the matter of the will
of Miss Bates, Regent Cocker and myself went to New York to look the
matter up. We found the following state of facts:
Objection to the probate of the will was made by some second cousins
of Miss Bates. They objected to it upon two grounds: first, the incompetency of Miss Bates to make the will, and second, that the University could
not legally be made a devisee. The reasons for this second objection
were not given. We found the estate to amount to about $I60,ooo. About
$105,000 or $II0,000 is personal, and the balance in real estate. There
were some claims to be presented against the estate, one of $,00oo.oo as
a subscription to the Presbyterian Church of Port Chester, one of $5,ooo.oo
by her physician, and I think about $I,2oo.oo from a nurse.
The church matter is undoubtedly all right; the physician's bill is
questionable, and we advise a compromise. The physician told the executor that he had not intended to charge anything, but as the estate was
going to a Michigan college they might as well get all they could.
Wingate & Cullen, attorneys of New York City, had appeared for the
executor, and had filed a demand that the contestant specify why a devise
could not be made to the University, that is, for a bill of particulars. T'his
will be heard upon the g9th.
There can be no question, I think, of the competency of Miss Bates,
and there can be as little of the right of the University to take a devise
either under the laws of New York or this State. There is probably no
question but what the personal property may be considered outside the contest. Under the laws of the State of New York at the time of the death of
Miss Bates, second cousins could not take, as heirs, personal property.
The attorneys for the executor desired us to employ counsel for the
University. Miss Bates had two aunts who would, as heirs, take all personal property. Wingate & Cullen are attorneys for one of these heirs.
They do not intend to make a contest or to dispute the will, but their interests are against those of the University, and it was thought better to have
counsel of our own. We employed Chas. H. Otis, of Brooklyn. lie is
counsel for the Public Administrator of New York and an accomplished
lawyer. He is engaged upon one side of nearly all the will cases in New
York City. The retainer is $,000.00o, but we could not do better in New
York for a lawyer of his standing.
President Hutchins was with us in the city and visited Wingate &
Cullen, and also Otis, with us.  Very cordially yours,
GEO. A. FARR,
W. J. COCKER.

'The collection now consists of 4,642 volumes and I74 pamphlets. A coinsiderable number of the additions of the year were from the Free Public
Iibraries of 'Birmingham; England. A catalogue of the Shakespeare duplicates possessed by that library was received from Mr. Mullins, the librarian.
A list of such of these as we did nlot have was made out and sent to M\r.
McMillan who authorized their purchase. 'he cost was $S50, 'I'le matter
thus acquired was largely "oult f print " matter, and constitutes a most
valuable addition to our collection.
'The appropriation of $50.00 made by you last year for completing the

Eight volumes were added to the Goethe Iibrary, which now numllers
948-volumes.

OCTOBEPR 1E XTIAG, 1898.


THE FELCH LIBRARY. ----he Felch Historical Library has been put
in order for use. Exclusive of duplicates, of which there are about 2,500,
it numbers 1,368 volumes.
On a former occasion I referred to the pamphlets in this collection as
numerous and valuable. (f these 174 were considered of sufficient importance to bind singly, and were by this operation raised to the dignity of
volumes. Six hundred and fifty were classified and bound together in 44
volumes.
The greater number of these pamphlets relate to American history,
and they constitute a most important addition to our collection on that subject. Indeed the preponderance of American history is not confined to the
pamphlet part, but is a feature of the collection as a whole. While this is
true, general history and travel have a representation in reputable editions
of the standard works. There are also a good many volumes of illustrated
books. There was a period, late in the last century and early in this one,
when it was the vogue to illustrate objects, and especially scenery, by steel
engravings. These were both drawn and executed by artists of reputation
and were usually published in elegant editions. The following will serve
as examples:
I. China: Its Scenery, Architecture, and Social llabits. 2 vols.
2. Syria: The Holy Land, Asia Minor, etc. 2 vols.
3. Shores and Islands of the Mediterranean.
4. The Gallery of British Engravings.
5. Views in Ireland.
Work of this character has been superseded by photography. It falls
into the category of Literary Annuals, and has the same relation to the art
of the period that the annuals have to its literature. Both are important
in a great library and these volumes of illustrations in the Felch collection
swell not a little our slender resources in this direction. I should also refer
to the fact that in this collection is found our first historical manuscript.
This is, "Journal of a tour to and fro overland from San Miguel de Orcasitas,
Sonora, to the Bay of San Francisco, California, in the years I775-6. By
Padre Fray Pedro Font: Neilson, script.: Monterey, Cal., June, I854."
This journal is one of the important authorities for the early history
of California. During Gov. Felch's residence there as Land Commissioner
a Catholic priest, in whose possession the original MS. was, made this copy
and presented it to him. The original is said to be lost.
This bequest is a piece of good fortune that we can never cease to be
grateful for. The books will not only do service as the hosts of students
come and go, but they will also permanently associate with the University,
as even his official connections cannot do, a name honored throughout the
state.
GIFTS. â€”In the matter of gifts we have as usual fared well, although
no collection of books has been received. The following seem worthy of
special mention:
From C. M. Burton, Esq., of Detroit, was received vol. 25 of the




OCTOBER MIEE TING, r898.


281


Stevens Facsimiles of Historical Manuscripts. This is an index volume and
completes the first series of the work, for the whole of which we are indebted
to Mr. Burton. It was when our resources were much more meagre than
now, and when acquisition of the work seemed impossible, that he was
appealed to. His hearty response will always be remembered.
The Duke of Loubat added the following to former gifts:
I. Hamy. Galerie Americaine du Musee d'ethnographie du Trocadero,
Part 2.
2. Il Manoocritto Mesicano Borgiana. A Facsimile made at the expense of the Duke of Loubat.
Miss Minnesota Neill in response to inquiries relative to certain of the
books of her father, Rev. Edward Neill, presented to the Library three
volumes and twenty-five fugitive pieces of his writings.
Leland H. Sabin, Esq., of Centreville, presented a number of earlI
volumes of the Ietroit Advertiser and Tribune and the Albany Argus â€” in
all II volumes.
Mrs. Morris added to the Morris Philosophical Library a set of the
Griggs Philosophical Classics, 8 vols., which had been edited by Professor
Morris.
From Hon. David Boyd, of Greeley, Colorado, was received a copy of
Hall's History of Colorado, 4 volumes. Mr. Boyd was a member of the
class of I866.
From the Baroness Burdett-Coutts was received a copy of "Women's
Mission," a large and elegant volume by various writers, and prepared for
the Columbian Exposition of I893.
The Ann Arbor Music Company presented seven volumes of Schirmer's
Collection of Operas.
President Angell turned over to the Library the papers of the Deep
Waterways Commission, of which he was a member. They consist of
considerable printed and typewritten matter, and maps.
Professor E. L. Walter gave books at various times during the year.
The whole number was 104 volumes.
I have referred to Mr. McMillan s gift of $I50 for the increase of the
Shakespeare Iibrary.
From the Venezuelan Legation at Washington was received a copy of
the Case of Venezuela in the boundary controversy, consisting of five (5)
volumes of text and a portfolio containing 17 maps.
I take this opportunity to acknowledge the generosity of the Institution of Civil Engineers of London. On the solicitation of Professor Greene
the Institution began in I872 to send its Minutes of Proceedings, and has
continued to do so with unfailing regularity. Up to this time Ioo volumes
have been received. The publication is of great value to engineers and the
Institution of Civil Engineers deserves, and has, the hearty thanks of the
University authorities.
Mrs. Chas. H. Chapin of this city presented 50 volumes of miscellaneous books, and 23 pamphlets.




282.


OCTOBEIR I/AEE1 7lyI7AG,,8 S.


Hon. D. M. Ferry gave S70.00 for the purchase of certain rare volumes, i9 in number, of Leigh Hunt.
In March an arrangement wa, made with the officers of the First
National Bank of this city by which they deposit with us at the end of each
year their copy of the Bankers' Magazine, New York, to be used by the
Library as its own books are. ()n our part we agree to bind the volumes
and care for them. This is an arrangement in the interest of both parties
to it. The set is complete from and including vol. I3. The number of
volumes is 43.
Other benefactors whose gifts there is not space to specify were Judge
C. B. Grant, Professors Demmon, Adams, and linsdale, Dr. S. A. Green of
Boston, Professor Francis Bashforth of England, Dr. Mary S. Cutter of
Seoul, Corea, Dr. I. G. Doane of New York, and many others.
USE OF THE LIBRARY.-The statistics that follow were compiled by
Mr. Finney who has charge of the circulation, and represent the use of the
library for the year:
Recorded circulation in the library...        I34,607 vols.
Drawn for home use by members of the Faculty..       7,500
142,I67
This is an increase of 5 per cent. over last year. The "recorded circulation," it shotld be said, represents about one-half the actual use of the
Library.
*The daily average of readers in the Reading Room was I63.
The privilege of consulting books in the Book Room was granted
to 75 students. This was all that could be admitted under the rule.
During the two semesters 350 students were admitted to the Seminary
Rooms, as follows: 6o to the East Room for the study of History, Political
Economy, Philosophy, and Pedagogy; and 290 to the West Room for the
study of English, French and German I iterature, and Greek and Latin literature and Art.
CONDITION OF THEE II1iRARY,-The condition of the bools is good.
Six volumes have been missed. I report them as lost, while believing that
some of them are only misplaced.
* Additional statistics furnished by Mr. Finney are as follows: Of the readers in the
Reading Room 54 per cent. were men, and 46 per cent. womnen. Classified they were:
University students                                       97.37 per cent.

A record kept in the men's Cloak Room for the week ending March l9,
1898, showed an average of men visiting the library daily of...  424
A fair estimate for women in the Reading Room and both sexes in the Seminary Rooms is.. 576

While this number would not unfrequently be exceeded during the middle months of
the year it would not be reached in the earlier and the later months.

The expenditure of the special appropriation of S200 made by Sou in
1897 to begin a change of classification, was begun during the vacation.
The subject selected for the change was English literature and it was practically carried out in the books of that class before the opening of work ill
(ctober. ()ur books had a fixed location on the shelves. Experience has
shown that with such a system of marking it is impossilble in a large library
to preserve the classification of the books on the shelves without labor that
cannot be justified. It is very desirable â€”1I may say nzecessa:,y-to preserve
this classification. Consequently schemes have been devised in which the
marking is elastic â€” analagous to an alphaletical arrangement. Our old
fixed method having become intolerable it was necessary to adopt one of
these schemes, or devise another having the same features.  At first it
seemed possible to devise something which would unloose our fixed location
and make the books movable without having to make changes in the catalogue. It was soon evident, however, that the development of such a
scheme, and the preparation of the details necessary for its use by others,
was too formidable a task for one already fully occupied. The one of the
schemes alluded to which has been worked out most carefully and which is
used most extensively is the "Decimal Classification " devised by Mr. Melvil
Dewey, State Librarian of New Vork. I am not entirely satisfied with this,
but I saw no better course for us under the circutmstances than to adopt it
with such modifications as our needs made desirable. A circumstance that
had influence in producing tllis decision was the fact that Mr. Jordan, the
cataloguer, and Mr. Finney, who has charge of the shelves, are b)oth familiar
with it.  As already said, the collection in English Literature has been
changed, practically. All the accessions of the year received tle new
markings.  These accessions are now occupying temporary cases in the
cataloguing room where they will remain until the extension to the bookroom is ready for occupation.
The second appropriation of $200 made by you for additional work
on the catalogue for I898-99 will be expended in forwarding the change.
As the two markings of the books â€”the old fixed and the new movablecreate confusion it is desirable that tile change be completed at the earliest
moment possible.
LIBRARY FORCE FOR I898 â€”99. --- â€”- The permanent force remains the
same as last year. At the delivery desk Mr. Frank II. Diehl remains. The
three new men are IHarvey IL. Curtis, Irving T. Raah, and H-arry M.
Robins.
Mr. H. S. Person will have charge of tile East Seminary Room and
Mr. La Rowe of the West Room.
WORK OF THE COMIN( YERAR. ---This will be the regular routine work
of the library and a continuation of the change of classification as there 'is
opportunity.
A large number of pamphlets have been received in the past few years.
Such of these as were of importance have been bound separately and are
counted as volumes. Those of minor importance that were parts of special




284


OCTOBER' METL 77NG, 'SQS.


collections â€”as the Morris and Felch collections-have been classilied and
bound in varying numbers in volumes. No arrangement, however, has
been made of the considerable number of minor importance that have come
at different times from a great many sources. To dispose of these in some
way that will make them accessible will be a part of our work.
The extension of the book-room will, when comp)leted, enable us to
carry on our work to a much greater advantage. Notwithstanding this fact.
however, I think it desirable to state now that in the estimates for the
library for I899-I900, 1 shall ask for additional assistance. We have been
obliged to omit for several years a part of our work that is growing in importance and should be omitted no longer. This is the examination at
stated intervals of the departmental coilections in other buildings, in order
to ascertain their condition and to learn whether or not there have l)een
losses. There are now five such collections which are parts of the General
Library. They are the Astronomical collection at the Observatory, the
Botanical collection at the Botanical Laboratory, the Zoological collection
at the Zoological Laboratory, the Chemical collection at the Chemical
Laboratory, and the Philosophical collection in the class-room of the professor of Philosophy. Besides these, and requiring the same service of us,
are the departmental libraries, half a dozen in number, of the Medical
Library.
In the last few years the library has been the recipient of a large nu1mber of photographs, acquired largely by the departments of ancient languages
for illustrating classical antiquities. The Library has stored them, but we
have been entirely unable to do more. What arrangement and description
of these has been made, has been made l)y the departments of instruction
using them. With our prospective increase of room it is possible to make
more suitable provision for them.  While certain expert assistance must
always be had of the professors it will be better for the library employees to
assume full control of all of this material and handle it as other library
matter is handled.
Our collection of maps has grown to quite respectable proportions in
the last few years. These are the maps of the Coast and Lake surveys, of
the Geological survey, of the Land office, maps of special surveys of the
Government, and military maps. These are in frequent demand for illustrating the scientific work. There has been equal activity in the collection
of maps that illustrate the political changes that have taken place in modern
history, and the progress of geographical discovery. The importance of
these is very great for the study of history in general and for information in
the special exigencies that are sure to arise. The extension of the book
room will give us space for properly arranging these so that they can be
catalogued and found readily when wanted.
I will name again these comparatively new duties, already important
and growing in importance, that we can now hardly attend to at all, and
only in a hurried, imperfect, and unsatisfactory way. They are the regular
inspection of the departmental collections of books and wall maps, the

arrangement and care of the collections of photographs, and the arrangement and care of the rapidly accumulating maps and charts.
TI E OT' I IE\k I. IBRARI.LES.
MEDICA.L 1,11.RARY.-.The additions to the Medical library were 918
volumes and 9 pamphlets. Of these 808 volumes and 9 pamphlets were
bought and IIo volumes presented.
For the greater number of volumes given, the Library is indebted to
Mrs. Thirza R. Spalding, of Detroit, Dr. Theodore A. Felch, of Ishpeming,
and Dr. W. J. Herdman, of the University.
The total of bills certified to by me for this library was $2,210. 15. ()f
this sum $I,612.17 were for books, and periodicals published irregularly,
and $597.98 were for annual subscriptions to medical periodicals.
The books of this collection are all in good repair. Owing to a want
of room, classification on the shelves is not a little confused. This will be
remedied as soon as the extension is completed and occupied. When the
amount that has been expended for this library is taken into consideration
the extent and quality-and especially the quality-is very gratifying.
THE LAW LIBRARY.-There were added to the Law Library during
the year 760 volumes. The library of the late Judge Douglass, presented to
the University by his widow, Mrs. Elizabeth C. Douglass, does not enter
into this enumeration, as the books had not been received at the time this
report closes, June 30, I898.
In June the books of this library were removed to the old chapel in
University Hall where they were shelved in the cases they had formerly
occupied. In this condition they were found convenient for consultation.
Members of the Law Faculty, and students of the department, alike
look forward with pleasure to the greater facilities for work, and the inspiration for it that will be afforded by the new quarters in which the books will
be shelved in the near future.
DENTAL LIBRARY.-Nineteen volumes were added to the library of
the Dental College. The cost of these was $80.20. The small number of
additions is accounted for by the fact that the periodicals which form an
important part of the regular annual increase, were not in readiness for
binding before the year closed.
THE HOMOEOPATHIC LIBRARY.-The number of volumes added to
this library was 215, and 9 pamphlets. Of these 200 were bought and 15
given. The interest manifested by the present faculty of this department
is resulting in a very creditable collection of Homoeopathic literature. The
total of bills certified to by me for this library was $251.90. The volumes
presented were largely from Dr. C. B. Kinyon of the Homceopathic Department.
THE BINDERY.
As I anticipated in the report of last year it has been necessary to add
to the force employed in the bindery in order to keep up with the work.

OCTOBIER iL.EE TIATG, r,898.


A comparison of the estimated cost of the work at outside linderies
with the outlay for labor and materials shows a balance against the bindery
of $146.34. This is a little more than the favorable balance of last year.
In explanation of the showing this year, the binder informs me that
he had on hand at its close much more stock than he had at the end of the
previous year, and also that a large number of books that were practically
completed, June 3oth, did not go into the account for the year.
It should also be said that the work has been unfavorably affected by
sickness and changes on the part of employees, and the absence of help
sometimes when it was very much needed. As now- constituted the force
promises a better showing for next year.
On the basis of the percentages shown in the table the expense to b)e
borne by each one of the libraries is as follows:
General Library,__-. 81.85 per cent. of $I,74I.00 = $I,425.0085
Law I.ibrary, --- â€” 7.33 per cent. of 1,74I.00 =   I27.6153
Medical Library,_ _.- 7.32 per cent. of 1,74I.00 -=  27.4412
-Iomoeopathic Library, 3.50 per cent. of 1,74I.00 =  60.9350
$I,741.0000
These amounts have been charged to the appropriations of the several
libraries.             Very respectfully submitted,
Oct. I8, I898.              RAYMOND C. DAVIs, Librarian.

The Secretary read the minutes of the last meeting which

which is as follows:
'Lo the Regents of the University:
I have the honor to lay before you my Annual Report.
By your permission I was absent during the entire year,
engaged in the diplomatic service of the United States.  I
am, therefore, unable to speak froml personal observation of
the life of the University during the period under consideration. But I have endeavored to inforim myself concerning
what has been done, and can, I think, see what are some of
our most pressing needs.
First of all, I wish to express my hearty appreciation of
the industry, energy and wisdom which Acting President
Hutchins brought to his executive duties. At your urgent

request he most relunctantly undertook theml. But students,
Faculties and the public most cordially agree with the warml
commendations of his work which you lhave forimallv uttered
in your resolutions of tlhanks to hil.
The weeks of this last summler vacation have been
freighted with heavy p)ersonal losses to the University.
Scarcely were the festivities of (Commencemlent week ended,
when we were shocked by the terrible news that Professor
Walter was lost in the fatal disaster to the steamer Bourgogne on July 4. A\ graduate of this institution in the class
of I868, Mr. Walter had given his whole life to her service.
A scholar of ample and various learning, a faithful and inspiring teacher, a man of the noblest character, he. will be remuembered with deep affection 1by his colleagues and with gratitude
by his many pupils.  Ile had filled the chairs of Assistant
Professor of Ancient Languages, of Professor of Modern
Languages, and, when the duties of tils last chair were at hlis
request divided, of Professor of Romance lIanguages and
Iiteratures.
On September 12, last, after a very prolonged illness,
Professor Thomas M1. Cooley found a welcomle release in
death.  It may safely be said that no milal has contributed
more to the fame and prosperity of the University than Judge
Cooley. A memlber of the first l'acultv of the.aw I)epartment in 1859, he has rendered continuous service of some
kind to one or another Department of the University almost
to the time of his decease.  His writings, especially his treatises on Constitutional Law, made his name and that of the
University known wherever lEnglish law is read.  Students
came from afar to sit at his feet, and all went awav filled with
admiration for the teacher and affection for the mlan.. His
administrative services as Dean of the Law I)epartment were
of the highest value. By the simplicity, sincerity and integrity of his character, and by his quick sympathies and kindness
of heart, he bound us all to him by the closest of ties.
On October 3, James L. High, who has been a lecturer




NClO IE.IB'AER 1IEE1 7'iNG, 1S9S.


297


on special topics on law for several years in our Iaw Department, died after a brief illness at his home in Chicago. Mr.
High was a graduate of our law' School. lie had not only
won a high reputation at the Illinois lbar, but was well known
both here and abroad through his treatises on Injunctions and
on Receivers and on Extraordinary ILegal Remedies.   He
was a man of refined and scllolarly culture, and he inspired
his pupils with the highest ideals of professional life.
I think that never in so brief a period hlas thle University
before been called to suffer so heavv an affliction as the loss
of these three eminent teachers has brought to it in the past
few months.   I amn painfully reminded of the rapidity of
changes in our Faculties, as I reflect that since the death of
Professor Coolev and Professor Walter, of the more than two
hundred teachers on our rolls only four were members of our
Faculties when I assumed the duties of the Presidency in 1871.
In appendices to this report will be found a list of appointments and resignations in the Faculties during tlie year, a
statement of the attendance in the several l)epartvments, and a
list of the degrees conferred.
The attendance last year was the larcest in tlhe history of
the University. Thle total nulmber of students, exclusive of
those in the Sumimer Schools, was 3,114, an increase over that
of the preceding year of 236. If we include tlhe students of
the Summer School of 1897, the attendance was 3,223. The
gain was largely in the Iaw I)epartment, which then fully
completed its change of course fromn two years to three years.
It is therefore apparent that the public was fully ready for the
extension of the course. The gain ill the number of undergraduate candidates for degrees in the Literary Department
was considerable, 97. The number of graduate students
changes but little from year to year. It is encouraging to
observe that we retain and attract so many students for graduate work, when most of the stronger Universities are able by
endowments to offer our cgraduates, and the graduates of other
institutions, fellowships and scholarships yielding from $300




298


ANO VEMAIBER   A EE TI NG, 898.


to $500 a year, or even more. It is well known that we have
only one permanent fellowship, though the generosity of some
of our friends is temporarily furnishing us two or three others.
In other words, with two or three exceptions, graduates must
remain here, if at all, at their own charges, while they are
offered a comfortable support if they will accept a fellowship
at some one of four or five of the stronger Universities in our
country. We ought to be encouraged by the fact that seventysix persons are pursuing graduate studies with us in these
circumstances rather than to be discouraged by the fact that
there are not more.
At the same time, as has been intimated in some of my
previous Reports, one of the gravest questions now confronting this University and several others, is whether the States
or private generosity will furnish them the means for carrying
beyond the undergraduate curriculum the considerable number of brilliant and aspiring young scholars who are willing to
give the time for two or three years of advanced and specialized study. It is by the training of such men that American
scholarship will be carried to the high level which the needs
of our country demand. It will be for the good of the State
and for the glory of the University, if we can be enabled and
permitted to do our full part in this honorable work. We
shall certainly suffer in reputation and usefulness and influence, if we are unable to do so.
I give as usual some of the interesting figures concerning the residence of our students. Michigan furnished 1,863,
which is 116 more than in the previous year, and the largest
number ever sent by this State. Estimating the population at
two and a half millions, one person in 1,342 is a student in
the University. Illinois, although so well furnished with colleges and universities, sent us 365 students, 58 more than in
the year before, Ohio furnished I9I, Indiana 98, Iowa 86,
New York 71, Pennsylvania 69, Missouri 60, Wisconsin 40,
California 34, Massachusetts 30, Colorado 28, Kentucky 26,
Kansas 19, Nebraska 19, Utah 16, Montana I5.

Every State in the Union, except Delaware, and every
Territory, and Alaska, and the District of Columbia, and the
Hawaiian Islands, were represented, as were (ermany, IEngland, Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Japan, and the provinces of
Ontario and Quebec. It may be doubted whether so cosiopolitan a company of students is assembled at any other
university in the country. Not the least of the happy influences of life here is found in the opportunity of associating
with students from every part of this land and from several
foreign lands. While Michigan mlay be glad to see that an
ever increasing number of her sons and daughters are availing
themselves of the privileges which the State furnishes by the
support of the University, we trust that she is proud to observe
that the Institution has sufficient merit and fame to attract
students from all parts of the civilized world. Nor need her
joy be tempered by the apprehension that the attendance of
these students from afar puts an additional burden on the
tax-payers of Michigan. In previous Reports it has been
repeatedly demonstrated that their presence is of distinct
pecuniary advantage to our treasury, as it is of marked benefit
in giving a large catholic spirit to the life of the University
and in spreading far and wide its reputation and its influence.
The attendance of women was as follows:
Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts,. 589
Department of Engineering,..                        I
Department of Medicine and Surgery,...59

College of Dental Surgery,....                    8
673
The preceding year the number was 647. The gain was
therefore 26. In the Literary Department there was a gain of
48; in some of the Departments there was a slight loss. The
relative attendance of women to the total attendance fell from
22.4 per cent. in the previous year to 21.6 per cent. For
several years the proportion of women to the total attendance




300


Al                         i&98.


has not fallen below 20 per cent. nor risen above that of
I896-7, 22.4 per cent.
The work of the various Departments has been carried on
smoothly and successfully. It is a cause of satisfaction that
the condition of the treasury has made it possible to enlarge
somewhat the teaching force in the Literary I)epartmnent,
especially for the classes in the modern languages.  It is quite
impossible to do good work in teaching those languages to
large sections.
The arrangelments, Ib which students are allowed in the
latter part of their literary course to combine with it studies in
law or in miedicine, are proving very satisfactory.  By availing
themselves of the opportun ities offered students are able to
abridge by a year the time otherwise needed to complete the
collegiate and the professional course. One who is studious
may thus graduate from both the Literary and the Law Department in six years, or froml both the Literary and the Medical
Department in seven years. This is possible, not because any
of the work is slighted, but because certain work conmmon to
the Literary and the Professional course is credited as fulfilling the requirements for both degrees.  For example, certain
studies in chemistry are properly credited as meeting the
requirements for a bachelor's degree and those for the degree
of doctor of medicine.  In the same way studies in constitutional history or in international law are treated as meeting
the requirements for the lachelor's degree in arts and the
bachelor's degree in law. A careful committee considers every
application for the privilege of pursuing the joint course, and
reports favorably only when it is clear that the privilege can
safely be granted to the applicant.
There has been much complaint throughout the country
because, since the courses in all the best professional schools
have been lengthened to three years in law and four years in
medicine, students who complete a full collegiate course and
a full professional course get so late to their real work in life.
Some have proposed as a remedy reforms in the lower grades




0    JlE- A' ii'/ 1A, '  9.          301 1
of schools which should bring the student to college a year or
two earlier than he now colies. If such reforms are feasible,
some time seems necessary to accomplish themn. And some
doubt whether if students could get to college at the age of
sixteen, they would derive as much profit from the collegiate
course as they do when entering at the age of eightcen. and
therefore whether the supposed ogain in timle might not prove
a loss in attainmients and mental growth. Without deciding
if that dolubt is well founded or not, it seems clear to us that
having all our Departments on the salme grounds w\e (an
wisely and without inconvenience to tlme student or witlhout
detracting from the thorouhllness of his collegiate or professional training pursue the plan which we have adopted.
At the Observatory Professor Hall has bleen engged since
April with the meridian circle in observing zenith distances of
Polaris for the purpose of determining the variation of latitude
and the aberration constant. 'The preliminary reductions
have been kept up as the observations have bee  in ade, and
results seem to be very satisfactory. Since the instrument was
remounted in the piers, it has been lmuch more steadv, and
probably a cause of trouble that had existed for many years
was thereby removed. With the large equatorial Dr. Townley
observed several comets and asteroids.
Certain much needed improvemlents have just been comnpleted in the Chemical Building, which is used to its utmost
capacity by the students of the several departments of the
University.  An enlargement of the Iaboratorv of (eneral
Chemistry has been made, by elevating a portion of the building on the east, and the interior has been adapted to the best
laboratory methods.  By this extension provision has been
made for teaching Physical Chemistry, a branch of Imuch
importance.  Room has been secured for Chemical Technology by finishing in a substantial manner the entire south
basement. The whole of this space has been very carefully
fitted with superior appliances for the principal branches of
Chemical Technology. This greatly needed improvenment wi.ll

give added impetus to the work in industrial aids and methods, so much in demand.
Messrs. Parke, IDavis & Co., of l)etroit, have made a gift
in support of a fellowslip in research in the Iaboratory of
General Chemlistry for the year I898-9. We were indebted to
the samne house for a like -ift in 1895.
The work of the Department of Medicine and Surgery
has as usual been carried on with great thoroughness. The
course at present imakles very strenuous delnands on the
students. The requiremTents for admission have been somewhat modified in order to secure preparation in scientific
studies. The rooms assigned to the Department are seriously
overcrowded. A building providing larger laboratory facilities is much desired by the Faculty, and is no doubt much
needed.
The hospital connected with the Iepart:cent has had
unusual demands on it. The number of patients froml July I,
1897, to July i, 1898, was the largest ever known here, being
1,7I5. Of these 1,072 were in-patients, 643 were out-patients.
Seventy-six counties of Michigan were represented among
them. The farmers numbered 288, the mechanics 100, housewives 375.  Persons of almost every vocation were treated.
Many were restored from helpless disability to lives of useful
productivity.  Of these some had become a charge on the
treasuries of the counties.  Had the hospital been larger, this
beneficent assistance could have been rendered to others.
A neat and convenient building has been completed
during the year, which affords pleasant rooms for twenty
nurses, and a kitchen and dining room for patients.
The Law Department is now housed in a fine building,
fitted with modern conveniencies, and having ample accommodations for one thousand students.  In 1892, the growth
of the Department had been such that the original building
had become inadequate, and a large addition was constructed.
In I895, a third year was added to the course, and soon thereafter the requirements for admission were materially increased.

It was thought by some that these changes would result in a
decrease in the attendance, but instead of this there has been
a marked increase. The enrolment of last year was seven
hundred and sixty-seven, an increase of one hundred and
eighty-one over the enrolment of the year previous. Enlarged
accommodations became a necessity, and during the year the
Board discussed and finally adopted plans that involved practically the reconstruction of the old building and an addition
thereto that would more than double its capacity. The plans
were so made and have been so carried out that the old building is completely lost in the present structure, which presents
the appearance of an entirely new edifice. The new building
has a frontage of 208 feet, and its extreme width is 120 feet.
It is three stories high with a basement. The material of the
basement and first story is cut stone and of the other two
stories pressed brick with stone trimmings. The building is
substantial and dignified in appearance, solid in structure,
and gives the department a housing that for commodiousness
and convenience is second to that of no law school in the
United States. Three large lecture rooms, capable of accommodating upwards of three hundred students each, are provided, while six smaller ones, each of half that capacity,
furnish ample room for the sections into which classes are
divided for recitation purposes. The office of the Board of
Regents, the offices of administration, the offices of the several
resident professors and four lecture rooms are upon the first
floor. The capacious and well lighted reading room  that
contains the law library is upon the second floor, and clustered around this are seminary, consultation and private study
rooms for the use of the students and the Faculty. Near the
library and upon the same floor are the court room and the
offices of the practice court. There are also three lecture
rooms on the second floor. Upon the third floor are two
lecture rooms, ample debating and society rooms and the
office of the instructors.  The building is provided with a fan
system of heating and ventilation and is lighted by electricity.

For the money expended, about 65,ooo0 including the furnishing, the results are more than could reasonably have been
expected at the time the work was undertaken.
The School of Pharmacy now enters upon its thirty-first
year. Its graduates number 765 persons. MAore than half of
its students have entered the University from the high schools
of this state, but on going out they have been in demand in
all the states, in the east even more than in the west, for
various services of skill.  As an instance of tle part which
Michigan has taken in pharmaceutical education it may be
mentioned tlat the present dean of the oldest school of pharmacy in New England graduated in pharmacy here in iSS3,
and came as a boy from the Jackson high school to the UIniversity in 1878. As another instance, a few years ago the
Maine State College established a department of pharllacy
and called to take charge of it a pharlmacist resident in Alichigan, who had prepared for college in a Michigan high school
and earned our degree in pharmlacy in 887. Again, in Alabama, upon the establishment of pharmacy in the Institute of
Technology, it was intrusted to a Michigan man, educated in
pharmacy at this UTniversity.
For the prosecution of chemical and pharmlaceutical
research at this University in the year now b)efore us, certain
trust funds have been placed in the hands of the Regents, in
continuation of gifts for like purposes for several years past. It
is proper to acknowledge the trust reposed in this institution
by the givers of these annual stipends, in their purl)ose to sustain scientific investigation. The Committee of Revision and
Publication of the Pharmacopoeia of the United States, 1890 -I900, a body representing the physicians, the pharmacists, and
the government of this country, out of the proceeds of publication, have set apart a sunm sufficient to support two experienced workers in research at this point. This work is to be
upon the quantitative methods establishing the purity and
strength of remedial agents, under the direction of the School
of Pharmacy.  Messrs. Frederick Stearns & Co., of Detroit,




AO!791/BAA))ER I/A/iTJA7, zSgs.


this year again, support a fellowship il research in the School
of Pharmacy, this annual grant having been continuous since
1895.
The Honceoplathic Medical College continues to mnake a
moderate but regular increase in numbers. As it now has a
united and efficient Faculty and apparently enjoys the cordial
support of the profession in the state and in the whole country,
there seems to be every reason to expect a high degree of
prosperity for it. In its laboratories and its hospital it has
now a good outfit for work of the most thorough character.
The report of its hospital shows that from October, 1897,
to July I, 1898, it cared for 315 in-patients and 423 outpatients. Compared with the previous year that is an increase
of 98 in the number of in-patients, and of 225 in out-patients.
It has nearly doubled the earnings of the previous year..s in
the other hospital the farmers, o'f whon there were 71, and tle
housewives, 104, exceeded in number those of any other calling in life. More than half the counties in the state were
represented in the patients. The hospital is elmphatically a
most useful public charity.
The Dental College continues its work with increasing
usefulness and prosperity. Its graduates are now found in
all parts of this country and in foreign lands.  It is a noteworthy fact that almost everywhere in the world the superiority
of American to European dentists is recognized. This is due
to the fact that the training in our best dental schools is
better than that of foreign schools.  Hence we always have
some foreign students in the D)epartment.
The growth of our libraries durinl the last year has been
reasonably gratifying.  The applropriations made by the
Regents from our General Fund, supplemented by the income
from the Coyl and Ford legacies and by generous gifts from
many donors has added, as we learn from  the Librarian's
report, 9,022 volumes, 1,079 pamphlets and 24 maps. Our
entire  collections  now number 122,962 volumes, 18,461
pamphlets, and 1,299 mIaps; of these the General library con



306


ANO VEMi:/BEeR MEE TiNG,,Sg8.


tains 98,222 volumes, 16,952 pamphlets and 1,299 maps. The
circulation of books was larger than ever before. The recorded
use, which is estimated at about one-half of the whole use,
reached I42,I67 volumes.
It is well known to the Board that students are not allowed
to draw books from the Library and take them to their rooms.
They must use them, if at all, in the reading room of the Library, which is kept open every week day from 8 o'clock in the
morning to o1 o'clock in the evening. As it has always been
our policy to give to our readers the largest use of the Library
compatible with the safe administration of it, the question has
often arisen whether we could not set aside a certain number
of books which  students might draw and carry to their
rooms for a limited time. I have discussed the subject in
some, previous Reports. It has seemed to me that when we
had collected about 1oo,ooo volumes in the General Library,
we might try the experiment. Of course most of our books
could not thus be loaned. But a considerable number, many
of them duplicates, could be selected for circulation without
incommoding the great mass of our students. And the students would, it seems to me, be materially aided in much of
their work. Perhaps an incidental advantage would be the
relief of our reading room, which at certain seasons does not
now furnish accomlnodations for all the readers. The additional expense of administration would not be large. The
enlargement of the Library building and the consequent
redistribution of our books seem to make this a suitable time
to consider the subject afresh. I respectfully commend it to
your attention.
It is a cause of great satisfaction that the Regents have
been able to make an addition to the Library Building, doubling the capacity of the book room and of our Art Gallery.
This addition is fifty-four feet in length and forty feet in
width. It contains three stories for iron stacks and one story
for the art room. This will provide storage room for about
70,000 volumes. It is proposed to provide on the third floor




A'O VEAZIBERiA' /E1  TING, 89oS.


307.) )i


for the special collections and the rare and valuable books,
which should be guarded more carefully. There are now
several thousands of this character. Space will also be afforded
in this third story for the "Concord Room" for the Thoreau
and Emerson collections, presented by Dr. S. A. Jones, and
for other rooms of a similar character
We shall also be able to display in a fitting manner our
collections of paintings, especially those of the Lewis collection, which in our limited space we were unable to provide for
as we desired.
I trust that the day is not distant when we may throw out
wings from the new book room to provide seminary rooms, for
which there is most urgent need. This can easily be done in
keeping with the architectural plan of the building. The
seminary method for advanced students has now been so generally adopted that all the best College Libraries recently
constructed make generous provision for seminary rooms.
Our present number is inadequate to our wants.
The Alumni Association, which now receives to lmembership the graduates of all Departments, is evincing a most
encouraging disposition to aid the University. It etmploys a
paid secretary and clerks who gather information about the
alumni, and by various means keep them in touch with tile
University. It is publishing a monthly magazine, the Alumnus,
which contains matter of special interest to graduates. A semimonthly sheet, the University News Letter, is also published fronm
the office of the Association. It is sent to any who desire it, but
especially to the newspapers of the State. It is filled with
trustworthy items of news from the University, which are given
in brief articles that newspapers are invited to produce without giving credit to the News Letter. It is edited by Professor
Scott. Through it the newspaper press of the State has been
led to give a large circulation to news of real importance to
the citizens of the State, who furnish in large part the support
of the University. We desire nothing so much as that they
should be kept fully advised of the nature and extent of the

work done here, and of the worth and beneficent influence of
the University.
When the recent war with Spain broke out, the patriotic
spirit of the University flamed up as it did in i86i. So far as
known, about one hundred and twenty-five of our students
and as many more of our graduates enlisted, and many others
would have willingly gone, if their aid had seemed necessary.
Three of our prominent Professors also enlisted, D)r. Nancrede,
Professor of Surgery in the Department of Medicine, Dr.
Vaughan, Dean of that I)epar-tment, and M. E. Cooley, Professor of Mechanical Engineering. The two former served on
the medical staff with the greatest efficiency.  They were
present at the fighting before Santiago, and 1)r. Vaughan was
prostrated with the yellow fever. Mr. Cooley, who is an engineer graduate of the Naval Academy, was Chief Engineer on
the United States Steamter Yosemite, which was manned by
the Naval Reserves of Michigan, and took an active part in
the campaign.  Dr. Nancrede, after discharging most difficult
and responsible duties, was released from  the service, and
resumed his work here at the opening of the year. Dr.
Vaughan, after his recovery froml yellow fever, was detailed to
study the causes of typhoid fever in certainl camps, and is
detained in Washinglton, colmpleting his report.  His return
to his post here is expected soon. Professor Cooley's services
have been so valuable that the navy department lhas been
unwilling to spare him vet, but we hope lie may before long
secure his discharge. lThe Board willingly granted these three
officers leave of absence for this latriotic duty, and they have
all done marked credit to tlhemselves and to the University.
The Board also in June conferred degrees on the men who
would have conmpleted tleir courses at that tilme, but who left
for the front in April.
So far as known to us, seven University meni lost their
lives in the war.
John Albert Bobb, iM.D., i886, was Assistant Surgeon of
the 34th Michigan Infantry. He died Aug. 19, on the voyage

form Santiago de Cuba to Alontauk Point, and was buried at
sea. His last words were, "I die for ill country; my only
regret is tlat I have not a hundred lives to offer for her."
Charles Augtust Fred von Walthausen, Ph.C., 1896, a
private in the 31st Michigan Infantry, died at (Camup Thomas,
Chickainauga, \Aug. 1o, aged 23 years.
William James ('Brien, who was fromll 1894-7 a lneiliber
of the last graduating class, was a sergeant in Torrey's Rough
Riders, and died at Jacksonville, Fla., Sept. 13, of malarial fever.
Oliver PBurleigh Norton, of the medical class of 190I, was
one of Roosevelt's Rolugh Riders, and was killed while bravely
charging up thle hill of San Jluall.
John Oliver, a student in tlie Iaw )epartment, a sergeant
in the 34th  li(chi,-an I nfantrv died in the hoslital at Sibonev,
Cuba, on Aug. 2I, aged 2 1 years.
Henry Carlton (owanl of the    literary I)epartmlent, a
private in the 33d 5Michigan Infantry, died of tylhoid fever at
Grace Hospital, Detroit, on Sept. T.  â€” e was )buried at Sault
Ste. Marie.
Elihlu Harrv l:ovnton, of St. (.lair, a 1private in tlie 3 Lst
Michigan Infant-r, died at Knoxville   n, Te i. o No-velber 2.
His home was St. Clair, Mlich. I-e liad studied in the literary and law D)epartmlents.
The naimes of these voung mien w     ill be cherislled with
those of the heroic spirits who left these halls for their coiintrv's
sake in the Civil \War and fell on southern fields.
A nulmber of students, who left the Universitv and joined
the 3ist Michigan regiment asked mie, when it was apparent
that there was no fighlting for them i to do, to inl(luire if the
War Department would not discharge theimt from service in
order that the5y iighilt return to their studies.  I therefore
requested the Secretary of War to release them. if such action
was compatible witl public interests.  1ie very promptly
granted the request. and miost of themll are already here at
their work.
In I890 we issued a General Catalogue of all tle students

who up to that time had been connected with the University.
It was prepared with ilmmlense labor and scrupulous care by
Professors Deminon and Pettee.  It gave, so far as then could
be learned, the occupations, official positions and addresses of
every graduate, and the names of those who had attended, but
not graduated. The volume was beautifully I)rinted. It has
attracted much attention, and has been i mitated by somle other
Institutions.  It was expected at the time of publication that
a new edition would be published in  900o. Clearly it is of
great importance that we should have another issue ready by
Commencement Day of that year.    In order to accolmplish
this, it is necessary that the work should soon be taken in
hand. I recommend that the Executive (Comlittee be at
once charged with the duty of relortingr to the Board a plan
for preparing the new edition of the General Catalogue. The
last one was so well prepared, and Professor Demmon has so
faithfully preserved the lmaterial whicli has come to hand for
another edition, that the task will be much less onerous than it
was before. I miay add that MIiss Chase of l)etroit has generously placed at our disposal the material gathered by her
father, the late ''heodore R. (Chase, who was so many years the
necrologist of the Alumni Association, and who prepared two
earlier editions of the catalogue of graduates.
It has been decided to require of the first year students
in the literary and engineering departments attendance for
two hours a week on instruction in the gymxinasiui1. It has
been found that often those who are most in need of physical
exercise do not take it. It has therefore been thought wise
to insist that those who are beginning college work should
take some gymnastic work.  It is hoped that they wvill by trial
see the benefits of it and acquire the habit of taking- systematic
and regular exercise.
The gifts which we have received during tlme year encourage us to hope that our friends will continue to sulI)plement the state appropriations by generous assistance.
In addition to the fellowships provided -by Parke, Davis &

Hon. James McMillaln has (continued his c('ontrilutions for
the Shakespeare Library.

largely duplicates of books tlht we already lhave. thev \\ill l)e
very useful to the D)epartmtent, as witl our large number of
students, miany duplicates are needed. Tlhe gift of tlese books
was in accordance with a wish expressed by Judge Douglass not
long before his death.  It is to be hoped that other members
of the bar, when providing for the disposition of their law
libraries, will remember that a Iore useful disposition could
not in most cases be made than b p)lacing them in the collection of this I)elartmlent.  All stuch gifts are kept bv themselves, and are known I) the name of the donor.
In Decemlber last Ex-Regent l evi I.. Iarbouir, \who had
already displayed his generosity to the University by his liberal
contribution towards the erection of the Barbour (Gvmlnasium
for XWomen, proposed to present to the Regents of the University certain pIremises in I)etroit valued at $15,ooo  or Imore
as a contribution toward the erection of a building to be
devoted to the display and promlotionl of art in the University.
The gift was to be made on the condition that within five
years the Regents should secure $5,0ooo for the erection
of the art building, and that wvithin six years they should
have begun the building and expended at least $20,000
upon it.  Mrs. Barbour joined with her husband in this
action.
Of our great need of such a building there can be no
question. Since the gift of the Rogers Collection of statuary
and of the Lewis Collection of pictures, our Art Gallery has
proved much too small for the proper display of our objects
of art. It is true the extension of the art gallery soon to be




312:312  OT JiJ/LI   if/i/ifAYA;W, iS9~.


completed will nmuch relieve us.  But the day is not distant
when the whole of our present art gallery, which occupies the
upper story of the Library building will be needed for library
purposes. Besides, if we had an appropriate fire proof building set apart exclusively for a gallery, we should receive many
gifts for our collections which are not likely to come to us in
our crowded rooms.
On April 6, I898, Miss Elizabeth Bates, M.I)., died at
Port Chester, N.. Y By will she bequeathed to the University
the bulk of her estate.  She directed that, subject to certain charges, the property be(lueathed should be "for the
use of the Medical Departmlent to found a Professorship to be
known and called the Bates Professorship of the Diseases of
Women and Children, provided. nevertheless, that said University or College will i-eceive female students to pursue their
studies thereat, and give to them the same advantages as male
students in the Medical Department thereof."
It does not appear that our benefactor ever visited the
University.  So far as we can learn, she was moved to remember us in this generous Ianner by the fact that this University
was one of the first to offer medical education to womlen.
She wished to testify her appreciation of the service thus rendered to her sex, and to enlarge our facilities for medical
education.  There seems good ground to expect that the
legacy will yield $ioo,ooo or more.
Such instances as these now namled of generous regard
for our welfare encourage us to hope that other persons of
liberal intent will be found ere long to aid the State in ministering to our many needs. No investments are inore productive
of permanent good than the endowment of schools of learning.
Many of these have survived the greatest political and social
changes, and bid fair to remainl perpetual fountains of blessing
to mankind.

GENTLEMEN: â€”My appointment as a member of the Presidential

further into the future than I can at present. As soon as matters take
definite shape I will communicate with you. M\eanwlile, I can only say
that at the termination of my present leave of absence I shall be entirely
willing to leave the matter of my future connection with the University in

Regent Fletcher, who was authorized at the last meeting

who had signified her desire to endow      a chair for women in

To THE PRESIDENT ANI) REGNTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICI(IGAN.
The subject most closely interesting me now-because it seems the
most important as regards the future of the race â€”is the education of womanhood. The world needs a higher and more useful type. May it not )e
promoted through a study of their own peculiar characteristics and endowments â€”its undeveloped possibilities and a thoghtful survey of the responsibilities inherent in their constitution?
A chair in the University to be filled by a woman of acknowledged
ability, with high ideals respecting the character and aims of her sex, as
well as tactful methods of influencing them, seems almost a necessity. Tlhe
co-operation of broad-minded scientific men should be heartily welcomed by
way of lectures or other modes of instruction when feasible, and all methods subject to the approval of the proper authorities.
While it will be always understood the first object of this endowment
is the enlightenment of the highest and most responsible elements of
womanhood, any other branch of study may be added to her duties except
physical culture or gymnasium work.
If the University will accept in prospective an endowment of not less
than thirty-five thousand dollars for this purpose with the accompanying
restrictions, the writer would like to initiate the movement by a gift of
ten thousand dollars to be paid by or before January, 900o. Interest to be
added to the principal, and name of present donor to be withheld till the
whole amount is raised.

Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman said that this is Art Fair week on Central Campus making
this a good time to move the meeting site to the North Campus Research Complex
(NCRC). This complex has become a real asset for research, creativity and economic
development in southeast Michigan.
She welcomed Regent Newman to her new role as board chair and Regent
White as vice chair. She commented on a reception for more than 200 UM student
interns working in Detroit. She thanked the students and businesses that are so
committed to Detroit and its future.
President Coleman continued, sharing that Michigan Radio's flagship station,
WUOM, celebrated its 65th anniversary on the air, and has the highest audience rating
of any public radio station in the country with 25 percent of adults in the greater Ann
Arbor area.
Finally, she said that men's basketball head coach John Beilein has been
awarded a contract extension through the 2018-19 season for his efforts in turning the
program into a national contender. President Coleman then turned to Regent Deitch for
an update.
Regent Deitch said he was pleased to speak on behalf of his colleagues, and
read the following letter on the presidential search process:

The Presidential Search Advisory Committee will conduct a broad, vigorous search to
develop and recommend a pool of candidates to be considered by the Board of Regents sitting as
the Presidential Search Committee. From this pool, the regents will select the University's 14th
president. Mary Sue Coleman announced she will retire as president when her contract ends on
July 31, 2014.
As part of the search process, the Advisory Committee will reach out to the campus
community to solicit feedback on issues facing the University and qualities to seek in a new
president. We will hold a series of public meetings to discuss those matters in September and
October. Further details will be forthcoming. We also look forward to receiving nominations
from members of the University community.
The regents have retained the services of Dr. Ilene H. Nagel and Alison Ranney,
of Russell Reynolds Associates, to assist them with the search. Russell Reynolds Associates is
one of the leading executive recruiting firms in the world, with offices in 26 countries. Their
higher education practice focuses on the recruitment of presidents, provosts and deans,
primarily at Association of American Universities research universities and peer institutions.
Their clients include, but are not limited to, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford
University, Johns Hopkins University, Duke University, University of Southern California,
Northwestern University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Texas at Austin, the
University of Minnesota, the University of Virginia, New York University, Georgetown
University, and University of California-San Diego, among others. Nominations may be
submitted directly to UMich.President@russellreynolds.com.
We have created this presidential search website to keep the campus community
apprised of matters related to the search and for members of the community to reach out to us to
discuss the search.
President Coleman welcomed Dr. David Canter, executive director of the North
Campus Research Complex (NCRC) for his presentation.
Presentation on NCRC:
Executive Director Canter said that the NCRC, purchased by the university in
2010, has exceeded goals in terms of active space, occupancy, collaboration and
research. The complex has more than 2,000 occupants to date, including many research
institutes and startups, and an active partnership with Veterans Affairs. The research
leadership team has effectively made the NCRC a place of scientific study, research
and collaboration that moves scientific discoveries from the lab to having an impact on

patient's lives. While the NCRC has no classrooms, it hosts many student researchers,
and also embraces a strong relationship with the arts, with the display of sculptures and
other works of art throughout the campus.
Public Comments
Regents heard comments from the following individuals on the topics listed:
Javier Contreras, citizen, on tuition equality; Jose Contreras, citizen, on tuition equality;
Citlalxochilt Ramirez-Lopez, citizen, on tuition equality; Chris Skovron, student, on
tuition equality; Joshua Simister, student, on University of Michigan guidelines for
qualifying for in-state tuition; and Laura Sanders, faculty, on University of Michigan
guidelines for qualifying for in-state tuition.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Richner, Chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, said that he and Regents Bernstein and
Darlow met with Executive Vice President Slottow. The committee reviewed the bimonthly Internal Audit and University Risk Assessment and FY2014 Audit Plan with
Jeff Moelich, executive director of university audits. The committee then heard from
the university Chief Information Technology Security Officer Paul Howell, who
presented on IT security/disaster recovery and enterprise risk. Vice President Slottow
then gave a report on investment office compensation. The members of the committee
then joined the other two committees for a presentation from Rowan Miranda, associate
vice president for finance, on the president's travel and hosting expenses.
Health Affairs Committee. Regent Diggs, chair of the Health Affairs
Committee, reported that she and committee members Regents Deitch and Ilitch met
with Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Doug Strong, director, and chief executive
officer of UMHHC, Tom Campbell, director of UMHS planning, Tim Lynch, general
counsel, and two new attorneys for the Health System, Pamela Emenheiser,
transactional attorney, and Gina Bertolini, associate vice president and deputy general
counsel.
They received an update from Jeanne Strickland, chief compliance officer, who
gave an overview of the complicated, changing regulations of the federal health care
system. Dr. Pescovitz presented the rationale for moving from the Pioneer Accountable
Care Organization (ACO) to the Physician Organization of Michigan (POM) ACO.
Under the Pioneer ACO there has been a 0.3 percent savings for several years, but it
has been difficult to administer both, leading to a decision to consolidate to just the
POM ACO, with over 100,000 patients. The committee also received an update on
strategic initiatives, a financial update, and an update on faculty appointments and
Medical School department chair renewals. Executive Vice President Pescovitz also
shared an experience about the value of art in the healing process and its impact on
patients.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Newman,
co-chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, and co-chair
Regent White received an update from Provost Pollack on dean searches, an update

the state.

~July Meeting, 2013

Approval of Guidelines for In-State Tuition
Provost Pollack said the recommended revisions seek to accomplish three
things: first, simplify the process for establishing eligibility for in-state tuition by
making the guidelines easier to understand; second, expand the ways in which veterans
may qualify for in-state tuition; and third, provide an alternative test for establishing
eligibility for in-state tuition based on attendance at Michigan high schools and
Michigan middle or junior high schools, and matriculation at the University of
Michigan within 28 months of high school.
President Coleman asked for comments on the proposed in-state tuition
guidelines before the vote.
Regent Darlow moved the approval of the guidelines, and expressed her
appreciation for the UM students saying:
I believe it was in the fall of 2011 that the Coalition for Tuition Equity got started and
brought these issues, which I don't think any of the regents were aware of, to our attention. I
remember Regent White and I meeting with the group in April of 2012, and throughout this
period there were wonderful speakers who came and spoke so movingly to us about the
importance of these changes and the need for these changes, building support with organization
after organization on campus. I think they've just done an impressive and a distinguished job,
and they have done it with dignity combined with passion, that many of us admire so much.
Most wonderful is that all of you students and other supporters are doing it not for yourselves,
but for other people, and also to ensure that this university continues to be the special university
it always has been. That feature of your efforts is particularly great.
Regent Bernstein said:
I have been looking forward to this moment since I joined the board. There are many
good reasons to support these tuition reforms: to simplify and streamline the admissions process
for all students; to honor veterans like Josh who spoke just a minute ago, no matter where they
live or served, which will make this university a destination of choice for our veterans; to create
essentially a right-of-return for Michigan residents who leave Michigan but want to return for
the best education in the world; and to stimulate economic development by attracting and
retaining exceptional students.
For me, to not address the impact of these changes on undocumented students would do
two things: First, I would miss an opportunity to express my own personal values that have
motivated my work on this issue, and second I would miss an opportunity to reaffirm the values
of this great public university as I see them. There are very few moments when strands of
history weave together, and for me today is one of those extraordinary moments. This university
has always been a place with a profoundly important public mission from its very beginning, but
it was already an old place when my family arrived in this country. Its treasures were far
beyond their reach. About a century ago I would have been an undocumented student, and I'm
pretty sure many of the people sitting at this table would as well, no different from the students
we are discussing today, who are simply struggling to make a new life, working for a better
future for themselves, their families and their communities. This university has always been a
ladder of opportunity for students and their families. A century ago, those students had names
like Bernstein, and Bendit, and Nelson and they found here at this university a public university
that welcomed them and literally launched their lives. Today, our essential mission remains the
same. Now a new generation with names like Contreras, Martinez and Gau and Achneed come
to us with the same hopes and dreams, and they are asking this university for the same thing that
my family sought, which was for us to help breathe life into their American dream. They ask for
nothing more and they deserve nothing less from us as a board.

~July Meeting, 2013

Regent Richner said, "I also wish to express my appreciation to those who have
been involved in putting these guidelines together but, I still have questions regarding
the policy and legal implications and will be voting no."
Regent Bernstein seconded the motion, and the regents approved the revised instate tuition guidelines as presented, with Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Deitch, Diggs,
Ilitch and White in favor, and Regents Newman and Richner opposed.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 4:30 p.m. The
next meeting will take place on September 19, 2013.

~SEPTEMBER MEETING, 2013

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
September 19, 2013
The regents met at 3:00 p.m. in the Anderson Room, Michigan Union. Present
were President Coleman and Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Deitch, Diggs, Ilitch,
Newman, Richner and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary
Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Chancellor Little, Vice
President Lynch, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President
Pescovitz, Provost Pollack, Executive Vice President Slottow and Vice President
Wilbanks. Vice President Rudgers was absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman said that the month of September has been exceptionally
busy with the celebration of the historic $200 million gift from Steve Ross, the worldrecord crowd at Michigan Stadium for the Notre Dame football game, and the first ever
quintuplets born at C.S. Mott Children's and Von Voigtlander Women's Hospitals.
President Coleman also said that she enjoyed meeting hundreds of students at her fall
open house, where she and Vice President Harper welcomed students to the new
academic year.
President Coleman continued saying that Steve Forrest, vice president for
research, will be stepping down to return to the faculty. Since becoming vice president
in 2006, Steve has maintained an active research portfolio in optoelectronic integrated
circuits and organic semiconductors. He is eager to return to this work, and to return to
teaching in the College of Engineering.
Vice President Forrest thanked President Coleman and the Regents for the
opportunity to serve as Vice President for Research, and said that he looks forward to
returning to the faculty in January. He continued, saying that one of the best parts of
his job is giving the Annual Research Report. There has been continued growth in
research and this has been another outstanding year, with total research expenditures for
FY2013 at a record $1.33 billion, a 4.3% increase over 2012. This includes a 12%
increase from the National Science Foundation, an 11% increase from the Department
of Energy, a 20% increase from NASA, and a 130% increase from the Department of
Transportation. The state of Michigan increase was 520% on a very low base. He was
most pleased to report that research sponsorship from industry grew by 14% to a record
$73 million. This is a significant increase; industry funding is now 8% of the total
sponsored research portfolio, which compares with 5% for research universities
nationally. He said this report is a great way to end the fiscal year, and to his term as
vice president.
President Coleman said that whether on campus, in the Ann Arbor community,
or across the globe in China and Israel, Vice President Forrest has promoted innovation
and collaboration among researchers, and she thanked him for his contribution. A
recommendation for an interim vice president will be brought to the Board shortly.

29



~September Meeting, 2013

President Coleman continued, saying that the approval of the Munger graduate
housing schematic design will come later on the agenda. This facility will offer more
interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of residential and intellectual life.
The administration is well aware of student concerns about cost, she said, and efforts
are being made to keep it affordable. She and the regents appreciate the thoughtful
letter received from the Rackham student leadership on this topic.
President Coleman introduced the presentation on global engagement by James
Holloway, who recently joined the Provost's Office as vice provost for global and
engaged education.
Presentation: The Globally Engaged Student
James P. Holloway said that the goals of global education are several: to include
create an impact on the world through research and scholarship; to expand education
abroad; and to continue to internationalize our own campus. He said that this program
strives to create opportunities and partnerships that are reciprocal, sustainable, and that
provide capabilities that cannot be created here. There are currently about 5,800
students participating, about 12% of the student population.
Public Comments on Agenda-Related Topics

31



~September Meeting, 2013

president. They also launched a survey and have received hundreds of responses to
date. The feedback will be consolidated and presented on September 26.
Regent White said that the regents wish to recognize and thank the member of
the CSG University Council who have agreed to gather input on the qualities,
experiences and values that are important to students in selecting a new president.
These students are extraordinarily busy and working hard, and their efforts are
appreciated. She said that their work on pulling together information from the student
viewpoint is crucial and she looks forward to meeting with the Council next week. She
thanked the CSG for their leadership in making sure the regents are well informed of
the student perspective.

2013, includes some very high profile gifts, including the Ross, Munger and Frankel
family gifts in support of business, athletics, the health system and graduate education.
A distinctive feature of this year was gifts to the arts, including the Stamps, Zell and
Brehm gifts. He thanked his colleagues and President Coleman for her leadership in
the delivery of these gifts. In summary, there were a record number of donors this year
with 129,000. The university received the most cash in the history of the university,
$357 million. There also were a record number of gifts under $25,000, with 120,000
donors. Most of those gifts were $100, $250 and $500 gifts, for a total $74 million. He
thanked the development officers and staff members for their efforts. Finally, in terms

~September Meeting, 2013

Approval of Change of Name from Division of Student Affairs to Student Life
Vice President Harper presented a proposed name change for the Division of
Student Affairs to Student Life, which better reflects the core work, and will create a
clearer and more meaningful connection to students. On a motion by Regent Bernstein,
seconded by Regent Diggs, the regents unanimously approved the name change from
Division of Student Affairs to Student Life. The ensuing changes to the bylaws will be
presented at a future meeting.
Public Comments
Regents heard comments from the following individuals on the topics
listed: Sam Dickens, student, on a private tutoring program; Douglas Smith, citizen, on
the sexual assault policy; Nancy Scarbro, citizen, on kicking Gibbons off the football
team; Elena Herrada, citizen, on Detroit Public Schools; Mack Wilkins, alumnus and
BAMN member, on affirmative action/proposal 2 case; Joseph Semana, citizen, on
affirmative action/proposal 2 case; John Lauve, alumnus, on the Michigan Constitution
Article 8, Section 6 on degrees; Tyler Wood, citizen, on the Supreme Court Case
(Schuette v. BAMN).
Vice President Lynch said, "There were a number of commenters today who
spoke about the University's sexual misconduct policy. I would like to make it clear
that because of federal law we may not speak about student disciplinary issues, but our
silence should not be construed as agreement with the inflammatory statements made
today."
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 5:30 p.m. The
next meeting will take place on October 18, 2013 at the UM-Flint Campus.

~OCTOBER MEETING, 2013

The University of Michigan
Flint
October 18, 2013
The regents met at 3:08 p.m. in the Harding Mott University Center on the
campus of the University of Michigan-Flint. Present were President Coleman and
Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Diggs, Newman, and Richner. Regent White participated
via conference call, and Regents Deitch and Ilitch were absent. Also present were Vice
President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper,
Chancellor Little, Vice President Lynch, Vice President May, Chancellor Person,
Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Provost Pollack, Vice President Rudgers,
Executive Vice President Slottow and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman welcomed those present to her last meeting at UM-Flint, and
she expressed her appreciation for the services the campus provides, particularly those
provided to military veterans. She said, "Student veterans come to higher education
with unique and sometimes challenging needs, and this campus goes above and beyond
in addressing those issues." She thanked Chancellor Ruth Person for her leadership,
and the countless contributions from faculty, staff and students.
She continued, noting that the University will soon kick off the most ambitious
fundraising effort in its history. Increasing support for students is a priority, and donors
will be asked to contribute to scholarships and fellowships at all levels of study. On
November 8, the overall goal for the campaign, Victors for Michigan, will be
announced. She thanked Jeff Mackie-Mason, dean of the School of Information, and
his wife, Janet Netz, who recently pledged a $2.5 million gift for the School of
Information.
President Coleman continued, noting that a UM alumnus, Professor Robert
Shiller, was one of three winners of the Nobel Prize in economics. He teaches at Yale
University and is a 1967 graduate of the College of LSA, with a bachelor's degree in
economics. She then turned to Regent Newman for an announcement.
Regent Newman read the following statement:
In January of this year the Board of Regents took time out from its regular meeting
schedule to have a strategic planning session for the first time in many years. It was an
incredibly valuable experience and we plan to that again in January in place of the regularly
scheduled board meeting. This informal strategic session will take place in New York City,
January 16-17, 2014.
This is a critical time in the history of the university. We are in the midst of the search
for our next president, someone who will lead the university into its third century and by the time
we gather in January, we will have launched the most ambitious fundraising campaign ever for
this university. The strategic session will allow us to focus on the future of the university and its
important place in higher education for our state, our region and the nation.
We will meet with several experts in higher education and academic medical centers
who are based on the east coast. Among them are: Bill Bowen, president emeritus, Princeton

87



~October Meeting, 2013

University, and former president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation; Peter Salovay,
president, Yale University; Ed Miller, retired EVPMA, Johns Hopkins Medicine; Mike Johns
retired EVPMA at Emory University.
Additionally, we will have the opportunity to meet with friends of the university and
donors in a state that is home to more than 26,000 UM alumni and 2100 current UM students,
our second largest contingent of alumni and students outside Michigan. Steve Ross, who
already has been so incredibly generous to this university with both his time and his money, has
agreed to host a donor event while we are in New York. We look forward to these important
discussions about the future direction of higher education and academic medical centers and we
will resume our regular schedule of meetings in Ann Arbor, February 20, 2014.
Normally the Board of Regents discusses the compensation for the President, at our
September meeting. This year we would like to do it at the October meeting, and talk about
some of your accomplishments as well. President Coleman led a year of fantastic forward
momentum at the university.
In addition to her recent announcement that she and Ken are giving $1 million to
Michigan for student international experiences, she also secured historic major gifts from
leadership donors. This year alone we announced Helen Zell's $50 million gift for graduate
creative writing; Penny and Roe Stamps $40 million gift for the School of Art and Design;
Charlie Munger's $110 million for graduate housing and fellowships, and of course Steve Ross'
$200 million donation for the Ross School of Business and for Athletics.
Importantly, President Coleman has also led the university in challenging important
milestones in affordability, financial aid, and business efficiency. FY14 tuition was increased
only 1.1% for in-state undergraduates, the smallest increase since 1985. In the FY14 budget,
need based financial aid for undergraduates was increased by 13.7% marking the 8th time in the
past nine years that aid has increased by at least 10%. The FY14 budget also decreased by
$500,000 the amount of loans that is part of a typical financial aid package for many in-state
students. The university replaced some loans with grants, which do not need to be repaid.
Additionally, UM will meet the full demonstrated need for twice as many out-of-state students
through a new financial aid program launched last year. Among the nation's major public
research universities, the UM provides the third highest amount of institutional aid to students.
The combination of a small tuition increase and a significant boost in financial aid means the
net cost of attendance for undergraduate student with financial need will not increase and in
some cases it will decrease. Last year UM helped in-state students by packaging more than
$110 million in grants and scholarships alone. None of that money has to be re-paid.
President Coleman has helped us shape the next fundraising campaign as well putting
student support as the number one priority for the Victors for Michigan Campaign that will
launch on November 8. Part of what makes this all possible is the university's long-term
commitment to cost containment and reallocating resources to the highest priorities, which goes
back the start of President Coleman's tenure as president.
Since 2004 the University has trimmed or reallocated $265 million in recurring
expenses in the general fund, and there is an ongoing commitment to identify additional $120
million in savings by 2017. The FY14 budget contains more than $24 million in reductions or
reallocations including further steps in the consolidation of information technology services,
expanding staffing efficiencies across campus and continued implementation of energy efficiency
initiatives.
Because of this and to show our appreciation to Mary Sue Coleman for what she has
done, the Board of Regents would like to give her a bonus this year, her last year as President,
of $100,000 and take it from non-general fund resources. We hope you will accept it with our
deepest appreciation for everything you have done.

88



~October Meeting, 2013

President Coleman thanked Regent Newman and the board, and said that she
appreciates all they have done to keep the university in good shape. She then
introduced Jon Davidson, director of admissions, for a presentation on the growth of the
UM-Flint Campus.
Presentation: UM-Flint Enrollment
John Davidson, admissions director, UM-Flint focused on enrollment growth
over the last seven years, since student housing became available in 2008. Enrollment
has increased over 25% in many different segments since that time. Many enrollment
opportunities continue to exist for the UM-Flint Campus including scalability, value, a
strong transfer population and geographic diversification. Enrollment of veterans and
international students has grown 80.7%, and 369% respectively, since 2007. New
student housing opportunities in the city of Flint have also helped grow enrollment.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Richner, Chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, said that he and Regents Bernstein and
Darlow met with Executive Vice President Slottow, and Jeff Moelich, executive
director of university audits, for the bi-monthly internal audit update. They met with
Erik Lundberg, chief investment officer, for the FY2013 Annual Report on Investment
Performance, including the largest endowment ever, $8.4 billion, up from $7.7 billion
last year. The return on investments was 10.7%, up from -0.5% the previous year.
Distributions from the endowment totaled $276 million; nearly double those of 10 years
ago. He thanked Erik Lundberg for his outstanding work. The committee also heard
from Rowan Miranda, associate vice president for finance, and Greg Tewksbury,
treasurer, on the debt program, rating and strategy, and AAA credit rating. Regent
Richner noted also that the committee met recently in special session to discuss longterm parking needs.
Health Affairs Committee. Regent Diggs, chair of the Health Affairs
Committee, reported that she and committee member Regent Ilitch met with Executive
Vice President Ora Pescovitz, Paul Castillo, Health System CFO, Doug Strong,
UMHHC CEO, Tim Lynch, general counsel, and Dean Woolliscroft, and Jeff Moelich,
executive director of university audits, for the quarterly internal audit update. Doug
Strong reviewed the projects to increase inpatient beds and operating room beds. These
projects will come before the regents in the coming months. Strategic initiatives were
reviewed and also the financial results which were positive this month. The Health
System transplant program is host to 43% of all organ transplants in the state. Last year
357 children and adults received transplants, 22 more than last year at this time. The
committee received a publication Colleagues in Care highlighting some of the
accomplishments in specialized care.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Newman,
co-chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that she
and co-chair Regent White, who participated via conference call, received an update
from Provost Pollack on current dean searches for LS&A and Pharmacy and upcoming

89



~October Meeting, 2013

dean searches; an update on the Flint Campus faculty and staff; and an update from
general counsel.

be a unique environment for testing automated vehicles of the future, working with
industry and government to change a fundamental aspect of our lives-how we move
people and goods. It will be located on North Campus and will include five miles of
roads, merges and actual streets, creating an authentic driving situation, not a test track.
President Coleman said that this partnership will help the entire state and keeps
Michigan at the forefront of the continued evolution of transportation. She thanked
Vice President Forrest who advocated tirelessly for this project.

of the Year by the Michigan Council for the Social Studies.
Central Student Government Report. Central Student Government (CSG)
Vice President Bobby Dishell commented on student concerns about football seating
and student safety under the new policy. He noted that CSG provided $15,000 for a
joint project expanding bus service after 10 pm in response to student concerns about
safety, and that they had strong participation in the forum on the presidential search.
UM-Flint Student Government President Amir Baz voiced concern over the
change to the Regents' meeting schedule, which does not include a meeting at the UMFlint Campus again until 2015. He said that the students oppose the change and their

Professor Sargous received his B.A. degree from Yale University in 1970. He
received formative musical instruction at the Cleveland Music School Settlement where

professor in 1982, and was promoted to professor in 1989.
As a soloist and collaborative performer, Professor Sargous is known and

He produced numerous recordings including two solo recordings, Premiere Oboe

mechanical engineering, professor of industrial and operations engineering, and the J.
Reid and Polly Anderson Professor of Manufacturing Technology.
President Coleman continued, saying "Last week I joined a group of faculty in
India to establish academic partnerships with several universities and institutes in Delhi
and Mumbai. It was a highly productive visit that will broaden exchanges of students
and faculty, as well as deepen our medical research and survey research."
President Coleman continued saying that the first presentation today is from a
group of students who are with MPowered Entrepreneurship, a student organization
that is expanding the campus culture of entrepreneurship. She introduced Cathy
Huang, who introduced her team: Chris O'Neil, Michelle Lu, Lucy Zhao, and Shreyas

119



~November Meeting, 2013

data for teaching and learning, learning analytics grants, and looking at teaching and
learning evaluation systems.
He spoke about predictive modeling of student performance, exploring
alternatives to the GPA, comparing performance between men and women, and with
first generation college students. Challenging classes, such as physics, actually carry a
"grade penalty" and also gender disparities, and 'stereotype threat,' is a condition that
exists that when people are placed in an environment where they feel that they don't
belong, which causes them to do less well. All of this information can be used to work
on creating an environment that can get the very best performance from all students.

Research Report. Vice President Forrest submitted the Report of Projects
Established, July 1 - October 31, 2013.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Pescovitz
had no additional report.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper commented on the honest
and painful conversations taking place in social media about the experience of AfricanAmerican students on campus. She said that she is "listening and talking individually
and collectively with students and will continue to do the work that reflects the
commitment of this institution."

Central Student Government Report. Central Student Government (CSG)
President Michael Proppe referenced a Twitter address "Being Black at the UM
(#BBUM)," which generated 10,000 tweets in 48 hours. He said that while some
comments, "were positive and uplifting, many were troubling, all were powerful, and
there is still work to do." The CSC report to the Presidential Search Advisory
Committee cited priorities including diversity and inclusion. He provided an example
of Inter Group Relations (IGR) courses that focus on identity, and include multicultural
discussions led by students. Students rave about these classes, but which do not fulfill
the race and ethnicity requirement.
Mr. Proppe said that students need to know that they are heard on many of the
issues on campus, whether it's about fixing the Trotter Multicultural Center, concerns
about the Munger graduate housing construction, the football ticket policy, the
recreational sports facilities, late night transportation needs, or undocumented students.
He said "Michigan has the smartest people in the world right here, and we can address
these issues."
Regent Ilitch thanked Mr. Proppe for his thoughtful remarks and speaking on
behalf of the board she said, "we are all listening very carefully, and working with the
administration on programs and we hear you. Talk is not enough at this time. We need
to do more. We are very, very aware and sensitive. Thank you for talking to us about
this and please share with the students that we are on it. We are as frustrated as the
students, but are very committed to this topic and to putting together the strongest
programs. And we agree with you. The smartest people are here."

and associated professional member of the American Society of Pension Professionals
and Actuaries. A gifted teacher and dedicated mentor, Professor Huntington taught a
generation of students, many of whom have gone on to successful academic and
business careers. A recent graduate noted, "No mathematical model could ever
quantify Professor Huntington's enthusiasm, passion, or his positive impact on his
students."

~DECEMBER MEETING, 2013

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
December 19, 2013
The regents met at 3:10 in the Anderson Room, Michigan Union. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Deitch, Diggs, Ilitch, Newman,
Richner and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,
Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Provost Pollack, Vice President
Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow and Vice President Wilbanks. Vice
President Lynch was absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman announced that the University of Michigan was recently
ranked sixth on Kiplinger's list of 100 Best Values in Public Colleges for 2014, moving
up five spots from last year. The ranking highlights colleges and universities that
combine outstanding education with economic value, and considers such factors as
student-faculty ratios, tuition and financial aid, and debt at graduation.
She continued, saying that the University community lost two influential leaders
in the past month -- Noreen Clark, former dean of the School of Public Health, and
alumnus Chuck Vest, the former president of both MIT and the National Academy of
Engineering.
President Coleman noted that this would be the last meeting for Vice President
Steve Forest and she thanked him for his leadership during the past eight years. Regent
Newman presented Vice President Forrest with the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend their
appreciation to Stephen R. Forrest, vice president for research, William
Gould Dow Collegiate Professor of Electrical Engineering, professor of
electrical engineering and computer science, professor of materials
science and engineering, College of Engineering, and a professor of
physics, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, as he leaves his
administrative duties, to return full time to scholarly pursuits.
Since accepting the position in 2006, Vice President Forrest has
strengthened and expanded one of the world's leading university
research enterprises. His leadership has culminated in a recordbreaking year in 2013 for research volume, industry engagement,
inventions, patents issued, and license and option agreements. Vice
President Forest has nurtured the processes of scholarship and
innovation across the University through such activities as establishing
the UM Energy Institute, the Mobility Transformation Center, and the
Office of Advanced Research Computing, and expanding international

149



~December Meeting, 2013

research partnerships with China and Israel. He highlighted the integrity
of research by committing the University to compliance with the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.
In January, Vice President Forrest will return to his active
research portfolio as one of the world's preeminent researchers in
optoelectronic integrated circuits and organic semiconductors, and to
teaching in the College of Engineering.
Teacher. Scholar. Leader. Best. The Regents thank Stephen R.
Forrest for his outstanding tenure as vice president for research and
look forward to his continued contributions in the laboratory, in the
classroom, and beyond.
Vice President Forrest thanked President Coleman for the opportunity to serve
as vice president and the Regents for their support.
President Coleman introduced the presentation by Eric Morganroth, co-chair of
the Advisory Committee for the Frankel Cardiovascular Center's (CVC) Patient and
Family Centered Care Initiative, and two-time UMHS heart transplant recipient; Linda
Larin, chief administrative officer; and Kim Eagle, the Albion Walter Hewlett Professor
of Internal Medicine and director of the Center.
Mr. Morganroth described his experience as a heart patient and the important
role of advocate played by his mother on his behalf. His experience inspired his work
in transforming patient and family center care, in which all decision making and
information is shared with the patient and their families, supporting their mantra
"nothing about me without me," based on mutually beneficial outcomes, dignity and
respect.
Linda Larin, chief administrative officer of the CVC said that patient and family
centered care is part of their strategic priorities and culture. This has become a national
movement, and the UMHS is national leader academically. She introduced Dr. Kim
Eagle, who has been a champion of patient and family centered care. Dr. Eagle
explained that this model is safer, more efficient, and it provides an opportunity for
students to recognize the experience of the patient.
Presentation: College of Engineering
President Coleman introduced Dave Munson, the Robert J. Vlasic Dean of the
College of Engineering (COE). Dean Munson said that the median COE student comes
to UM with a 3.9/4.0 GPA and 32/36 on the ACT. Four years ago 57% of applicants
were admitted, compared with 30% last year. There are more than 9,000 engineering
undergraduates, 24% of which are women, and the current freshman class is 30%
women. Enrollment is unable to grow any further until new facilities are built.
Currently there are 385 tenured faculty members, of which 18.7% are women, the
highest percentage of peer schools nationally. Approximately 80% of the students who
begin as engineering students graduate with an engineering degree. The COE
emphasizes experiential learning, international experiences and entrepreneurship.

150



~December Meeting, 2013

Regent Richner asked what COE graduates do after graduation, adding "are
there thoughts on how to keep more graduates here in Michigan?" Dean Munson said
that part of the answer is economics, including more opportunities in entrepreneurship,
start-ups and partnerships with business.

Central Student Government Report. Central Student Government (CSG)
President Michael Proppe said that the new off campus late night bus routes will begin
in January. He said that this and the changes to student ticket policies have been
priorities. Changes to the basketball ticket policy were due to high demand for student
tickets, and the CSG worked collaboratively with the Department of Athletics to craft
an effective revised policy. He continued, saying that football attendance has been
reviewed and the new seating policy has not resulted in any real improvement. The
CSG, working with Athletics, has designed a follow-up survey and "the preliminary
results are not surprising: students don't like general admission but the biggest problem
is that the policy makes hard to sit with your friends." He said they are working on
adjustments to the policy and agree on four principals:
1. The game day experience needs to be positive for students
2. The policy should motivate students to attend games and be on time
3. The policy should reward students who consistently support the team, and
4. Every student who wants a ticket should be guaranteed a ticket.
Regent Ilitch said, "I've heard a lot of complaints about the ticket policy from
students. I am an alumna, and one of my fondest memories is going to football games
and sitting with my friends, having fun. I'm very much in support of what you are
trying to do and encourage you to be very tenacious." She asked that he report back,
well before the football season, so that this can be addressed.
Regent Newman said "I know when you became CSG President you didn't
expect that this would be your top issue. I know you had other plans you wanted to
accomplish, but you have truly done an amazing job, getting people's attention on this,
working with your colleagues in student government and making it known to the board
and the administration and to others how important this issue is. And you have done it
in a way that is nice, professional, tenacious and pushing forward. You have the
attention of the Regents. We actually discussed this earlier today. We feel your pain.

~December Meeting, 2013

We want to help you solve this and we look forward to hearing from you. Thank you
for letting us take on your cause."
Regent Bernstein said, "It's good to have a strong opinion but even better to
have strong facts. Your work with talking to students and the surveys that you
conducted are very convincing with respect to the real problem that we have. I think I
speak for the whole board in saying that we appreciate the work you have done."
Voluntary Support. Vice President May said that the campus community is
very focused on the Victors for Michigan campaign. He submitted the report of
voluntary support for November 30, 2013.

RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF

OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO
WHEREAS, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer") is a constitutional body
corporate established pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as
amended, with general supervision of The University of Michigan (the "University") and the control and
direction of all expenditures from the University's funds; and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties and in order to properly serve the needs
of students attending the University, the Issuer has authorized the acquisition, construction, installation
and equipping of the capital improvements listed in Category I of Exhibit A attached hereto, and will
consider authorizing at a future date the acquisition, construction, installation and equipping of the capital
improvements listed in Category II of Exhibit A (all of such capital improvements listed in Exhibit A
being collectively referred to herein as the "Project"); and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously issued and has outstanding certain series of General
Revenue Bonds (the "Outstanding General Revenue Bonds"), and certain other obligations secured by a
lien on General Revenues (as defined in Trust Agreements pursuant to which the Outstanding General
Revenue Bonds were issued), and has reserved the right to issue additional series of General Revenue
Bonds, notes or other obligations, secured on a parity basis as to the General Revenues with the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds and other obligations secured by a lien on General Revenues; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously entered into certain interest rate swap agreements related
to the debt service on portions of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, which are payable from and
secured by General Revenues (the "Existing Swap Agreements"); and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has issued and has outstanding Commercial Paper Notes, Series I (the
"Series I Notes") and Commercial Paper Notes, Series E (Taxable) (the "Series E Notes," and together

WHEREAS, it may be appropriate and economic to refund all or a portion of the Outstanding
General Revenue Bonds and all or a portion of the outstanding Notes as shall be determined by an
Authorized Officer (hereinafter defined) (the portion of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, if any,
to be refunded being herein called the "Bonds to be Refunded," and the portion of the Notes, if any, to be
refunded being herein called the "Notes to be Refunded"); and
WHEREAS, the financing of all or a portion of the Project and the refunding of the Bonds to be
Refunded, if any, and the Notes to be Refunded, if any, through the issuance of General Revenue Bonds
of the Issuer will serve proper and appropriate public purposes; and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties, and in order to control and direct
prudently expenditures from the University's funds, the Issuer determines it is necessary and desirable to
authorize the issuance of General Revenue Bonds (the "Bonds") in order to provide funds that, together
with other available funds, will be used to pay all or part of the costs of the Project, to pay all or part of
the costs of refunding the Bonds to be Refunded, if any, and the Notes to be Refunded, if any, and to pay
costs incidental to the issuance of the Bonds and the refunding; and

designated by an Authorized Officer, pursuant to which the Bonds will be issued and secured; and

189



~December Meeting, 2013-Appendix

WHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Authorized Officers to negotiate the sale of the
Bonds with one or more underwriters or groups of underwriters to be selected by an Authorized Officer
(collectively, the "Underwriter") and to enter into one or more bond purchase agreements (collectively,
the "Bond Purchase Agreement") setting forth the terms and conditions upon which the Underwriter will
agree to purchase the Bonds and the interest rates thereof and the purchase price therefor, or, in the
alternative, to select the Underwriter for all or any portion of any series of Bonds and to establish the
terms for such Bonds through a competitive sale or bidding process pursuant to a Notice of Sale; and
WHEREAS, in order to be able to market the Bonds at the most opportune time, it is necessary
for the Issuer to authorize the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Associate Vice
President for Finance and the Treasurer (each an "Authorized Officer"), or any one of them individually,
to negotiate, execute and deliver on behalf of the Issuer, the Trust Agreement, the Bond Purchase
Agreement, one or more remarketing agreements with the Underwriter or other parties (collectively, the
"Remarketing Agreement"), and other related documents, to publish any Notice of Sale required for the
sale of any portion of the Bonds, to establish the specific terms of the Bonds and to accept the offer of the
Underwriter to purchase the Bonds, all within the limitations set forth herein; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has full power under its constitutional authority for supervision of the
University, and control and direction of expenditures from the University's funds, to acquire, construct,
furnish and equip the Project and to pay all or a portion of the costs of the Project and the costs of
refunding the Bonds to be Refunded and the Notes to be Refunded by issuance of the Bonds, and to
pledge General Revenues for payment of the Bonds as provided for herein.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. The Issuer hereby approves the definition of the term "Project" as set forth on Exhibit A attached
hereto, and authorizes the Authorized Officers, or any of them, to determine the specific amount of the
cost of each component of the Project to be financed from the proceeds of the Bonds, provided, however,
that no proceeds of the Bonds will be used to finance a component of the Project listed in Category II of
Exhibit A attached hereto until final approval of such Project component is given by the Issuer. Subject
to the Issuer's policies regarding approvals of capital projects, any Authorized Officer may subsequently
approve additional components of the Project and specify that such additional components shall be
financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of the Bonds, upon which occurrence such components
shall thereupon become components of the Project hereunder. The Issuer further approves the refunding
of the Bonds to be Refunded and the Notes to be Refunded and authorizes the Authorized Officers, or any
of them, to select the portion, if any, of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds to constitute the Bonds
to be Refunded and the portion, if any, of the Notes to constitute the Notes to be Refunded, in order to
produce interest or other cost savings, a more favorable debt service structure, a more stable interest rate
structure, more flexible documentation or a more favorable security structure, or to provide for permanent
financing of projects previously financed with short-term debt, and to fund, if deemed appropriate, a
portion of the costs of the refunding from available funds of the Issuer and the balance of such costs with
the proceeds of the Bonds, and to proceed with the refunding.
2. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Bonds in one or more series
to be designated GENERAL REVENUE BONDS, with appropriate series designations, if any, in the
aggregate original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but not to exceed the
principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of ONE HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS
($110,000,000) for the payment of the costs of the Project and the costs of issuance of the Bonds, plus the
amount, if any, required to refund the Bonds to be Refunded and the Notes to be Refunded and to pay
costs related thereto. The Bonds shall be dated as of the date or dates established by an Authorized
Officer, and shall be issued for the purpose of providing funds which, together with other available funds,
will be used to pay all or a portion of the costs of the Project, all or a portion of the costs of refunding the
Bonds to be Refunded, if any, and the Notes to be Refunded, if any, and all or a portion of the costs
related to the issuance of the Bonds and the refunding, including capitalized interest, if any, for such
period as an Authorized Officer may determine appropriate, and bond insurance premiums, if appropriate.
The Bonds shall be serial bonds or term bonds, which may be subject to redemption requirements, or

190



~December Meeting, 2013-Appendix

both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first maturity shall be no earlier than April
1, 2015 and the last maturity shall be no later than December 31, 2045. The Bonds may bear no interest
or may bear interest at stated fixed rates for the respective maturities thereof as shall be established by an
Authorized Officer, but the weighted average yield (computed using the stated coupons and the stated
original offering price) for the Bonds shall not exceed 7.0% per annum for tax-exempt Bonds or 11.0%
per annum for taxable Bonds, and the Bonds may be issued in whole or in part as capital appreciation
bonds, which for their term or any part thereof bear no interest but appreciate in principal amount over
time at compounded rates (not in excess of 7.0% per annum for tax-exempt Bonds or 11.0% per annum
for taxable Bonds) to be determined by an Authorized Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds
may bear interest at a variable rate of interest for all or a portion of their term, at indexed or market
established rates or any combination thereof, and the variable rate of interest shall not exceed the lesser of
the maximum rate permitted by law or the maximum rate, if any, to be specified in the Trust Agreement.
The Bonds may be subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the times and prices and
in the manner as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but no redemption premium shall exceed
3% of the principal amount being redeemed unless the redemption price is based on a "make whole"
formula, in which case no redemption premium shall exceed 40% of the principal amount being
redeemed. Interest on the Bonds shall be payable at such times as shall be specified by an Authorized
Officer. The Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form in denominations, shall be payable as to
principal and interest in the manner, shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be executed and
authenticated, all as shall be provided in the Trust Agreement. The Bonds shall be sold to the
Underwriter pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement or through a competitive sale or bidding process
pursuant to a Notice of Sale for a price to be established by an Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's
discount, exclusive of original issue discount, shall not exceed 1.50% of the principal amount thereof)
plus accrued interest, if any, from the dated date of the Bonds to the date of delivery thereof.
Any or all of the Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the option of the holder thereof or
to mandatory tender for purchase. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any Bonds subject to tender
for purchase may be limited to remarketing proceeds of the Bonds, or may be made payable from General
Revenues (as defined in Section 3 below), from available cash reserves of the University, subject to such
limitations as may be specified in the Trust Agreement, or from, directly or as support for the cash
reserves, a letter of credit, line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity device, or
one or more of the same, or any combination thereof (collectively, the "Liquidity Device"), all as shall be
determined by an Authorized Officer. The Liquidity Device, or any part thereof, may also be used to
provide liquidity for any other indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer, including the Notes and the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds. Any reimbursement obligation for draws under the Liquidity
Device shall be a limited and not a general obligation of the Issuer, payable from, and may be secured by
a pledge of, General Revenues (as defined in Section 3 below). Any Authorized Officer is authorized to
execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any agreements or instruments necessary to obtain,
maintain, renew or replace, and provide for repayments under, any Liquidity Device deemed by such
officer to be required for the purposes of this Resolution.
Any Bonds authorized and issued hereunder may, at any time, upon direction of an Authorized Officer,
be subsequently converted to another mode or structure authorized hereby, either through procedures
established in the Trust Agreement pertaining thereto, or through the issuance hereunder of refunding
bonds to refund and replace the outstanding Bonds to be converted. Any such refunding bonds issued
hereunder shall be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Resolution. Any
Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any documents or
instruments, including but not limited to, any amendments to the Trust Agreement, necessary or
convenient for the purpose of accomplishing the conversion as described in this paragraph.
In connection with the refunding of all or any portions of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, any
Authorized Officer may, in the name and on behalf of the Issuer, and as its corporate act and deed,
modify any of the Existing Swap Agreements, in whole or in part, and relate any of such Existing Swap
Agreements to any portion of the debt service on the Bonds or any Outstanding General Revenue Bonds,
or terminate any Existing Swap Agreements, in whole or in part, and any fees or termination payments
required in connection with any such modifications or terminations may be paid from proceeds of the
Bonds, or from available funds of the Issuer, as determined by an Authorized Officer.

191



~December Meeting, 2013-Appendix

In relation to the debt service on all or any portion of the Bonds, or in relation to debt service on all or
any portion of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, any of the Authorized Officers may, at any time,
on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into or modify an interest rate swap, cap, forward starting
swap, option, swaption, rate lock or similar agreement or agreements (collectively, the "Swap
Agreement") with a counter-party or counter-parties selected or to be selected by the Authorized Officer.
Such Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the Issuer and the counter-party related to
interest on all or a portion of the Bonds or the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, at indexed or market
established rates. If the Swap Agreement is entered into at approximately the same time as the issuance
of the Bonds and is related to the Bonds, the expected effective interest rates on the Bonds to which the
Swap Agreement relates, taking into account the effect of the Swap Agreement, shall be within the
limitations set forth herein. Any Swap Agreement may, if determined necessary or appropriate by an
Authorized Officer, be subsequently terminated, in whole or in part, which may result in termination
payments due by the Issuer. Any such required payments and other costs of termination may be funded
from available funds of the Issuer or the proceeds of the Bonds or other indebtedness of the Issuer.
3. The Bonds, and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement, if any, and the Liquidity
Device, if any, shall be limited and not general obligations of the Issuer payable from and, except as
provided below in this Section 3, secured by a lien on, the General Revenues (as shall be defined in the
Trust Agreement in a manner generally consistent with the definition thereof contained in the Trust
Agreements pursuant to which the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds were issued). Except as
otherwise determined by an Authorized Officer, as provided below in this Section 3, the lien on General
Revenues shall be on a parity basis with the lien on General Revenues securing the Notes and the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds. The Bonds and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap
Agreement, if any, and the Liquidity Device, if any, may also be payable from and secured by a lien on
moneys, securities or other investments from time to time on deposit in certain funds created pursuant to
the Trust Agreement or agreements entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement or Liquidity
Device.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount of or interest or premium on the Bonds,
or for the payment of any amounts owing under the Swap Agreement, if any, or the Liquidity Device, if
any, or any claim based thereon, against the State of Michigan, or any member, officer or agent of the
Issuer or the University, as individuals, either directly or indirectly, nor, except as specifically provided in
the Trust Agreement or the instruments entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or
the Liquidity Device, if any, against the Issuer, nor shall the Bonds and interest with respect thereto, or
any obligations of the Issuer in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or the Liquidity Device, if
any, become a lien on or be secured by any property, real, personal or mixed, of the State of Michigan or
the Issuer, other than the General Revenues and the moneys, securities or other investments from time to
time on deposit in all or part of the funds established by the Trust Agreement or the agreements entered
into in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or the Liquidity Device, if any.
Any pledge of General Revenues, and funds specified in the Trust Agreement or agreements entered into
in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or Liquidity Device, if any, shall be valid and binding
from the date of the issuance and delivery of the Bonds or such agreements, and all moneys or properties
subject thereto which are thereafter received shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without
physical delivery or further act. The lien of said pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties
(other than the holders of any outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations secured by a parity first lien
on General Revenues) having a claim in tort, contract or otherwise against the Issuer, irrespective of
whether such parties have notice of the lien.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement
or the Liquidity Device may, if determined appropriate by an Authorized Officer, be payable and secured
on a subordinated basis to the Bonds and other General Revenue obligations of the Issuer, or may be
payable from General Revenues but be unsecured.
4. The right is reserved to issue additional bonds, notes or other obligations payable from General
Revenues and secured on a parity or subordinated basis with the Bonds by a lien on General Revenues,
upon compliance with the terms and conditions, if any, as shall be set forth in the Trust Agreement.

192

as its corporate act and deed, to select the Trustee, and to negotiate, execute and deliver the Trust
Agreement. The Trust Agreement may contain such covenants on behalf of the Issuer and terms as such
officers deem appropriate, including, if deemed appropriate, but not limited to, covenants with respect to

obligations payable from and secured by General Revenues. In addition, any Authorized Officer is

for all or any portion of any series of the Bonds may be made through a competitive sale or bidding
process. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to accept the winning bid or offer of the Underwriter for
the purchase of such Bonds. Any Authorized Officer is further authorized and directed, in the name and
on behalf of the Issuer and as its corporate act and deed, to negotiate, execute and deliver the
Remarketing Agreement with the Underwriter or other party selected by the Authorized Officer.

its corporate act and deed, to execute the Bonds by placing his or her facsimile or manual signature
thereon, and to deliver or cause to be delivered the Bonds to the Underwriter in exchange for the purchase
price therefor.
8. Any Authorized Officer is hereby authorized to solicit ratings on the Bonds from any national rating
services that the Authorized Officer deems appropriate and to cause the preparation of one or more
Preliminary Official Statements, if necessary, and to deem such Preliminary Official Statements "final" in
accordance with applicable law, and to cause the preparation of one or more Official Statements with
respect to the Bonds, and to execute and deliver the Official Statements. In the event that all or any
portion of any series of the Bonds is to be sold by means of a competitive sale or bidding process, as

published, or otherwise distribute, in such manner as an Authorized Officer shall determine, a Notice of
Sale for such Bonds. Any Authorized Officer or the Underwriter is authorized to circulate and use, in
accordance with applicable law, the Notice of Sale, if any, the Preliminary Official Statements, if any,
and the Official Statements in connection with the offering, marketing and sale of the Bonds.
9. The President, the Authorized Officers, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary, the Vice President and
General Counsel and any associate general counsel, and any other appropriate officer of the Issuer or the
University are hereby authorized to perform all acts and deeds and to execute and deliver for and on
behalf of the Issuer all instruments and documents required by this resolution, the Trust Agreement, the
Remarketing Agreement, the Swap Agreement, the Liquidity Device or the Bond Purchase Agreement, or
necessary, expedient and proper in connection with the issuance, sale and delivery of the Bonds, as

The regents did not convene for a formal meeting during the month of January
2014.

~JANUARY SPECIAL MEETING, 2014

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
January 24, 2014
The regents met at 10:00 a.m. in the Kuenzel Room at the Michigan Union.
Present were President Coleman and Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Deitch, Diggs, Ilitch,
Newman, Richner and White.
President Coleman called the meeting to order, saying that this was a special
meeting of the Board of Regents called at the request of all board members. She then
turned the proceedings over to Regent Andrea Fischer Newman, chair of the Board of
Regents.
Regent Newman began by welcoming to the meeting Dr. Mark Schlissel and his
wife Monica Schwebs. She continued, saying:
The Michigan Constitution provides that 'the board of regents shall have general
supervision of its institution and the control and direction of all expenditures from the
institution's funds.' The Board of Regents 'shall, as often as necessary, elect a president of the
institution, under its supervision. He shall be the principal executive officer of the institution, be
ex-officio a member of the board, without the right to vote, and preside at meetings of the
board.' The Regents take this constitutional duty seriously. As the current chair of the Board of
Regents, and as a member of the Presidential Advisory Search Committee, I am pleased to
announce that we have completed the search process and have identified one finalist for election
as the 14th President of the University of Michigan. As befits a decision of this magnitude, the
process of getting to this happy moment has been long, intense and involved. We have dug deep
and our efforts have borne great fruit. On July 18, 2013, the regents announced the
appointment of a Presidential Search Advisory Committee that included the entire board of
regents and a truly outstanding set of faculty members. Not surprisingly, a superb set of
candidates wished to lead this superlative institution. Through this process we have found a
leader to follow in the footsteps of the 13 great presidents of this most wonderful institution, the
most recent being our current President, Mary Sue Coleman. Like those who came before, our
new President will start with a great foundation and take the University to even greater heights.
Before we elect our new President I want to begin by thanking my colleagues on the
Board of Regents for their hard work and for the collegial manner in which this search process
was conducted. This was not an easy or simple deliberation. But as always, in the end, what
unites us is our love for this wonderful institution, and our desire to see it flourish. I also want
to personally thank the faculty members of the Presidential Advisory Search Committee and
know that one of my colleagues will talk more about them later. This powerhouse group of
distinguished faculty played a vital role in the selection process and served as vital
representatives of the faculty as a whole. Thank you for your services. I would next like to
thank President Mary Sue Coleman. There will be plenty of time to celebrate Mary Sue for her
tremendous service to the university over the next months, but as we look forward to the future
with our new President, we must also stop to cherish and remember where we have been. Thank
you Mary Sue. Before I turn the floor over to Regent Ilitch, I also want to thank everyone who
came to the six public outreach meetings sponsored by the Regents to hear from the community,
particularly the many students who attend the various forums. We heard your message, we
heard your passion, and we greatly appreciate your input. I can tell you without any doubt,
your concerns were a driving force in our deliberations.

199



~January Special Meeting, 2014

This is an exciting time for the University of Michigan, and Iam confident that our next
president will lead the University into its next century focused on our deepest ideals of world
class academic excellence and public impact. I now turn the floor over to Regent Ilitch.
Comments from Regent Denise Ilitch
The presidential search process was a first for me. It was an extremely rewarding and
enriching experience. What a privilege to meet so many devoted higher education professionals
that are committed to providing academic excellence and preparing the world's future leaders.
Dr. Schlissel's qualifications are unquestionable and so in situations such as this, the selection
falls on character, values and fit. What set Dr. Schlissel apart from the other highly qualified
candidates for me was his heart. As a parent first and foremost, I am confident that Dr.
Schlissel will lead with our students' welfare as his top priority. He understands our mission
and will work tirelessly to continue our academic and research excellence, our passionate desire
for access and affordability and a learning environment that is inclusive and promotes diversity.
It is a rare combination to find a leader who brings compassion and kindness with brains and
brawn! Welcome to the University of Michigan! I also want to acknowledge and welcome a
talented lawyer in her own right, Monica Schwebs. It is my privilege to offer the following
resolution:
Nomination of President
On behalf of the Presidential Search Committee and the
Presidential Search Advisory Committee, and pursuant to Article VIII,
Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution, and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of a certain letter agreement that has been previously
agreed upon, with its effectiveness being subject to approval and
ratification at this meeting, I enthusiastically present the finalist, and
hereby nominate Dr. Mark Schlissel as the 14th President of the
University of Michigan. The letter agreement will be attached to the
minutes of this meeting.
The motion was seconded by Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Deitch, Diggs,
Newman, Richner and White.

Comments from Regent Katherine E. White
As part of the Presidential Search Process, the Presidential Search Advisory Committee
engaged in listening sessions with our communities on all three campuses: Ann Arbor, Flint and
Dearborn. We met with faculty, staff, students and alumni. Throughout this process we learned

200



~January Special Meeting, 2014

a great deal about what qualities, experiences, and values you desire in the next President of the
University of Michigan. In particular, I want to recognize the Central Student Government
University Council Committee for consolidating the student perspectives in an outstanding
report that provided us much guidance throughout our process. Thanks, again, to CSG
President Mike Proppe and Vice President Bobby Dishell for your exceptional leadership
through this process.
The Presidential Search Advisory Committee heard many concerns about affordability
and the cost of attendance at the University of Michigan, concerns about having a diverse
campus across all levels, faculty, staff, and students, but also to promote a climate that fosters
inclusion so that our faculty, staff and students can thrive.
Top of mind was also the need for fundraising efforts to positively impact each and
every student. Importantly, we also heard from graduate students who have unique concerns
separate from those of undergraduates. At the Flint and Dearborn campuses, we heard about
the desire for deeper collaboration, engagement, partnerships, and leveraging of resources
across and between the campuses. Throughout this process, your voices have been heard. And,
most importantly, the listening continues.
I am pleased to report that, in addition to being a thoughtful leader with extraordinary
experience in higher education at the highest levels, President-Elect Mark Schlissel is an
outstanding listener. He has demonstrated that he listens and solicits input from the campus
community, including fostering a diverse and inclusive campus environment. He is recognized
as a highly rated scholar and teacher. Having both an M.D. and a Ph.D., he has experience at
the lab bench. He has won numerous awards as a researcher and teacher. He has experience as
an academic administrator at virtually every level, except as President, and we are fixing that
right now.  We look forward to our continued conversations as the listening continues. I
welcome you, Dr. Schlissel, and your extraordinarily talented wife Monica Schwebs, to
Michigan.
Comments from Regent Laurence B. Deitch
My colleagues honored me with the privilege and responsibility of coordinating the
work of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee and the Presidential Search Committee on

process. Everyone involved was deeply committed and did a spectacular job. The Board all
know that we would not have been able to recruit the distinguished leader that we have
presented today without the active involvement and guidance of our faculty colleagues. I would
like to acknowledge them by name:

Comments from Regent Mark J. Bernstein
Today is a great day for the University of Michigan. We go today from strength to
strength, from one great leader, Mary Sue Coleman, to Dr. Schlissel. Mark's journey from
Brooklyn to Ann Arbor, through Princeton, Johns Hopkins, and MIT, UC-Berkeley, and then
Brown, is a uniquely American story about opportunity and achievement. It is one that is
familiar to this University where we are also passionate about the transformative power of high
education. We know Mark shares this passion.
At the very first interview he was asked, 'What are the qualities of a great president?'
He said, "You have to love and be amazed by students. You have to love and be amazed by
faculty, and you have to love and be amazed by research and discovery."  I know that we all
agree with you, and those indeed are the qualities of a great president. It is a great privilege
and honor to serve together with you as you take the helm of this great University.
Comments from Regent Julia Donovan Darlow
I want to take a minute to express our appreciation to Mary Sue Coleman for her role
in creating a near perfect environment for our recruitment of a new President. While we will
have many opportunities to thank her for her extraordinary contributions to this university but I
wanted to note that she gave us the luxury of time to do our work as thoroughly and carefully as
possible. She also gave us the luxury of choosing among a splendid group of eager brilliant
candidates because of the great stature, excellence and stability that this institution has achieved
under her leadership.
As to the wonderful incoming president presented today, I believe that Mark's deeply
probing, visionary mind; his commitment to the values this University cherishes, including
diversity, access, and public education; his compassionate nature; and the breadth and depth of
his experience will enable this greatest of public universities to preserve its heritage and to meet
the challenges of the future at the highest level.
Comments from Regent Shauna Ryder Diggs
When we began our search process for our new President in March, we began with an
introspective assessment of our needs and discussed our goals. We desired a university
achieving academic excellence in our undergraduate colleges, graduate programs and
professional schools, and research; a university that continues to attracting bright youth with
drive and intellectual curiosity and then enabling them to join our community regardless of
socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, circumstance or lack of opportunity; a university
providing a supportive educational and social environment for those very students with an
accepting and encouraging culture on campus, and with resources available; a university
attracting innovative, accomplished faculty and supporting their teaching and research efforts
within their disciplines and interdisciplinary; a university practicing fiscal responsibility
respecting the investments by our students, their families, our state and our donors, allowing
monies to be spent towards our primary academic mission; and a university contributing to
knowledge and translating it into health, economic, and social benefits for citizens of our city,
our state, our nation and the world.
We desired a president who would articulate a vision and develop a strategy to
accomplish it. We found this person in our next President, Dr. Mark Schlissel. He is an
academic scholar, a thoughtful and strategic leader, and an empathetic, contemplative person. I
personally welcome another physician to our team, and I am proud to have him lead us into the
future. Welcome Dr. Schlissel and Monica Schwebs.

Comments from Regent Andrew C. Richner
In Mark Schlissel, we have found a brilliant academic leader who has the vision to
build on the University of Michigan's standing as one of the world's great institutions of higher
education. Mark understands and embraces the mission of our public research university and
the important role it plays in the future lives of our students and in the future of our state. He is
superbly qualified to guide us into our third century. We welcome Mark and Monica, and look
forward to working with him.
Regent Newman called for a vote on the motion, and the regents unanimously
approved the appointment Dr. Mark Schlissel as the 14h President of the University of
Michigan.
Comments from President Mary Sue Coleman
I want to join in the tremendous enthusiasm about the naming of Mark Schlissel as the
university's 14th president. I'm thrilled they picked another biochemist! I also want to thank the
Presidential Search Committee and the faculty of the Search Advisory Committee for their
thoughtful, diligent work.
Dr. Schlissel, welcome to a university unlike any other. You will find the Michigan
community to be engaging, thoughtful, energetic and impassioned about making a difference.
More than any characteristic, it is a community of academic excellence. Our students, faculty,
staff and alumni have a profound affection for this institution, which I am certain you yourself
will come to embrace.
When the University's first president, Henry Philip Tappan, laid out his vision for
Michigan, he described a 'great center of intellectual activity, and a fountain of learning open to
the whole populace.' That vision has been realized again and again.
In addition to leading an exceptional university, you and your wife, Monica, are joining
a remarkable community and state - both of which look to the University of Michigan for ideas,
solutions and talent. I have often said that being president of the University of Michigan is the
best job in the country. I could not be more pleased to know that you, as the 14th president, will
soon experience this firsthand. Again, welcome and Go Blue.
Comments from President-Elect Mark Schlissel
I am honored to be chosen to lead a jewel of the American educational system. The
University of Michigan is held in high regard throughout the academy. The students you train
here are leaders around the world. The doctoral students you train populate the academy,
perhaps more so than any other university. It's beyond a privilege and an honor. I also want to
thank and point out the role of both the Presidential Search Advisory Committee and the Regents
played in this process. It was obvious to me from the very first meeting that everyone here is
passionate about Michigan. There are different views, but the common denominator is a deep
level of commitment to the institution, to its students and faculty, to its legacy and future. This
made it attractive for me to come and join the Regents in partnership, and join the faculty as a
colleague. I hope to spend the coming months getting to know you, learning about the
institution and working together to develop ideas that build upon the great success of President
Coleman for the years ahead. Thank you for coming today, and Go Blue!

~JANUARY SPECIAL MEETING, 2014 - APPENDIX

Dr. Mark S. Schlissel
Dear Mark:
On behalf of the Regents of the University of Michigan ("Regents"), we are pleased to confirm the terms
and conditions of your employment by the University of Michigan (the "University") as President as
follows:
1. Term. Your employment with the University will commence on July 1, 2014. The term of your
appointment as President will commence on or after July 1, 2014 (but in no event later than August 1,
2014), on a date selected by the Regents in their sole discretion; provided that, during the period (if any)
from July 1, 2014 to the effective date of your appointment as President (the "Effective Date"), the terms
of this Agreement shall apply as though you had commenced your appointment as President on July 1,
2014, and during such period you shall have the title as President Elect with such duties as mutually
agreed upon by you and the Regents. Your appointment as President will end on June 30, 2019, subject
to earlier termination as provided herein. The parties may extend the term of your appointment by mutual
written agreement.
2. Your Duties. Your duties as President of the University shall include all of the duties normally
attendant to the position of President of a university and an institution of higher education of the type and
size of the University and such other executive duties and responsibilities as may be assigned to you from
time to time by or under authority of the Regents. You will report to the Regents. You will devote
substantially all of your business and academic time and attention and your best efforts, skill and ability
to promote the interests of the University, carry out your duties in a competent and professional manner
and work with other employees of the University in a cooperative and professional manner. Your
conduct and comportment shall at all times during your employment be consistent with preserving and
promoting the dignity and reputation of the University and your office. You may give speeches and
publish articles in accordance with University policy. You may serve on one (1) for-profit corporate
board and on charitable and academic boards, but all subject to the prior written approval of the Regents
and only so long as such activities in the aggregate do not interfere with the performance of your duties to
the University. If at any time the Regents notify you that your service on any such board is interfering
with your duties or is otherwise inconsistent with your position with the University, you shall resign from
such board as promptly as reasonably possible. If you serve on the board of any entity that does business
with the University, you shall promptly disclose this information to the Regents in writing and take
appropriate steps in accordance with the University policies to recuse yourself on such matters.
3. Tenured Academic Appointment. In addition to being appointed as President, you will be appointed
to a tenured position on the University faculty in a department to be mutually agreed upon by the
University and you. During your appointment as President, you may teach a course if you so desire, but
shall have no obligation to each.
4. Compensation. (a) You will receive an annual base salary ("Base Salary") for the term of your
employment as President under this Agreement at a rate of $750,000, payable in installments in
accordance with the University's customary payment practices, and subject to withholding and
deductions required by law or authorized. Your Base Salary will be subject to annual review for increase
by the Regents commencing July 1, 2015. You and the Regents shall develop a mutually acceptable
annual review process. Such process shall establish goals and shall monitor progress toward the
attainment of such goals; provided, however, that the Regents shall retain the right, in their sole
discretion, to grant or not grant an increase in your Base Salary in any particular year.

205



~January Special Meeting, 2014-Appendix

(b) During the term of your employment as President, you will be eligible to earn a retention incentive
(the "Retention Incentive"), credited to you in installments of $100,000 each on June 30 of each of the
years 2015 through 2019, subject to your continuous employment as President of the University through
the applicable crediting date. The Retention Incentive shall vest and become payable on June 30, 2019,
provided that you are employed as President of the University on such date. The amount of the Retention
Incentive will be adjusted from crediting until payout for any earnings and losses based on your selection
of investment measurement factors from those made available by the University. In the event of your
termination as President for Disability, death or by the Regents without Cause, you (or your estate in the
case of your death) shall be paid, in a lump sum promptly after such termination (but in no event later
than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such termination occurs), any
Retention Incentive credited to you on or prior to the date of such termination (subject to adjustment in
accordance with this Section 4(b)) through the date of termination as President). In the event of any other
termination of your service as President prior to June 30, 2019, you shall not be entitled to the Retention
Incentive and it shall be forfeited.
(c) The University's obligations as to the Retention Incentive shall be an unfunded and unsecured
promise to pay money in the future. Your right to receive it shall be no greater than the right of any
unsecured general creditor of the University. You shall have no right to transfer, assign or otherwise
encumber any portion of the Retention Incentive and any attempt to do so shall be null and void.
5. Other Benefits. You shall be entitled to participate in the employee benefit plans offered to the
University's employees generally (e.g., retirement, health, life, long-term disability and other insured and
uninsured benefits programs). Your participation in such plans shall be subject to the terms of the
applicable plan, applicable law and the University's policies. In addition, you shall be entitled to an
annual supplemental contribution to the University's Section 403(b) plan, in an amount equal to $20,000
(prorated for any partial calendar year). Nothing in this Section 6 shall limit the University's right to
modify or terminate any of its employee benefit plans at any time.
6. Vacation. You shall be entitled to paid vacation in accordance with the terms of the University's
vacation policy as in effect from time to time at such times as shall be agreed upon by you and the
Regents.
7. Expense Allowance. The University shall reimburse you in accordance with the University's normal
policies and practices for reasonable travel (at a level commensurate with your position), business, and
entertainment expenses you incur in connection with your performance of your duties under this
Agreement. The University will provide you with the use of an automobile for business and personal use
in accordance with University policies, and you shall have the use of a driver from the University's pool
of drivers when appropriate, in accordance with University policy.
8. University Housing. As a condition of your employment as President and for the University's
convenience, you shall be required to reside in the President's house on the University's campus (the
"House") during the term of your service as President. To the extent renovations to the House have not
been completed as of the Effective Date or the House remains occupied by the current President, the
University shall provide you with temporary housing until such renovations are complete. The University
will furnish the House, including family areas therein, to the extent you elect not to use your own
furniture. The University shall be responsible for upkeep and cleaning services related to the House in
accordance with University policies. The University will reimburse you for reasonable moving expenses
(in accordance with University policies) you incur in connection with moving an automobile, furniture,
clothing and personal effects to the House from both your east and west coast residences, and shall
provide you with a tax gross-up for such reimbursement to the extent such reimbursement is not tax
deductible to you so that you have no after tax costs. You shall promptly vacate the House upon
termination of your appointment as President for any reason.
9. Post-Presidency Employment and Other Matters. (a) Upon the termination of your appointment as
President (other than for Cause, death or Disability), on or after June 30, 2019, you shall be entitled to

206



~January Special Meeting, 2014-Appendix

take a one (1) year sabbatical immediately following the termination of such appointment, during which
you shall continue to receive your then-current Base Salary and University benefits (but not any retention
amounts or supplemental 403(b) payment). The sabbatical shall be subject to the terms of the
University's sabbatical policy as may be in effect from time to time, including as to activities and intent
to return to the University in your tenured position. If you cease to serve as President prior to June 30,
2019, Sections 10 and 11 below will apply to your rights, if any, to a sabbatical.
(b) Following the completion of your sabbatical, you shall have the responsibilities commensurate with
your position as a tenured professor, as well as transitional and fundraising responsibilities consistent
with your status as a former President. Your salary and benefits shall be commensurate with that of a
senior faculty member, as determined in accordance with the applicable compensation policies of the
University as may be in effect from time to time but in no event will such salary be less than $255,000
per year; provided, that, if you remain continuously employed as President of the University through June
30, 2019, your salary during the first year following the completion of your sabbatical shall be no less
than fifty percent (50%) of your Base Salary as President; and provided, further, that if your appointment
as President is terminated by the University without Cause prior to June 30, 2019, your salary during the
first year following the completion of your sabbatical shall be equal to your Base Salary as President.
(c) Upon (i) the termination of your appointment as President on or after June 30, 2019, or (ii) the
termination of your appointment as President by the University without Cause before June 30, 2019, the
University will make appropriate laboratory space and up to $2 million (the "Start-Up Fund") available
for the establishment of a biological laboratory at the University for your use as a tenured faculty member
after termination of your appointment as President. Additionally, during the pendency of your
Presidency, the University shall pay the cost of storing certain research materials in the "freezer farm" at
Brown University or an equivalent substitute location. The cost of such storage will be deducted from the
Start-Up Fund.
10. Termination for Death, Disability or Cause. (a) If, during the term of your employment, you have
not been able to perform your duties as President for 180 days (including weekends and holidays) in any
365 day period, or you are projected in good faith by the Regents after seeking medical advice to be
unable to perform your duties under this Agreement for 180 consecutive days, in either case by reason of
your physical or mental illness or incapacity, the University may, immediately upon notice to you,
terminate your employment as President for Disability. Your employment as a tenured faculty member
will be in accordance with the tenure policies then in effect. Your employment with the University shall
automatically terminate upon your death. In the event of your termination as President for Disability and
you continue as a tenured faculty member, you shall receive the Retention Incentive as provided herein
upon termination as President and all other amounts and benefits shall continue or be terminated as
provided under the applicable University plan or policy, except as specifically provided otherwise in this
Agreement. In such event you shall not be entitled to the sabbatical. If you continue as a tenured faculty
member after your termination as President for Disability, your right to a sabbatical shall not arise until
the later of you having recovered and are ready to rejoin the faculty and July 1, 2019. In the event of
your termination as a result of your death or you also terminate as a tenured faculty member as a result of
your Disability, the Retention Incentive shall be paid as provided herein and all other amounts and
benefits shall be paid or provided in accordance with the applicable University plans or policies, except as
specifically provided otherwise herein, and you shall not be entitled to any sabbatical.
(b) The Regents may terminate your employment as President for Cause immediately upon notice to you.
As used in this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean: (i) your failure to attempt in good faith to perform your
duties or follow the legal direction of the Regents, which in either case is not cured, if curable, within ten
(10) days after your receipt of written notice of such failure; (ii) your material breach of this Agreement,
which if not cured, if curable, within ten (10) days after your receipt of written notice of such breach; (iii)
your willful misconduct, including, but not limited to, acts of fraud or misappropriation of University
funds or assets, or gross negligence with respect to the University or in the performance of your duties;
(iv) your violation of any material University policy, including those as to discrimination, sexual
harassment or use of public funds; (v) your misconduct not with regard to the University or the
performance of your duties which has or could have, in the good faith judgment of the Regents, more

207



~January Special Meeting, 2014-Appendix

than a de minimis adverse effect on the University (economic or reputational) or on your ability to
perform your duties; or (vi) your conviction of, indictment for, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to,
any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony. Upon your termination as President for Cause, the
University shall have no further obligation to you (or your estate), other than accrued salary and similar
accrued amounts for the period prior to termination in accordance with the University policies and
programs or as otherwise required by applicable law. In the event such Cause termination is not also
Cause under the University's tenure policies, you shall have your rights as a tenured faculty member.
11.  Other Termination.  (a) At the discretion of the Regents, the University may terminate your
employment at any time without Cause upon written notice to you. In the event of your termination
without Cause, you will be entitled to take a sabbatical and join the faculty in accordance with Section 9
hereof and shall be entitled to the Retention Incentive in accordance with, and subject to, Section 4(b)
hereof.
(b) You may voluntarily terminate your employment as President upon six (6) months' notice, which
termination date the University may accelerate at the discretion of the Regents. If you voluntarily
terminate your employment prior to June 30, 2019, you will forfeit any Retention Incentive, and you will
be entitled to join the faculty in accordance with Section 9 hereof and will be entitled to a sabbatical after
June 30, 2019 in accordance with University policy.
12. Restrictive Covenants. (a) During your employment with the University and for a period of one (1)
year thereafter, you agree that you shall not, except in the furtherance of your duties to the University,
directly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person, firm, university, corporation or other
entity, (i) solicit, aid or induce any employee, representative or agent of the University or any of its

You agree to promptly inform the University if you become aware of any lawsuits involving such claims
that may be filed or threatened against the University or its affiliates. You also agree to promptly inform
the University (to the extent that you are legally permitted to do so) if you are asked to assist in any

21. Taxes and Section 475(f). (a) The University will withhold appropriate federal, state and city taxes,
including employment taxes, on salary and any benefits that are determined to be subject to tax
withholding.
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if all or any portion of the Retention Incentive
Payout becomes subject to federal, state, or local taxation as a result of vesting, as determined under Code
Section 475(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") prior to the date on which
the amount that is subject to taxation is scheduled to be paid (i) the University shall pay to the Employee
in the year in which the taxation event occurs, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the income and
payroll withholding that would have been remitted by the University if there had been a payment of
wages to the Employee equal to the income includible by the Employee under Section 475(f) of the Code
(such lump sum, the "475(f) Tax Payment"), and (ii) any subsequent payment of such amounts shall be
reduced by the amount of the 475(f) Tax Payment. Any decision as to whether the Employee is subject to
taxation at a particular time for purposes of this Section 21 shall be made by the University in good faith
after consultation with you. The University shall have no liability to the Employee for an improper
determination or an improper estimate.
22. Section 409A. This Agreement is intended to be in compliance with, or to be exempt from, Section
409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code Section 409A") and shall be
interpreted accordingly. Any term used in this Agreement which is defined in Code Section 409A or the
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Regulations") shall have the meaning set forth therein unless
otherwise specifically defined herein. Any obligations under this Agreement that arise in connection with
your "termination of employment", "termination" or other similar references shall only be triggered if the
termination of employment or termination qualifies as a "separation from service" within the meaning of
~1.409A-1(h) of the Regulations, provided that termination of your appointment as President shall not
require a separation from service. If any expense reimbursement, fringe benefit or other arrangement
under this Agreement is determined to be "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Code Section
409A, (i) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for
another benefit, (ii) the amount eligible for reimbursement or payment in one calendar year may not
affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or payment in another calendar year (except that a plan
providing medical or health benefits may impose a generally applicable limit on the amount that may be
reimbursed or paid), (iii) reimbursements shall be made to you as soon as practicable after submission for
the reimbursement, but no later than December 31 of the year following the year during which such
expense was incurred, and (iv) the reimbursements shall be made pursuant to objectively determinable
and nondiscretionary University policies and procedures regarding such reimbursement of expenses. If
under this Agreement, an amount is to be paid in two or more installments, for purposes of Code Section
409A, each installment shall be treated as a separate payment. In addition, if any provision of this
Agreement would subject you to any additional tax or interest under Code Section 409A, then the
University may reform such provision; provided that the University shall (x) maintain, to the maximum
extent practicable, the original intent of the applicable provision without subjecting you to such additional
tax or interest and (y) not incur any additional compensation expense as a result of such reformation.
Any tax gross-up payment as provided herein shall be made in any event no later than the end of the
calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Executive remits the related taxes,
and any reimbursement of expenses incurred due to a tax audit or litigation shall be made no later than the

210



~January Special Meeting, 2014-Appendix

end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the taxes that are the subject of
the audit or litigation are remitted to the taxing authority, or, if no taxes are to be remitted, the end of the
calendar year following the calendar year in which the audit or litigation is completed. In no event shall
the University be responsible for any additional tax, penalties or interest under Code Section 409A or
damages as a result of noncompliance therewith. You represent that you have been advised to consult
with your counsel or other tax advisor as to the tax implications of this Agreement, including under tax
Code Sections 409A.
23. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
24. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall
be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
25. Execution. Upon signature by you and the approved and ratification by the Regents at a public
meeting, this Agreement shall become a legally binding agreement in accordance with its terms. Until
approval and ratification by the Regents at a public meeting (which is currently scheduled to be held on

~FEBRUARY MEETING, 2014

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
February 20, 2014
The regents met at 3:10 in the Anderson Room, Michigan Union. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Deitch, Diggs, Hitch, Newman,
Richner and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Harper, Interim Vice President Hu, Chancellor Little, Vice President Lynch,
Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Provost
Pollack, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow and Vice President
Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman began by highlighting the accomplishments of UM students
participating in the Sochi Olympics. In Olympic ice dancing, juniors Meryl Davis and
Charlie White, earned gold medals. The team included the "Shib Sibs," freshman Maia
Shibutani and her brother sophomore Alex Shibutani, and also Evan Bates, who
graduated in December 2013. Three former UM hockey players competed in Sochi for
three different countries.
President Coleman noted that Governor Snyder shared his budget proposal for
higher education, which includes a six percent increase. This marks the first substantial
increase in more than a decade.
President Coleman said:
I want to take a few moments to talk about diversity and climate on campus. It is an
issue essential to the excellence of this university, and one to which I have been deeply
committed. One of my proudest moments as UM president was in 2003, when the U.S. Supreme
Court upheld our right to consider race in admissions to help create more diversity in our
student body.
At the time, many people asked why the University was taking on such a divisive issue
in such a public way. My answer was always the same: It was the right thing to do. It was a
long, difficult struggle, it was hard on many levels, and it was the right thing to do.
That we have not been able to make more progress with underrepresented minority
enrollment, along with the challenging climate and inclusion issues our community is
experiencing, deeply troubles me. We have to redouble our efforts toward a more diverse
campus. We haven't realized our collective aspirations. There is so much work to be done, and
we know that.
There is a larger conversation about race occurring across the country, prompted by
ugly incidents of racism and intolerance at other universities and, sadly, on our own campus as
well.
We hear loud and clear that students of color feel isolated and marginalized; and that
our frequently declared "commitment to diversity" is perceived as disingenuous. Students here
and elsewhere are raising real and painful concerns about campus climate and the diminishing
number of students of color in classrooms. We see the struggles many colleges are facing now,
but here at Michigan we have unique challenges that have affected us these past few years. We
have struggled in the wake of Proposal 2 and the ban on affirmative action. We know that.

213



~February Meeting, 2014

We have been conscientious as we worked within the new law's parameters and yet still
looked for lawful approaches. We reached out to colleagues at other public universities with
similar restrictions, putting their best practices into place here. But our efforts still have not
achieved what we need to achieve. Our commitment has never waned. The environment in
which we operate, however, has changed. As a public institution, we are at the confluence of
deep societal forces that affect us, from K-12 challenges to the wide range of public opinion on
inclusion, equity and race.
Michigan has been one of the public institutions to always stand its ground, knowing
that diversity is essential to our academic excellence. We also know from research that our
alumni say diversity is among the greatest assets of the university, a defining characteristic.
We haven't always gotten it right through the decades, and we've had great struggles
along the way. But the long view shows that Michigan stands for improving diversity and access
in higher education. Other universities look to us to develop new solutions, to foster national
dialogue, and to focus society's attention on this issue. That is why today's students are raising
their voices, and why so many people have filled the room today. Great struggles occur at great
universities. People expect Michigan to effect social change.
I was proud to stand on the steps of the Supreme Court for that very reason. We were
able to call the nation's attention to the value of a diverse educational environment for every
student who studies here and for our society. Those students learn how to live and work and
learn together; they create a diverse workforce, a diverse military, and a diverse academy. This
is what the University of Michigan stands for. We will continue to be engaged at many levels
and in many parts of the university as we work on both increasing minority enrollment and on
making our campus more inclusive. We have made progress in some areas, including
continuing to increase the representation of faculty of color over the past decade and making
significant progress in closing the graduation gap between undergraduate majority and minority
students. Also, Michigan ranks consistently in the "top ten" in awards of Ph.D. degrees to
minority students, including third in the number of doctorates awarded to African Americans
this past year.
In the course of the next few months, our community will see additional concrete steps.
As just some examples, we are working to ensure that all of our undergraduates receive
education that will lead to a more welcoming environment, through the new Change It Up
program. We will restore the current Trotter Multicultural Center, while identifying a central
campus site and planning for a new center. We will continue and expand our outreach efforts to
lower-income and first-generation students as one component of our effort, and we will look to
all legal approaches to recruiting and retaining a more diverse class. I want to say, too, that
members of our leadership team have had constructive discussions with students from the Black
Student Union in the last several weeks.
Our community's passion to make our commitment real for this generation, in these
times, could not be stronger. I share that concern and that passion. Our board and our
leadership team share that concern and that passion. Our new president, I know, shares that
concern and that passion. We have work to do, all of us, together. We need to recognize the
societal factors that affect our public institution; we need to work within the law and with
respect to a wide variety of opinion and belief But Michigan has long been a place where these
hard conversations have led to new ideas and new energy. I am proud this university leads in
the country with a historic commitment to diversity and the courage to face the hardest
challenges with integrity and intellectual rigor.
President Coleman turned to Regent Newman for a report about the Board's
strategic session held in New York last month.

214



~February Meeting, 2014

Comments from Regent Newman
Regent Newman provided highlights of the strategic session in New York City
in January, where the regents met with some of the top East Coast leaders in higher
education and discussed topics ranging from integrating technology into learning
environments and keeping college affordable, to maintaining academic quality and how
the Affordable Care Act will affect academic health systems. The regents met with:
Bill Bowen, president emeritus of Princeton University and former president of the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation; Peter Salovey, president of Yale University; Ed Miller,
retired executive vice president for medical affairs at Johns Hopkins University; and
Mike Johns, retired executive vice president for medical affairs at Emory University.
The regents also meet with alumni of the university during events that were part of the
Victors for Michigan campaign and spent time as a board discussing the future
direction of higher education.
Regent Newman said, "The costs for this event were modest and we've been
quite conscientious about that. We've asked the public affairs staff to provide the tally
of total expenses, which were not paid from tuition or taxpayer resources. Overall, it
was an important and intense two days of hard work. I am very pleased we were able to
make the time available for this strategic session."
Presentation: School of Music, Theatre & Dance
President Coleman introduced Christopher Kendall, dean of the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance, noting that a highlight of the New York session was an
alumni dinner with that featured a student performance.
Dean Kendall thanked the regents for the opportunity to present several student
performances representative of current initiatives. Members of the University Chamber
Choir, directed by Professor Jerry Blackstone, will tour New Zealand and Australia this
summer, thanks to a prestigious invitation to headline the National Conference of the
New Zealand Choral Federation. In addition, he spoke of the internationally celebrated
El Sistema music education program supported by President Coleman's "Third Century
Initiative." This is a joint program with the Schools of Education and Social Work.
Student violinist Zachary Ragent and pianist Nicholas Shaneyfelt performed Guitarre,
arranged by Pablo Sarasate.
Dean Kendall said that the Gershwin Initiative brings with it many
opportunities, including new courses, interdisciplinary seminars and symposia,
performances and recordings. Jazz piano student Malcolm Dean performed George
Gershwin's "A Foggy Day," which concluded with an arrangement by choral
conducting student Arianne Abela, and performed by members of the Chamber Choir.
Presentation: Sexual Assault Prevention Awareness Center
Vice President Harper introduced Holly Rider-Milkovich, director of the Sexual
Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC), who is providing institutional and
national leadership on sexual assault, prevention and awareness.
Ms. Rider-Milkovich said that like all campuses across the country, UM does
not have accurate number for campus incidences related to sexual assault. Only five

215



~February Meeting, 2014

percent of these matters are ever reported. National data shows that as many as one-infour women may experience sexual misconduct while attending UM.
In 2009 two incidences were reported to the Office of Student Conflict
Resolution, then responsible for these matters, and in 2010 three incidences were
reported. Then in 2011, the Office for Civil Rights provided new guidance to all
universities that changed the way in which these matters were addressed, from a
complainant driven model to a university driven investigative model. This resulted in
68 incidences reported. In 2012, 75 incidences were reported. This increase in reports
is a positive indicator. It means that polices are in place, there is more student
awareness of services, and there is less fear about coming forward. This means that
more students will be connected to support and will be cared for. It also means more
students will be held accountable, and get the support they need as well.
UM is a national leader in prevention measures. In 2004 President Coleman
mandated that first-year students receive sexual violence prevention education soon
after arriving on campus, a full decade before such education was mandated. Student
volunteers have facilitated much of the training provided.
She continued, saying that, unfortunately, all the efforts to improve the climate
for reporting, and creating a safer community where students who are harmed can feel
safe in coming forward, are potentially being undermined. Survivors are now choosing
to stay silent, not because of fear of not being taken seriously, and not because they
believe they might be blamed, both common barriers. They remain silent because they
don't want the terrible details of their experience available for public scrutiny.
Ms. Rider-Milkovich said that SAPAC would continue to advocate for students,
help them make the best choices possible, and continue working to ensure a safe and
just campus community.

her Ph.D. degree from Harvard University in 1974. She joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1979, and was promoted to associate
professor in 1987, and professor in 1994.
Professor Schwartz is a highly regarded investigator of hormonal regulation of
growth and metabolism. She studied the mechanisms of action of pituitary Growth
Hormone (GH), a major regulator of normal statural growth and inducer of insulin
resistance and diabetes. Her contributions span the molecular and cellular aspects of
GH signaling and transcriptional regulation; computational and in vivo studies in
animal models that dissect mechanisms for insulin resistance; and human endocrine,
metabolic, and genetic studies of a short stature population in Papua New Guinea.
Professor Schwartz's work identifying STAT family proteins as GH signaling
molecules led to the landmark demonstration of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway
between the GH receptor and the nucleus, and related GH signaling to that of cytokines
mediating immune regulation. A gifted teacher and dedicated mentor, Professor
Schwartz guided graduate student training and oversaw training grants programs that
fostered a vibrant research community of faculty mentors and trainees. She served on
the Physiology Graduate Committee, the Pharmacological Sciences Training Program,
and as director of the Cellular and Molecular Biology Interdisciplinary Graduate

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
March 20, 2014
The regents met at 3:15 p.m. in the Anderson Room, Michigan Union. Present
were President Coleman and Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Newman,
Richner and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Harper, Interim Vice President Hu, Chancellor Little, Vice President Lynch,
Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Provost
Pollack, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regent Diggs was present via conference call.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman said that she was encouraged by Governor Snyder's budget
proposal that includes a six percent increase for higher education. This will ultimately
result in more affordable college costs for Michigan students and more innovation for
the economy as investing in higher education is investing in job growth. She
encouraged everyone to contact their state legislator and voice their support of this
proposal.
President Coleman reported that she had attended the annual Honors
Convocation, recognizing the University's highest-achieving students and the new
Thurnau Professors. In addition, Lily Bonadonna was announced as the 2014
Wallenberg Fellow. She received a $25,000 fellowship that she will use to travel to
Peru to study the prevalence of tuberculosis from both the biological and cultural
perspectives.
She announced that Ora Pescovitz, executive vice president for medical affairs,
will step down on June 1 after leading the Health System for five years. She thanked
Vice President Pescovitz for her leadership and commitment to exceptional medical
care, education and research, citing the excellent patient satisfaction scores are and the
tremendous growth of the Health System.
Turning to the agenda, President Coleman welcomed Janet Weiss, dean of the
Rackham School of Graduate Studies for a presentation on graduate education.
Presentation: Graduate Education
Dean Weiss began by saying that last year UM granted 850 Ph.Ds., second only
to UC-Berkeley, and there are currently 5,500 students working towards a graduate
degree. She referred to the Rackham School goals, including success in competing for
talent, maintenance of diversity, high completion rates, graduate preparation, and
continuously striving for cutting edge scholarship and education. Beyond course
grades, graduate students learn by doing scholarly research and by developing good
research topics and questions. With a median time of 5.4 years for completing a
graduate degree, financial support allows students focus on their education. The

297



~March Meeting, 2014

Rackham School continues to become more selective in admissions, and was fifth
nationally in number of African American Ph.D. recipients between 2008-12.
President Coleman asked about efforts to recruit underrepresented students.
Dean Weiss said that diversity is a high priority, and they utilize a number of different
avenues to identify and recruit students they believe can succeed at Michigan.
Regent Richner asked how the Rackham School compares in terms of
placement with peer institutions. Dean Weiss said that there is no good comparative
data. There are some peer exchanges and stories in The Chronicle, but the Michigan
data is the best data available on placement.
Presentation: Annual Research Report
President Coleman introduced Interim Vice President for Research Jack Hu,
who presented the annual research report. He began by stating that graduate education
and research are inseparable, and both support interdisciplinary study and partnerships.
Research expenditures for 2013 totaled $1.3 billion, making UM the number one public
university, and number two among all universities, in a climate of declining federal
support.
He continued, saying that an important component of research is ensuring that
discoveries ultimately benefit society. Ideas are translated into inventions and then into
businesses, and in return they bring value back to the University.
Interim Vice President Hu spoke of a UM graduate student during the 1950's,
Hunein Maassab, who participated in field trials on the effectiveness of the polio
vaccine. Motivated by the success of this experience, and after a lifetime of dedicated
research, his hard work led to approval by the Food and Drug Administration of a new
nasal-spray flu vaccine in 2002. That vaccine carries the brand name of the FluMist.
Dr. Maassab is an outstanding example of how inspiration, passion and dedication to
research can lead to benefits for society. UM is very proud of his achievement and his
lasting legacy.
Interim Vice President Hu introduced another distinguished researcher,
Professor Shaomeng Wang, recipient of the Distinguished University Innovator Award
for 2014, an award that honors faculty who have made important and lasting
contribution to society by developing novel ideas and insights through their research,
and then translating them to practice. Professor Wang is the Warner-Lambert/ParkeDavis Professor of Medicine and professor of internal medicine and pharmacology in
the Medical School, and professor of medicinal chemistry in the College of Pharmacy.
He also is director of the Center for Discovery of New Medicines. His work has led to
67 new invention disclosures resulting in 33 issued U.S. patents, and four license
agreements. He is also co-founder of three start-ups.
Interim Vice President Hu spoke of the Mobility Transformation Center, which
involves creating a facility and partnering with government and industry in
transforming the movement of people and goods. This initiative will position UM as a
regional and international leader in the future of transportation.

299



~March Meeting, 2014

Litigation Report. Vice President Lynch submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report. Interim Vice President Hu submitted the Report of Projects
Established, July 1 - February 28, 2014.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Pescovitz
thanked Regent Ilitch for her warm comments. She thanked President Coleman for
hiring, coaching, mentoring and supporting her. Executive Vice President Pescovitz
said, "It has been a rare privilege during my time here. We really have a phenomenal
institution in the UM Health System, and the reason is because of the extraordinary
people who do phenomenal work." She acknowledged the executive officers, and
regents, and thanked them for their time, expertise and support.
Student Life. Vice President Harper had no additional report.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Person had no report.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little spoke to the appointment
of Tony England, dean, College of Engineering and Computer Science, and also Kate
Davy, as provost, and vice chancellor for academic affairs, who is being recommended
for appointment to a second term. He also noted a new Robotics Engineering program
is getting a great deal of media attention.
Central Student Government Report. Central Student Government (CSG)
President Michael Proppe said, "At our assembly meeting on Tuesday night, the
representatives of the assembly voted to indefinitely postpone assembly resolution 3 -050, a resolution for UM to divest from socially irresponsible companies that violate
Palestinian human rights. A student group, Students Allied for Freedom and Equality
(SAFE), brought the resolution forward. A majority of the assembly members voted
not to vote on the resolution, arguing that divestment was outside of the scope of CSG
business. This group, through CSG, effectively stated that debating and voting on these
student concerns was outside the scope of CSG." He said that, as a result, the 250
students present and the 36 organizations that co-signed the resolution feel that CSG is
unwilling to listen to their concerns. He continued, "While I don't vote on the
assembly, I do regret the aftermath of this vote. I do not want, and members of CSG do
not ever want, any student to feel their elected representative will not listen." He said
that the leaders of CSG and SAFE are meeting regularly and working to find a solution.
He continued, providing an update on the new student football ticket policy that
will end general admission seating beginning with the 2014 season. The new policy
addressed the top student concerns about seating groups, phasing the policy changes in
over time, and eliminating the need for students to wait in line for hours in order to get
a great seat. Response to the policy been very positive, and the process has received
national attention, with the Bleacher Report citing it as "a creative solution to a national
problem that other schools should consider implementing. Interestingly, it appears
Michigan's new policy came from a close working relationship with its student
government, going to show that perhaps administrators don't have all the answers."
Mr. Proppe noted CSG's work, the work with the #BBUM (Being Black at the
University of Michigan) movement, and the CSG resolution in support of these
students. He said, "The issue of diversity and inclusion on campus is fundamental to

300



~March Meeting, 2014

our identity as an institution of higher education. We are not yet where we need to be
but students are meeting regularly with top administrators to discuss new and creative
strategies and it is encouraging."
He reported on student safety issues, including the Night Owl off-campus bus
service, which has had a total of 3,500 riders during the first six weeks of services, and
a new student designed Safe Ride app, which alerts students when their late-night ride
home has arrived to pick them up. Mr. Proppe encouraged ongoing student
engagement in developing and revising new policies, and said that he said he looked
forward to introducing the new CSG leadership at the April meeting.
Regent Darlow said, "We are so impressed with the deliberative, constructive,
consultative, inclusive way you have gone about addressing the issues, and including
the students. We have all learned from you this year and I want to express my personal
appreciation for your work."
Regent Newman agreed and added, "We have worked with a lot of student
leaders and you are a very, very good leader. You work very inclusively, you are
prodigious, you are tenacious in a nice way, and I've been very impressed watching
you this year. You have achieved a lot, and you were handed some things you didn't
expect when you were running for office, most notable the seating for football, and you
handled it very graciously and nicely. I do think you are right, and there are times when
students and administrators can get more done working together than just
administrators making decisions."
Regents Bernstein said, "You are right. Administrators don't have all the
answers. Regents don't have all the answers. None of us do. I echo what my colleagues
have said. You have done a remarkable job as a student president, and Bobby as well. I
remember joining the board with Manish Parikh as the President thinking that he was
fantastic, and you had big shoes to fill. You filled them and whomever gets elected next
has a big act to follow."

Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Provost
Pollack, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow and Vice President
Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman began by welcoming Dr. Mark Schlissel to the meeting.
President-elect Schlissel said that he looks forward being on campus full-time in July,
and appreciated the warm welcome he has received.
President Coleman congratulated Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer Tim Slottow, who has been selected as president of the University of Phoenix
after leading Business and Finance Office for the past 12 years. She credited Vice
President Slottow's leadership for the strength of the endowment, the bond ratings and
the University's overall fiscal health. This transition has led to the recommendation
for approval of the appointment of CEO of UM Hospitals and Health Centers
(UMHHC), Doug Strong, as interim executive vice president and CFO.
President Coleman noted the appointment of Susan Borrego as chancellor of
UM-Flint, succeeding Chancellor Ruth Person. Dr. Borrego is currently vice president
for enrollment management, planning, and student affairs at California State University
at Dominguez Hills, and with approval, will begin her work as chancellor on August
1st.
The men's gymnastics team won their third national championship in five years.
Team captain Sam Mikulak won his third individual all-around championship, and
finished his UM career as a 17-time All-American. She congratulated the team and
Coach Kurt Golder on a remarkable season.
President Coleman noted that planning for commencement activities for the
Class of 2014 is underway. General Motors CEO Mary Barra will deliver the keynote
address at Michigan Stadium, and journalist Daniel Okrent is speaking at University
Graduate Exercises at Hill Auditorium.
President Coleman introduced Dean Jeff Mackie-Mason for a presentation about
the School of Information.
Presentation: School of Information
Dean MacKie-Mason began by stating the School of Information mission,
which is to create and share knowledge so that people can use information, with
technology, to build a better world. The focus is on the intersection of people,

327



~April Meeting, 2014

information and technology, and is highly multidisciplinary. Faculty teaches and
conducts research on the human-centered design of information systems, and the
impact of information systems on education, communications, politics, commerce,
health, and science. They are guided by asking the following three questions: what is
needed to improve lives, how can information help, and how can technology make it
happen.
President Coleman then introduced a Karen Staller, chair of the Senate
Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA), for a presentation.
Presentation: SACUA Annual Report
Karen Staller, chair of SACUA. Ms. Staller spoke of the challenges of
centralized and decentralized faculty governance, and provided real examples of the
benefits and costs. She said that it is more difficult to implement centralized policies in
a decentralized system, even when they may be beneficial to the university as a whole.
She gave examples of faculty grievance procedure, and the SPG on minors involved in
university programs, noting that the manner in which these programs are implemented
in a decentralized model could lead to more risk. Tenure and promotion guidelines also
vary between colleges and schools. She stressed the importance of a common
commitment and vision, and cited communication, participation and transparency,
balanced with a strong faculty voice as key factors for success. She called for a
renewed commitment to faculty participation that transcends all colleges and schools,
and builds on faculty expertise, for a new and even better future.

important issue, complimenting him for being, "clear on your role, and firm in your
resolve."

professor of industrial and manufacturing systems, for his efforts in encouraging

Campus was honored to have recently accepted all the official papers of Congressman
Dale Kildee who served for 37 years. She noted that the first user of these papers was
by an Ann Arbor doctoral student writing a dissertation on fair housing practices.
Central Student Government Report. Central Student Government (CSG)
President Michael Proppe reported that since the IM building began opening two hours
early, over 200 students have taken advantage of the new hours. The CSG conducted a
survey, the results of which were supportive of the new football ticket policy, the night
owl bus route, and the Intra-Fraternity Council ban on hard liquor at parties. Students
oppose the shortening of Welcome Week and believe that there could be unintended
consequences, such as having a football Saturday be the first full day of college for
incoming freshman. This could negatively impact meeting the people in their dorm,
exploring Ann Arbor, and other new student initiatives.
The survey also provided constructive feedback, and he commented that
listening and having conversations were both very important. The CSG report on the
new Student Sexual Misconduct policy cited some encouraging information, and also
some concerns, especially regarding completion time for follow-up.
Looking forward, Mr. Propped recommended working with CSG to revise the
Regents' Bylaws to codify student input in decision-making, and he introduced the
2014-15 CSG President Bobby Dishell.
Mr. Dishell said that he and vice president Megan Shorkal were looking forward
to working with the regents and the administration. He called the Alumni Association
an underutilized resource and highlighted plans work with this group to help increase
minority enrollment, and to connect UM students with local alumni while they are
studying abroad or interning off campus. He mentioned the priority of student safety
and plans to implement the Wolverine Support Network - a peer support network to
help improve mental health by creating a safe space to talk about everyday life, led by
seniors, where students can talk freely, and hopes that this will help to de-stigmatize
mental health issues.
Regent Richner thanked Mr. Proppe for this service and said, "I look forward to
seeing you in your new position at PWC in the elevator bank we will share in Detroit."
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted the report of voluntary
support for March 31, 2014. He said that support continues at record-breaking levels.
He also spoke to the establishment of an endowed deanship made possible by a gift
from the Graham Foundation for the Samuel A. Graham Dean, School of Natural
Resources and Environment.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted four faculty
retirement memoirs.
Helen A. Baghdoyan, Ph.D., professor of anesthesiology, professor of
pharmacology, and professor of psychiatry in the Medical School, will retire from
active faculty status on April 30, 2014.
Professor Baghdoyan received her A.B. degree from Eisenhower College in
1974 and her Ph.D. degree from the University of Connecticut in 1980. At Harvard
Medical School, she completed a postdoctoral fellowship funded by a National
Institutes of Health's National Research Service Award (1980-83), and served as an
instructor (1984-87) and assistant professor (1987). She joined The Pennsylvania State
University College of Medicine faculty as an assistant professor in 1987, and was
promoted to associate professor in 1993, and professor in 1998. Professor Baghdoyan
joined the University of Michigan faculty as a professor of anesthesiology and
professor of pharmacology in 1999, and received an additional appointment of
professor of psychiatry in 2000.
A pioneering and internationally renowned scientist, Professor Baghdoyan
studied the neurochemical mechanisms and brain regions that regulate behavioral states
such as sleep, wakefulness, and anesthesia. She has a notable history of successfully
securing research grants, published numerous articles in the leading peer-reviewed
journals, and was a frequent invited speaker. Since 2004, Professor Baghdoyan has
held a National Institute of Mental Health Method to Extend Research in Time
(MERIT) Award that provides superior investigators with long-term and stable funding.
She authored twenty-five book chapters including "The Neurochemistry of Sleep and
Wakefulness" in Basic Neurochemistry: Principles of Molecular, Cellular, and Medical
Neurobiology (2012). A gifted mentor and dedicated teacher, Professor Baghdoyan
directed multiple pharmacology Ph.D. theses and co-developed the University's first
comprehensive course on sleep. In recognition of her many achievements she received
the Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research's Distinguished Clinical and
Translational Research Mentor Award in 2013.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Helen A.
Baghdoyan professor emerita of anesthesiology, professor emerita of pharmacology, and
professor emerita of psychiatry.
David W. Learned, M.D., clinical assistant professor of anesthesiology in the
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on December 6, 2013.
Dr. Learned received his A.B. and M.D. degrees from the University of
Michigan in 1958 and 1959, respectively. He completed his internship at Midland
Hospital in Midland, Michigan (1959-60) and his anesthesiology residency at the
University of Michigan (1960-62). Dr. Learned served as chief of the anesthesia
department at the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration Hospital from 1962-63 and
worked in a private anesthesiology practice in Benton Harbor, Michigan from 1963-86.

343



~April Meeting, 2014

He returned to the University of Michigan faculty as a clinical instructor in 1986 and
was promoted to clinical assistant professor in 1990.
An accomplished, caring, and dedicated anesthesiologist, Dr. Learned devoted
his career to developing and teaching the highest quality clinical procedures and
policies within the operating room. He taught resident lecture series and resident
tutorial series on a wide variety of topics including non-ventilatory functions of the
lung, blood conservation and utilization in the operating room, anesthesia delivery
systems, neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal agents, and electrical and
environmental safety. He was a highly regarded teacher and mentor to his countless
residents, many of whom have gone on to distinguished careers in medicine. He served
as the medical director of the operating rooms (1987-91) and director of anesthesia at
the Kellogg Eye Center (1991-2013). In addition to his teaching and clinical
responsibilities, he was actively involved in the Berrien County Medical Society, the
Michigan Society of Anesthesiologists, and the Washtenaw County Medical Society.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming David E. Learned clinical assistant professor emeritus of
anesthesiology.
Ralph Lydic, Ph.D., Bert N. La Du Professor of Anesthesiology Research,
professor of anesthesiology, and professor of molecular and integrative physiology in
the Medical School, will retire from active faculty status on April 30, 2014.
Professor Lydic received his B.A. degree from Lamar University in 1969, his
M.A. degree from Stephen F. Austin State University in 1974, and Ph.D. degree from
Texas Tech University in 1979. During his postdoctoral training and junior faculty
years at Harvard Medical School, he received a National Research Award from the
National Institutes of Health and scholarships to the neurobiology training programs of
both the Cold Springs Harbor and Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratories. He
served as an associate professor (1986-1991) and professor (1991-99) at The
Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. Professor Lydic joined the
University of Michigan faculty as the Bert N. La Du Professor of Anesthesiology
Research, professor of anesthesiology, professor of physiology (now molecular and
integrative physiology), and associate chair for anesthesiology research in 1999.
Dr. Lydic is an internationally recognized leader in the field of sleep
neurophysiology, with special expertise in arousal state-dependent respiratory
depression, sleep and pain, and neurochemical control of sleep and anesthesia. His
seminal shared circuits hypothesis postulated that the neural networks evolved to
generate sleep comprise the brain substrates that are most likely to generate and
maintain states of anesthesia. Dr. Lydic's translational research endeavors have helped
to promote a new dimension in patient care by bridging the gap between clinical
anesthesiology and sleep disorders medicine. He has a notable history of successfully
securing research grants, an outstanding record of scholarly publications, and was a
frequent invited lecturer. An inspiring teacher and dedicated mentor, Dr. Lydic served
on twenty-six dissertation committees and co-developed the innovative course entitled
Sleep: Neurobiology, Medicine, and Society. Dr. Lydic oversaw the research training
of countless undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty;
many of whom have gone on to successful academic, research, and clinical careers. He

M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from The Ohio State University in 1984 and 1989,
respectively. She joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty as an assistant
professor in 1986, and was promoted to associate professor in 1992, and professor in
1998. She completed an oncology clinical research fellowship at the National Institutes
of Health in 2001.
Professor Pfalzer is a distinguished scholar in the field of physical therapy with
special expertise in the areas of breast cancer, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, oncology,
and upper quadrant overuse injuries. She has a notable history of successfully securing
research grants and published numerous articles in the leading peer-reviewed journals.
From 2001-13, she served as the associate investigator on a prospective study to
identify factors affecting morbidity following the diagnosis and treatment of patients
with breast cancer. Professor Pfalzer's recent research endeavors have provided
clinically based guidance to healthcare reforms in oncology rehabilitation. She held
several key administrative leadership positions including associate director for research
and post professional education (1994-2012), director of the Transitional Doctor of
Physical Therapy Program (2009-13), and interim director of the Department of
Physical Therapy (2012-13). Professor Pfalzer was a gifted teacher and played an
instrumental role in the introduction of the first doctoral program in physical therapy on
the Flint campus in 2013. She was a fellow of the American Physical Therapy

Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman announced that this was the final meeting for Dr. Ora
Pescovitz, executive vice president for medical affairs, and she turned to Regent Diggs
for a presentation. Regent Diggs read the following:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend their sincere
appreciation to Ora Hirsch Pescovitz, executive vice president for
medical affairs, professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases,
Medical School, for her dedicated service as the leader of the University
of Michigan Health System for the past five years.
Appointed in 2009, Dr. Pescovitz has led a number of important
efforts, including: the transition of the North Campus Research
Complex into an important scientific research center; the completion
and  opening  of the   C.S. Mott Children's   Hospital and   the
VonVoigtlander Women's Hospital; the significant expansion   of
specialized services throughout the health system; and the completion of
important strategic affiliations with entities such as Trinity Health and
MidMichigan Health, which has the effect of expanding access to quality
health care services across the state.
Dr. Pescovitz has been a conscientious steward of the Health
System budget, research funding and philanthropic opportunities. She
has worked tirelessly to improve quality, safety, patient care, access and
satisfaction. Dr. Pescovitz skillfully helped the Health System navigate
the ever-changing national health care landscape, and she helped lead
the University into the spotlight with numerous accolades, including best
hospital in Michigan and among the best nationally.
The Regents thank Ora Hirsch Pescovitz for her tireless
dedication as executive vice president for medical affairs, and thank her
for the positive impact she has had on health care delivery, medical
research and medical education at the University of Michigan.

351



~May Meeting, 2014

President Coleman thanked Dr. Pescovitz for her leadership, grace and style,
and said that the Health System has never been in better shape. Vice President
Pescovitz thanked regents for the recognition and for the privilege of leading one of the
most extraordinary institutions in the nation.
President Coleman reported that the Dearborn campus suffered a great tragedy
this week with a situation involving two students, one still missing, on the Rouge River.
She called on Chancellor Little for an update.
Chancellor Little said, "On Tuesday, a female student entered the Rouge River,
behind the Henry Ford Estate. A male student went into the river to assist her. An
eyewitness observed both individuals in distress and contacted emergency personnel for
assistance. The female student was able to pull herself out of river. She remains in the
hospital with non-life-threating injuries. The male student remains missing.
"Both students were graduate students from China. At the request of the
families we are not releasing the names of the students. The Dearborn Police and Fire
Departments, along with mutual aid from surrounding communities, immediately began
the search for the man and have continued search efforts each day. On Wednesday,
along with other campus leaders, I met with faculty, staff and students to discuss the
incident and, more importantly, provide needed support services. We are appreciative
of the support we have received from the Ann Arbor campus. I speak for the entire
UM-Dearborn campus community, when I say that our hearts are heavy and our
thoughts are with the students and their families at this difficult time."
President Coleman committed the Ann Arbor campus' full support, adding that
her thoughts and prayers are with the students, their families and the entire UMDearborn campus community.
President Coleman called attention to the retirement memoir for Professor
Marilyn Mason of the School of Music, Theatre and Dance (organ) who has been the
long-time organist at Hill Auditorium. Professor Mason retires at the end of May, and
thus enters the history books as the longest-serving professor at Michigan, having
joined the faculty in 1947. She thanked her for an extraordinary 67 years of service.
Regent Bernstein added his congratulations and said that Professor Mason is his
neighbor and is truly a wonderful person.
President Coleman introduced Janine E. Janosky, dean of the UM-Dearborn
College of Education Health & Human Services.
Presentation: UM-Dearborn College of Education, Health & Human Services
Dean Janosky talked about the changing face of health care in this country and
some new developments in education programs that integrate education and health and
human services. The college currently has enrollment of 1,000, of which about one
third are graduate students. There are three health and human services programs on the
agenda for consideration, each of which is responsive to the needs of the state and
nation, has growing employment opportunities combining public health and population
health, and is highly innovative.

352



~May Meeting, 2014

These programs and how they were developed was in part due to the
implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the resulting job creating. The new
programs include two Bachelor of Science degrees and a Master of Health Information
Technology degree.
Public Comment
Regents heard comments from Linda Martinson, alumna, on the litigation
report.
Vice President Lynch stated that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the
Federal District Court have rejected all of the claims made by Ms. Martinson at this
meeting.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Richner, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, said that he and Regents Bernstein and
Darlow met with Vice President Slottow, Hank Baier, associate vice president for
facilities and operations, and Marina Roelofs, executive director for architecture,
engineering and construction, for a discussion on capital project cost benchmarking.
They also heard from Jeff Moelich, executive director of university audits, to review
the status of the centers and institutes audit program and for a bimonthly internal audit
update.
Health Affairs Committee. Regent Diggs reported that she and committee
member Regent Ilitch received the FY15 Michigan Health Corporation (MHC)
business plan from Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs Ora Pescovitz, and
discussed pending changes in the board makeup due to transitions in staff. The
committee received an HHCEB update from Doug Strong, Health System CEO, which
included progress towards achieving Nurse Magnet status. Health System CFO Paul
Castillo presented the April financial results.
Dr. Steve Bernstein, who directs the quality management program, gave a
presentation on quality and safety for ambulatory care, and spoke of health care
quality, ethics, and quality management programs. The committee reviewed a fact
sheet that describes how the health centers serve the community by contributing over
$429 million in community benefits, and learned that over $550 million of the $1
billion Victors for Michigan campaign goal has already been raised.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent White, cochair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, met with co-chair
Regent Newman and Vice President Churchill and received a report from Chancellor
Little on the UM-Dearborn Campus, and an update from Provost Pollack on various
searches. The committee also met with Hank Baier, associate vice president for
facilities and operations, for a discussion about increasing the capital projects threshold
for the regents' agenda book.

353



~May Meeting, 2014

Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report as
of April 30, 2014 and the Plant Extension Report. There was no University Human
Resources Report.
Litigation Report. Vice President Lynch submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report. Interim Vice President Hu submitted the Report of Projects
Established, July 1 - April 30, 2014.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Pescovitz
had no additional report.
Student Life. Vice President Harper had no additional report.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Person noted that the UM-Flint
commencement was the largest class in history with 788 students.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little thanked Dean Janosky
for her presentation and for highlighting the three new programs pending approval.
Chancellor Little continued saying he was "genuinely inspired" after a visit to
the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy (JRLA), a new school serving disadvantaged
students with high expectations. The occasion for the visit was the celebration of a gift
from UM-Dearborn alumnus John Junge (64, B.S. engineering), who established two
Junge Family Endowed Engineering Scholarships offered to JRLA students pursuing
engineering degrees at UM-Dearborn beginning in 2015.
Central Student Government Report. UM-Dearborn student government
president, Sarah Elhelou thanked the board and spoke about her plans to improve
inclusion, athletics, safety and academics through special events, athletic events and the
safety walk late night escort program. She noted the high number student veterans on
campus and efforts to expand services for these students. She said that the Student
Organization Advisory Council, which provides funding to a growing number student
programs, relies on the funding from the university, and continues to see growing
needs.
Central Student Government (CSG) President Bobby Dishell spoke about their
recommendation for a $2 increase to the student fee in support of student organizations.
CSG has expanded the way it funds organizations, making disbursements more
frequently, which allows for more accurate planning by student groups. Last year CSG
received $1,168,201 in requests and funded $444,052 with a 96% claim-rate. Mr.
Dishell said that students generally favor a small fee increase.
Regent Newman asked if there is a policy regarding what can and cannot be
funded. Mr. Dishell said that CSG has a strict policy. A test that is often used is,
"could this event occur without funding?"  There are also legal guidelines that are
carefully followed.
Regent Newman asked if some events were cancelled due to a lack of funding.
Mr. Dishell replied that he is not sure, but knows that some organizations have had to
alter their plans based on funding availability.

354



~May Meeting, 2014

Regent Newman said, "usually when there has been an increase in the student
fee it has been for a certain purpose." Mr. Dishell said that additional funds would go
to support a growing number of student programs. There are about 1,500 student
organizations and CSG has cut their own budget by half in order to help fund more
student groups.
Vice President Harper said that CSG is working with her staff to refine their
request in preparation for the June meeting.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted the report of voluntary
support for April 30, 2014. He spoke to the naming of the Chinese Studies program,
part of a $50 million gift from Richard and Susan Rogel, honoring one of the great
academic leaders at this university, Kenneth G. Lieberthal. He added that it is very
unusual that a donor honors someone else in the naming.
President Coleman added that Dr. Lieberthal has been very helpful in assisting
with delegations to China. He gives his time freely to help and it is a tremendous
service.
Vice President May also spoke of a gift from the Samuel A. Graham family
establishing a deanship in the School of Natural Resources and Environment, the first
recipient of which will be named at this meeting.
Vice President May highlighted student scholarship recipient Wedad Ibrahim,
past president of the UM-Dearborn student government. She received a scholarship
every year and is a good example of the real impact of philanthropy impacting real
students.

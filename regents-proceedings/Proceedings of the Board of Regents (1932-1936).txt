September Meeting, 1932


UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
ANN ARBOR, SEPTEMBER 30, 1932
The Board was called to order in the Regents' Room at 3:30 P.M.
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Murfin, Regent Smith, Regent
Stone, Regent Shorts, Regent Beal, Regent Hubbard, Regent Clements.
Absent, Regent Cram, who entered shortly, and Superintendent
Pearce. There were also in attendance Vice-President Yoakum, Dr.
F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G. Watkins, and Secretary S. W. Smith.
The customary financial reports were filed.
The minutes of the meeting of June 17 were approved as submitted to the Regents in press proof with certain specified changes.
Regent Cram took her seat.
Regent Beal requested and received permission to refer to the
Finance Committee of the Board a certain communication received
by him from relatives of the late H. H. Herbst (R.P. 1926-1929,
page 503). This communication was not filed, and is to be returned
to Regent Beal.
Regent Clements discussed the parking problem with respect to
the Law Quadrangle, and the Board declined to change the present
parking space.
Actions of the Executive Committee were approved as recorded
in the minutes of the committee as follows (R.P. 1929-1932, page
954):June 22, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee appropriated the sum of $125 to be added to the Salary
budget of the Law Library to provide salary for four weeks for as many stack
assistants as are necessary to provide service for those attending the seminar
for teachers of international law which will be in session from June 27, 1932,
to July 28, 1932. The seminar will be conducted under the auspices of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (R.P. 1929-1932, page 858).
June 23, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of the President, the committee added the sum of $4,160 to
the Salary account of the budget of the Extension Division for the University
year 1932-1933. At the time the budget was prepared, this total amount was
deducted from the amount allocated to the account of the Extension Credit
Plan and from the amount allocated for Extension lectures. Inasmuch as the
Extension Credit Plan salary expenditures are met by fees, paid by the students, and because the amount allocated for Extension lectures was originally
$4,000 and reduced to $2,000, it was not thought advisable further to reduce
these two accounts by $4,160 or 8 per cent of the total.
June 25, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the meeting of the Regents on June 17, the matter of accepting a gift
of a certain piece of property in Georgia was referred to the committee, with
power.
By action on this date, the committee decided not to accept the property
because it is evident, from all available sources of information, that it would
probably prove a liability to the University rather than an asset. President
Ruthven has written the prospective donor of the action of the Regents with
respect to his offer.




2                 SEPTEMBER        MEETING, 1932
June 27, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Dean Sadler, the committee added the sum of $400 to
the Salary budget of the Department of Chemical Engineering, to augment the
amount allocated for assistants for the University year 1932-1933. It is understood that this amount will revert to general funds, provided it is not needed
after registration at the beginning of the University year.
July 5, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee approved the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
the University Musical Society, outlined in the following resolution adopted
by that Board and submitted to the Regents by President Charles A. Sink in
his letter of July 1, 1932: —
That the policy adopted by the Board of Regents upon previous recommendation of the Board of Directors of the University Musical Society,
whereby the earnings of the Murphy Fund should be invested for the
purpose of creating a fund for the erecting and equipping of a proper
building for the School of Music, be varied to the extent:
That to meet an urgent temporary need a sufficient amount from the income
account be utilized for the purpose of renting the second floor of the Ann
Arbor Press Building for a period of five years, and
That the contract be executed by the University with the Ann Arbor Press
on the basis of details which are being worked out by the writer in
cooperation with Professor L. M. Gram, Director of University Plant
Extension.
July 6, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On request of Professor Harley H. Bartlett, Head of the Department of
Botany, of Dean Effinger, and of Dr. E. B. Mains, Director of the University
Herbarium, Dr. Bessie Kanouse, Curator and Assistant to the Director of the
University Herbarium, was transferred from the budget of the Department of
Botany, Salary account, to the budget of the University Herbarium, Salary
account. Dr. Kanouse's salary is $2,208 per year, twelve-month basis.
July 6, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent!Beal, and Regent Stone.
Upon request of Dr. H. B. Lewis, Head of the Department of Physiological
Chemistry, and with the approval of Dr. F. G. Novy, the committee approved
the recommendation that the 8 per cent decrease in the salary of Acting
Assistant Professor Samuel A. Lough, of the Department of Physiological
Chemistry, in the sum of $160 be not deducted, but that his salary should be
at the rate of $2,000 for the University year 1932-1933. Professor Lough is
on leave of absence from the University of Nevada during the present year,
having obtained this leave with the understanding that his salary at the
University of Michigan would be at the rate of $2,000. This action involves no
increase in the budget.
July 8, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
Upon recommendation of President Ruthven, the salary of Professor William
A. Paton of the School of Business Administration was fixed at $10,000 for
the University year 1932-1933. Professor Paton had been assured a year ago
that his salary for the present year would be $10,000, the increase to be
available from the New York Salary Endowment Fund. This salary is subject
to the 10 per cent decrease, leaving Professor Paton a net salary of $9,000 for
the University year 1932-1933.
July 9, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee gave approval to the budget, adopted by the Board of

July 30, 1932

Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee approved the request of Dean Effinger that the salary of
Catherine C. Dawson, Custodian and Teaching Assistant in the Department of
Geology, be placed at $1,200 for the University year. Miss Dawson agreed
to a reduction in salary from $1,500 to $1,200 for the University year when preliminary budget cuts were made, with the expectation that in view of this
large reduction the additional 6 per cent would not be deducted. Due to a
misunderstanding, however, the 6 per cent deduction was made, and the present
action of the committee restores her salary to the figure of $1,200.
This action necessitated an appropriation of $72, to be added to the budget
of the Literary College.

The Board took the following action confirming mail vote during
the summer:The title of Dr. John Alexander was changed from    Associate Professor
of Surgery to Professor of Surgery, without change in salary, effective as of
October 1, 1932, full-time, twelve-month basis.
The resignation of Dr. Vernon L. Hart, Assistant Professor of Surgery,
effective as of September 30, 1932, was accepted with regret.
Dr. Carl Egbert Badgley was appointed Professor of Surgery, to take charge,
in succession to Dr. Hart, of the Division of Orthopedic Surgery, as of October
1, 1932, full-time, twelve-month basis, with salary of $10,500, of which $7,200
will be provided on the Hospital budget and $3,300 on the budget of the
Medical School.
Differences between the salary formerly paid to Dr. Hart and the
salary to be paid Dr. Badgley caused the following changes in the
budget for the remaining nine months of the present fiscal year:University Hospital budget, addition of $3,525; Medical School budget,
transfer of $60 from the item "for adjustments" to the Salaries account of the
Department of Surgery.
Confirming a mail vote during the summer, necessitated by the
opening of college previous to the meeting of September 30, the
Regents adopted the following resolutions (R.P. 1929-1932, page
917):Resolved, That the annual and summer session fees of all students include
the Health Service portion, except as stated below. All such students whose
fees include the Health Service portion are entitled to the benefits of the University Health Service, but their treatment by it is optional on their part,
except when in the opinion of the Director they may be a source of danger to
the student health.
Resolved, That part-time students in the Graduate School, those living more
than six miles from the Campus and taking not more than six class periods
per week, and others approved by the Director of the Health Service may waive
Health Service privileges by signing a request for such waiver.
Resolved, That first enrollment in a regular session for all applicants to
full-time student status shall require previous Health Service approval. The
same shall apply to all applicants for part-time student status who have not
waived Health Service privileges. Such approval is to be based upon assurance
of health safety to the entrant and associates as determined by a suitable
examination and evidence of vaccination (immunity to smallpox). Vaccination
may be waived by the Director of the Health Service for applicants who file




14


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1932


statements of objection on religious grounds properly signed by parents or
guardians.  Such waiver shall release the University from  responsibility of
financial assistance for the case of smallpox in the applicant.
The President filed the following statement:Professor Fred Manville Taylor, Professor Emeritus of Economics, died at
South Pasadena, California, on Sunday night, August 7, 1932. He was born
at Northville, Michigan, July 11, 1855, and consequently was seventy-seven
years of age at the time of his death. He was a graduate of Northwestern
University (A.B., 1876; A.M., 1879) and had received the degree of Ph.D.
from the University of Michigan in 1888. Northwestern conferred upon him
the honorary degree of LL.D. in 1926. His teaching career covered thirteen
years (1879-1892) at Albion College as professor of history, and thirty-seven
years (1892-1929) at the University of Michigan; since 1904 his rank was
professor. Professor Taylor was recognized, here and elsewhere, as one of our
outstanding teachers and scholars.  He organized our elementary course in
Economics, which is generally recognized as setting a high standard for courses
of this nature, and wrote his Principles of Economics (which went into its
ninth edition in 1925) for use in this course. His advanced work in economic
theory was required of all candidates for advanced degrees in the department.
He -was particularly successful in the training of teachers, and scores of his
former students now occupy important positions in colleges and universities in
this country. The American Economic Association made him its President in
1928.
The Regents placed on record the resolutions of appreciation and
sympathy appearing below:WHEREAS, The Regents of the University of Michigan have learned with
sorrow of the death on August 7, 1932, of Professor Emeritus Fred Manville
Taylor for thirty-seven years an important member of the Department of
Economics of this University, therefore be it
Resolved, That the Regents do hereby record their appreciation of the distinguished services rendered by Professor Taylor to the University of Michigan,
as a keen and tireless scholar in his chosen field, as a teacher endowed with
extraordinary powers of exposition, organization, and the inspiration of younger
men, and as an author whose contributions were read and whose texts were
studied in this and other countries; and be it further
Resolved, That the Regents express the satisfaction which the Board and
the University community in general find in the fact that Professor Taylor's
name will not cease to appear in the University's annual records, since his
influence will actively live on in the form of the Fred M. Taylor Fellowship
in Economics, established two years ago; and be it further
Resolved, That the Regents extend to Professor Taylor's family their heartfelt sympathy in their bereavement and direct their Secretary, in token thereof,
to send to Mrs. Taylor an official copy of these resolutions.
The Secretary filed a report of an inspection made by Regent
Smith, Mr. J. E. Schmidt, and the Secretary, of property remaining
in the estate of the late Percy Tyler Cook, under whose will the
Regents have a contingent interest (R.P. 1923-1926, page 566). In
view of the status of the real estate involved, the Board directed that
the record should show the expectation on the part of the Regents
that nothing will eventuate from     the bequest of Mr. Cook.
The Board adopted the following budget for the year 1932-1933
covering expenditures from the Parke, Davis and Company Ventriculin
Fund (R.P. 1929-1932, page 739):Jean Kyer, Chemist...............................$...............1,304

Department of Engineering Research, the sum of $500 was set aside
from the Patents Receipts Research Fund to establish a fellowship in




SEPTEMBER lMEETING, 1932


31


Electrical Engineering under the direction of Professor Benjamin F.
Bailey for the present University year, under terms and conditions
as follows:a) The fellowship to be known as the Engineering Research Fellowship in
Electrical Engineering, the subject of study being Investigation of Capacitor
Motors;
b) Upon approval of this recommendation by the Board of Regents, the
above amount to be transferred from the Patents Receipts Research Fund
to an account under the Graduate School to be known as Special Engineering
Research Fellowships, with the understanding that any part of the funds
thus transferred which is not used for these purposes is to be transferred
back to the Patents Receipts Research Fund of the Department of Engineering Research.
While under the rule (R.P. 1929-1932, page 601) the only Fellows
who may receive remission of fees are those who have, among other
conditions, enrolled in the Graduate School, on recommendation of
the President, the Regents gave the privilege for the present year to
Mr. George L. Beard, who has been appointed to one of the Earhart
Fellowships and who desires to be enrolled in the School of Business
Administration.    No precedent for the future is created in the extension of this privilege in the case of Mr. Beard.
The Board approved the following five-year program proposed
by the Faculty of the College of Architecture as an additional course
of study, and provided that the degree of Bachelor of Architecture
shall be granted to students who complete this program:The purpose of a longer period of study is to encourage greater breadth
and thoroughness, a better understanding of public and private problems and
of the conditions affecting the individual and professional service.
Under this plan the four-year programs are extended by twenty-four hours
of electives.. These electives, the technical and other courses are spread over
five years. This will permit greater flexibility in study schedules, which will
average sixteen instead of seventeen hours per semester. Some technical electives
may be included.
Since suitable preparation can be made during the earlier years, cultural
courses of an advanced character and a wider range of electives will be open
to students than are listed under "Approved Nontechnical Electives" in section 66.
The four-year programs in Architecture allow twenty credit hours for
language and electives, also an equal amount for the requirements in English,
mathematics, physics, business administration, and geology or mineralogy. With
the added electives, the equivalent of nearly two years of nontechnical studies
will form part of the training of those who enroll under this plan.
The most favorable groups of electives will be available for those who have
completed the language requirement and three units in history before admission.
The selection of the electives will be made in consultation with the Faculty;
consideration will be given to the interests and needs of the individual student,
and to the distribution of electives and other courses throughout the five years.
There may be some concentration in a single field, such as economics,
sociology, philosophy, or business administration; or a combination of courses
may be made, such as economics, general sociology and community problems,
city planning, and domestic architecture and housing.
Most architectural students will feel the need for additional English and
for a course in business law. Those who have had one year of high school!
history should elect one or both of the courses in the history of civilization.
Among the elective courses of particular interest in this connection are the
following:
History: The History of Civilization, Courses 11 and 12.
Economics: General Economics (53 and 54) or Modern Economic Society
(153).

Political Science: Introduction (181).
Business Administration: Business Law I and II (205 and 206); Real

Most of the above are three-hour courses. They are described in the

School of Business Administration.
The Regents revised the regulation concerning reimbursement
for travel on University business (R.P. 1926-1929, page 246) in
accordance with the report made to the President by a committee
consisting of the Vice-President and Secretary as chairman, and Dr.
H. A. Haynes, Dean J. R. Effinger, Dean H. M. Bates, Dean E. H.
Kraus, Dr. F. E. Robbins, Mr. J. C. Christensen, and Professor
G. E. Carrothers, and in turn filed with the Regents by the President.
The new regulations become effective immediately.
The President filed resolutions adopted by the Michigan Bankers'
Association in convention at Mackinac Island thanking the University
for the course of lectures on economic subjects broadcast during the
past winter; also resolutions adopted by the Ann Arbor Trades and
Labor Council expressing appreciation of the University's cooperation
with the Council, chiefly through the Extension Division, in conducting the Labor Institute which was held in Ann Arbor on June 20
and following days.
The Secretary filed, for the information of the Regents, the registration card for State employees requested by the Commission of
Inquiry into. State Governmental Expenses.   Each person on the
University pay roll, except temporary employees, will file a report
upon one of these cards.
The Secretary filed with the Regents copies of the report by Dr.
Harley A. Haynes, Director of the University Hospital, showing reductions in prices to patients, particularly patients whose bills are
paid by the public.   The changes made in these schedules from
October 1, 1930, to September 19, 1932, have made estimated annual
reductions of $450,800 in the expenses of patients.
The Secretary filed the annual report of the committee consisting
of Dean Alice C. Lloyd, Miss Ellen B. Stevenson, and Mr. J. C.
Christensen, operating University House No. 1 at 1020 South University Avenue, showing a surplus for the year of $846.59. Including
the balance on hand one year ago, the net surplus of University
House No. 1 is, as of September 30, $1,235.66. Out of this surplus
the management desires to contribute, the same as last year, the sum
of $1,000 to be used in the retirement of a Mosher-Jordan Hall
bond (R.P. 1929-1932, page 651). The Regents expressed gratification with this desire on the part of the management committee to
regard the problem of housing for University women as a single
problem and not as several problems affecting only each separate
residence hall, and accepted the contribution of $1,000 for the purposes
tendered, with thanks.
The Regents approved a plan proposed by the Vice-President and
Secretary whereby personal belongings of residents in University
dormitories may be insured against fire, at the option and at the
cost of the residents.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1932

The Board declined at this time to authorize any expense for the
taking of new aerial pictures of the Campus.
The Secretary filed a letter addressed to the Regents by Mrs.
Elizabeth B. Holbrook expressing the thanks of herself and her children for the action taken by the Regents following the death of the
late Professor Evans Holbrook (R.P. 1929-1932, page 961).
The Secretary reported progress thus far made with respect to
the building known as Fletcher Hall, under authority given to the
Executive Committee at the June meeting (R.P. 1929-1932, page
960). Actions thus far taken were approved by the Board.
The Secretary filed notice of the following gifts, each of which
was accepted in accordance with its terms and conditions, and with
the thanks of the Regents:Under the will of the late Dr. Eva E. MIcKnight, of Oswego, New York,
a member of the Medical Class of 1890, the University is bequeathed, should
the residuum of the estate permit, the sum of $15,000 to establish "A fellowship for research or advanced work in some branch of medicine, to be granted
only to women graduates whom the Faculty may deem fitted to enter upon
the work."  Representatives advise that at this time it is problematical whether
there will be any remainder after the specific bequests are paid.
From the Freshman Frolic Committee of the Class of 1935, through Dean
Bursley, the sum of $59.19 to be added to the Special Student Aid Fund (R.P.
1929-1932, page 942).
From  Captain Arthur Newton Pack of Princeton, New Jersey, through
Dean Dana, for expenses during the year of the George Willis Pack Forestry
Foundation, the sum of $4,000.
From the American Game Association, through Dean Dana, the sum of
$100 as a contribution toward the field expenses of the so-called Williamston
Project, the fellowship to be known as the Izaak Walton League of America
Fellowship (page 16).
From Charles B. DuCharme, of Detroit, the sum of $300 for renewing the
Elwood Croul Memorial Scholarship for the present year, to which Ernest Mead
Baker, Jr., was reappointed (R.P. 1929-1932, page 748).
Dr. Walter Koelz, at present holding the title of Honorary
Collaborator in Asiatic Research (R.P. 1929-1932, page 241), was
appointed Research Fellow on the Charles L. Freer Fund, with a
stipend of $5,500 annually, effective with the beginning of the present
University year. Dr. Koelz is to work in Tibet and upon the Freer
Collections in Washington. The proposal has the endorsement and
the financial cooperation of Dr. Lodge, Curator of the Freer Gallery
in Washington.
The gift of Dr. and Mrs. Walter R. Parker toward the expenses
involved in conducting the study has already been recorded in the
Proceedings of this meeting (page 16), and the President stated to
the Board that Mr. George G. Booth, for the Cranbrook Foundation,
proposed to contribute an additional sum of $1,000. The project in
general received the approval of the Regents, and the President was
requested to express the thanks of the Board to Mr. Booth.
The President placed before the Regents the         following  letter
(R.P. 1929-1932, page 940):President Ruthven and Regents of the University:
Dear Sirs:In your resolutions, adopted at the time of Dr. Canfield's death, you placed
on record your "appreciation of Professor Canfield's character as a man, and
of his devotion to the University of Michigan, and to the profession in which
he attained high eminence."

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1932


During his twenty-eight years of service in the Medical School, the work
nearest his heart was the training of young graduates to carry on successfully
work in Otolaryngology. That his influence in this field may be continued,and in memory of his years of devotion to his Department, it is my pleasure to
ask you to establish "The Roy Bishop Canfield Memorial Fellowship in
Otolaryngology." To this end I am enclosing my check for thirty-five thousand
dollars ($35,000) with the request that this fund be invested in safe securities,
and that the interest therefrom be given to young men, physically and mentally
equipped, but perhaps financially unable, to carry on, with honor, work in this
special field of medicine,-young men, not only of ability, but of such sincerity of purpose, and of effort, that they will uphold the high standards to
which Dr. Canfield pledged himself.
It is my request that so long as Dr. Furstenberg,-who is carrying forward
the plans and ideals which he and Dr. Canfield had for the Department,-shall
occupy the Chair of Otolaryngology, the recipient of this fellowship shall be
named by him, and sanctioned by the Board of Regents, and that with him, and
under his direction, shall be evolved a plan for the administration of this fund,
which shall make it most practical and efficient,-to the end that each candidate
shall be enabled to successfully complete the regular rotation in Otolaryngology.
Trusting that you will accept this fellowship as a fitting memorial to
Dr. Canfield, I am
Very truly yours,
Leila Harlow Canfield
September 19th, 1932
Mrs. Canfield's gift, to establish the "Roy Bishop Canfield
Memorial Fellowship in Otolaryngology" was accepted, in accordance
with its terms and conditions, by the Regents with profound thanks,
and the Executive Committee of the Medical School was requested,
in conference with Mrs. Canfield, to draw up and present to the
Regents, with her approval, a plan of administration.
The President notified the Regents that the Carnegie Corporation
had contributed the sum of $5,500 to be used by the University for
grants-in-aid for studies in librarianship. This gift was accepted in
accordance with its terms, and the President was requested to communicate to President Keppel, of the Corporation, the thanks of the
Board.
Dean Edward H. Kraus, of the College of Pharmacy, notified the
Regents that the Frederick Stearns and Company Fellowship of $500
(R.P. 1929-1932, page 904), the Parke, Davis and Company Fellowship of $500 (R.P. 1929-1932, page 826), and the Upjohn Fellowship
of $750 (R.P. 1929-1932, page 826) would be continued in the
College of Pharmacy     through  the present University    year.  The
Regents directed that thanks should be communicated to these donors
for their generous cooperation.
Professor A. E. White and Dean Sadler communicated to the
Regents the fact that the Michigan Gas Association had renewed for
the University year 1932-1933 its fellowship in Gas Engineering, in
the sum of $750, of which $600 is to be paid to the fellow. One-half
of this fellowship has already been received. The Board accepted this
fellowship in accordance with its terms and directed that the thanks
of the University should be transmitted to the Michigan Gas Association, through Mr. A. G. Schroeder, its Secretary and Treasurer,
in Grand Rapids.
In accordance with recommendation of the proper Faculty in each
case, degrees and certificates were voted as follows:BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN MEDICINE

The President and the Vice-President and Secretary were requested
to confer on the subject of the desirability of additional means of
publicity for the University's activities, and to report back to the
Regents at an early meeting.
Regent Clements, as Chairman of the Buildings and Grounds Committee, called the attention of the Regents to the office space provided
for the President, as inadequate and as positively harmful to the
health of anyone required to occupy this space, due to improper light
and to apparently irremediable bad ventilation, besides lack of the
privacy necessary for sustained work. The Board referred the matter
to the Buildings and Grounds Committee for further study and a
full report.
All of the above actions were taken by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to 3:30 P.M. Friday, October 28.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary
APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREE
Voted May 27, 1932 (R.P. 1929-1932, page 945). Characterizations by
Professor John G. Winter.
MASTER OF ARTS
AuGUSTUS W\ARREN CRANE. A graduate of the Medical School in the Class
of 1894, a distinguished member of his profession, honored alike by the citizens of
his commonwealth and his associates in the advancement of medicine. Early in
his career he established the diagnostic laboratory of the Board of Health of
Kalamazoo, and with equal vision devoted himself as a pioneer to the investigation and application of x-rays. His attainments in this ield of research brought
him recognition from learned societies at home and abroad, and in 1921 won for
him the gold medal of the Radiological Society of North America. By reason of his
skill as a diagnostician and of his contributions to the science of radiology, I
now present him to you for the honorary degree of Master of Arts.




October Meeting, 1932
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, OCTOBER 28, 1932
The Board was called to order in the Regents' Room at 3:30 P.M.
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Hubbard, Regent Clements,
Regent Cram, Regent Shorts, Regent Stone, Regent Beal. Absent,
Superintendent Pearce, Regent Murfin, and Regent Smith, who later
took his seat. There were also in attendance Vice-Presidents Yoakum
and Bruce, Dr. F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G. Watkins, and the Secretary.
The minutes of the meeting of September 30 were approved as
submitted to the Regents in press proof with certain specified changes.
The customary financial reports were filed.
Regent Hubbard reported progress in his revision of the By-Laws
with respect to the administrative outline of Hygiene and Public
Health and the University Health Service (page 13).
Regent Smith took his seat.
Actions of the Executive Committee were approved as recorded
in the minutes of the committee as follows (page 1):August 8, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee gave approval to a request from the City of Ann Arbor to
cross certain University property included in the Nichols Arboretum, as part
of the project for a new water main extending from Huron Street across Palmer
Field to Observatory Street, thence to Washington Heights, and from there
across the Arboretum  to Harvard Place (R.P. 1929-1932, page 929). It is
understood that the route across the Arboretum has been approved by Assistant
Professor Harlow O. Whittemore, Acting Director of the Arboretum in the
absence of Professor Tealdi, and the crossing is granted with the express provision that all possible future interests of the University can be safeguarded
by legal agreement.
August 26, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee granted the request of Dr. W. C. Olson, Principal of the
University Elementary School, for permission to offer a salary up to $2,200
to the teacher for the second grade in the University Elementary School now
being sought by him. It is understood that $2,200 is a maximum figure and
the position is to be filled for less if possible. The budget provision for this
position is $1,472. The difference in amounts is to be made up by adjustments
within the budget of the Elementary School, presumably from the amount set
aside for the first-grade assistant and the unassigned portion of the research
budget. This action has been taken in order to provide a superior type of
teacher for the position, inasmuch as the appointee will necessarily have many
contacts with patrons and with graduate students and Faculty members in the
University. The action of the committee involves no addition to the budget.
September 21, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee approved a remittance of $900 to be credited to the account
of Assistant Professor Ralph L. Belknap of the Department of Geology, now
in charge of the University of Michigan Greenland Expedition with Gronlands
Styrelse Copenhagen as a guarantee that his expenses will be paid. Professor
Belknap has assigned his salary for the University year 1932-1933, amounting
to $1,150, to the University to be applied on the expenses of this expedition

OCTOBER MEETING, 1932


October 8, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation of Dean Sadler, one of the positions of Professor of
Mechanical Engineering in the College of Engineering was declared vacant on
advice that Professor Clyde E. Wilson will be unable to resume his teaching
duties in the University this year. To fill the vacancy thus created, Paul Allerton
Cushman was appointed Professor of Mechanical Engineering as of the beginning of the University year 1932-1933, with salary of $4,140 per University
year.
October 8, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Dr. Carl E. Guthe, Director of the Museum of Anthropology, the committee approved the use of an additional sum of $200 from the
Charles L. Freer Research and Publication Fund allocated to the work which is
now being done by Mr. Benjamin March and Dr. Aga-Oglu, to permit the
purchase of a collection of important miniatures which has been discovered
during the course of their research (R.P. 1929-1932, page 951).

Regent Stone, as Chairman of the Finance Committee, presented
the following written report made by Price, Waterhouse and Company
embodying their audit of the University's accounts for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1932. After discussion the report of the auditors was
accepted and placed on file (R.P. 1929-1932, page 703):Honorable Ralph Stone,
Chairman of the Finance Committee,
The Regents of the University of MTiichigan,
Detroit, Michigan.
Dear Sir:
In accordance with instructions and in continuance with our previous audits,
we have made an examination of the books and accounts of the University
of Michigan for the year ended June 30, 1932. Our examination, as on previous
occasions, has been directed to the verification of the balance sheet of the
University as at June 30, 1932, a copy of which is annexed hereto as Exhibit
I. In addition, we have compared the annual Financial Report of the University with the relative records and have found that the report has been prepared
in accordance therewith. It will be understood that our examination did not
include a check of the detailed cash and other transactions for the period
under review nor a confirmation of the accounts receivable and student loan
notes by correspondence with the debtors, and our report is submitted subject
to this general reservation.
The books have been kept on a cash basis except in respect of accounts
receivable.
UNIVERSITY ACCOUNTS
We have the following comments to offer with reference to our verification
of the balance sheet of the University as at June 30, 1932:
ASSETS FOR GENERAL PURPOSES-$2,634,877.52
PLANT FUNDS-$8,769.13
The cash in the hands of the University for current purposes and plant
construction as at June 30, 1932, amounted to $239,534.49, comprising $232,513.51 for current purposes and $7,020.98 for plant construction. The latter
amount represents the unexpended balance of funds at June 30, 1932, received
from the State Treasurer for construction of the elementary school. The funds
on hand, amounting to $3,378.45, were verified by actual count at the close
of business on June 30, 1932, and the bank balances as at that date in the
amount of $232,156.04 were reconciled with certificates furnished to us by the
depositary banks. In this connection we might mention that, during the year
under review, the University entered into certain agreements whereby the depositary banks, in lieu of the customary depository bonds, pledged certain
securities, comprising bonds and real estate first mortgages, with designated
trustees. We have inspected the depository agreements and have obtained certificates, signed by the respective trustees, to the effect that the securities were
actually in their possession at June 30, 1932.
The cash in the hands of the State Treasurer for current purposes and
plant construction amounted to $1,220,089.20 comprised of $1,218,341.05 for
current purposes and $1,748.15 for plant construction. We have received a
certificate from the State Administrative Board in confirmation of these amounts
as the balances of unexpended appropriations as at June 30, 1932.




50                  OCTOBER MEETING, 1932
It will be observed from the annexed balance sheet (Exhibit I) that the
item of funds for plant construction is shown under the caption of "plant
funds."
The inventory of materials and supplies amounting to $345,359.58 represents the total of physical inventories taken as of June 30, 1932, at the
principal storehouses, a comparative statement of which follows:
Increase
June 30              or
Storehouse                       1931        1932      decrease
General Storehouse..................$143,323.13  $126,487.87  $16,835.26
University Hospital.................. 106,481.42   85,228.98  21,252.44

Printing and Binding Department......   5,847.03    5,596.92     250.11
Power Plant, coal only.............. 33,614.74     16,276.20  17,338.54
$399,446.84  $345,359.58  $54,087.26
We have tested the clerical accuracy of the inventories and have satisfied
ourselves that the basis of pricing adopted represented approximate cost, and
we have been furnished with a certificate signed by a responsible official of the
University as to the accuracy of the quantities and the inventory in general.
Included in the inventories at the General Storehouse and Chemistry Department are materials that have been on hand for some years, and this condition
has been brought to the attention of officials of the University.
The item of accounts receivable represents the total amount of charges to
outsiders for materials and supplies sold and for services rendered, uncollected
at June 30, 1932. The inclusion of these accounts in the balance sheet as at
June 30, 1932, is in continuation of the policy adopted in prior years in order
to show all of the assets of the University. As mentioned in our previous
reports, credits in respect of the charges to accounts receivable are not made
to income or asset accounts of the University until the cash has been actually
received. The accounting system of the University Hospital provides for credits
to the proper income accounts at the time the charges accrue, but these accounts
are kept in separate records apart from the University records kept in the
Business Office. Consequently the credits to hospital sales and services are
made in the Business Office only when the cash is actually received. We have
checked the detail of the accounts receivable of the Hospital and of the University to the subsidiary control records and have found the aggregate of the
individual accounts to be in agreement with the controlling accounts. The collectibility of the Hospital accounts was discussed with a responsible official and,
as a result thereof, the reserve for bad debts has been increased to the amount
of $73,482.13. We might mention that the reserve includes an amount of
$33,074.63 representing an additional provision against possible loss in the
collection of certain past due accounts aggregating $65,873.69 which had been
guaranteed by a Michigan county. The amount of $33,074.63 has been appropriated from the earnings of the Hospital for the period under review as
shown in the attached Exhibit II. The following summary shows the changes
which have occurred in the Hospital accounts receivable during the year ended
June 30, 1932:Balance  at  July  1,  1931....................           $  334,522.40

The net decrease in the expendable fund in the amount of $74,732.97 is
accounted for, principally, by the transfer of the balance in the general trust
fund interest account to the consolidated fund reserve for losses, included in the
endowment funds, in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents at
their meeting held on January 29, 1932. Further details relative to changes
in the trust fund accounts are shown in Schedule 14 of the Financial Report
of the University.
The securities held in trust by the investment officer of the University as at
June 30, 1932, at a carrying value of $5,271,180.07 have been verified by
inspection of the securities in the custody of the investment officer and by certificates furnished to us by the depositaries holding securities. We have satisfied
ourselves that all purchases and sales of securities during the period under
review have been properly accounted for. The following statement shows the net
changes in the various security accounts during the year ended June 30, 1932:

the market value thereof as at June 30, 1932, amounted to $1,738,494.29.
Included in the item of mortgages are amounts aggregating $27,838.95 which
represent mortgages foreclosed during the year, but the property acquired thereby
is subject to redemption for the period of one year from the date of foreclosure.

The item of trust fund real estate amounting to $571,644.83 as shown on
the statement of trust fund investments, Schedule 13 of the Financial Report
of the University, has been increased during the year under review by a net
amount of $15,196.86. Additions in the amount of $18,311.15 represented the
total of the unpaid balances of certain land contracts foreclosed during the year
under review, forming a part of the Levi Barbour Fund. The reduction of
$3,114.29 represented the book value of property sold located in Detroit and
Bay City, Michigan, comprising in part the Levi Barbour and Angell funds,
respectively. We noted that the rental payments on certain properties forming
a part of the Levi Barbour and Herbst funds were in arrears to the extent of
$7,166.64 and $263, respectively.
The cash balances in the custody of the University Cashier of the various
trust funds and deposit accounts amounted to $194,451.36 as at June 30, 1932,
and have been verified by, or reconciled with, certificates furnished to us by the
depositaries.
We have ascertained that the receipt of all income from securities has been
properly accounted for, with the exceptions hereinbefore mentioned, and have
satisfied ourselves generally that income received from specifically invested funds
has been properly allocated and that income from consolidated investments has
been fairly and correctly prorated on the basis previously adopted to the funds
entitled to a portion thereof. Furthermore, we have ascertained that the procedure adopted by the Regents at their meeting held on May 25, 1928, relative
to the classification and segregation of trust funds, the apportionment of trust
fund earnings and creation of reserves to cover losses from investments and
uncollectible student loans has been followed. The aforementioned resolution
relating to the creation of reserves to cover losses from investments has been
amended by a further resolution of the Regents in this respect at their meeting
held on January 29, 1932, wherein it is stated inter alia "that the amount in
the general trust fund interest account as of January 25, 1932, namely $68,905.05,
be transferred to the account entitled 'Consolidated Fund Reserve for Losses'
(formerly entitled 'Surplus from Consolidated Investments'), amounting January
25, 1932, to $23,975.30; and that the total in the latter fund, thus aggregating
$92,830.25, be subject to charges for losses from investments in the consolidated
group when duly authorized by this Board. Resolved, That in order to aid in
building up an adequate and safe reserve fund against losses in investments
of the consolidated trust funds, it is hereby ordered that for the fiscal year
1931-1932 there shall be transferred from income received from consolidated
investments to the account designated 'Consolidated Fund Reserve for Losses'
an amount equal to 5 per cent of the gross income earned by the consolidated




OCTOBER      MEETING, 1932                       53
trust funds for the year. After the year 1931-1932 or until further action of
this Board, there shall be apportioned semi-annually as of July 1 and January
1 each year to the surplus from consolidated investments a sum equal to 2 /
per cent of the earnings of said trust funds for the preceding six-month period.'
We understand that this resolution is to be amended to read 5 per cent of
semi-annual earnings instead of 2 2 per cent as authorized in the above resolution. We noted that the reserve fund had been set up in the books as authorized
and that the accounts have been correctly drawn up in accordance with the
aforementioned resolutions as at June 30, 1932.
During the course of our examination we noted that a portion of the income
of the Oliver Ditson Fund has been used for loans to students whereas the
instrument of gift directs that the income be used for the establishment of a
chair in music, scholarships in' music, or for musical performances. We also
noted that the income of certain other trust funds had not been transferred to
the principal amount as stated in the terms of gift.
The amounts of the Original Federal Endowment and Special Endowment,
known as the Treadwell Free Bed Fund, in the amounts of $548,384.40 and
$2,000, respectively, have not changed during the period under review and were
confirmed to us by a certificate from the State Administrative Board. We have
verified the amount of interest received during the period under review from
these funds in the amount of $38,403.72 and $50, respectively, as shown on
Schedule 3 of the Financial Report of the University.
PLANT FUNDS-INVESTED IN PLANT —$42,738,787
Our comments relative to the unexpended plant funds have been made in
a previous section of this report.
Schedule 12 of the Financial Report of the University shows the amounts
of the additions to the educational plant for the year ended June 30, 1932, and
of the sales and other disposition of property. We have examined recorded
deeds conveying all lands acquired during the period to the Regents of the
University and receipted vouchers and vendors' invoices in support of all major
expenditures for additions during the year to lands, buildings, land improvements and equipment. As in prior years, we have not been able to ascertain
definitely that all of the charges to the equipment account represent actual
additions and not replacements. The determination of which equipment items
had been replaced during the period could only be satisfactorily made by a
physical inventory and none has been taken for several years. We noted that
the additions to the property accounts included an amount of $18,000 representing the equity of Mosher-Jordan Halls in the building and equipment thereof
arising through the retirement during the year of dormitory trust certificates
in a like amount. Inasmuch as the dormitory will have no title in this property
until the bond issue has been retired, we are of the opinion that this item
should not be reflected in the accounts of the University.
GENERAL
In considering the annexed balance sheet and the Financial Report of the
University at June 30, 1932, it should be understood that they are based on
the cash actually received and disbursed by the University to that date with
the exception that accounts receivable uncollected at June 30, 1932, have been
included in the balance sheet as assets. The balance sheet is incomplete to the
extent that unaudited vouchers outstanding and items of accrued liabilities and
income have not been included.
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL ACCOUNTS
Our comments relative to the examination of the Hospital accounts receivable
have been made in a previous section of this report.
We have annexed hereto as Exhibit II a statement of the revenues and
expenditures of the University Hospital for the year ended June 30, 1932,
included in the Financial Report of the University as Schedule 20. As shown
on this statement, the excess of revenues over expenditures for the year ended
June 30, 1932, amounted to $7,501.31 after including deductions for provisions
for loss from bad debts in the amount of $53,074.63, transfers to the trust
fund for equipment replacements amounting to $57,754.23, and appropriation
for construction and equipment projects in process in the amount of $12,000.
This statemeni has been prepared to reflect the results of the financial conduct




54


OCTOBER MEETING, 1932


of the Hospital on the basis outlined and adopted by the Regents at their
meeting held on June 12, 1925, to the effect that the revenues of the Hospital
as determined on an accrual basis are expected to meet all expenditures concerned
with the care of patients. With this basis in mind, it should be understood
that the item designated as fees for board and room, etc., amounting to
$2,455,133.89 represents the accrued income for the year and not receipts.
It might be of interest in this connection to note that the sales and services
of the Hospital for the year as determined on a cash basis and represented by
actual net receipts amounted to $1,988,563.18 as shown in Schedule 3 of the
Financial Report.
Expenditures for salaries, wages, food, supplies, and other expenses, together
with equipment additions represent actual cash expenditures or appropriations.
These items, however, are practically stated on -an accrual basis for the reason
that efforts were made to include in the period under review payments for all
vouchers for expense items applicable thereto. The item of gas, water, and
electricity represents the expense thereof as determined by meter readings by the
University. The item of power plant expense comprises the portion determined
to be applicable to the Hospital through an apportionment of the power house
expense for the year over the several building groups of the University as
determined by the average cost on the bases of units of radiation, cubical content
and floor area. The item "Transfer to trust fund for equipment replacement"
represents the total amount of funds to be transferred from the general funds
of the University to the trust fund. This amount comprises the annual provision
for depreciation as computed by the Hospital less expenditures made during the
period under review in respect of equipment replacements and had not been
actually transferred as at June 30, 1932. The item captioned "Special alterations to buildings and equipment items" comprises the cost of construction of
a new mattress room and expenditures made during the period under review for
equipment and alterations in the X-Ray Department. The item "Transfer to
special account for construction and equipment projects in process" represents
the estimated cost of the installation of a new pneumatic tube system, which
construction had not been commenced as at June 30, 1932.
Yours very truly,
Price, Waterhouse & Co.
Detroit, Michigan, October 17, 1932
Regent Stone further presented the reports of Price, Waterhouse
& Co. upon the books and accounts of six dormitories for women and
the Lawyers Club, dormitory for men (R.P. 1929-1932, page 763).
A separate report for each dormitory was presented with a summary
including the Adelia Cheever House, Alumnae House, Betsy Barbour
House, Helen Newberry Residence, Lawyers Club, and Martha Cook
Building. The summary report for the six last named is as appears
below except that there is printed in these Proceedings only a statement of the net excess of operating income of each house instead of
the more detailed analysis thereof appearing in the auditors' report.

The report on our examination of the books and accounts of Mosher-Jordan
Halls for the year ended June 30, 1932, has been sent to you under separate
cover.
SCOPE OF AUDIT
As on previous occasions, our examination was directed primarily to a
verification of the cash receipts and disbursements for the periods under review
as shown by the books and of the changes in the assets and liabilities during
the periods.
RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS
The following comparative summary shows the excess of operating income
by dormitories for the respective periods under review:
Adelia Cheever House, for the year ended June 30, 1932..........$ 1,091.05
Alumnae House, for the year ended June 30, 1932..............       98.44
Betsy Barbour House, for the year ended August 31, 1932........ 7,241.09
Helen Newberry Residence, for the year ended August 31, 1932.....  7,292.81
Lawyers Club, for the year ended June 30, 1932.................. 31,250.08
Martha Cook Building, for the year ended June 30, 1932.......... 8,106.41
The above statement has been prepared to reflect uncollected receivables as
at the end of the respective periods as well as receipts and payments. In so far
as we were able to determine, the accounts payable at the end of the period in
respect of expense items amounted to:Betsy  Barbour  House..........................$147.05
Helen Newberry Residence..................... 741.75
Together..............................$888.80
In view of the amount involved, the item of $741.75, in respect of Helen
Newberry Residence, has been placed on the books as of the end of the period
and is reflected in the balance sheet.
PROPERTY ACCOUNTS
We have verified the current additions to the property and equipment
accounts by reference to the relative vendors' invoices and other documentary




56                  OCTOBER      MEETING, 1932
evidence and have satisfied ourselves as to the propriety thereof. In the case
of the Helen Newberry Residence, certain household equipment was sold during
the period and, as it was not possible to ascertain the original cost thereof, the
proceeds in the amount of $25 have been credited to the property account.
INVESTMENTS IN BONDS AND MORTGAGES
The investments of the dormitories in bonds and notes receivable secured by
first mortgages on real estate are kept under the control of the investment officer
of the University of Michigan for safekeeping. At the time of our count of the
securities held by the investment officer as at June 30, 1932, the securities held
for the dormitories were inspected. In the case of securities purchased subsequent
to the date of our inspection, we have examined the records in respect thereof and
have been furnished with certificates signed by the investment officer to the
effect that these securities were actually on hand at the date of the close of
the period under review. For your information, we have prepared the following
brief summary by dormitories of the bond values as at the close of the respective
periods:
Carrying    Market
Dormitory                Par V         alue  V      alue Value
Betsy Barbour House.................$19,000.00   $17,895.00  $15,280.00
The  Lawyers  Club....................  64,000.00  63,701.31  38,101.25
Martha Cook Building................. 12,000.00    11,910.00   9,310.00
Totals......................$95,000.00  $93,506.31  $62,691.25
No adjustment in this respect, however, has been made in the attached
accounts.
INVENTORIES
Physical inventories of groceries on hand as at the close of the respective
periods were taken at Betsy Barbour House, The Lawyers Club and Martha
Cook Building and valued at cost. We have verified the clerical accuracy of
the inventories and have satisfied ourselves as to the basis of pricing by reference to vendors' invoices.
NOTES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
This item represents, principally, uncollected board and room rentals owing
by residents and applicable to the periods under review as shown by the following
summary:Dormitory                                   A mount
Alumnae   House....................................          $   81.00
Adelia  Cheever  House..............................             70.90
Betsy  Barbour  House...............................             63.00
Helen  Newberry  Residence...........................           374.00
The Lawyers Club:
Board and room  rentals.........................$ 555.79
Estate of W. W. Cook.......................... 8,394.04
Sundry......................................     20.66   8,970.49
Martha Cook Building..............................               140.24
T otal.....................................          $9,699.63
No provision has been made in the annexed accounts for possible loss on the
realization of these accounts.
CASH ON DEPOSIT WITH THE CASHIER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
We have reconciled the balances as shown by the books of the dormitories
as at the end of the respective periods with the relative balances as shown by
the pass books kept by the Cashier's Office of the University of Michigan. We
have traced all recorded receipts and deposits for the periods under review to the
accounts of the University Cashier and have examined all cash receipt tickets
to ascertain that receipts for board, room rentals, room deposits and miscellaneous
items had been properly accounted for. In this connection we should mention
that certain receipt tickets of the Martha Cook Building aggregating $1,741.40
had been entered in the cash book as $1,750.75 and we were not able to obtain
a satisfactory explanation as to this net difference. We noted, however, that
the amount of $1,750.75 had been included in the funds deposited with the
Cashier of the University of Michigan. All disbursement vouchers drawn on the




OCTOBER MEETING, 1932


57


accounts of the University Cashier were examined and vendors' invoices or other
documentary evidence to substantiate these disbursements were scrutinized by us
for the purpose of determining the propriety thereof. In the case of Betsy
Barbour House and the Helen Newberry Residence, there were numerous
instances in which we were not able to determine the nature of the disbursements
owing to the lack of information. Generally, salary and wage rates were not
verified by us for the reason that no formal authorizations in this connection
by the respective Boards of Governors are on file and we should mention that, in
connection with the student pay roll at the Adelia Cheever House, we ascertained
that no records of the working time or rates of wages were kept and, accordingly,
we were not able to satisfy ourselves as to the correctness thereof. We have
suggested that in the future periodical pay roll statements be prepared and that
the students be required to receipt the statements for the amount of wages applied
against their respective board and room charges. We also noted that, generally,
checks drawn by the dormitories on the accounts of the University Cashier are
not accompanied by the supporting detail when presented at the Cashier's Office
for signature. Although the disbursements shown by the books of the dormitories appeared to be in order, the distribution of the charges in respect thereof
was not always made to the proper accounts. We, however, have not attempted
to make a redistribution of the charges for the reason that the net adjustments
would result in relatively small transfers between the several expense accounts.
We have made thorough tests of the accuracy of the footings of the cash
books and purchase registers and of the postings from the accounts in these
books to the relative accounts in the general ledgers.
IMPREST CASH REVOLVING FUNDS
We have reconciled the balances in these funds as at the close of the
respective periods with certificates obtained from the depositary banks. In addition, we have made thorough tests of the accounting for and the propriety of
the disbursements from these funds and have ascertained that all reimbursing
checks drawn upon the accounts with the University Cashier have been properly
treated.
RESERVE FOR ROOM    DEPOSIT REFUNDS
Room deposit accounts were adjusted by us, when required, to show the
liability outstanding as at the end of the respective periods in respect of the
amounts subject to refund to applicants for residence at the expiration of the
terms thereof.
GENERAL
The internal control over the bookkeeping systems of the Adelia Cheever
House and the Helen Newberry Residence, generally, is unsatisfactory. The
organization of the Adelia Cheever House, however, is too small to permit an
adequate check and we have suggested that, as a matter of mutual protection,
the director of the House be bonded. In the case of the Helen Newberry
Residence, the condition of the records caused us to spend more time on our
examination than should have been necessary. We should also mention that
the bank reconciliations of the imprest cash revolving fund had not been made
for the last five months of the fiscal year and that it was necessary for us to
visit the depositary bank in order to obtain the paid cancelled checks for that
period.
Yours very truly,
Price, Waterhouse & Co.

The Regents of the University of Michigan,
Detroit, Michigan.
Dear Sir:
In accordance with instructions we have made an examination of the books
and accounts of Mosher-Jordan Halls for the year ended June 30, 1932, and

SCOPE OF AUDIT
As on the previous occasion, our examination has been directed primarily
to a verification of the assets and liabilities as at June 30, 1932, and of the
results from operations for the year ended on that date. Our examination,
however, did not include a detailed check of the cash and other transactions
for the period under review, except as hereinafter mentioned, and our report
is submitted subject to this general qualification.
RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS
The operations of the dormitory for the year ended June 30, 1932, after
deductions for depreciation, rental payments, and provision for probable losses
on receivables, resulted in a profit of $10,632.52 as compared with a profit
of $33,415.29 for the previous period and as shown by the following condensed

Depreciation has been provided during the year ended June 30, 1932, at
the rates established in the dormitory lease of /2 of 1 per cent per annum of
the cost of the building and 8 per cent per annum of the cost of the equipment.
The changes which have taken place during the year in the reserves for
depreciation, shown on the attached balance sheet (Exhibit I) under the caption
of "Appropriated Surplus," are summarized as follows:


Reserves for Depreciation
Particulars              Building  Equipment  Together
Balance  at  July  1,  1931................  $3,322.87  $  6,051.81  $  9,374.68
Add:
Provided during the year ended June 30,
1932..........................  3,987.43  11,051.94  15,039.37
Interest received during the year ended
June 30, 1932, on investments of the
funded reserve..................   13.94     181.02     194.96
Together..................$7,324.24  $17,284.77  $24,609.01

Balance  at  June  30,  1932..............$7,324.24  $11,927.23  $19,251.47




The balance of the reserve for depreciation as at July 1, 1931, in the
amount of $9,374.68 was funded by a transfer of cash from the general funds
of the dormitory to a special fund and placed under the control of the University
for investment purposes. This item in the amount of $9,569.64 is shown on the
annexed balance sheet (Exhibit I) under the caption "Funds for Special Purposes." The income received during the year under review from this fund, the
greater portion of which is invested in Ann Arbor mortgages, has been credited
to the reserve for depreciation as shown in the foregoing summary. As in the
previous period, the cost of additional equipment and equipment replacements
purchased during the current year has been charged against the reserve for
depreciation and this procedure has been agreed to by the Trustee.
The cash fund in the amount of $47,221.67 on deposit with the Trustee at
June 30, 1932, has been reconciled with a certificate received from the depositary
bank. This item is comprised of the following amounts:
Unexpended construction funds set aside for the redemption
of trust certificates, together with bank interest thereon
to  June  30,  1932................................  $20,497.70
Excess of rental payments over the amount of interest on
trust certificates paid to June 30, 1932, together with
bank interest thereon to that date..................  10,091.44
Excess of operating surplus for the year ended June 30, 1931,
deposited with the Trustee in accordance with the terms
of the dormitory lease, over the amount paid for the
purchase of the trust certificates retired during the period
under review, together with bank interest thereon to
June  30,  1932..................................  16,632.53
Total........................................  $47,221.67
FUNDS FOR SPECIAL PURPOSES —$13,348.76
The cash funds amounting to $4,498.76 on deposit as at June 30, 1932,
have been reconciled with certificates furnished to us by the depositaries and
mortgages of a face value at June 30, 1932, of $8,850.00 were produced for
our inspection. The item shown on the balance sheet (Exhibit I) as funds in the
hands of the Trustee for the payment of the ground rent in the amount of
$1,663.37 represents the present value of the annual ground rental of $100.00
for a period of twenty-six years and three months, the period covered by the
lease.
CURRENT ASSETS-$26,559.91
The notes receivable in the amount of $1,672.15 were produced for our
inspection and we have listed the detail of the accounts receivable from the
subsidiary record and the total thereof amounting to $4,021.10 was found to be




60


OCTOBER MEETING, 1932


in agreement with the controlling account in the general ledger. The collectibility of the notes and accounts receivable was discussed with responsible
officials in whose opinion the reserve for uncollected receivables in the amount
of $2,899.49 appears to be adequate for the purpose.
The cash on deposit with the University Cashier as at June 30, 1932, in
the amount of $23,766.15 was reconciled with a certificate obtained from the
University. During the course of our examination we made thorough test-checks
of the cash receipts from room rentals and board to ascertain that these items
had been properly accounted for. In addition, we checked in detail the cash
receipts for the months of September, 1931, February and June, 1932, as
evidenced by the cash receipt tickets, against the relative entries appearing in
the cash book and traced all recorded receipts into the funds on deposit with
the University Cashier. Disbursements made during the months of October, 1931,
January and May, 1932, were supported by vendors' invoices, vouchers and
other documentary evidence, and we made extensive test-checks of the accuracy
of the distribution of the charges in the cash disbursements record. Thorough
tests of the accuracy of the footings of the cash receipts and disbursements
record were made and the postings to the controlling accounts of these books
were traced to the general ledger and found to be in order.
TRUST CERTIFICATES AND SURPLUS APPLICABLE THERETO- $982,857.64
The balance of the trust certificates outstanding as at June 30, 1932, in
the amount of $937,000.00 was confirmed to us by a certificate received from
the Trustee thereof.
The item captioned "Reserve for Redemption of Trust Certificates" in the
amount of $27,857.64 is comprised of the following amounts:
Interest credited by bank to June 30, 1932, on the amount
of unexpended construction funds set aside for the
redemption  of  trust  certificates.....................  $  1,133.67
Excess of rental payments over the amount of interest paid
on trust certificates to June 30, 1932, together with bank
interest  thereon  to  that  date......................  10,091.44
Excess of the operating surplus for the year ended June 30,
1931, deposited with the Trustee in accordance with the
terms of the dormitory lease, over the amount expended
for the purchase of the trust certificates retired during
the period under review, together with bank interest
thereon  to  June  30,  1932........................  16,632.53
T otal......................................  $27,857.64
The item  of surplus invested in plant and equipment in the amount of
$18,000 represents the equity of the dormitory in the physical plant arising
through the retirement of trust certificates in a like amount.
DEFERRED CREDITS TO FUTURE INCOME-$6,245.56
This item represents revenue from room rentals and board collected in
advance at June 30, 1932, but not earned at that date and is, in our opinion,
properly deferred to future operations.
RESERVES-$3,779.12
This amount is a contra account to certain items appearing on the annexed
balance sheet (Exhibit I) under the caption "Funds for Special Purposes."
The reserve for room deposits in the amount of $2,115.75 represents a
liability to residents who were required to make deposits at the time of applications for rooms during the college year 1932-1933. These deposits will be
refunded at the expiration of the term of residence less any charges for damage
and breakage.
Yours very truly,
Price, Waterhouse & Co.
Detroit, Michigan, September 6, 1932
The Regents referred with power to a committee consisting of the
President, the Finance Committee of the Board, the Vice-President
and Secretary, and the attorney of the Board whatever questions arise,




OCTOBER MEETING, 1932


61


if any, in obtaining funds to meet necessary bills, including payrolls,
during the remaining months of this calendar year.
In accordance with its terms and conditions, none of which is in
any way influential upon the investigators in their endeavor to determine scientific facts, or in publicity for the facts when obtained,
the Board accepted the tender by the Kellogg Company of Battle
Creek, Michigan, of the sum of $20,000 to be used for researches
in the effect of caffeine, under the direct supervision of Professor C. W.
Edmunds, during the coming period of two years. The thanks of the
Regents were voted to the Kellogg Company.
The Secretary reported the receipt from Dr. S. R. Light of Kalamazoo, Medical Class of 1904, of the sum of $5,000 sent by him as
executor under the will of his deceased wife, Winifred U. Light, and
of the further sum of $5,000 sent by him personally to augment the
bequest made by his wife. The deed of gift, including the terms and
conditions of Mrs. Light's bequest, are as follows:
The will of my deceased wife, Winifred U. Light, provides a bequest to
the University of the sum of Five Thousand ($5,000) Dollars, under the following clause:"I do hereby direct my said Trustee to pay out of the income of said Trust
Fund, within five (5) years after my death, the sum of Five Thousand ($5,000)
Dollars to the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, said sum being
for the foundation of a scholarship in the Medical Department of the University
of Michigan, to be known as the "Light Scholarship"; said Fund being hereby
given and bequeathed to said Board of Regents in trust, for such purpose."
I desire to tender to the University of Michigan a similar additional sum
of Five Thousand ($5,000) Dollars, the total of Ten Thousand ($10,000)
Dollars to constitute the "Winifred U. Light Memorial Loan Fund," and to
be administered by the Regents in accordance with the terms of the bequest
and the following interpretative or additional conditions:The total sum of Ten Thousand ($10,000) Dollars is to be invested and
reinvested from time to time in safe securities in accordance with your best
judgment and the interest is to be available for loans to junior and/or senior
medical students, with preference, if any, to the latter class.
Notes for the repayment of loans are to be for not more than one (1) year,
but with privilege of renewal until three (3) years after graduation. Notes
should all be paid in any event within five (5) years after graduation. Interest
at three (3) per cent or other low rate may be charged at the discretion of the
committee named below, and the University Treasurer. It is recommended,
though not definitely a condition, that the loan be protected by a life insurance
policy.
The beneficiaries or borrowers are to be determined by a committee consisting of the chief administrative officer of the Medical School by whatever
title, the Professor of Surgery, the Professor of Medicine, and the Chairman
of the University Committee on Student Loan Funds established by the Regents,
at present the Dean of Students.
As payments of the loans and interest thereon are made, such payments
shall be added to the original principal sum of Ten Thousand ($10,000) Dollars
and invested as nearly as practical in the same manner as the original principal
sum.
If the income on the fund is sufficient to permit, the loan to a student shall
not be less than Six Hundred ($600) Dollars per year, except that if income exceeds Six Hundred ($600) Dollars per year, the excess may, in accordance with
the judgment of the committee be loaned in smaller amounts to another student
needing a loan, and when the excess over the first Six Hundred ($600) Dollars
is sufficient to permit, a second loan of Six Hundred ($600) Dollars shall be
made to a second student and excess over the two loans shall again be loaned
in accordance with the judgment of the committee. This plan shall be followed
to establish, if possible, loans in units of Six Hundred ($600) Dollars each,
as rapidly as accumulations to the fund provide sufficient income for the purpose.
Before a loan shall be granted, the committee shall be thoroughly convinced




62


OCTOBER MEETING, 1932


of the applicant's real need for assistance; and it shall be considered a ground
for refusal of the application if it is found that a loan is desired as a mere
matter of convenience to avoid the necessity of earnest effort on the part of
the applicant to obtain the necessary money otherwise. Loans shall not be
made to students having expensive habits or to those belonging to recognizedly
expensive societies or organizations.
In the event accidental or unforeseen unfortunate circumstances develop in
the life of the borrower before return of the loan has been completed, so that
the return of the balance in the judgment of the committee would be unduly
burdensome upon the borrower or his estate, the committee shall cancel the
loan and forego its repayment.
Should the present status of medical education be changed to the extent
that it should become the opinion of the Regents of the University or their
successors in office that this fund is no longer needed for students in medicine,
or in the event of the establishment of "State Medicine" or any other program
making it more or less incumbent upon the State or any other organization to
provide medical education, then, within the discretion of the Regents of the
University of Michigan, or their successors in office, the income of the Winifred
U. Light Memorial Loan Fund shall be used for such educational purpose as
shall seem to the committee herein created or their successors most desirable for
the benefit of the Medical School of the University of Michigan.
Dated this 7th day of October, A.D. 1932.
The Board authorized the acceptance of the "Winifred U. Light
Memorial Loan Fund" under its terms and conditions, and directed
that the thanks of the Regents should be transmitted to Dr. Light.
The President reported with respect to additional means of publicity for the University's activities (page 36). After discussion, the
matter was referred back to the President and the Vice-President and
Secretary for further consideration and report.
The claim of Samuel French vs. the Michigan Union and the
University of Michigan Mimes, presented through his attorney, Mr.
J. D. Lawrence of Ypsilanti, was referred with power to the Executive
Committee and the attorney of the Board.
The Secretary called attention to the more condensed typographical form in which the minutes of the Board were being printed, and
to the lowered cost involved in the changed form.
The Secretary filed for record the fact that it was possible for
Mr. Carlton F. Wells to accept the year's leave of absence granted
him (page 4) through a gift by an anonymous donor of approximately
$3,500. It was the belief of the donor that in making possible the
year of foreign study for this member of the Faculty, he was acting
for the benefit of the University itself. The drafts on London, sent
to the University by the donor, were endorsed to Mr. Wells without
passing through the University treasury, but proper journal records
were made in the University books.
The Board approved payment of the bill for legal services of
Burke and Burke for the six months' period from March 1, 1932, to
October 1, 1932, in the amount of $1,759.60.
Regent Hlubbard's traveling expense vouchers in the sum of $304.46
were approved for the period from June 16, 1931, to October 25, 1932,
inclusive.
The Board directed the renewal of the Fidelity bond covering
University employees, on the basis of a commercial blanket bond in
the sum of $50,000, with a coverage of $100,000 each upon the
following:- Vice-President and Secretary, the Assistant Secretary and
Controller, Investment Officer, and the Cashier (R.P. 1929-1932, pages
724 and 448).




OCTOBER MEETING, 1932

A tentative allotment of $231,686.57 was made to the Summer
Session of 1933, subject to revision should circumstances subsequently
require (R.P. 1929-1932, page 763).
The Budget Director of the State, having requested that the usual
blank form be filled out indicating the University's estimates for the
biennium 1933-1934, the Regents directed that these be filed with a
mill tax estimate of $3,768,584.84, based on the present equalized
valuation, and further directed that if after discussion with the Budget
Director it was deemed advisable, attention be called upon the blanks
to the need for an administration building.
The President notified the Regents that a check for $750 had been
received from the Monsanto Chemical Works of St. Louis in fulfillment of that Company's renewal of the Monsanto Chemical Works
Fellowship, for research under Professor Gomberg (R.P. 1929-1932,
page 961).

November Meeting, 1932
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, NOVEMBER 25, 1932
The Board was called to order in the Regents' Room at 3:30 P.M.
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, Regent Clements, Regent
Shorts, Regent Cram, and Regent Stone. Absent, Regent Murfin,
Regent Hubbard, Regent Smith, who later took his seat, and Superintendent Pearce.  There were also in attendance Vice-President
Yoakum, Dr. F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G. Watkins, and the Secretary.
The customary financial reports were filed.
The minutes of the meeting of October 28 were approved as submitted to the Regents in press proof.
Regent Smith took his seat.
Regent Clements reported for the Buildings and Grounds Committee that Mr. Albert Kahn of Detroit had, on request, presented
plans for an addition to the President's house to provide office space
for the President (page 36). The Regents appropriated not to exceed
$7,500 for building this addition and for whatever equipment may be
necessary for proper furnishings.
Regent Beal reported on the successful meeting of the Association
of Governing Boards of State Universities and Allied Institutions
which convened in Ann Arbor on November 16 (R.P. 1929-1932,
page 908).
The Secretary reported that a long-time lease, originally made by
the Regents to Angus and Frederick L. Smith (R.P. 1917-1920, page
780) and by Messrs. Smith assigned to the Briggs Investment Company (R.P. 1923-1926, page 513), had now been reassigned by the Briggs
Company to Rudolph H. Schmittdiel of Detroit. This latest assignment
has been recorded in Wayne County, Liber 3862 of Deeds, page 487.
It has been examined in connection with the terms of the original
lease by the attorney for the Regents and has been approved by him.
The Board denied the request of approximately sixty-five resident
students of Ann Arbor to change the terms of the so-called automobile
ban (R.P.:1929-1932, page 837).
Secretary Smith presented a proposal from Mr. George H. Sandenburgh, Ann Arbor City Engineer, for the crossing of certain University of Michigan property with a sewer line which will serve as a
necessary part of a sewage disposal plant if and when constructed
(R.P. 1929-1932, page 937). The whole matter was referred to the
Buildings and Grounds Committee and the attorney of the Regents
with power, provided that it is possible for the City to sell an issue
of bonds amounting to $150,000 with which it is proposed to finance
the project.  '''Actions of the Executive Committee were approved as recorded
in the minutes of the committee as follows (page 37):October 11, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Dean Alice C. Lloyd, the committee changed the title of
Miss Ethel McCormick to Social Director of Women, Office of the Dean of




66                  NOVEMBER MEETING, 1932
Women, effective with the beginning of the University year 1932-1933. Miss
McCormick's former title was Assistant Professor of Physical Education for
Women, and Social Director in the Office of the Dean of Women, but, inasmuch
as her duties now lie entirely outside the Department of Physical Education for
Women, it was thought best to change her title to agree with her present position.
October 14, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Dean Bates, the committee approved the appointment of
four instructors of the Department of Economics, to proctor the preliminary
examination in first-year courses through the current University year.  It is
understood that they are to be paid at the rate of $1.00 an hour out of the
appropriation in the Law School budget for proctors and readers. The names
of the appointees are as follows: William T. Crandell, Donald C. Horton, Lloyd
E. Devol, and Roland I. Robinson.
October 16, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Dean Effinger, and with the approval of Professor Strauss,
Chairman of the Department of English Language and Literature, the sum of
$500 was appropriated from the unexpended balance in the Salary budget of that
Department, as an honorarium for Professor Robert Frost who will come to the
University for a series of lectures and consultations with students at the invitation of the Department of English Language and Literature.
October 17, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation by Dean Sadler and with the approval of Professor A.
E. White, Director of the Department of Engineering Research, the committee
directed that certain members of the staff of the Department of Engineering Research shall, until further notice is given, be paid in accordance with the following provisions, effective as of July 1, 1932: —
1. That two rates should be established for each member of the research
staff, namely, a base "on-project" rate which should correspond to the salary
received prior to July 1, 1932, and a base "off-project" rate which in the lower
salary ranges should in general be the same as the base "on-project" rate, in
the other ranges less than the base "on-project" rate, and in no case higher than
$4,200;
2. That the base "on-project" rate should be subject to the 6 or 8 per cent
reduction effective July 1, 1932;
3. That the base "off-project" rate should be subject to a 25 per cent
reduction effective July 1, 1932;
4. That each man should be paid (a) at the reduced "on-project" rate for
the amount chargeable to projects, and (b) at the reduced "off-project" rate for
the time not represented by the amount paid at the "on-project" rate;
5. That the amounts paid at the "off-project" rate should be paid out of
the Department of Engineering Research-Current account; and
6. That all "off-project" compensation should expire automatically at the
end of three months, unless specifically renewed by the Financial Control Committee of the Department of Engineering Research, with the approval of the
Regents; that is, that the continuation of payment for time not chargeable to
projects and the effective "off-project" rates to'be used. if such payment is continued should be subject to review every- three months, with downward revision
of the effective "off-project" rate, if necessary.
November 12, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation of Librarian William W. Bishop and Dean John R.
Effinger, the committee appointed Mrs. Harriet P. Sawyer Associate Professor of
Library Science for the second semester of the University year 1932-1933, with
salary at the rate of $4,000 per University year. It is understood that Mrs.
Sawyer will replace Associate Professor Margaret Mann, who will be on leave
of absence during the period of Mrs. Sawyer's appointment (page 48). No addition to the Salary budget of the Department of Library Science will be necessitated by this action, inasmuch as Mrs. Sawyer's salary will be paid from the
trust fund  designated "Carnegie  Corporation  Studies in  Library  Science"
(page 34).

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1932


In accordance with a request from the Alumnae Council, formulated at the Council's meeting on October 28, the Regents voted that
instead of placing $3.00 from the Michigan League element of the
annual fee of women students in the University of Michigan League
Endowment Fund, such portion of the annual fee of each woman student should for the academic year 1932-1933 and thereafter, until
further action of the Regents or until the necessity no longer existed,
be applied to the reduction of bank loans made by the Alumnae
Council in lieu of a certain large subscription the maker of which has
found himself unable for the present to meet the current amounts due.
It was specifically provided that the portions of the annual fee thus
diverted from the originally intended object should be applied to the
reduction of principal of the bank loans in question and not to the
payment of interest thereon or to any other purpose whatsoever, and
secondly, it was specifically provided that when the said bank loans
were retired, payments on the subscription in question, or on any
subscription under similar circumstances, should go in their entirety
into the University of Michigan League Endowment Fund (R.P. 1929 -1932, page 170, and R.P. 1926-1929, page 966).
The Secretary reported the following contracts made by the Department of Engineering Research (page 39):With the American Injector Company, Detroit, for study of anti-glare
windshields; at an estimated cost of $500
With the Ingersoll Milling Machine Company, Rockford, Illinois, for investigation of surface measurements of machined parts; at an estimated cost of
$1,000
Renewal of contract with The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, for
study of tire noise; at an estimated cost not in excess of $1,000 for November,
$1,200 for December, and $1,000 per month thereafter until such time as the
work may be terminated or modified by fifteen days' written notice.

Elsie R. Fuller, Secretary to the Principal of the University High School, for

To correct an error in the wording of a resolution adopted at the
January meeting, 1932 (R.P. 1929-1932, page 840) the Board readopted the second resolution appearing on the indicated page, in the
following form:Resolved, That in order to aid in building up an adequate and safe reserve
fund against losses in investments of the consolidated trust funds, it is hereby
ordered that, for the fiscal year 1931-1932, there shall be transferred from income received from consolidated investments to the account designated "Consolidated Fund Reserve for Losses" an amount equal to 5 per cent of the gross
income earned by the consolidated trust funds for the year. After the year 1931 -1932, or until further action of this Board, there shall be apportioned semiannually as of July 1 and January 1 each year to the surplus from consolidated
investments a sum equal to 5 per cent of the earnings of said trust funds for
the preceding six-month period.
The Regents appropriated the sum of $450 to reprint in an edition
of 2,000 copies The University of Michigan-A Description, which was
originally prepared in 1930 and which has proved very useful for
presentation to various groups visiting the University and to individuals who write for information of this character.
The Regents approved the payment of salary for November,
amounting to $94, to the widow of the late Theodore Penix, Laboratory Attendant in Pathology, who died November 7, 1932.
The Board referred with power to a committee, consisting of the
Vice-President and Secretary and the attorney of the Regents, questions involved in an appeal for aid from the mother of Charles Atchison, a young boy who accidentally met his death on University property on October 24, 1932.
The Secretary reported that Mr. John L. Pierce of the Class of
1901 had notified the Business Office of the fact that it was no longer
feasible for him to pay the premiums upon the insurance policy which
he had assigned to the University (R.P. 1926-1929, page 809), and
that it was the recommendation of both Mr. Pierce and the Secretary that the Regents should take the cash value of the policy and
apply it to the purpose for which the assignment was made. The
Board directed that such a course be pursued.
The Vice-President and Secretary presented a telegram announcing
that the Court has awarded a judgment of $30,000 for the so-called
Hunt lands in Humboldt County, California, in the condemnation
suit of the State of California vs. Mrs. Hunt, the Regents, et al (R.P.
1929-1932, page 861).
The President filed the annual report of the Board in Control of
Athletics (R.P. 1929-1932, page 770), signed by Professor Ralph W.
Aigler, Chairman. The report covered the period from July 1, 1931,
to June 30, 1932, and the following are extracts:

It will be noticed from the above tables that as against $105,000.00 received
from short term bank loans, the sum of $110,000.00 was used in paying off such
loans. This represents a reduction in indebtedness of $5,000.00. These tables
also show $41,631.90 credited to "Plant Additions."  Upwards of $31,000.00
of this sum, however, represents payments upon the construction of the Intramural Sports Building. That building was finished and occupied several years
ago and the final payments, which now appear in this year's report as an addition
to the plant, have been held up by litigation until the early part of 1932. The
board has admittedly owed this amount for these several years and although
the item appears under the heading of "Plant Additions," it really represents a
reduction in indebtedness. The significance of this, of course, lies in the fact
that during the year covered by this report, trying though it was from the point
of view of financing, nevertheless a net reduction in indebtedness of between
$35,000.00 and $40,000.00 was accomplished.
In keeping with the reductions in salaries of members of the University
staff generally, reductions beginning with the year 1932-1933 were made in the
salaries of those carried on the rolls of the Board in Control of Athletics. The
following table shows the salaries for the year 1932-33 of the members of the
coaching staff:Harry G. Kipke, Football Coach..........................$6,440
Franklin C. Cappon, Basketball Coach.................... 5,060
Ray L. Fisher, Baseball Coach........................... 4,600
Charles B. Hoyt, Track Coach........................... 4,600
Jack L. Blott, Assistant Coach........................... 4,140

There seems to be a general impression that attendances at the football
games of the 1932 season were markedly less than at the games of the preceding
year. However it may be at other places, the figures show that the total
attendance at the games in which the Michigan team took part was not much
less than last year. The following tables show the paid attendances at the




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1932                           77
games for both seasons. However, the falling off in receipts is somewhat larger
than that indicated by the falling off in attendance as the admission prices for
some of the games were cut.

Permission was granted to Dean Marcus L. Ward of the School of
Dentistry to prepare an exhibit for the Century of Progress Exhibition
to be held in Chicago next year, with the understanding that the material will be returned to the School of Dentistry in as good condition
as is possible under the circumstances.
The following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That full-time members of the staff may engage in governmental
activities for compensation, or hold or announce their candidacy for an elective
public office, other than local or county offices, only with the consent of the
Board of Regents.
The Regents designated.Professor John G. Winter as Director of
the University of Michigan Institute of Archaeological Research for
the term ending June 30, 1933, to succeed Professor Campbell Bonner
whose term expired with the academic year 1931-1932 (R.P. 1929 -1932, page 610).
The President reported the receipt of a check for $100 from an
anonymous donor for research work on cancer. This gift is to be
credited to the special fund "Research for Tissue Culture," (R.P.
1929-1932, page 957).
The President, for himself and the Vice-President and Secretary,
reported progress in the study of University publicity (page 62).
The following resolution adopted unanimously by the National
Academy of Sciences at the recent meeting in Ann Arbor was filed for
record (R.P. 1929-1932, page 867):Resolved, That the Home Secretary be requested to express to the President
and Faculty of the University of Michigan and to the members of the Academy
resident in Ann Arbor, the appreciation of the National Academy of Sciences
of the courtesies extended to the Academy during the present autumn meeting.
On recommendation of the proper authority in each case degrees
and a certificate were voted as follows:

December Meeting, 1932


UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, DECEMBER 30, 1932
The Board was called to order in the Regents' Room at 3:40 P.M.
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Murfin, Regent Beal, Regent
Smith, Regent Cram, and Regent Stone. Absent, Regent Clements, Regent Hubbard, Regent Shorts, and Superintendent Pearce. There were
also in attendance Vice-President Yoakum, Vice-President Bruce, Mr.
H. G. Watkins, and the Secretary.
The customary financial reports were filed.
The minutes of the meeting of November 25 were approved as submitted to the Regents in press proof.
The Regents directed payment from the Woodward Avenue Lease
fund of the sum of $41.85 for reimbursement td the executors of the
estate of the late Mrs. Charles H. Stowell of the cost of packing and
shipping to the University, from Lowell, Massachusetts, of certain miscellaneous items for the Department of Anatomy, the Library, and the
Michigan League (page 83).
The Board directed the payment of an itemized bill of $1,226.79 to
Morrison, Hohfeld, Foerster, Shuman, and Clark, attorneys at law, San
Francisco, California, for expenses involved in the trial of the condemnation suit of the state of California to secure possession for the State
of the so-called Hunt lands in Humboldt County, California. These expenses included the sum of $500 to Mr. H. C. Nelson, as local counsel
in Humboldt County (page 73).
The Secretary was directed to report on the present and prospective
value of remaining lands owned by the University, under deed from
Mr. and Mrs. Hunt, either or both.
The Secretary was also directed to consider with the attorney of the
Board and to report upon the proper means, under terms of the deed,
by which the University could be reimbursed for expenses either involved in this suit or otherwise growing out of the ownership of these
lands.
The following resolution was adopted, which the President was requested to communicate to Mr. Herbert W. Clark of the firm of Morrison, Hohfeld, Foerster, Shuman, and Clark:Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby express to
Mr. Herbert W. Clark, A.B. 1905, A.M. 1906, LL.B. 1908, and now an eminent
member of the Bar of the state of California, the thanks of his University for the
generous gift of his time and his abilities in the protection of the interests of the
University in the recent suit instituted by the state of California to acquire possession, for State park purposes, of certain lands in Humboldt County conveyed in
trust to the Regents, many years ago, by Mrs. Margaret E. Hunt.
The Board directed the payment, from the budget provision for
legal fees and expenses, of the sums of $168 and $162, respectively,
comprising the expense of foreclosure of two mortgages in the Levi L.
Barbour fund.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1932


The following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That it shall continue to be the policy of the Regents to meet
expenses involved in the care and protection of University trust funds out of the
general funds of the University unless the Regents shall make specific exception.
The Board transferred the sum of $1,500 from earnings in the De.
partment of Engineering Research Current account to a fund in the
Department of Physics, to be used to carry on during the Summer Session of 1933 the Symposium in Physics. which has been a feature of
recent summers.
The President and Secretary were requested to report at the next
meeting upon the suggestion that Mr. Wilfred B. Shaw, Director of the
Bureau of Alumni Relationsi be accorded the privilege of purchasing,
at the joint expense of the University and himself, an old-age annuity.
The Board added the sum of $300 to the Salary account of the
Bureau of Cooperation with Educational Institutions, to provide extra
clerical assistance by the hour during the present University year.
The following reports of the Finance Committee were approved and
ratified (page 67):December 14, 1932
Present, Regent Stone and Regent Murfin. Also, Mr. S. W. Smith and Mr.
J. E. Schmidt.
Those members of the committee present voted that the best interests of all
concerned would be served by the transfer to the Consolidated fund of all of the
investments of the Marion LeRoy Burton fund and of the Thomas Henry Simpson
Memorial fund. This action might have been taken at any time since the Consolidated fund was established, as the type of investment in which these two funds
have been placed is of the type eligible for investment of the Consolidated fund.
These are the only two funds with investments of this type that are not already
in the Consolidated fund. The Burton fund and the Simpson fund will thus have
the benefit of the reserves against losses and will contribute to those reserves.
The committee's action with respect to the Thomas Henry Simpson Memorial
fund was not taken until after consultation with Mr. Henry Slyfield, the personal
attorney of Mrs. Simpson. The committee directed that the transfers of the present
investments of these two funds should be made as of January 1, 1933, at their
present book value and on a flat (nonaccrual) basis.
Regent Shorts later concurred in the above action, making it unanimous.

Actions of the Executive Committee were approved and ratified as
recorded in the minutes and report of the committee, as follows (page
65):November 30, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Dean Clare E. Griffin of the School of Business Administration and with the approval of Dean Kraus, the sum of $352.66 was transferred
from the budget of the present year of the Bureau of Business Research to the
Summer Session budget for 1933 to provide salary during the Summer Session for
Assistant Professor Malcolm L. McElroy, who will give the instruction which it
was originally planned would be given by Dean Griffin. Inasmuch as Dean Griffin's
duties will be concerned more especially with the work of the Bureau of Business
Research during the Summer Session period, it seems perfectly proper to make the
transfer as requested with the understanding that no precedent is created thereby.




DECEMIBER MEETING, 1932                             81
December 2, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee set aside out of the Woodward Avenue Lease fund the sum of
$500 for entertainment of the American Society of Bacteriologists, who expect to
hold their annual meeting in Ann Arbor from December 28 to December 30, 1932.
The Regents extended an invitation to the Council of the American Society of
Bacteriologists to hold their annual meeting in Ann Arbor in December, 1928
(R.P. 1926-1929, page 413), and the sum of $500 was appropriated at that time
for entertainment purposes. The Society, however, did not convene that year in
Ann Arbor and the appropriation was returned to the general account.
December 3, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation by Dr. Charles W. Edmunds and with the approval of the
Faculty Personnel committee, Dr. Erwin E. Nelson, Associate Professor of Pharmacology, and Professor John F. Shepard of the Department of Psychology were
appointed as consultants on the research which is now being conducted under Dr.
Edmunds' direction by the Kellogg Company of Battle Creek in the effect of caffeine. It is understood that Dr. Nelson will receive a stipend of $500 for the
twelve-month period beginning November 1, 1932, and that Professor Shepard will
receive $300 for the same period with the understanding that this arrangement is
for the duration of the investigation only or until further notice, and that the
compensation will be paid from the Kellogg Research fund.
December 6, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee approved the expenditure of $80 from the Woodward Avenue
Lease fund toward certain expenses of printing and postage in connection with the
Emeritus Club. This action was taken on the request of the Alumni Association
through Mr. Fred S. Randall, Secretary of the Class Officers' Council.
December 7, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee gave approval to a cash donation to the University Band, to
the Men's Glee Club, and to their members and officers, by the Chevrolet Miotor
Company for services rendered by those organizations at a banquet given to its
sales staff on the evening of November 21, 1932.
The Board approved the President's nomination of a Commencement speaker for 1933, and voted that an honorary degree should be
conferred upon the speaker, should he accept the invitation (page 36).
The Secretary filed a tabulation of the payroll of the University for
the month of October, 1932, showing a total of 3,570 names as compared with the total for October, 1930, of 3,958 (R.P. 1929-1932,
page 521*). As the roll for October, 1932, included 95 names of employees of Mosher-Jordan Halls, not included in the 1930 tabulation,
the net reduction was 483 persons.
The Secretary reported having received a warranty deed from Ernest
F. Lloyd and Mabel Robertson Lloyd, husband and wife, conveying as
a gift, property described as follows (page 40 and R.P. 1929-1932,
pages 800-808):

While this deed is without condition, the grantors expressed their
"hopes for the future of this land" in a communication filed as Exhibit
K, meeting of October 28, 1932. This deed is No. 441-A in the Inventory Clerk's serial list.
The Secretary reported the following contracts made by the Department of Engineering Research (page 68):With the Committee on Industrial Gas Research, American Gas Association,
New York City, for summation of work on short-cycle malleableizing; at an
estimated cost of $850
With the Committee on Industrial Gas Research, American Gas Association,

The President filed a letter from the Rockefeller Foundation under
date of December 16, 1932, as follows:At the meeting of the Rockefeller Foundation held December 14, 1932, consideration was given to the situation of the Institute of Archaeological Research's
project at the site of ancient Karanis in the Fayum which has for eight years been
supported privately and which can be completed in two years if funds can be secured, and I have the honor to inform you that an appropriation was made to the
University of Michigan in a sum not to exceed $35,000 towards the completion
during a two-year period beginning January 1, 1933, of this project.
This grant was accepted by the Regents, and a letter acknowledging the
thanks of the Board therefor was directed to be sent to the Foundation.
Dr. Robbins filed with the Regents letters from Mrs. Augusta M.

paintings was accepted by the Regents with expressions of thanks to
the Todd family.
The Regents accepted with thanks the sum of $562.10 from the
American Association of University Women, through Miss Anna B.
Steele, treasurer of the Ann Arbor Branch, this sum to be added to the
A.A.U.W. Scholarship fund for women students in the University.
The Board accepted with thanks the gift of $500 from the Board of
Governors of Adelia Cheever House, this to serve as a permanent endowment of the "Mary B. Goddard Loan Fund," in memory of the
mother of Professor Edwin C. Goddard. The donors recommend that
the gift be invested as part of the Consolidated fund and that its income
be paid over to the Board of Governors of Adelia Cheever House upon
request, to be used by such board at its discretion for scholarships,
loans, or similar purposes for the benefit of residents of Adelia Cheever
House. If Adelia Cheever House or its successor should cease to exist,
the Regents may at their discretion use the income for purposes similar
to the above or for such other University purposes as the Regents may
deem expedient.
The Board accepted with thanks an allowance of not to exceed
$250 made by the American Medical Association Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry, through its Committee on Therapeutic Research, for
the aid of Professor Robert Gesell in investigating the "action potentials involved in the control of respiration." Under terms of the grant,
the Business Office will handle the money, render an accounting to the
donor, and if the entire amount is not used will return the balance.
The check has been received and placed in the University trust funds
to the credit of the "American Medical Association Therapeutic Research Grant No. 191." The balance, if any, remaining unexpended, is
to be returned to the donor not later than November 4, 1933, unless
an extension is requested and granted.
Dr. F. E. Robbins filed the following report of objects received
from the estate of the late Mrs. Charles H. (Louise Reed) Stowell
(page 79):From the estate of the late Mrs. Louise Reed Stowell, '76, there have been
received a number of packing cases containing books, microscopes, microscopic
slides, photographs, and crockery. This consignment was unpacked by Dean G.
Carl Huber, and Regent Beal and the undersigned inspected it at Dr. Huber's request with a view to its appropriate disposal. The microscopic apparatus and
most of the books have been turned over to the custody of the Department of
Anatomy. One of the microscopes is of some historic value and the books, which
are chiefly on the subject of microscopy, arei being placed in the department library. A number of the photographs have been placed in the University's historic




84

collection in the General Library. The crockery, which included some glassware
and a rather large collection of majolica, was intended for the Michigan League
and has been turned over to that organization.
The sum of $50 was added to the Sorosis Alumnae Emergency fund,
by a gift of this sum from the Collegiate Sorosis Alumnae Club, through
Mrs. Archibald W. Diack, Jr., of Ann Arbor (R.P. 1929-1932, page
837). It was directed that the thanks of the Regents be sent to Mrs.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1932


89


President Harry B. Hutchins. It was the informal opinion of all Regents present that the Board could take no action relative to the situation brought out by these letters.
The President filed with each Regent a printed copy of the President's Report for 1931-1932, for acceptance.
The President filed a letter from Mr. D. W. Springer expressing the
thanks of the Association of Governing Boards of State Universities
and Allied Institutions for the hospitality of the University during the
Association's recent meeting in Ann Arbor (page 65).
The sum of $325 was transferred from the Current account of the
Museum of Zoology to the Salary account and made available for the
salary of a research associate. The remainder of this salary will be provided by gift reported immediately below.
The President reported, and the Regents accepted with thanks, the
gift of $600 from an anonymous donor for research and instruction in
the Museum of Zoology.
The following resolution, recommended for passage by the Executive Committee of the Medical School, was adopted by the Regents
with the express provision that the adoption was tentative and experimental and might be rescinded at any time that circumstances seemed
to justify:Resolved, That the operating rooms and the fourth and sixth private floors,
as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic facilities of the Hospital, may be utilized
by part-time professors for their private patients in so far as these facilities are
available. All charges other than professional fees shall be arranged by and paid
to the Hospital.
The degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery was voted to each of the
following candidates, as recommended by the Faculty of the School of
Dentistry:Louis Bartko                   James Daniel Grace
Chris Demetrios Christie       William Ferris McKenna
John Robert Davidson            Harry Maynard Norton
Otto Adam Wendt
The President filed the following letter from the E. I. du Pont de
Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Delaware:
The Du Pont Company has been, for some time past, giving considerable
thought to the development of a Du Pont Fellowship plan which might, in its
opinion, better meet the educational requirements of both the chemical industry
and the universities. The present plan has accordingly been discontinued.
You have been the recipient of a Du Pont Fellowship in the past and since
it is ordinarily our custom to announce the placement of Du Pont Fellowships at
this time, we have to advise you that there will be no Du Pont Fellowship award
available for the academic year 1933-1934.
The Regents directed that the letter be placed on record and that
there be sent to the Du Pont Company, by the President, an expression
of the appreciation which the authorities of this university feel for
their extensive and generous cooperation with the scientific work of this
university over a long period of years.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to Friday, January 27, 1933, at 3:30 P.M.
Shirley W. Smith, Secretary




Special January Meeting, 1933
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, JANUARY 13, 1933
The Board met in special session at the call of the President, at
the Detroit Club, Detroit, Michigan, after dinner, at 7:30 P.M.
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Murfin, Regent Stone, Regent
Shorts, Regent Cram, Regent Smith, and Regent Shields, appointed
January 9 by Governor Comstock to succeed Regent Hubbard who,
during the preceding week, presented his resignation to the Governor.
Absent, Regent Clements, Regent Beal, and Superintendent Pearce.
There were also in attendance Vice-Presidents Bruce and Yoakum,
Dr. F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G. Watkins, and the Secretary.
The President filed the resignation of Mrs. Frederic B. Stevens
(R.P. 1929-1932, page 606) from the Board of Governors of Martha
Cook Building, effective at once because of the necessity on her part
of being away from Detroit for an indefinite period. Mrs. Stevens's
resignation was accepted with regret and with an expression of thanks
for her long and devoted service. The President was authorized to
tender the appointment of membership in this Board to Mrs. Stuart
G. Baits.
In view of the appointment of Regent Shields the President was
requested to appoint a committee of the Board to recast the standing
committees of the Regents.
Leave of absence for a period of one month each was voted to
Dr. James D. Bruce and Dr. Chalmers J. Lyons.
The following resolution was adopted:1WHERE.AS, it has been found impracticable to carry out the letter of the
order appearing in the Regents' Proceedings of January 19, 1932, page 868, as
follows:
"The Board directed that beginning with March 1, 1932, all patients
admitted to the University Hospital under classifications known as B, C, and
D, shall be so admitted only when referred by letter from a physician."
THEREFORE, be it Resolved, That the said order of January, 1932, be
hereby rescinded.
At this time the Board of Regents records its opinion that the University
Hospital should contribute to the public welfare by receiving a limited number
of persons not mentioned in Legislative Acts. It is further believed, however,
that the diagnosis and treatment of patients admitted to the University Hospital,
in classes A, B, C, and D, must not be construed as an entry into the practice
of medicine nor in any way as reflecting upon the desirable close relationship
between patient and physician, which, it is felt, is essential to the proper functioning of the medical profession.
To insure a proper relation between practicing physician and patient and
between Hospital and physician, and to conform to the generally accepted practice
and ethics of the medical profession, the Board is of the opinion that in the
future University Hospital patients paying Hospital fees but no professional
fees, or paying both Hospital and professional fees, should be limited as far as
possible to those who either by letter or by direct communication have been
referred to the Hospital for consultation or treatment by physicians or other
authoritative agencies.
The Regents approved the establishment by the Business Office
of the University of a uniform system of accounting for all the dormitories and secondly authorized the President and the Vice-President
and Secretary at their discretion to approve changes in rates for board
and lodging in the dormitories.




92           SPECIAL JANUARY MEETING, 1933
The Board discussed at length the situation of the University with
relation to the present session of the Legislature. The President was
authorized to appoint when, as, and if in his judgment desirable, a
legislative committee of three members of the Board to act for the
Regents in all matters requiring Board action with reference to the
Legislature.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to the date of the regularly called meeting
namely, January 27, 1933, 3:30 P.M. in Ann Arbor.
Shirley W. Smith, Secretary




January Meeting, 1933
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, JANUARY 27, 1933
The Board was called to order in the Regents' Room at 3:35 P.M.
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Murfin, Regent Beal, Regent
Shields, Regent Clements, Regent Cram, Regent Shorts, Regent Stone,
and Superintendent Pearce. Absent, Regent Smith. There were also
in attendance Vice-President Yoakum, Mr. H. G. Watkins, Dr. F. E.
Robbins, and the Secretary.
The minutes of the meetings of December 30 and January 13 were
approved as submitted to the Regents in press proof.
The customary financial reports were filed.
The Board approved the following recommendations for the recast
Regents' committees, reported by Regent Beal (page 91):I. Executive                      V. Library
The President, Chairman          Regent Clements, Chairman
Regent Beal                      Regent Cram

IV. Buildings and Grounds          VIII. Student Welfare
Regent Clements, Chairman        Regent Murfin, Chairman
Regent Shorts                    Regent Shields
Regent Shields                   Regent Beal
Regent Shorts raised the question of changed rate of compensation
to two certain trust companies through which investments of University trust funds have been made. The contract with the Security Trust
Company (now the Detroit Trust Company) was changed to provide
for a fee of 1 per cent of money placed in new investments, without
the former limitation that such charge shall not be made oftener than
once every five years (R.P. 1923 —1926, page 484). In the two agreements with the Michigan Trust Company of Grand Rapids, Michigan,
the rate of compensation has been '2 of 1 per cent in one agreement
and Y  of 1 per cent in the other agreement. The rate was made
uniform at '2 of 1 per cent in both agreements (R.P. 1929-1932,
pages 426 and 703). Regent Stone and Regent Murfin received permission to have it recorded in the minutes that neither of them participated in the discussion of this matter either before or at the meeting, except that Regent Stone called attention to the fact that the
contract at present in existence with the Detroit Trust Company came
to that company through its merger with the Security Trust Company,
and that he would be pleased to have the agreement terminated by
the University whenever his colleagues felt that an arrangement better
or equally satisfactory could be negotiated elsewhere.




94


JANUARY MEETING, 1933


Certain agreements were offered for consideration for the handling
of a defaulted mortgage on property in Avon Township, Oakland
County, which mortgage had come to the University under the will of
the late Levi L. Barbour, the Smith Holding Company of Detroit
being the owner of the fee at the present time. The Board directed
that these proposed agreements be not executed, that foreclosure under
the mortgage be not undertaken at this time, and that the Smith Holding Company be requested to use all income received by it under contract sales which it had made of the lots covered by the mortgage or
otherwise received from this property, for the purpose of bringing the
taxes upon the property up to date.
The Board directed that as far as practicable approximately 20
per cent of the coal shipped to the University direct from mines be
routed as desired by the Ann Arbor Railroad; the remainder, as desired by the New York Central lines. On this action Regent Clements
voted no.
Action of the Executive Committee was approved and ratified as
recorded in the minutes and report of the committee, as follows:December 13, 1932
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Dean John R. Effinger, Mary P. Parsons of the Library
School of McGill University, Montreal, Canada, was appointed Special Lecturer
in Library Science for the second semester of the University year 1932-1933
with compensation at the rate of $4,000 per University year to be paid from
the Carnegie Corporation Studies in Library Science fund. It is understood that
Miss Parsons will replace Associate Professor Margaret Mann, who will be on
leave during the second semester. It was hoped that Mrs. Harriet Sawyer, whose
appointment was approved by the Regents at their November meeting (page 84)
could accept the position, but she has been forced to decline on account of illness.
The Secretary filed payrolls of the Department of Engineering Research for the months of October, November, and December, 1932, in
the amounts respectively of $7,671.32, $6,548.09, and $8,373.10 (page
39).
The Secretary reported the following contracts made by the Department of Engineering Research (page 82):With H. E. Coffin, New- York City, for study of cutting oils; at an estimated cost
of $500
With Howell Electric Motors Company, Howell, for measurement of motor noises;
at an estimated cost of $300
Traveling expense vouchers were ordered paid as follows:Regent Smith for the period from March 25, 1932, to December 30, 1932, inclusive,
in the amount of $147.03 (R.P. 1929-1932, page 841)
Regent Shorts for the period from January 19, 1932, to November 25, 1932,
inclusive, in the amount of $81.06 (R.P. 1929-1932, page 841)
Regent Clements for the period from January 29, 1932, to November 26, 1932,
inclusive, in the amount of $317.97 (R.P. 1929-1932, page 840)
The Board gave formal approval to the transaction under which
real estate deed No. 437-A was taken. In making up original record
(pages 87-88) it developed that the Regents had not given such formal
approval, in advance. The circumstances of the transaction were reported in writing by the Secretary and placed on file.
The Secretary filed a written report of progress upon the proper
means, under terms of the deed, for reimbursing the University for




JANUARY MEETING, 1933


95


expenses either involved in the suit by which the state of California
condemned the so-called Hunt lands in Humboldt County in that state,
or growing out of the ownership of these lands. It will apparently
be necessary to await the final order of the California court before
the question can be regarded as fully decided (page 79).
The Secretary reported that under the will of the late Arthur C.
Tagge, of the Engineering Class of 1897, the University was a contingent beneficiary. Mr. Tagge was a brother-in-law of former Regent
Harry C. Bulkley. The Regents accepted the benefaction, when it
becomes payable, under terms of the will, with an expression of
gratitude to the memory of Mr. Tagge as an alumnus always loyal to
the University.
The Board accepted with sincere thanks and in accordance with its
terms a gift from E. R. Squibb and Sons of New York, through the
National Research Council's Committee on Drug Addiction, of a
fellowship of $700 for work in Pharmacology to be carried on under
Professor C. W. Edmunds of the Medical School (R.P. 1929-1932,
page 751).
Further, the Board received with thanks, and in accordance with
its terms, the gift of the Michigan Chapter of Sigma Xi of the sum
of $250 to be used as a loan fund for graduate students, the loan to
be administered by the Dean of the Graduate School with preference
to be given to members and associate members of Sigma Xi. The
Board provided, however, that loans should be made through the University Committee on Student Loans, but not without the approval of
the Dean of the Graduate School, said loans to be from principal and
to be repayable in accordance with the usual regulations.
The following routine resignations were approved by the Regents

The Regents adopted the following resolution of appreciation of
the services and personality of their former colleague, who resigned
January 6:WHEREAS, Dr. Lucius Lee Hubbard, of Houghton, Michigan, after a long
and honorable service to the State of Michigan, has decided to relinquish his
membership in this Board, and
WHEREAS, Dr. Hubbard's keen mind and scholarly tastes, cultivated by the
liberal training of his young manhood both here and abroad, his high ideals, his
nobility of character, his unselfishness, his unfailing courtesy, and his native
kindliness have made him a most valuable member of this Board for the past
twenty-two years, a counselor to whom the Regents could turn at any time with
confidence in his nicety of taste and saneness of judgment, and a colleague association with whom has been an honor and a constant source of pleasure; therefore
be it
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby record
their appreciation of those qualities which have made their colleague both valued
and beloved, their regret that he has felt it necessary to withdraw from the
Board, and their good wishes to one who for so many years has been not only
a friend but also a conscientious and effective State official.
All of the preceding actions were by unanimous vote except where
otherwise expressly stated.
The Board adjourned to February 24, 1933, at 3:30 P.M.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary




February Meeting, 1933


UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, FEBRUARY 24, 1933
The Board was called to order in the Regents' Room at 3:30 P.M.
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Murfin, Regent Beal, Regent
Shields, and Regent Stone. Absent, Regent Smith, Regent Clements,
Regent Shorts, Regent Cram, and Superintendent Pearce. There were
also in attendance Vice-President Yoakum, Mr. H. G. Watkins, Dr.
F. E. Robbins, and the Secretary.
The minutes of the meeting of January 27 were approved as submitted to the Regents in press proof.
The customary financial reports were filed.
Actions of the Executive Committee were approved and ratified
as recorded in the minutes of the committee as follows (page 94):January 25, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Dean Clare E. Grilfin, the committee approved the
appointment of Mr. Herbert H. Gardner, Vice-President of the Highland Park
Trust Company, as Nonresident Lecturer in the School of Business Administration for the second semester of the University year 1932-1933 with compensation at the rate of $1,000 for the University year. No addition to the budget
is necessitated by this action, inasmuch as the salary for Mr. Gardner will be
paid from an unexpended balance in the salary budget of the School of Business
Administration originally allocated for an instructor.
February 3, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation of Dean John R. Effinger, Dr. George R. LaRue,
Professor of Zoology, was appointed Executive Secretary of the Department of
Zoology, as of February 1, 1933, to replace Dr. Peter O. Okkelberg, who
resigned the position on January 31, 1933. No increase in salary is involved
by this action.
February 8, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Professor Tealdi, and with the approval of Dean Effinger.
Mr. T. Glenn Phillips, practicing landscape architect of Detroit, and Fellow
of the American Society of Landscape Architects, was appointed Lecturer in
the Department of Landscape Design for the second semester of the present
University year at a nominal stipend of $10 a month. It is understood that
this salary will pay for expenses incurred in coming to Ann Arbor for each
lecture and that his term of service will begin on February 13 and end on
June 19. No addition to the budget is necessitated by this action, since the
salary will be paid from the appropriation in the departmental budget allocated
to Nichols Arboretum  labor.
February 8, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On request of Professor Lorch, the committee voted to change the form
of the degree granted to James Auer at the meeting of January 27, 1933,
from "Bachelor of Science in Architecture (Architectural Design)" to "Bachelor
of Science in Architecture (Architecture)." The latter form is in accord with
custom.
The Secretary reported the following contracts made by the Department of Engineering Research (page 94):With the Dodge Brothers Corporation, Division of Chrysler Corporation, Detroit,
for measurement of the comparative sound deadening effect of materials
placed in automobile bodies; at an estimated cost of $500




102                FEBRUARY       MEETING, 1933
With the Farm Fire Prevention, Detroit, for determination of draft effect
produced by construction of spark arrester; at an estimated cost of $30
With the Kelvinator Corporation, Detroit, for theoretical analyses of combustion
occurring in an oil burner; at an estimated cost of $650
With the Kelvinator Corporation, Detroit, for investigation of chromium plate;
at an estimated cost of $600
The Regents approved changes in rates at the University Hospital
as recommended, or as already made, by Dr. Haynes, Director. Rate
changes reported at the September meeting (page 32), together with
the present changes, will result in annual reductions in the cost to
patients in the University Hospital, on the basis of normal occupancy,
as follows:Estimated annual reductions in the cost to patients based on the
changed rates shown in the Hospital schedules from October 1,
1930, to September 19, 1932 (page 32)...................... $450,800
Additional estimated annual reductions in the cost to patients on the
basis of the changes in rates now (February 24) approved...... 211,100
Grand total of estimated annual reductions in the costs to patients.... $661,900
The Secretary filed the following report of actions by which title to
the dormitory known as Fletcher Hall had been acquired:The matter of the purchase of the dormitory known as Fletcher Hall has
been before the Regents at least four times in the recent past (see Proceedings of
June, 1931, page 653; September, 1931, page 725; June, 1932, page 960;
September, 1932, page 33). In June, 1932, the matter was referred to the
Executive Committee with power, and in August, 1932, the Executive Committee approved the purchase of the building; principally for the back taxes and
minor expenses of receivership, with the further authority to expend for repairs
and rehabilitation an amount within a grand total of $25,000, including the tax
and receivership payments. It was the expectation that these expenditures
should be made entirely from a reserve account entitled "Geddes and Volland
Street Property Sales" in which there was on June 30 last the amount of
$26,519.01. (See printed budget of 1932-1933, page 20.) This fund arose
through the sale of two houses moved to vacant land and sold at the time Forest
Avenue was cut through from   Washtenaw  Avenue to North University. The
entry in the Proceedings of last September (page 33) was a report of this
progress.
On February 15 the Regents received from the receiver deed to the property
and a bill of sale of all personal property, i.e. furniture and equipment in the
building. The amount required thus to secure the building and the equipment
and pay up the taxes and receivership expenses is $13,830.74,-well within the
estimate given by Mr. Mark Norris of Grand Rapids, without whose voluntary
and unselfish help the matter could not have been brought to completion. There
may be some reduction in the total of $13,830.74, depending on final settlement
of the controversy with a tax-title holder. We are assured by Mr. Burke that
the amount allowed in the total for settling with this tax-title holder is the
utmost that he can possibly demand and probably considerably more than will
ultimately be necessary to pay him.
The repairs and rehabilitation of the building are now under way, and the
total cost will be well within the estimate previously given to the Board.
The building is now being operated as a dormitory for men by the University at rentals, for a single room, of $2.50 a week. There were, at last report
forty-four students living there.
When all bills are paid in full, I will file a final, accurate report.
The following communication was received:We, Edward H. Kraus and Lena H. Kraus (parents) and Edward T.
Ramsdell (husband), desire to establish at the University of Michigan a fellowship in memory of Margaret Kraus Ramsdell in accordance with the following
proposals:




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1933


103


1. It is our intention to contribute fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000)
to endow a fellowship fund which shall be known as the Margaret Kraus
Ramsdell Fellowship fund.
2. The fellowship shall be known as the Margaret Kraus Ramsdell
Fellowship in Religion.
3. The fellowship fund is to be invested by the Regents of the University
of Michigan and only the income therefrom is to be used for said fellowship. At the end of every University fiscal year, any portion of the income
from the fellowship fund for that year in excess of the amount required
for the fellowship award or awards for the succeeding year, or any amounts
unexpended on the fellowship or fellowships of the current year, shall be
transferred to the fellowship fund.
4. The annual amount of the fellowship shall be seven hundred and fifty
dollars ($750), provided the income from the fund shall permit. One
fellowship shall be available each year until the income from the fellowship fund shall permit further fellowships of like amounts to be granted
annually.
5. The first fellow shall be appointed for the University year 1934-1935.
6. The fellowship shall be used to assist students of the University of
Michigan of Methodist affiliation who have been active in the work of
the First Methodist Church of Ann Arbor, or of the Wesley Foundation
at the University of Michigan, to pursue graduate studies in religious
education in this country or abroad or in preparation for the Christian
ministry.
7. Fellows shall be selected by a committee consisting of the Dean of the
Graduate School of the University of Michigan, the Dean of the College
of Literature, Science, and the Arts of the University of Michigan, the
minister of the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Ann Arbor, the
Director of the Wesley Foundation at the University of Michigan, and
a fifth member who shall be a member of the faculty of the University
of Michigan and of the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Ann Arbor.
The fifth member of the committee shall be chosen by the first four named.
Applications for the fellowship shall be filed with the Dean of the
Graduate School.
8. In the selection of fellows, the committee shall especially consider the
following qualifications: (a) integrity of moral character; (b) genuineness
of religious interest; (c) capacity for. superior scholarship; (d) personal
attractiveness; and (e) qualities making for effective leadership in the
Church.
9. Whenever, in the opinion of the committee, none of the candidates
possesses in large measure the qualities above indicated, the appointment
of the fellow or fellows shall be omitted for that year, and the amount
allocated for the fellowship, or fellowships, for that year shall be transferred to the fellowship fund upon notification by the committee referred
to above that such fellow or fellows will not be appointed.
10. Fellows shall be appointed for one year only and shall not be eligible
for reappointment.
11. All candidates for appointment to this fellowship shall be given full
information concerning the purpose of the fellowship, together with full
information concerning the life and character of the one in whose memory
it is established.
12. Should at any time the organization of the University of Michigan,
or of the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Ann Arbor, or of the
Wesley Foundation at the University of Michigan be so changed that it
would be impossible or inadvisable to carry out our expressed wishes as
to the purpose of the fellowship or to follow the method described above
by which the fellows are to be selected, the Regents of the University of
Michigan, or their successors, shall be empowered to modify said purpose
and method of appointment in accordance with the recommendations of
a representative committee appointed to study the changed conditions; said
committee might well include the President of the University of Michigan,
the Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Michigan, and the
Judge of the Circuit Court of Washtenaw County.
We trust that these proposals may meet with your full approval.

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1933


The   offer of the   Margaret Kraus Ramsdell Fellowship          fund  was
accepted in accordance with its terms and conditions with an expression of the thanks of the Regents to the donors of this memorial to
one of the University's most promising young graduates.
Gifts were received and accepted with thanks as follows:From  the American Council of Learned Societies, allocation of the sum   of
$11,000 toward the expenses of the Middle English Dictionary for the year
beginning February 1, 1933, to February 1, 1934 (R.P. 1929-1932, page
878)
From the Upjohn Company of Kalamazoo, the sum of $2,500 to be paid to the
University during the period ending June 30, 1934, for research in the
preparation of mercury antiseptics, to be carried on under the direction of
Associate Professor Frederick F. Blicke. Expenditures from the fund will
include the provision of research assistants and equipment and materials.
The terms and conditions under which the gift was offered and accepted are
as follows: ---
1. The Upjohn Company shall have the privilege of testing all compounds
resulting from such investigation as to their bactericidal and pharmacologic
properties, therapeutic use, and commercial value.
2. If, after such examination or testing, the Upjohn Company desires to
control the manufacture of any or all of such compounds, the Company
shall, at its expense, secure a patent or patents covering the same in the
name of Frederick F. Blicke, who is to assign the patent or patents to the
University of Michigan, and the University of Michigan shall grant to
the Upjohn Company the exclusive right to manufacture and market the
compound or compounds covered by such patents.
3. The Upjohn Company shall pay to the Cashier of the University of
Michigan a royalty of five per cent (5%) on the net sales prices of any
such compound or compounds as it may use or sell less such amount of the
same as may be returned for credit in the regular course of business. In
case a compound or more than one compound shall be discovered that the
Upjohn Company may not sell as such but which it can use in one or more
of its preparations, it shall pay to the Cashier of the University of Miichigan a royalty of five per cent- (5%) on all amounts so used. In such case
the selling price shall be understood to be twice the cost of materials and
labor entering into such compound or compounds.
The conditions accompanying this research award are similar to those made by
Frederick Stearns and Company in November, 1930, which received the
approval of the Regents on November 14, 1930. (See pages 493 and 494
of the Proceedings.)
In the event of royalties being paid to the University as provided for in Condition 3, the royalties are to be divided as follows:

An additional United States Army Veteran's scholarship for the
present year only was created and to this Kepler G. Mills was appointed. This appointment implies refund of such fees as Mr. Mills
has paid during the present year in so far as the fees would not have
been paid had he been appointed to the scholarship at the beginning
of the year (page 46).
The appointment of Tresse Musil as Secretary to the Bureau of
Business Research was changed to the rate of $1,400 a year, twelvemonth basis, effective from January 12, 1933 (R.P. 1929-1932, page
831).
The title of Hanns Pick was definitely approved as "Professor
of Violoncello" (R.P. 1926-1929, page 972).
Leave of absence for a period of six months, beginning March
15, 1933, was voted to Dr. Carl Parker Huber, holder of the Reuben
Peterson Instructorship and Fellowship in Obstetrics and Gynecology
(page 19) to enable him to continue his work in Europe. Salary under
this leave is to terminate June 30, 1933.
On recommendation of the Faculty of the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, the degree of Bachelor of Arts was voted to
Marion Villiers Higgins, A.B.L.S., the degree being recommended
under special considerations which in the opinion of the Literary
Faculty justified the action.
The Board directed that deductions from salaries for the purchase
of old-age annuities and contributions thereto by the University should
continue throughout the present year unaffected by reductions in
salaries that would ordinarily have made changes in the premium
payments for such annuities.
The following resolution, adding to the By-Laws, was adopted
(page 98):Resolved, That Chapter V, Section 7, pages 24 and 25, of the 1923 edition
of the By-Laws of the University of Michigan be amended by the addition of
the following paragraph:
(f) Leaves of absence, other than sabbatical, may be granted by the
Regents to members of the faculties, or other employees of the University,
for periods not exceeding one year. Requests for extension of such leaves
of absence for longer periods shall be considered by the Regents only
in cases of emergency.
Traveling expenses of Regent Stone in the amount of $23.80 for
the period from  March 26 to November 26, 1932, inclusive, were
approved.
The Board granted permission to Mrs. Fredrika F. GoodwinMallette, of Ypsilanti, to use the death mask of the late President
Marion L. Burton in such quarters in a University building as might
be available for the purpose of making a portrait bust of President
Burton. This permission was without any obligation whatever to
purchase the bust or otherwise compensate the sculptor.
The Secretary reported that there were 309 outstanding tuition

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1933


loan notes for a total of $12,730.53 under the terms of which, the
notes not having been paid at the beginning of the second semester,
the makers thereof could be requested to withdraw from the University and use their refund for the settlement of the note (R.P. 1914 -1917, page 299).     The Regents authorized     the  Business Office to
renew these notes for a period within the discretion of the Business
Office, on condition that unless and until the notes were paid with
interest the makers of the notes could not receive either in forms
of certificates or on the books of the University any credit for work
done in the present semester, and would not be eligible for reregistration as students after the close of the present semester.
The Board approved the placing of all dormitories of the University, except when the deed of gift of the dormitory would not
permit, under a coordinated and unified business management. Details
by which the plan would be made operative were left with the
President and the Secretary.
The President reported that Assistant Professor John H. Muyskens
of the Department of Speech and General Linguistics had been
proposed as a candidate for State Superintendent of Public Instruction on the Democratic ticket and that Assistant Professor Harold
J. McFarlan of the Department of Geodesy and Surveying had been
proposed as a candidate for Regent of the University on the Socialist
ticket, and recommended that no objection be offered by the Regents
to these candidacies. The Board took no action (page 77).
The Board voted payment to Assistant Professor Harcourt L.
Caverly of the sum    of $275 from   such trust funds as in the opinion
of the President might properly provide available funds, the payment
being for extra services, in response to the President's request, upon
a fact-finding commission assisting the Governor and other State
officials with respect to the tax situation.
The Board voted that it was at this time impossible to approve
the admission of Professor Chalmers J. Lyons to the older Faculty
members' retiring allowance plan (R.P. 1929-1932, pages 540-544).
The President informed the Regents of the death of Professor
Charles W. Cook, and the following statement was adopted by the
Regents for inclusion in full in the records:Charles Wilford Cook, who died in Ann Arbor on February 17, 1933, was
a graduate of the University of Michigan in the Class of 1904, and had also
received the degrees of Master of Science, 1906, and Doctor of Philosophy, 1913,
from this institution. As a young man he served for several years as Assistant
in Mineralogy while pursuing graduate studies, and for two years was Professor
of Chemistry at the Pacific University, Forest Grove, Oregon. Returning from
the far West, he again became a member of our faculty in 1908, and from
that time until his death made Ann Arbor his home and service to the University
his major interest. He was promoted to be Instructor in Economic Geology in
1909, Assistant Professor in 1914, Associate Professor in 1920, and Professor
in 1925. As Assistant Geologist of the Michigan Geological Survey from 1910
to 1913, as a member of various scientific societies, and through his work on
mining and oil problems in the field during the summers, in the western and
southern United States, Nova Scotia, and Quebec, he became well known as an
expert in his field of economic geology. Throughout his career he was a frequent
contributor to the literature of mineralogy and geology. As a teacher and
colleague, he was keen and efficient, modest in manner but valued as a friend
by many, and respected for his attainments and ability. The organization and
conduct of the curriculum in economic geology was largely in his hands, and
as one of the University marshals, he was an invaluable helper in the conduct

of academic ceremonies. The Regents of the University of Michigan hereby
record their profound regret at the loss of an able and distinguished professor,
and extend their sympathy to Professor Cook's surviving family.
The Board voted that the salary of Professor Cook for the
remainder of the present University year should be continued to his
widow.
The Board approved the employment of an additional student
assistant in the shop courses in Chemical Engineering, with compensation of $30 for the semester, and directed the transfer of this
sum from the "Dean's Fund" of the College of Engineering to the
Chemical Engineering Salary account.
Upon recommendation of the proper Faculty in each case, degrees
and certificates were voted as follows:BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN MEDICINE

Mr. Leon Gropper and Mr. John L. Ali appeared before the
Regents, to represent a 'Committee for Student Relief," and demanded:
(a) an extension of tuition notes; and (b) an adequate student relief
fund to be administered by a democratically elected student-faculty
committee.
The fund demanded was to be financed: (a) by reductions in
University salaries; (b) by an appropriation      of one-half of "the
existing football funds"; and (c) by an appropriation to be requested
from the State Legislature for relief of needy students, the appropriation to be provided by a tax on higher incomes.
The young gentlemen were informed of the action already taken
(pages 107 and 108) with respect to the student tuition notes, and
further were informed that their "demand" for the provision of a
student relief fund by the means proposed would receive from the
Regents such attention as was proper. Messrs. Gropper and Ali withdrew.
The Board referred to the Executive Committee and Dr. Haynes,
with power, the pressing financial problems of the University Hospital
growing out of the fact that the State has not paid bills rendered
for the treatment of patients sent to the Hospital by legal process.
Regent Beal formally communicated to the Regents the death of
their former colleague, Honorable Benjamin Sawtelle Hanchett, and
upon his motion the following statement was adopted and ordered to
be incorporated in the minutes of the meeting:
The Regents of the University of Michigan hereby record the sorrow with
which they have learned of the death, at his home in Grand Rapids on February
4, 1933, of the Honorable Benjamin Sawtelle Hanchett, a member of this board
from 1911 to 1929. Regent Hanchett was a man in whom kindliness and
sympathy were instinctive, a trait which endeared him to his colleagues and
which led him in his official capacity to do all in his power to improve the
University's agencies for student welfare, particularly the Health Service. He
shared prominently also in the establishment of relations between the University
and the industries of Michigan whereby the research facilities of this institution
might be utilized to serve the latter, for the general good of the community.
As a token of respect and friendship for a former colleague, and of sympathy
for those to whom his passing has brought intimate and poignant sorrow, the
Regents have ordered that this resolution be incorporated in their Proceedings,
and that a copy be sent to Mr. Hanchett's family.
The Board adopted the following new admission requirements
for the College of Pharmacy, as recommended by its Faculty:REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTRANCE

tThese subjects are recognized under List A only when taken in the junior or senior
high school year. Community and Vocational Civics may be recognized only in List B.
The total credit in Government and Civics shall not exceed one full unit.
LIST B
List B comprises any secondary school subjects which are counted towards
graduation by the accredited school.
DEFINITION OF A UNIT. Requirements for admission are stated in units,
a unit being defined as a course covering an academic year that shall include
in the aggregate not less than the equivalent of one hundred and twenty sixtyminute hours of classroom work. Two to three hours of laboratory, drawing, or
shop work are counted as equivalent to one of recitation.
CONTINUITY OF SUBJECTS. It is strongly recommended that one or more
studies be pursued throughout the four years of the high school course. For
this purpose the various branches of science may be considered as a single
group.
FOREIGN LANGUAGE. When two or more units in a foreign language are
offered to satisfy the specific requirement, an additional single unit of credit
in a second language will be accepted. Some modification in the requirement
may be allowed in the case of students whose native language is other than
English. Applicants who intend later to study medicine should offer two units
of Latin, and are urged to present also either German or French.
SCIENCE. The applicant who intends to study Pharmacy, or later Medicine,
should offer, if possible, one-half unit of Trigonometry, and is urged to present
also Chemistry, Botany, and Zoology.

March Meeting, 1933
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, MARCH 31, 1933
The Board was called to order in the Regents' Room at 3:30 P.M.
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Murfin, Regent Beal, Regent
Shields, and Regent Cram. Absent, Regent Shorts, Regent Stone, Regent
Clements, Superintendent Pearce, and Regent Smith, who later took his
seat. There were also in attendance Vice-President Yoakum, Mr. H. G.

The minutes of the meeting of February 24 were approved as submitted to the Regents in press proof, with certain typographical changes.
The customary financial reports were filed.
A communication from the Board in Control of Athletics upon
questions relating to the requirement of physical education was laid
upon the table until the next meeting.
Regent Smith took his seat.
The Regents voted certain honorary degrees recommended by the
University Council's Committee on Honorary Degrees to be conferred
at Commencement 1933 under the usual terms and conditions (page 81).
On the understanding that Assistant Professor Floyd A. Firestone
would accept the assignment if made, the Board adopted the following
resolution (page 98; R.P. 1926-1929, page 452; R.P. 1923-1926, pages
632-633 and 810):Resolved, That U.S. Letters Patent No. 1,640,567 and No. 1,783,234, covering
inventions made by Assistant Professor Floyd A. Firestone in the prosecution of
work through the Department of Engineering Research for and at the expense,
including service charge, of an outside concern, before adoption of the present
patent policy governing such inventions, which patents were granted on applications prepared and prosecuted by and at the expense of the outside concern (The
Timken Roller Bearing Company) and assigned to the Regents by the inventor,
now be assigned back to the inventor, Floyd A. Firestone, subject to the licenses,
dated February 3, 1933, to The Timken Roller Bearing Company under each of
the patents (the rights granted by those licenses being all the rights desired or
claimed by that company) and reserving to the University the right to make and
use inventions and devices covered by these patents, the assignment to be made
for a consideration of one-half the net proceeds realized by Professor Firestone
from license fees, royalties and/or other revenues arising from the use and/or sale
of these patents, to be paid to the University annually by Professor Firestone or
his representatives, with an annual accounting thereof, such proceeds to be placed
in the Engineering Research Patents Receipts Research fund or, in case it is
discontinued, the account which succeeds it; that it is to be understood that this
action does not necessarily constitute a precedent; and that the General Electric
Company and the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company be advised
by the University that this action has been taken.
Actions of the Executive Committee were approved and ratified as
recorded in the minutes of the committee as follows (page 101):March 4, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Dr. Novy, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the
Medical School, the committee approved the transfer of the sum of $200 from the




118


M1ARCH MEETING, 1933


item in the budget of Medical Administration, earmarked "For Adjustments," to
the Current account of the Department of Surgery to provide sufficient funds to
continue certain work required of senior students. The emergency arises because
of the fact that bills amounting to $300 for material purchased before the end of
the fiscal year of 1931-1932 were carried over and paid from the budget of the
fiscal year 1932-1933.
March 14, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee gave permission to Dr. James D. Bruce, Director of the
Department of Postgraduate Medicine, to allow a delay in the payment of fees for
seven courses scheduled in the Department of Postgraduate Medicine for the period
between March 20 and July 1, 1933. It is hoped that this action will tend to
increase the attendance in these courses, which otherwise might be decidedly small,
owing to the financial conditions. It is understood that Dr. Bruce will keep a
record of all those in attendance who do not pay the fee upon registration and that
the attempt will be made, in due course, to collect the fee.
The Board approved and ratified the following transactions as reported by the Finance Committee (page 80):The following securities were offered to the University by the donors of the
Margaret Kraus Ramsdell Fellowship fund (page 102). These securities were
accepted at par or face value and made a part of the Consolidated Endowment
investments in accordance with the desire of the donors.
The two issues of bonds, while now selling at approximately 2 /2 points below
par, would not depreciate the Consolidated Fund but on the contrary might improve
the average quality of it.
The qualifications of the Arnet mortgage permit it to be placed in the Consolidated Fund at its face value and it is in all respects worth as much as our
general run of Ann Arbor mortgages.

The President informed the Regents of the death of Mr. Edward
Bruce Williamson of the Museum staff, and the following statement
was adopted by the Regents for inclusion in full in the records:



MARCH MEETING, 1933


119


Edward Bruce Williamson, B.S., who died at his home in Ann Arbor on February 28, 1933, after a brief illness, was one of the most distinguished scientists
associated with the University of Michigan through its biological departments and
its Museums. Years of search in the field and study in the laboratory had brought
him international recognition as one of the world's authorities-and probably at
the time of his death as the world's greatest authority-on the order Odonata.
After his graduation from Ohio State University in 1898, he was for a year assistant
curator in Carnegie AMuseum, Pittsburgh, and in 1900-1901 held a fellowship at
Vanderbilt University. In 1905 he became president of the Wells County Bank in
Bluffton, Indiana, and was engaged in banking until 1928 when he came to this
city. He did not, however, abandon his scientific studies, but constantly went into
the field, on many occasions in cooperation with the Museum of Zoology, and
accumulated unrivaled collections of North, South, and Central American dragonflies, to which by exchange were added representative specimens from all parts
of the world. His interest in our Museum was recognized in 1916 by his appointment as Honorary Curator of Odonata, and in 1928, when he transferred his home
to Ann Arbor, the University of Michigan welcomed the opportunity to make him
a Research Associate in the Division of Insects of the Museum of Zoology. The
list of his publications was a long one and has added substantially to the sum of
the world's knowledge of an important section of insect life. Mr. Williamson's
friendliness and his unquenchable enthusiasm for scientific research have been a
source of inspiration to scores of students and colleagues throughout the years of
his association with this institution. The Board of Regents hereby record officially
their appreciation of Mr. Williamson's distinguished services and extend their
profound sympathy to the members of his family who survive him.
The President informed the Regents of the death of Dr. George
Slocum, Professor of Ophthalmology in the Medical School, and the
following statement was adopted by the Regents for inclusion in full
in the records:The Regents of the University of Michigan have learned with profound
sorrow of the sudden death of Professor George Slocum, head of the Department
of Ophthalmology in the Miedical School of this University, at his home in Ann
Arbor on March 24, 1933, in his sixty-eighth year. Professor Slocum received
the degree of M.D. in 1889 from this University, and after some years spent in
general medical practice returned to the Medical School for advanced study in
ophthalmology. In October 1904, he was made Demonstrator in Ophthalmology,
in 1913 Instructor, in 1919 Assistant Professor, in 1930 Associate Professor, and
in 1932, on the retirement of Dr. Walter R. Parker, Professor and Head of the
Department. Thus he had served nearly twenty-nine years as a member of the
medical faculty. Dr. Slocum was a skillful ophthalmologist, was a member of
many medical and scientific organizations, and contributed frequently to the literature of his subject. His quiet manner and his upright character won him the
regard of his colleagues and friends, who will long regret his loss. The Regents
hereby express their sympathy to Dr. Slocum's surviving family.
The Secretary reported the following contract made by the Department of Engineering Research (page 101):With the Calorizing Company, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, for high temperature
investigation of calite alloys; at an estimated cost of $3,000
The Secretary reported the following clause from the will of Mary
E. Turner, who died in Santa Barbara, California, during the month
of January:Fourth: I give and bequeath to the Regents of the University of Michigan
the sum of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000), to be held by them in trust as
a loan fund, and to be invested by them in good securities, the income from the
same, but not the principal, to be used to aid worthy young women who. without
aid, would be unable to continue their work in the University. Said fund is to be
added to the present Jane Owen Turner Loan Fund for Women. All loans from
the income of the fund are to be authorized and administered by a committee
composed of the President of the University, the Dean of Women, and Clarence




120


MARCH MlEETING, 1933


A. Lightner, of Detroit, Michigan. Upon the death or declination to serve of any
one or more of the members of said committee his or her place is to be filled by
appointment of the Regents of the University, with the approval of the President
thereof. Said committee is hereby given full power to determine as to the beneficiaries, as to the amount of the loan in each case, and as to the terms on which
the loan is made.
I desire this bequest to be paid in full, even if the assets of my estate should
not be sufficient to pay all of the legacies herein contained.
Miss Turner was the donor of the Jane Turner Memorial Fund (R.P.
1914-1917, page 748).
The following gifts were received and accepted with the thanks of
the Regents and in accordance with any special terms and conditions
made:From the University of Michigan Alumnae Association of Washington, D.C.,
the sum of $100 plus an additional sum of $200 as soon as banking conditions will
permit the release, to be added to the Washington, D.C., Alumnae Loan fund under
the same terms and conditions that applied to the original gift for this fund, made
in November 1931 (R.P. 1929-1932, page 800)
From the Junior Research Club, through its Secretary, Mr. Franklin L. Everett,
the sum of $100 to be loaned, preferably, to graduate students specializing in the
sciences, though ultimate selection of beneficiaries of the fund shall be in the hands
of the University Loan Committee or such authorities as the President and Regents
may constitute for the purpose
From the University Hospital Circle of King's Daughters, through Mrs. F. G.
Novy, Chairman of the Educational Committee of the Circle, the sum of $75 to
establish the Sarah M. Brace Memorial fund. This gift is to serve as an endowment
to be invested in the consolidated fund, and the income is to provide an annual
subscription to the National Geographic Magazine for the children's ward at the
University Hospital. Suitable provision is made in writing for the use of any
excess above the annual subscription to the magazine, and for other contingencies,
including a provision that if this magazine should cease to exist or if the purposes
for which the fund is created should cease to exist, the Regents may use the fund
for purposes as nearly similar to those for which it is now created as reasonably
possible.
From  Mr. H. C. Hoskier, Honorary Curator of the Museum of Classical
Archaeology (R.P. 1926-1929, page 886), whose residence is Ivy Farms, Trinity,
Jersey, C.I., England, a very rare Etrurian bronze for the IMuseum of Classical

APRIL MEETING, 1933


Riggs Foundation be increased from $75 to $200 a month, effective

The Board approved and made effective the action recommended
in the following resolution of the Executive Board of the Graduate
School:Resolved, That there be established a class of University of Michigan scholarships to be known as University Scholarships in the Graduate School.
These scholarships shall be available to students in the University who are
residents of Michigan and who enter upon graduate work in the academic year
immediately following completion of their undergraduate curricula. Appointees
are not eligible to reappointment.
The scholarships shall carry exemption from fees in the manner of existing
fellowships and scholarships in the Graduate School. Applications or nominations
shall be made to the Dean of the Graduate School in accordance with such rules
and regulations as he may prescribe.
The number of scholarships shall be limited to twenty for the academic year
1933-1934.
The Board approved and made effective for the coming University
year the following recommendations of the Policy Committee on
Consolidated Dormitory Management:
1. That applications for residence in the dormitories should be made to the
Dean of Women and that the Dean should assign women students to such living
quarters as the desires of the applicants and the quarters available may make
most advantageous to all interests.
2. That all undergraduate women be required to live in University dormitories,
except those given permission to live elsewhere by the Dean of Women.
3. There is a general rule of the Regents that all fees owing to the University
must be paid before a student receives his credit. Bills owing to the dormitories
fall within this category.
The committee reported that on the basis of the above recommendations, it has reduced the room       rate per person to $80.00 a
semester with price ranges above and below for the Aiore desirable or
less desirable rooms. This represents a reduction from the $95.00 and
$105.00 charge for the second semester of 1932-1933, and this secondsemester rate is a reduction from the $105.00 and $115.00 charge
previous to that time. Board will be furnished at $6.00 a week instead
of $6.50 a week, the rate for the second semester of 1932-1933, or
$7.00 a week, the rate charged previous to that time.
The Board received for filing a communication from Mr. Clarence
L. Ayres with regard to proposed liberalization of homestead mortgages.
The Secretary reported for record the following extracts from the
will of the late Professor George Slocum (page 119):I hereby give and bequeath one thousand dollars ($1,000) to the Regents of
the University of Michigan to be known as the "George Slocum Research Fund."
One half the income from this fund shall be added to the Weeks Research fund
annually, as income. The other half of the income shall be added to the principal
until such time as the total income shall amount to one thousand dollars ($1,000)
a year, at which time the whole income may be used for research in Ophthalmology
in such manner as the President shall advise, provided that such portion of the
income as may be necessary to stabilize the income at one thousand dollars
($1,000) per year may, from time to time, at the discretion of the Regents of the
University of Michigan, be added to the principal of the fund.
I give and bequeath to my wife, Helen B. Slocum, all my library and books,
including books, magazines, framed and unframed pictures, with the request that
she keep and use all such books and pictures as she may wish. The remainder she




APRIL MEETING, 1933


133


shall distribute as follows: all medical books and pamphlets shall be given by her
to the Library of the Medical School of the University of Michigan, more particularly for the use of the Department of Ophthalmology, under such rules as the
President of the University shall deem wise and best; my other books which my
wife does not care to keep shall be distributed among my children at any and such
times as she may see fit so to do and in such manner as she may think wise and
best. I suggest that my very old books be given to the University of Michigan
at any and at such times as she may see fit so to do, or after and until she no
longer desires to keep them herself.
All my relics and specimens of all kinds are to be the full and unquestioned
property of my wife, with the suggestion that she give any and such things as she
may not desire to keep to the Museum of the University of Michigan.
On nomination of the Board of Governors of Adelia Cheever
House, Mrs. L. C. Karpinski and Mrs. C. L. Washburne were elected
to succeed themselves for terms of three years each, beginning October
1, 1933, as members of the Board of Governors of the Adelia Cheever

The Secretary filed a letter from Mrs. Anna Williamson expressing
her appreciation of the action taken by the Regents following the
death of the late Edward B. Williamson (page 119).
The Secretary filed a communication from The Women's City Club
of Detroit urging the granting of a certain honorary degree. The
Secretary was instructed to write The Women's City Club that recommendations for honorary degrees invariably came through the Committee of the University Council on Honorary Degrees, that the list
of candidates for honorary degrees for the coming commencement was
already filled, and further, that if recommendations for honorary
degrees for next year be sent, they should be addressed to the Committee on Hoi;:ry Degrees (page 117).
The following statement prepared by the President was ordered
incorporated in the minutes:With regret I report for record the death of Dr. Cyrenus Garritt Darling,
former member of the University faculty. Dr. Darling died at his home in Ann
Arbor on April 21, 1933. He was born at Bethel, New York, January 6, 1856, and
received the M.D. degree from Michigan in 1881. In 1890 he joined the faculty
of the Medical School (then the Department of Medicine and Surgery) as Assistant
to the Professor of Surgery and Clinical Surgery, and in 1891 became also Lecturer
on Oral Pathology and Surgery in the College of Dental Surgery. Thereafter his
academic titles were as follows: 1892-1896, Demonstrator of Surgery in the
Department of Medicine and Surgery, and Clinical Lecturer on Oral Pathology in
the College of Dental Surgery; 1896-1899, Demonstrator of Surgery and Lecturer
on Minor Surgery in the Department of Medicine and Surgery, and Clinical Lecturer on Oral Pathology and Surgery in the College of Dental Surgery; 1899-1903,
Lecturer on Genito-Urinary Surgery and Minor Surgery and Demonstrator of
Surgery in the Department of Medicine and Surgery, and Clinical Lecturer on Oral
Pathology in the College of Dental Surgery; 1903-1907, in addition to his other
titles, Acting Dean of the College of Dental Surgery; 1904-1905, Clinical Professor
of Surgery, Lecturer on Genito-Urinary and Minor Surgery and Demonstrator of
Surgery in the Department of Medicine and Surgery, and Lecturer on Oral Pathology
and Surgery in the College of Dental Surgery; 1905-1906 (with medical title as
before) Professor of Clinical Oral Surgery; 1907-1914, Clinical Professor of
Surgery and Demonstrator of Surgery in the Department of Medicine and Surgery,
and Clinical Professor of Oral Surgery in the College of Dental Surgery; 1914 -1919, Professor of Surgery and Clinical Surgery in the Medical School, and Professor of Oral Surgery in the College of Dental Surgery. In 1919 he retired from
the Medical faculty, but retained until 1927 his position as Professor of Oral




134                    APRIL    MEETING, 1933
Surgery in the Dental College. Thus for thirty-seven years Dr. Darling had been
associated with the staff of the University. He was a fellow of the American College
of Surgeons, President of the Michigan State Medical Society in 1926, a contributor
to medical periodicals, and nationally known as an authority on oral surgery.
Outside of his connection with the University, Dr. Darling in 1911 was instrumental
in founding St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, and was its chief of staff
until but a short time before his death. In 1894 he was mayor of the City of Ann
Arbor.
In view of Dr. Darling's long and honorable service as a member of this University's faculties, his eminence as a surgeon, and the esteem in which he has been
held in this community and in the State, I recommend that the preceding sketch
of his career be inserted in the Proceedings of the Regents, and that the Regents
express to his surviving family their profound sympathy in their bereavement.
Leave of absence for the remainder of the University year, on
account of illness, was voted to Professor Thomas H. Reed of the
Department of Political Science. Professor Reed's work will be cared
for by his colleagues during his absence.
On recommendation of the Faculty of the College of Architecture,
the degree of Bachelor of Science in Architecture (Architecture) was
voted to Floyd Richard Johnson.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote with the exception expressly stated.
The Board adjourned to Friday, May 19, at 3:30 P.M.

DOCTOR OF LAWS
CONFERRED AT THE FOUNDER'S DAY EXERCISES OF THE LAWYERS CLUB,
APRIL 21, 1933
SAMUEL SEABURY. Honored wherever good government is prized. As a
member of the Supreme Court and later of the Court of Appeals of New York,
he proved himself wise in counsel, learned in the law, and resolute in the
administration of justice. Liberal in interpreting legal principles in the light
of social needs, he conceived the law less as a fixed code than a dynamic force
with inherent capacity to adapt itself to altered conditions. To the distinction
won by temper and attainments as a jurist, he added enduring renown by his
public service as investigator of the Magistrates' Courts and as counsel for the
Legislative Committee in its examination of the municipal government of New
York. Resourceful and unrelenting in disclosing evidences of bribery and corruption, he defied a highly organized political machine, compelled unwilling and
recalcitrant witnesses to contradict and incriminate themselves, brought to light
the sinister methods by which prominent officials enriched themselves at public
expense, and forced the offenders to serve in prison or flee in disgrace. For
his skill and courage in unmasking evil he has received widespread acclaim;
not less praiseworthy is his constructive plan of municipal government whereby
such abuses as he has revealed shall become forever impossible. He has fearlessly maintained the traditions of an informed judiciary, upon whose conduct
and decisions rests the hope of civic improvement, and has exemplified throughout
his career the ideals which serve as compelling forces toward a freer life of
progress and enlightenment.
CONFERRED AT THE HONORS CONVOCATION, APRIL 28, 1933
STEPHEN PIERCE DUGGAN. A graduate of the College of the City of New
York in 1890, and since 1896 a member of its faculty in the Department of
Political Science, whose services as author, educator, and unofficial ambassador
have won recognition here and beyond the seas. As director of the Institute
of International Education since 1919 he has labored with effective zeal to
promote the cause of mutual understanding and to strengthen the bonds of
goodwill among the nations of the world. Through foreign fellowships established
under his direction, young scholars have not only prepared themselves for professional careers but have helped to interpret the problems and ideals of their
own people to countries of alien speech and traditions. Firm in his belief that
through a community of scholarship, men may realize their joint heritage and
strive for the common good, he has endeavored to create, by personal contacts,
an enduring basis of cultural relations in place of ignorance, isolation, and
distrust. When sympathetic and intelligent attitudes of mind prevail, arbitrament
by force cannot occur.

resigned. Dr. Birkbeck will continue to receive $115 a month from the
University Hospital.
The following rule was adopted, effective at once:Students must pay in acceptable funds (which shall not include notes unless
the same are bankable), all amounts due the University before they can be
admitted to the final examinations at the end of either semester or of the Summer
Session. No officer of the University is authorized to make any exceptions to
this rule.
The Board directed that notice be given to a certain debtor for work
done by the Department of Engineering Research that unless satisfactory settlement of the account is made promptly a suit for collection
will be begun, and the Secretary was authorized to initiate such suit.
The Board referred with power, to the Vice-President and Secretary
subject to the usual approval of the Finance Committee, individual
cases of demand for reduction of mortgage interest when such demands
were made.
The Regents declined to increase fees of students in the College of
Engineering in the amount of $1 per year and apply such fee increase
for a subscription to the Michigan Technic for each student.
The Board approved the following procedure and regulations concerning honorary degrees, as recommended by the University Council:1. All recommendations of individual candidates for honorary degrees, which
are received from outside the University, are to be referred through the dean to
the faculty most appropriate in each case.
2. The University Committee on Honorary Degrees, in addition to utilizing
and selecting from the nominations made by the several faculties, may add
nominations of its own, if it sees fit.
3. The several faculties may nominate for honorary degrees not only persons
regarded as worthy of such distinction because of their achievements in the
literary, scientific, artistic, or professional fields represented by the faculties, but
also individuals whose qualifications are of a more general nature or whose
relation to the University is more properly with the institution as a whole than
with any of its subdivisions. A faculty, in making its nominations to the
University Committee, shall definitely indicate into which of these categories
the nominees fall.
4. Honorary degrees may be conferred at times other than at Commencement
as follows:
a) At University convocations, and
b) At special convocations of the individual schools or colleges at which the
University as a whole is represented by its general administrative officers
and by the deans or designated members of the faculties of the several
schools and colleges; provided
5. That the degrees and the candidates be subject to the recommendation of
the Committee on Honorary Degrees and the Committee on Program and Policy
of the University Council and to the approval of the Board of Regents; and
6. That the actions involved in paragraph 5 be taken at regularly called
meetings of the Committee on Honorary Degrees, the Committee on Program and
Policy, and the Board of Regents.
7. The term "convocation" shall be reserved for academic and ceremonial
functions of the University as a whole and such special convocations (see 4b)
as may be authorized by the University Council.
8. The Board of Regents shall be requested to approve the above definitions
and to delegate to the University Council the power to authorize the holding of
convocations of an official nature.

MAY MEETING, 1933


The Board received for filing the financial report of the University
Musical Society for the year ended August 31, 1932, with attached
certificate of audit by Mr. D. W. Springer (R.P. 1929-1932, page 917).
The Board declined the proffered services, for a commission, of a tax
expert to secure refund of alleged unnecessary tax payments of approximately $150.
The following transfers were authorized (R.P. 1929-1932, page
198):
From Parke, Davis and Company Ventriculin fund to the Thomas Henry Simpson
Memorial Institute trust fund such amount as may be required on June 30,
1933, at the present date believed to be $6,282.62
From' Parke, Davis and Company Ventriculin fund to the Current Expense
account of the Thomas Henry Simpson Memorial Institute such amount as
may be required on June 30, 1933, at the present time believed to be not
in excess of $400
The Board accepted with thanks, in accordance with the terms and
conditions stated, the gift of Delta Omicron Musical Sorority, of the
sum of $200, to constitute the Delta Omicron Scholarship fund. This
fund is to be invested as are other similar trust funds. The donors
hope to be able to build up the fund to at least $1,000, and they expressed
the desire that the income be not used until the fund reaches that
amount, or failing to reach $1,000 at the expiration of two years, that
it be used for scholarships or student loans, as the Board of Directors
of the University Musical Society, through its president, may from
time to time recommend. If for any reason any income is not so used,
it is to be added to the principal. The donors expressed the further
desire that so far as possible, in the awarding of scholarships or loans,
preference be given to women students studying applied music.
The Board accepted with thanks and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the offer of the gift, the sum of $1,094.67 from the
School of Music Alumni Association. This amount is to be held in
trust and invested as are other similar trust funds, for the establishment
of the Elsa Gardner Stanley Scholarship fund. The income in part or
in whole is to be used for scholarships or student loans, as the Board
of Directors of the University Musical Society, through its president,
may from time to time recommend. If for any reason any income is
not so used, it is to be added to the principal. Elsa Gardner Stanley
was the only daughter of the late Professor and Mrs. Albert Augustus
Stanley; she was a graduate of the University School of Music, and for
several years a member of its faculty.
The Secretary filed a letter from the family of Mrs. Mary E.
Buffington expressing appreciation in her behalf of the action of the
Regents at the April meeting (page 131).
The Board directed the Finance Committee and the Secretary to
secure bids and report to the Regents, for the work of auditing the
accounts of the University, the University Hospital, and dormitories,
for the year 1932-1933.
The Regents authorized the charge to the Woodward Avenue Lease
fund, of the cost of printing and postage for a letter recently sent to
the alumni residing within the State (outside the city of Ann Arbor),
the total cost being approximately $1,300.
The Board authorized the Department of Highway Engineering




MAY MEETING, 1933


141


to give during Commencement Week, a concentrated course for
the benefit of the incoming staff of the State Highway Commissioner's
office. As no expense will be attached to the giving of this course, no
charge will be made to those who attend it.
The Regents authorized the Department of Engineering Research
to make an exhibit at the coming meeting of the American Society for
Testing Materials, to be held in Chicago June 26 to 30. The cost,
estimated to be between $300 and $500, is to be paid out of funds
already accumulated by the Department of Engineering Research.
Representatives of the "National Student League" appeared at the
door to present demands similar to those presented at the April meeting
(pages 127-128). The Board declined to receive these demands the
second time since, as the delegation was advised, the answer would of
necessity be the same as that given at the April meeting.
The Secretary raised the question of the use of University trucks or
automobiles for the transportation of students. The Board instructed
him to investigate the situation further and to make a report, including
the feasibility, and cost if feasible, of insuring any liability for personal
injury arising from such use of transportation.
The Board approved the holding of a special convocation on the
occasion of the opening of the Medical School September 25, 1933, and
directed that should a certain proposed recipient of an honorary degree
(page 117) not be present at Commencement but should be present and
deliver the address on the occasion of the Medical School Convocation,
the honorary degree should be conferred upon him at that time.
The Board voted that the degree of Bachelor of Arts should be
conferred at the coming Commencement upon George Mason of Chicago, 1857-1861, as of the Class of 1861.
Leave of absence to July 1 next with pay due to illness was voted
to Mr. Morley P. Williams, Superintendent of the University Museums
Building.
The Board voted to confer upon Norman A. Wood, for nearly forty
years connected with the University Museums, the title of Emeritus
Curator of Birds, to be effective July 1, 1933, with compensation for
such services as he chooses to render of $1,800 a year during the
remainder of his lifetime.
The sum of $50 was transferred from the "Adjustments Fund" of
Medical Administration to the Current Expense account of the Department of Surgery.
Sabbatical leave for the first semester of 1933-1934 was voted to
George M. Ehlers, Assistant Professor of Geology (page 131).
The Board voted to approve continuation of the Michigan Alumni
Undergraduate Scholarships through the junior and senior years, to
those holders of these scholarships whose work has continued to be
satisfactory during the sophomore year (page 46).
The Board appointed the following physicians and surgeons, all of
Detroit except Drs. Douglas and Willis of Northville, Dr. Davis of
Ann Arbor, Dr. Smith of Grand Rapids, Dr. Stucky of Lansing, and
Dr. Lojacano of Marquette, each to be Extramural Lecturer in Postgraduate Medicine for the period of twelve months, beginning June 1,
1933. The University does not assume any obligation to pay compensation to these appointees (R.P. 1929-1932, page 950):

The Board directed that the communication from    the Board in
Control of Athletics, by its chairman, Professor Aigler, which was laid
upon the table at the March meeting (page 117), should remain upon
the table until the University Council could study the whole question
of procedure in making recommendations in physical education.
Dean Bates reported to the Board that Regent Murfin had presented to the Law Library:
Federal Statutes Annotated, second edition, including the supplements, of 1919
to 1925 inclusive
American Annotated Cases, 1912A to 1918E inclusive
The colleagues of Regent Murfin accepted this gift and extended to
him a vote of thanks therefor.
The President reported that a conference had been held at noon
this day, attended by Mr. John T. Creighton, and Mr. Baylor Knox
representing the City Bank Farmers Trust Company, Trustees of the
estate of Mr. William W. Cook, and by President Ruthven, Mr. J. C.
Christensen, Mr. S. W. Smith, and during its latter portion by Mr.
James Baird. At this conference Mr. Creighton, and Mr. Knox acting
for the Trust Company, approved the remaining items of equipment
for Hutchins Hall, including hangings, rugs, miscellaneous expense,
landscaping, and minor contingencies, and the University was authorized to proceed with letting contracts for these items which will
complete the furnishing and equipment of Hutchins Hall ready for use.
They approved also the financing of these remaining items, if necessary, either through contractors or sub-contractors supplying the
materials, or James Baird Company, Inc., upon the same conditions
as set forth in a letter of June 29, 1932, from John T. Creighton and
City Bank Farmers Trust Company to the Regents of the University
of Michigan with regard to the completion of the construction of
Hutchins Hall. Mr. Creighton and Mr. Knox expressed themselves
as approving the work of construction already completed on Hutchins
Hall. It is expected that Hutchins Hall will be ready for occupancy
by the Law School at the opening of the first semester of 1933-1934
(R.P. 1929-1932, page 867).
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
otherwise expressly stated.
The Board adjourned to the date and hour of the annual meeting,
namely, June 16, at 10:30 A.M.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary




Annual June Meeting, 1933


UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, JUNE 16, 1933
The Board was called to order in the Regents' Room at 10:40 A.M.
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Murfin, Regent Beal, Regent
Smith, Regent Shields, Regent Clements, Regent Cram, Regent Shorts,
Regent Stone. Absent, Superintendent Pearce. There were also in
attendance Vice-President Yoakum, Dr. F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G.
Watkins, and the Secretary.
The customary financial reports were filed.
The minutes of the meeting of May 19 were approved as submitted
to the Regents in press proof with certain specified changes.
The Board directed that a wrought-iron tablet be erected in Hutchins
Hall reciting the first paragraph of the tenth clause of the will of the
late William W. Cook. The cost of this tablet, estimated at $600, is
to be treated as a part of the work to be done by the James Baird
Company, Inc., under its contract (page 142).
The President, Regent Clements, and the Secretary were authorized
and directed to have erected in some appropriate place upon the
Campus a bronze tablet of suitable design and inscription as a
memorial to the late Regent Walter H. Sawyer. The cost of this tablet
is to be taken from an available gift fund.
Regent Stone informally reported for the committee appointed at
the May meeting (page 137) to consider questions of purchases to be
made from or subsidies to be granted to current University publications or expenditures for advertising, and recommended that these
questions be raised when making up the budget for 1933-1934. It
was so ordered.
The Board commissioned Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company
to make the audit of the University and University Hospital books
and of the books of seven University dormitories for the year 1932 -1933 at the flat sum of $2,750 (page 140).
Regent Cram made the following report with respect to the affairs
of the Michigan League:REPORT FOR UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LEAGUE AND ALUMANAE COUNCIL
FOR YEAR 1932-1933
This year has seen so complete a change in the administration of the League
that some special report should be made.
Miss Alta Atkinson, Food Director of Martha Cook Dormitory, was brought
to the building as Manager and Miss Ethel McCormick was made Social Director
in connection with the activities of the University of Michigan League. Several
changes have been made, all looking toward bringing more students into the
building. How well these changes have worked is shown by the following figures:

This does not include students who eat in the
cafeteria, main dining room, etc., or who come
to the building to do laundry, pressing, etc.
In the theater the question of sound apparatus has been considered but is in
abeyance at the present time. As practically all good modern pictures are sound
pictures and the theater is equipped only for silent pictures, this is an important
matter which must certainly come up for consideration in the near future.
The new regime of cooperation with the Union will undoubtedly work to the
advantage of both. There have been no special "League" dances held since March,
but there has been quite a continual rental of available rooms for private dances
and parties.
The annual art exhibit of Professor Fairbanks and his pupils has this year
been held in the League, and the work of this too little known department
of the University has been received with delight by many hundreds of people who
have found it impossible to climb to the fourth floor of the old administration
building where the studios are located and where the exhibits have previously
been held.
In connection with the work of the Michigan alumnae, there are a number
of interesting things to be noted. The two large notes at the bank have been
cared for either wholly or in part. The note of $60,000 has been decreased to
$48,000 with the interest met in full. The other note of $10,000 has been taken
up through the payment in full of the subscriptions upon which the note was
based.
Since February, collections have totaled nearly $15,000. This includes the
payment of the $10,000 pledge.
In regard to the fellowship work of the alumnae, I would note:
1. The first of ten Capital Fellowships has been established. This is the
Lucy Elliott Memorial Fellowship of $15,000 for graduate study anywhere
in the world.
2. We have subsidized two fellows out of current funds. The holders of
these fellowships are:
Eleanor  Cooke....................$500
M argaret  Ives....................  500
3. We have carried this year a Cooperative Fellowship of which $300 was
given by the Nellie Jackson Memorial Fund of Detroit and $200 by the
Alumnae Association. The holder of this fellowship has been Clara Roe
of Flint.
4. Flint, San Francisco Bay, and Saginaw have started such cooperative
fellowships.
5. There have been established Senior Gift Scholarships to which all the
current funds for this year are going. This is done in order to help meet
the emergencies on the Campus at the present time due to the unnatural
financial situation.
Finally I have been asked by Mrs. Blankenburg, who has been Chairman of
the Board of Governors for the past three years, to express to the Board of
Regents her pleasure in doing this work and her thanks to the Board for its
continuous support and consistent cooperation.

The following communication       presented  by  the  President was
ordered incorporated in the minutes:With great regret I report the death of Dean John R. Effinger, which
occurred on June 7, 1933. I present for adoption the following minute:
Dean John Robert Effinger, of the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts, devoted forty-one years of his busy and successful life to the University
of M\ichigan. He was graduated from this University in the Class of 1891 and
in 1898 received the degree of Ph.D. here. Since 1892 he had been a member
of the faculty, winning promotion to a professorship of French in 1912; his
administrative talents, first exercised as Dean of the Summer Session, brought
him appointment as acting dean and then as dean of the largest unit of the
University. During these years he became known to thousands of students who
passed through the college; there were few who had more friends or a wider
acquaintance among Michigan alumni than he, and few alumni who preserved
a keener or more active loyalty to their alma mater. To him is in large
measure due the success of the college over which he presided with dignity and
excellent judgment for the past twenty years. He called many distinguished
scholars to its faculty, and by encouraging the younger teachers to further
development and by forwarding the plans of departments, he maintained the
academic division of the University at the standard set by the ideals of its
founders. Leadership of faculty and students, in his case, was facilitated by an
unusual capacity for making friendships and commanding the respect and affection of colleagues. As a college administrator Dean Effinger was known far
beyond the campus of this institution. He was honored with the presidency of




146


ANNUAL JUNE MEETING, 1933


the Association of American Colleges and was frequently called on by the Association of American Universities to undertake the difficult task of inspecting
institutions of higher education. For the University of Michigan to be deprived
with stunning suddenness of so loyal an alumnus and an officer so experienced
through years of administration is a blow difficult to support; it is even harder
to face the loss of the man whose genial friendship meant so much to the
members of this Board and of the Faculties, and upon whose upright character
and good sense they had learned to rely. The Regents of the University of
Michigan hereby record in their Proceedings their profound sorrow at the death
of Dean John Robert Effinger, and direct their Secretary, as a token of their
sympathy, to communicate a copy of this resolution to his family.
The Secretary reported the following contracts by the Department
of Engineering Research (page 137):With The Timken-Detroit Axle Company, Detroit, for determination of positions
of instantaneous contacts in two styles of worm gears; at an estimated cost
of $400
With The Norge Corporation, 670 East Woodbridge, Detroit, for investigation of
refrigerator noises; at an estimated cost of $2,500
The Secretary filed payrolls of the Department of Engineering
Research for the months of April and May, 1933, in the amounts
respectively of $4,160.65 and $5,326.87 (page 129).
The Board received from     the Trustees of the Earhart Foundation
notice of the appropriation of $10,000 to the University for the University year 1933-1934 for the continued support of the work in
community leadership being carried on under the direction of Professor
McKenzie of the Department of Sociology (page 40). A formal vote
of thanks was tendered the Earhart Foundation for this continued
generous cooperation.
The Board directed the incorporation in the minutes of record of
Grants-in-Aid made by the National Research Council to the following
three members of the Faculty to assist them     in research as follows:To Assistant Professor Ralph L. Belknap, Department of Geology, a grant of $500
for the purchase of supplies and equipment, in connection with his study of
the upper air conditions over the Greenland ice-cap
To Professor Robert Gesell, Physiology Laboratory, a grant of $500 for equipment,
supplies, and technical assistance, in connection with his study of the action
potentials of the nerve cells and fibers constituting the respiratory center
To Professor A. Franklin Shull, Department of Zoology, a second grant of $400
for technical assistance, in connection with his study of wing production in
aphids
The Board accepted with thanks the sum        of $100 from    the Ann
Arbor Branch     of the American Association      of University   Women
toward the support of an academic teacher in the University Hospital
School.
The following routine resignations were approved by the Regents

enlightened benefactor of this University and of his home community, and
WHEREAs, By his aid the University of Michigan was enabled to maintain
for three years the Fellowship in Creative Art, which was both an inspiration
and a practical benefit to students preparing for a literary career; to pursue
important anthropological and archaeological investigations in the Philippine
Islands over a period of three years; to carry out for more than ten years a
program of archaeological and humanistic research in the Near East, involving
the important excavations at Karanis, Egypt; and to add to its library invaluable
and unique collections of Arabic manuscripts, early Latin and Greek manuscripts,
and papyri, all of which have added greatly to the prestige of this institution
and have served to stimulate and quicken the scholarly work being done on its
Campus; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby record
their profound sorrow at the death of this far-seeing and public-spirited citizen,
who was so keen to perceive and to understand the purposes of this University
and so generous in his encouragement of them, whose appreciation of the needs
of his fellow men led him to make munificent provision of recreational facilities
for their use and enjoyment, and whose genuine modesty induced him, during his
lifetime, to refuse the public acknowledgment and credit which were so amply
due him; and be it further
Resolved, That the Secretary of this Board be instructed to convey to Mrs.
Rackham a copy of these resolutions, as an indication of the Regents' own sense
of loss and of their heartfelt sympathy in her bereavement.
The Board accepted with regret the final resignation of Robert
T. Crane as Professor of Political Science, thus terminating the leave

MASTER OF ARTS
NEiVA RUTH DEARDORFF. A graduate of the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts in the class which now celebrates its twenty-fifth commencement
anniversary. Long engaged in many forms of social service, and proving her
competence under every responsibility, she now occupies, as Director of the Research
Bureau of the Welfare Council of New York, a position of importance in promoting
the well-being of the city's unwanted and wasted children. By devoting herself to
their growth under healthier and happier conditions, and by laboring with informed
purpose, she has won the esteem of all workers in her special field.
DEXTER   IASON FERRY, JR. A student here from 1892 to 1895, a graduate of
Columbia in the Class of 1898, President of the Ferry-Morse Seed Company.
A distinguished and public-spirited citizen whose influence has been priceless in
the support of every worthy cause, a patron of arts and letters, constant and helpful
in his devotion to the best interests of the University, he lends distinction to the
degree whereby the University officially, as she has always done in fact, now claims
him for her own.
ROBERT RAYNOLDS AMCA'IATH. A graduate of the College of Engineering in
the Class of 1913, whose contributions to the mechanism of telescopes have won
for him and his associates at the Lake Angelus Observatory the John Price Wetherell
medal of the Franklin Institute. By applying with inventive skill electrical frequency changers to telescopes he has widened for astronomers the horizons that
reach beyond our world, and by originating educational films to show change and
movement in celestial spheres he has revealed, as none had done, the trackless ways
of a universe in motion.
MASTER OF ENGINEERING
FRED MIORRELL ZEDER. A graduate of the College of Engineering in the Class
of 1909, whose career has been one of conspicuous success. Rising steadily in his
profession to posts of increasing importance, he has, since 1923, been associated
with the Chrysler Corporation and has justified the confidence placed in his wisdom
and experience. He has repeatedly demonstrated his constructive imagination and
engineering ability by designing and developing types of cars which have made his
company one of the leading producers in its field. Noted for his encouragement of
fundamental research he now holds, as Vice-President in charge of Engineering, a
commanding place in one of the great industries of the world.
MASTER OF LAWS
JOHN PETER BARNES. A graduate of the Law School in the Class of 1907,
Judge of the United States District Court of Northern Illinois. An able member
of his profession, respected by his associates of the bar for his scholarly grasp of
legal principles and for his courage and integrity in administering the law, he
serves the public for the public good. Through his practical idealism and the
sanity of his decisions he lends to the bench effective support in the conflict between
society and the disruptive forces of organized crime.
JOHN THOMAS VANCE. A graduate of the Law School in the Class of 1909,
who now, as Law Librarian of Congress, administers a responsible office with
marked efficiency. Widely recognized and honored by his colleagues for his knowledge of the civil law and his interpretation of early Spanish documents of Latin
America, he successfully combines research with the direction of a great institution.
DOCTOR OF ARCHITECTURE
ELIEL SAARINEN. Architect, city planner, designer, whose achievements are
known here and beyond the seas. Formerly associated with the University, he was
called to transmute the vision of Mr. George G. Booth into the reality of Cranbrook.
Under the magic of his art, stones and mortar rise in new and compelling forms
of beauty and remain enduring monuments of his skill.
DOCTOR OF ENGINEERING
JAM-ES BAIRD. A graduate of the College of Engineering in the Class of 1896,
a great builder and engineer, master of the knowledge which has enabled architects

to create buildings that are bold in conception, impressive in size, and beautiful
in form. Associated throughout his career with vast constructive enterprises,
chiefly with the George A. Fuller Company, of which he became President, and
now head of the firm which bears his name, he has enriched our cities with a
number of imposing structures, notably the Lincoln and Arlington Memorials, the
Internal Revenue Building, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Aeolian Building,
and the recent units of the Law Quadrangle on our campus. These give lasting
expression to man's vision and his capacity to achieve.
DOCTOR OF SCIENCE
JOHN BIACK JOHNSTON. A graduate of the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts in the Class of 1893, Doctor of Philosophy in 1899, Professor of
Comparative Neurology and Dean of the College of Science, Literature, and Arts
at the University of Minnesota. Beginning his career as an instructor in zoology
here, he has won recognition as a scientific investigator, influential teacher and
administrator, author and editor in the field of his specialty. In conferring this
degree upon him, the University pays tribute to an alumnus who has distinguished
himself in developing problems of research and in expressing their relation to the
changing curriculum.
JOSEPH LEGGETT \IILLER. A graduate of the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts in the class which celebrates its fortieth commencement anniversary,
formerly instructor in the Medical School, now Clinical Professor of Medicine
in the University of Chicago. In his long association with the Cook County and
the St. Luke's Hospital, he established a national reputation as a diagnostician
and consulting physician. A leader in the knowledge of his profession, a productive
scholar in the study of coronary and circulatory diseases, skilled in the alleviation
of suffering, he not only restores strength to the afflicted but inspires the strong
to renewed endeavor.
EUGENE CORNELIUS SULLIVAN. A graduate of the University in the Class of
1894, Instructor in Analytical Chemistry from 1899 to 1903, formerly President
and now Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Corning Glass Works.
In his search for a type of glass with a low coefficient of thermal expansion and
high resistance to chemical attack he invented Pyrex, and applied the results of his
research to the needs and processes of scientific and industrial use. For his distinguishd services in the field of chemistry he was awarded the medal of the
Franklin Institute in 1928 and the Perkins medal in the following year; throughout
his career he has persistently followed the unending quest, and shared with others
what he sought and found.
DOCTOR OF LAWS
JOSEPH HENRY BEALE. Royall Professor of Law in Harvard University,
Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Recognized both at home
and abroad as a learned investigator and stimulating teacher, he holds a preeminent
place among the authorities in his field. His numerous contributions to legal
studies, especially in the domain of the Conflict of Laws, are notable alike for
profound scholarship and illuminating interpretation. Through personality and
attainment he has stamped his constructive thought upon the legal problems that
confront a complex democracy.
CHRISTIAN GAUSS. A graduate of the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts in the Class of 1898; Instructor in Romance Languages in this university
from 1899 to 1901, now Professor of Modern Languages and Dean of the College
in Princeton University, whose influence extends far beyond the institution which
he worthily represents. A keen observer and gifted interpreter of human motives,
he has won distinction as a scholar who contributes to the understanding of men
and events in the history of literature, as an essayist who writes of contemporary
problems with precision and charm of style, and as an administrator who shows
wisdom and sympathy in adjusting the difficulties that confront the undergraduate
in his relation to school and society. His analysis reaches the causes of things,
his exposition makes them clear.
ALBERT KAHN. A leader in contemporary architecture, whose creative imagination is attested by imposing structures that combine utility with dignity and
beauty. Great industrial plants and towering office buildings in Detroit and elsewhere have risen responsive to his dream. By expressing function and purpose
in harmony with massive strength and artistic design, they bear witness to the
progress made by American architects, and challenge comparison with historic
monuments of the past.
JOHN CAMPBELL AiIERRIA'AI. A scientific investigator of the first rank, an
administrator of proved ability, President of the Carnegie Institution of Wash



180              ANNUAL JUNE MEETING, 1933
ington. As Professor of Palaeontology and Historical Geology at the University
of California for many years, he won an international reputation by his numerous
authoritative publications in his chosen field. Called to direct the activities of
an institution whose influence is everywhere known, he has given abundant evidence
of his interest in the relation of research to the problems of education, and of his
capacity to integrate both with the orderly development of human progress. His
vision penetrates the secrets of life embedded in the earth through countless years,
his knowledge and interpretation relate them to the living present.
ORLA BENEDICT TAYLOR. A graduate of the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts in the Class of 1886 and of the Law School in the following year. In a
career marked by profound understanding of the law and by brilliant distinction
in court and council, he has exerted a lasting influence upon the development of
certain phases of public law in this state. Engaged in cases relating to railways,
public utilities, and industrial concerns, he clearly saw their implications and with
lucid exposition set forth their relation to the public good. Since his retirement
from the bar, he has proved himself skilled in the search for rare materials concerning Napoleon and the history of the law, learned in their use and interpretation,
and generous in making them permanently available to scholars in this University.

to the amount of $637.50 with the City of Detroit Bondholders Refunding Committee, in exchange for a registered 4'2 per cent bond of
this sum maturing August 1, 1962, and redeemable at the option of
the City on any interest payment date at par and accrued interest.
Regent Smith -and Superintendent Voelker took their seats.
The President laid before the Regents the special circumstances,
principally the late action of the Legislature, which had made it necessary this year to proceed with the budget with the saving of every
possible day of time and with the result that the budget was now presented to the entire Board by him instead of through the Finance
Committee as has been and would presumably be the practice in the
future. The President filed the following statement:The process of bringing the budget of the University for 1933-1934 within
the income as set by the Legislature was broken up into four separate steps.
In the first place all general services, such as upkeep of buildings and grounds,
repairs, heating, lighting, telephone services and all other assisting services, and
services for the security and welfare of the faculty and students were scrutinized
and reduced to what seemed to be the lowest amount consistent with safety of
operation.
The second step dealt with executive functions, student personnel units, and
all general offices and general accounts. These were contracted and consolidated,
and budget figures reduced again to a point where it seemed no further eliminations
could be made without complete loss of the activity. In none of the functions thus
handled will the efficiency of the department be able to be continued at what seems
to be a reasonable standard of operation.
The third step was to request the several Schools and Colleges and independent units to readjust their staffs and offerings as completely as possible. The
preliminary estimate indicated that it would be necessary to find approximately
one-third of the total reduction required in this process. In carrying out this
part of the procedure, departments eliminated a considerable number of their
clerical and technical assistants, placed a number of members of their staffs on
part time, in some instances reduced salaries, gave leaves of absence without pay,
and in other ways undertook to reduce budget requirements. The figures for two
of the major processes used by units and departments were as follows:

POSITIONS ELIMINATED

Others.......................   5
Total......................      64
Nonteaching Staf
Total......................      58
Grand Total................          122
In order to accomplish these reductions, members of the staff have increased
their teaching load and other duties very materially in many instances, have
reduced course offerings, and have seriously constricted future important research
programs.
The fourth step was to determine the decrease necessary in salaries in order
to meet the deficit remaining after the above reductions had been made. The rule
used in reduction of salaries is as follows: $1,500 of each salary was exempted
from percentage reduction and any part of a salary above $1,500 was reduced
according to the following formula:8 per cent on the first $2,000 above $1,500
12 per cent on the second $2,000
15 per cent on the third $2,000
20 per cent on any portion above $7,500, provided that no
reduction should exceed 20 per cent for two years
Figures on general cost of living and on the conditions under which younger
members of the faculty were required to work were used in the determination of
the $1,500. exemption. The extension of this $1,500 to all salaries is in accordance
with best practice and conforms in slight measure to the increase in responsibilities
and commitments among older members of the faculty. The scale of reductions
above this exemption was determined in part on the basis of the amount of reduction required and in part upon the range of salaries to which the percentages
had to be applied. In exempting $1,500 of each salary, approximately half of
the salary roll of the University was exempted from any percentage reduction.
The rise in percentage with increase in salary corresponds closely to other percentage intervals as these have been applied in other universities and other educational institutions up to the present time.
As far as possible these percentages have been set up to take into account
the fact that the salaries of faculty members were reduced after the Special Session of the Legislature for the year 1932-1933. In conformity, again, with those
institutions with which the University comes most strongly in competition for
men of ability and international reputation, percentages were kept as low as was
consistent with total amount of reduction absolutely necessary to meet the reduced
income. A great many salaries of individual faculty members have been reduced
more drastically than these percentages indicate. Combinations of step three,
where faculty members were put on part time or had salary reductions independent
of the percentage scale, and step four have resulted in total percentage reduction
more drastic than the scale shows.




JULY MEETING, 1933


183


Following an extensive discussion, on motion of Regent Stone as
Chairman of the Finance Committee, seconded by Regent Shields, the
budget was adopted in the following resolutions:Resolved, (1) That the budget as presented to the Board for the year 1933 -1934, amounting to $5,088,831.69, exclusive of the University Hospital, be approved and adopted as the budget for the year 1933-1934 except as the same may
be altered and reduced by (2) below
Resolved, (2) That this total shall be subject to reduction by such changes
as may be made in various clerical salaries recommended in a communication by
the Committee on Office Personnel under date of July 14, these changes being all
in the nature of reductions and to be subject to the approval of the President
before being effective
Resolved, (3) That the budget of the University Hospital shall, when prepared in detail in accordance with the same general principles of reductions as
have been applied to the budget of the University proper, be referred to the
Executive Committee with power
Resolved, (4) That the Vice-President and Secretary be authorized as in
former years to group or regroup accounts as may seem desirable for formal
accounting purposes, but without affecting in any case the actual amount of the
appropriation
The Executive Committee (as of July 28) took action adopting
the budget of the University Hospital and this later action is inserted
in these minutes in order that the record may show in one place the
entire action, with respect to adoption of the budget:Resolved, That the budget of the University Hospital for the fiscal year
1933-1934 be fixed at $1,282,989.00 for salaries and $856,193.40 for expense and
equipment, a total of $2,139,182.40.

JULY MEETING, 1933                             187
The Board enacted the following general directions with respect to
student fees* (pages 144-145):1. The retention of matriculation and diploma or graduation fees on precisely the present basis.
2. The payment of fees in advance by the semester rather than by the year
and designating the combined general fee and incidental fees (under 3, below) as
the "semester fee."
3. The combination of what were previously designated as the tuition and
library fees, and the designation of this combined element of the semester fee as
the "general fee." All other elements of the semester fee, such as outdoor physical
education, Health Service, and Michigan Union or Michigan League fees, will be
designated as "incidental fees."
4. The equalization of the semester fees charged men and women, making
them the same, and providing that any differential as between the Union and
League or other incidental fees be absorbed in the general fee. Proper amounts
are to be allocated by the Board each year to these University activities.
5. The payment of fees on the following basis, which aside from the parttime fee represents a probable decrease in the total amount of fees. (The fee for
a single semester was formerly 60 per cent of the annual fee.)

vaccination (immunity to smallpox). Vaccination may be waived by the Director
of the Health Service for applicants who file statements of objection on religious
grounds properly signed by parents or guardians. Such waiver shall release the

capitol.
The Regents directed that the so-called entertainment fund (R.P.
1929-1932, page 651) should henceforth be known as an entertainment
and maintenance fund, and that its purposes should be broadened to
include the purchase from time to time, at the discretion of the President, of equipment for the President's House, and the employment
of help needed to maintain the establishment. It is understood that
the equipment purchased is to remain the property of the University
and that the President is to continue to provide the service required
by his family.

patients who are unable to pay, and, on account of the present economic stress,
it is probable that there will be more demands on this fund than there have been
in the past, as it is absolutely necessary that we have patients for study. It will
also be necessary to use a portion of this fund for current expenses on account
of the reduction in the current expense fund of the Institute.

title of Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering with leave of absence
without pay for the University year 1933-1934.
James M. O'Neill, who was included in the budget of the present year as
Professor of Speech on three-fourths time at the salary of $4,510, was returned
to full time, but in view of the fact that he has been relieved from duties as
Chairman of the Department, the full-time salary was fixed at $5,508. This
necessitates an addition of $998 to the Salary account of the Department of
Speech.
Mr. Waldo M. Abbot, whose position as Assistant Professor of English was
eliminated for reasons of economy, was restored to the position for the year
1933-1934, with salary of $1,500. This necessitates an addition of $1,500 to
the budget of the Department of English.

enlarged for the use of women. Toilet room 121 will be made available
from the corridor only, as a key toilet for women.
18. The Old Law Building should be given some other appropriate designation, to be put on the building perhaps by a wooden or other movable
sign affixed over the two inscriptions "Law Department" cut in the
stone above the two entrances to the building.
August 3, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
Upon recommendation of Dean Henry M. Bates, the committee appointed

202                SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1933
1934, with salary at the rate of $3,000 for the University year. Mr. Yntema
will give approximately one-third time. Funds to take care of Professor Yntema's
salary are already provided in the budget.
August 13, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
Because of a misunderstanding on the part of Professor H. M. Randall,
Head of the Physics Department, the salaries of employees in the Physics Shop
were cut a greater percentage than. those of. employees in similar positions, such
as the Engineering Shops, Observatory Shop, and Chemistry Laboratory. The
committee, therefore, approved increases in these salaries to such an amount
as to bring them to a comparable basis with the other shop positions referred
to. The list of employees with salaries resulting from this action is as follows:
H. R. Roemer................$2,913
Gunther Kessler............... 2,913
P. A. Weyrich................. 2,448
August Wagner................. 2,363
Herbert Ritz................ 1,363
This action involves no increase in the budget, since the amount involved
will be taken from shop earnings or from the Current Expense provision in the
budget.
August 14, 1933
Included in the budget as adopted July 17, 1933, was a tentative budget
for the Department of Industrial Education, which department is supported by
federal and state funds under the Smith-Hughes Law. The total of this budget
was $18,836.00, submitted with the understanding that when it was known
definitely what funds were to be made available, the tentative budget could be
altered in accordance therewith. Information is now received that the sum of
$21,833.32 is to be released for this department, and the committee has, therefore, approved the following revised budget:
G. E. Myers, Professor................................   $ 5,508
Thomas Diamond, Associate Professor....................  4,308
Cleo Murtland, Associate Professor......................  4,146
E. Lewis Hayes, Assistant Professor (part-time)...........  564
F. W. Dalton, Research Assistant........................   1,472
Student  assistants.....................................  1,000

Total  salaries.....................................  $17,598
Current expense and equipment..........................     825
Traveling  expense.....................................   1,520
$19,943
No increase in salary is involved in any case, although one position which
had been eliminated was reinstated and one position which had been made threequarters time was restored to full time. The student assistant fund and fund
for clerical help were increased and the current expense fund, including travel
and equipment items, was reduced.
August 14, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee approved the proposed budget, as submitted by the Board
of Governors of the Lawyers Club, through Professor Grover C. Grismore, its

August 14, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The budget as originally adopted included an item of $1,200 in Medical
Administration as salary for a clerk, replacing an item of $2,576 which had
been carried previously as salary for one of two such positions. It has, however, been found impossible to secure an employee satisfactory to Professor
Novy at the salary of $1,200, and the committee, therefore, approved an increase
of $300 in the Salary account of Medical Administration, thus providing a
salary of $1,500 for the clerical position to be filled.
August 14, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The sum of $515 was added to the Salary account of the Department of
Mathematics, this amount being added to the salary provided for Professor
Walter 0. Menge in the budget as originally adopted. The salary of Professor
Menge is, thus, $3,428.
August 14, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
Leave of absence was granted to Professor Morris A. Copeland for the
University year 1933-1934, without salary, in order that Professor Copeland might
accept an invitation received by him to serve on the Committee on Government
Statistics and Information Services, sponsored by the Social Science Research
Council and the American Statistical Association. Dr. Copeland's courses will
not be given during his absence.
August 14, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.

Dr. Hubbs, in submitting the budget, advised that the Director of the
Department of Conservation has given some indication that an additional sum
in the amount of approximately $2,000 would be available for the special
beaver-trout investigation, but this sum was not considered when the budget
was drawn up.
August 23, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee granted leave of absence to Miss Ellen Stevenson, both as
Instructor in Geology and as Assistant to the Dean of Women, until June 30.
1934. This action of the committee assumes that, if necessary, Professor Hobbs
as Head of the Department of Geology and Miss Alice Lloyd as Dean of Women
will take care of these positions for the year in the usual routine of appointments out of the salaries released by the granting of a leave without salary to
Miss Stevenson. The leave of absence of Miss Stevenson is necessitated by her
assignment to other duties in connection with the management of the dormitories
(page 241).
August 24, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation by Dean Kraus, Chairman of the temporary Executive
Committee of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and at the
request of Professor K. C. McMurry, Chairman of the Department of Geography, the committee appointed Chester Youngs Assistant in the Department of
Geography for the period from July 1, 1933, to June 30, 1934, with salary for
the period of $1,128. This action necessitates the addition of that amount to
the Salary budget of the Department of Geography.
September 8, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
At the request of Dean Herbert C. Sadler, and with his approval, the
committee granted permission to the Department of Engineering Research to
display some of the equipment of that Department at the National Metal Exhibition in Detroit which begins on October 2, 1933, with the understanding
that the probable expense of approximately $200 will be met from the Current
Expense account of the Department of Engineering Research.
September 8, 1933
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation by Dr. Frederick G. Novy and Dr. Harley A. Haynes,
the committee granted leave of absence to Dr. Reuben L. Kahn, Assistant
Professor of Bacteriology, and Director of the Clinical Laboratories, to permit
him to attend an international meeting arranged by the Volta Foundation, which
is attached to the Royal Academy of Italy. It is understood that Dr. Kahn's
leave will extend from approximately September 15 to November 1, 1933, and
that it will be possible for him to attend the meeting without cost to the University or interruption to the usual work.

*Harvey Theodore Deinzer, A.B.
A communication was received from each of the four local banks,
requesting that the depository agreements (R.P. 1929-1932, pages 811,
933, and 961) be so altered as to relieve these banks from paying interest on demand deposits from and after October 1. In view of
changes in banking regulations, this request was approved.
The Vice-President and Secretary and the Investment Officer were
given authority to trade or exchange the University's holdings of
defaulted bonds of the Bankers Trust Company of Detroit as in their
discretion might be desirable, provided that no money other than a
reasonable amount for expenses is to be spent by the University under
this authority in excess of what will be received for the sale of such
bonds.
Regent Smith took his seat.
The following statement presented by Regent Murfin was adopted:It seems fitting to include in the minutes of the Regents a tribute to the
cherished memory of the late Paul Buckley, who died in Ann Arbor July 5,
* Graduated with distinction.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1933

1933, thus terminating thirteen and one-half years of devoted and highly useful
service to the University. He was born in 1881 at Petoskey, Michigan, and
was graduated from  the Law School of the University of Michigan in 1905.
His work from then on was of a varied sort, first in the title-abstract business,
then in managing hotels, and finally as assistant clerk of the Supreme Court
of this State. This experience, with its emphasis on precision of thought and
act, with its training in the procedure of the Bar and the Courts, and with its
knowledge not only of the hotel routine but of human nature as the hotel man
constantly studies it, fitted him wonderfully well for the positions he was later
asked to fill at the University. January 1, 1920, he became Assistant Secretary
of the University and as such served personally, to the satisfaction of all, at
the meetings of this Board till the summer of 1926, when he was asked to take
charge of the Michigan Union as its manager. In this he achieved outstanding
results, and it is inconceivable that the best successor to be found could at once
take up the work where he laid it down. While successful from the beginning,
Mr. Buckley had grown steadily in his grasp of the situation, in the understanding of his manifold problems, in his tact, poise, and inborn capacity for
friendly relations. He was loyal to all the interests he served-alumni, faculty,
and students-"to Michigan men everywhere." He was energetic in their behalf,
and immensely fertile and resourceful in developing ideas for the benefit of the
Union and the University. Finally, when unexpectedly brought face to face
with death in a dreadful form, he promptly mustered the resources of his
personality, and up to the hour he entered the hospital he went about his final
daily routine with a quiet, matter-of-fact courage that was magnificent.
In a desire to recognize his service to the University and the splendid
manhood that he exemplified, the Regents direct that this statement be spread
upon the records of the Board, and that a copy be sent to Mrs. Buckley.
Regent Stone, as Chairman of the Finance Committee, presented
the following written report made by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and
Company, embodying their audit of the University's accounts for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1933 (pages 143 and 49). After discussion
the report of the auditors was accepted and placed on file.
Honorable Ralph Stone,
Chairman of the Finance Committee,
The Regents of the University of Michigan,
Detroit, Michigan.
Dear Sir:
In accordance with instructions received, we have made an examination of
the accounts of the University of Michigan, for the year ended June 30, 1933.
Our work embraced the examination, to the extent hereinafter described,
of the accounts relating to the assets and liabilities of the University as shown
by the books at June 30, 1933, a review of the general principles upon which
the accounts as a whole are based, and a series of test checks of the transactions of the year, all for the purpose of enabling us to form an opinion as
to the financial condition of the University. In addition, we have compared the
several schedules contained in the annual Financial Report issued by the University,* with the records maintained, and have found that they are in accordance with the books of the institution. Our examination did not extend to a
detailed check of the cash and other transactions for the year under review, nor
did we confirm the accounts receivable, student loan notes, mortgages and land
contracts receivable by correspondence with the several debtors; with these
reservations we now submit a report on the accounts, together with relative
statements as enumerated in the index.*
FINANCIAL CONDITION
A balance sheet of the University as at June 30, 1933, is presented in
Exhibit A. In connection with our examination of the accounts relating to the
assets and liabilities at June 30, 1933, the following comment is submitted.
Filed at this meeting. See page 232.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1933


ASSETS
The accounts of the University are maintained, generally speaking, on the
basis of cash receipts and disbursements, in that, throughout the year cognizance
is not taken of income accrued but uncollected, nor is consideration given to
liabilities incurred, until they are paid. In this latter connection, however, it
should be stated that at the close of the fiscal year, efforts are directed to
obtaining invoices and vouchers for known expense obligations, and to the
issuance of checks in settlement thereof; to accomplish this purpose, it is
customary for the University to hold its cash accounts open for a few days after
June 30th in each year; thus, in this respect, the records approach the accrual
basis of accounting. The outstanding departure from the basis of cash receipts
and disbursements is the inclusion in the balance sheet of accounts receivable,
both general and hospital; the former relate to services rendered or advances
made out of the general funds of the institution, while the hospital accounts
receivable are in respect of charges for medical and surgical services rendered
to patients, uncollected at June 30, 1933.
GENERAL FUNDS
Under the above caption in the balance sheet, Exhibit A, appears an
amount of $2,596,289.52, particulars of which follow:
Cash  in  hands  of  University...........................$  47,639.28
Cash   in  closed  bank..................................  153,313.74
Cash  in  hands of State  Treasurer.......................  803,957.31
Inventories,  materials,  and  supplies....................  350,379.74
Accounts Receivable:
University   H ospital..............................  1,183,969.29
G eneral........................................  57,030.16
T otal.................................. $2,596,289.52
The cash in hands of the University was confirmed by certificates obtained
from the several depositaries, and by actual count of the funds on hand. At
this point mention might be made of the fact that the University has entered
into agreements with the Ann Arbor depositary banks, whereby the banks, in
lieu of the customary depository bonds, pledge with designated trustees certain
securities comprising bonds and first mortgages on real estate. We have inspected
the depositary agreements, and have obtained certificates, signed by the trustees,
confirming custody of the securities at June 30, 1933. The protection thus
afforded the University's local funds does not apply in the instance of depositaries located outside of Ann Arbor.
Cash in closed bank, in amount, $153,313.74, relates to the uncollected
balance of funds in the First National Bank, Detroit, on February 13, 1933,
at which date that bank suspended business; the figure has been confirmed by
certificate from the receiver.
Cash in hands of State Treasurer, $803,957.31, has been confirmed by correspondence with the Auditor General, and is in respect of the unremitted
balance at June 30, 1933, on the mill tax.
Inventories of materials and supplies at the date of the balance sheet
aggregated $350,379.74, and are classified in the following tabulation; the figures
as at June 30, 1932, are appended for purposes of comparison:

We have tested the arithmetical accuracy of the inventories, and have satisfied
ourselves that the basis of pricing adopted represented approximate cost. In
addition, we have been furnished with a certificate signed by a responsible
official of the University as to the accuracy of the quantities, and the inventory
in general. It was noted that in the inventories at the General Storehouse, and




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1933                               213
at the Chemistry Stores, some items have been on hand for several years;
these items have been discussed with officials, who have assured us that such
stores are of a nature not subject to deterioration by reason of age only, and
are properly included in the inventories.
Accounts receivable in the amount of $1,240,999.45 are indicated in the
balance sheet as follows:
H ospital...........................................  $1,183,969.29
G eneral.............................................  57,030.16
Total..........................................$1,240,999.45
The inclusion of the accounts receivable in the balance sheet of the University is in continuation of the policy adopted in prior years; normally in the
accounting system of the University proper, credits in respect of the charges
to accounts receivable are not made to income or asset accounts until cash has
been actually received. At the close of the fiscal year, however, provision is
made for the inclusion of certain items due but uncollected, as has been referred
to in a prior paragraph of this report. With respect to the individual accounts
of the University Hospital, these are kept on a basis of prepayments and
accruals, so that they may reflect from day to day the excess of charges for
services over receipts from that source. In recording the operating results of
the activities of the Hospital on the books of the University throughout the
year, the only items reflected are those relating to the receipt and disbursement
of cash; in the annual closing of the accounts, however, effect is given to the
accounts receivable as they exist at the end of the fiscal year.
For confirmation of the accounts receivable, both of the University and of
the Hospital, we listed the individual accounts, and found them to be in agreement with the balances shown by the controlling accounts in the general ledger.
The total University accounts receivable, $57,030.16, may be subdivided as
follows:
Due from affiliated associations...........................$34,609.09
Due from outside parties................................ 22,421.07
Total............................................. $57,030.16

made in the accounts.

we are of opinion that the reserve of $90,390.66 provided for possible loss in
their collection, and included on the liability side of the balance sheet, should
be adequate.

The balance relates to bonds of issues which have defaulted as to interest,
or as to principal maturities of an earlier date than those held by the University.
Of the mortgages receivable, $1,512,806.89, included in the investments of
the University, $61,161.65 relate to mortgages in respect of which foreclosure
proceedings have been instituted; on the expiry of the period during which the
mortgagor may redeem the property, this amount will be added to the real
estate investments of the institution.

Title deeds to the above parcels of land were produced for our inspection, other
than in the instance of the item of $16,505.70, which was acquired by foreclosure of a land contract hitherto bequeathed to the University. The remainder
of the items were acquired by foreclosure of the underlying mortgages.
In addition to our confirmation of the cash and securities at June 30, 1933,




218                SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1933
we have vouched the sales and acquisitions of securities during the year, and
have ascertained that all income received from securities has been properly
accounted for. It was noted that rentals on properties forming part of the
funds of the Levi Barbour and H. H. Herbst funds were in arrears in amounts
of $495.00 and $289.00 respectively.
We have satisfied ourselves generally that income received from specifically
invested funds has been allocated properly, and that income from consolidated
investments has been prorated fairly and correctly to the participating funds,
on the basis hitherto adopted. We have further noted that the procedure
adopted by the Regents at their meeting held on May 25, 1928, and amended
January 29, 1932, and November 25, 1932, relative to the creation of reserves
to cover losses on investments and uncollectible student loans, has been followed, by the transfer to "Consolidated Fund Reserve for Losses," of 5 per cent
of the income earned by the consolidated trust fund for the year ended June
30, 1933.
In connection with our examination of the trust funds, and the expenditures therefrom during the year under review, the following comments are
submitted.
It was noted that in the following funds in which the deed of gift specified
"a scholarship" or "a fellowship," more than one student had been benefited
by cash awards during the year:
AWARDS
FUND                                                  MADE
Adams, Charles Francis, Memorial Scholarship.....................4
Bagley, Paul  F., Fund  Endowment...............................2
Cole,  Emma  J.,  Fellowship  in  Botany............................2
Spaulding,  Stephen,  Scholarship..................................3
The deed of gift in the instance of the James L. Babcock Scholarship stipulates
"Of the annual income, $250.00 is to be used for a scholarship in music..
If a satisfactory candidate cannot be found, the entire income from the fund
is to be added to the principal." In this case two awards, each for $125.00,
were made during the year under review.
It was also noted that no award was made during the scholastic year
1932-1933 in respect of the Bronson-Thomas German Prize.
In the report on your accounts for the year preceding, exception was taken
by the auditors to use for loans to students, of certain income of the Oliver
Ditson fund. During the year under review the University obtained from Messrs.
Sullivan and Cromwell, attorneys for the estate of Mr. Ditson, the following
opinion: "From the standpoint of the estate, we are unable to see any objection
to the application of the income of the bequest in the manner proposed."
Further in connection with the Oliver Ditson fund, the income is directed
by the deed of gift to be used "for any one or more of the purposes mentidned
below, as shall, in the judgment of the Officers of the School of Music, be of
the greatest benefit musically to the School." These purposes are defined as
follows, "for establishing and maintaining a chair or chairs, of music or musical
history or musical aesthetics, or for establishing and maintaining scholarships
or fellowships in music, or for giving public performances.... of musical
compositions." It was noted that during the year under review awards had
been made to certain students of architecture, who, we understand, rendered
services to the School of Music.
PLANT FUNDS
Plant funds, aggregating $43,344,316.13 are indicated as follows in the
balance sheet, Exhibit A:

of funds received from the State Treasurer for construction of the Elementary
School.
Full particulars of the additions and retirals of physical properties during
the year under review are set forth in Schedule 12 of the Financial Report of
the University. A summary of the changes therein reflected is presented below:
PARTICULARS               JUNE 30, 1932  ADDITIONS (NET) JUNE 30, 1933

Total......................... $42,738,787.00  $600,185.96  $43,338,972.96
Particulars of the additions to lands during the year are as follows:
Valuation  accorded  to  city  lot, Fletcher Hall site............................$1,500.00
Taxes in arrears at date of acquisition, on lands hitherto acquired by the University  296.87
T otal.............................................................$1,796.87
Title to the Fletcher Hall site was produced for our inspection.
We have examined warranty deeds or other evidence of title to the land
owned by the University; we accept no responsibility, however, as to validity
of title. Receipted vouchers and vendors' invoices have been examined in
support of all major expenditures for additions during the year on buildings,
land improvements, and equipment. It. is not the practice of the University
to provide reserves for depreciation of its physical properties, on the theory
that the buildings and equipment are properly maintained, and that, as they
are incurred, replacement costs are systematically charged to expense.
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL ACCOUNTS
The accounts of the University Hospital are maintained on a basis of
accruals and prepayments, in contra distinction to the cash basis adopted for
those of the University as a whole. This distinction is made for the reason
that the Hospital is treated as a self-supporting institution, which should, in
the presentation of its accounts, reflect those items of income and expense which
must be considered in presenting the operating results of the institution, although
not, during the period covered by the accounts, represented by cash receipts and
disbursements. Thus, the accounting system at the Hospital provides for the
prompt recording of accounts receivable covering services rendered to patients,
and for depreciation charges, representing provision for wear and tear of the
physical properties, which must be rehabilitated by the expenditure of cash at
irregular intervals.
The basis of accruals and prepayments in so far as relates to the accounts
of the Hospital was approved and adopted by the Regents during the year
1925, while the charge against revenue for equipment replacement fund was
authorized by the Regents April 24, 1928.
In Exhibit B, designated Schedule 20 in the Financial Report of the University of Michigan for the year ended June 30, 1933, are set forth particulars
of the operating results of the University Hospital for the year under review,
prepared on the basis outlined in the preceding paragraph.
It will be noted from Exhibit B that the excess of revenue for the year
was $41,035.57, after provision for bad debts in the amount of $28,500.00,
for equipment replacements to the extent of $53,103.80, and for appropriations
aggregating $17,808.13 for construction and equipment projects. The amount
of $53,103.80, representing the excess of the provision for depreciation over the
total expenditures for replacements during the year under review, will, in the
ensuing year, be appropriated and added to a fund of $495,707.81 existing at
June 30, 1933, and available for equipment replacements. Further, the net
operating income of $41,035.57 will likewise be set aside and added to an
invested fund of $147,292.90 available at June 30, 1933, for making good any
operating deficit which may occur in the future, or for defraying the cost of
special equipment or additions to the Hospital facilities requisitioned and
approved in the manner directed.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1933


Regent Stone further presented the reports of Peat, Marwick,
Mitchell and Company upon the books and accounts of six dormitories for women and the Lawyers Club, dormitory for men (pages
54 and 57). A separate report for each dormitory was presented
with a summary, including the Adelia Cheever House, Alumnae House,
Betsy Barbour House, Helen Newberry Residence, the Lawyers Club,
and the Martha Cook Building. The summary report for the six last
named is as appears below, except that there is printed in these proceedings only a statement of the net excess of operating income in
each house instead of the more detailed analysis thereof appearing in
the auditors' report. For the report of Mosher-Jordan Halls see below
(page 225) following the combined report of the other six dormitories.
Honorable Ralph Stone,
Chairman of the Finance Committee,
The Regents of the University of Michigan,

1933
The report on our examination of the accounts of Mosher-Jordan Halls for
the year ended June 30, 1933, has been submitted to you under separate cover.
Our work embraced the examination to the extent hereinafter described,
of the accounts relating to assets and liabilities as disclosed by the books at
the close of the several fiscal years or periods, a review of the operating accounts, and of the general principles on which the accounts as a whole are
based, and a series of test checks of the transactions of the period under review,
all for the purpose of enabling us to form an opinion as to the financial condition of the dormitories, and the results of their operations.
In our opinion, based on our examination and information furnished to us,
and subject to the qualifications indicated, the attached balance sheets, and
relative profit and loss and surplus accounts, set forth the financial condition
of the several dormitories at the dates indicated, and the results of their
operations for the periods stated.
OPERATIONS
The profit and loss accounts of the several dormitories which portray the
results of their operations, and which have been presented in 'the individual
reports, have been reclassified, and are presented herewith in comparative form
in the summary given on page 222, prepared to show the net revenues from
room rent and board, direct expenses, and other income and expenses; a table
of percentages, based on total revenue from room rent and board, is also included.
Reference to the comparative profit and loss accounts of the several dormitories will show that in every instance revenues from room rent and board have
decreased appreciably during the year under review. This diminution in revenue
is attributable partly to a decrease in the number of residents, but principally
to reductions in room rental and board charges for the second semester of the
scholastic year 1932-1933. Economies effected, particularly in the cost of foodstuffs, have served to counterbalance, in part, the decrease in operating revenue.
In the following tabulations are set forth in comparative form  the net
income of the several dormitories for the fiscal periods 1931-1932 and 1932 -1933:
NET INCOME FOR THE PERIOD  Increase

Further details of the income and expenses of the periods under review will
be found in the comparative profit and loss accounts and supporting schedules
attached to this report.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The financial condition of the individual dormitories as at the close of
their relative fiscal years is set forth in the respective balance sheets appended
to this report.
In connection with our examination of the accounts relating to assets and
liabilities, the following comment is submitted.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

period under review have been vouched by reference to vendors' invoices and
other documentary evidence.

CASH
Imprest cash funds were confirmed by certificates obtained from the depositary banks, and funds on deposit with the University of Michigan, by reference to the accounts of that institution.
INVESTMENTS
The investments of the several dormitories are in the custody of the University of Michigan, and have been confirmed by the production of bonds and
mortgage notes and indentures during the course of our examination of the
books of the University at June 30, 1933. In the case of dormitories whose
fiscal year ended subsequent to that date, we have obtained from the Investment
Officer of the University a certificate as to their custody as at the date of the
relative balance sheets. Indicative of the variation between the book and market
values of the bond investments of the dormitories, we submit herewith a tabulation of this information as at June 30, 1933:

It should be stated that while mortgages aggregating $8,187.50 are technically
past due as to principal, they are not so treated by the Investment Officer of
the University, who brings to bear no pressure as to principal, if interest payments are maintained, and the property kept in first-class condition; of the
total principal in arrears, one item of $6,000.00 exists, and in this case interest
has been paid regularly.
NOTES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
The notes and accounts receivable indicated on the several balance sheets
relate, for the most part, to unpaid balances of board and room rentals. Included
in the accounts of the Adelia Cheever House and Alumnae House are amounts
of $100.72 and $23.70 respectively, representing the unpaid balance of the
inventory of foodstuffs taken over by the Michigan Union stores, at the time the
Union undertook the purchase of foodstuffs and supplies for the several dormitories. The balance sheet of The Lawyers Club includes an amount of $8,394.04
in respect of the cost of constructing a driveway to the Club building; it is
anticipated that this amount will be recovered from the Estate of the late W.
W. Cook.
For your information we present herewith a summary of the notes and

A reserve of $700.00 has been created to provide for possible loss in collection
of the accounts of The Lawyers Club; no provision in this respect has been
made in the case of the remaining dormitories.
INVENTORIES
Inventories, in the instance of The Lawyers Club and Martha Cook Building, are stated at cost and are based on physical inventories taken and priced
by employees of these dormitories. In these cases we have checked the arithmetical accuracy of the inventories, and confirmed the basis of the pricing. In
the case of the inventories of the Alumnae House, Betsy Barbour House, and
Helen Newberry Residence, the inventories are stated at valuations based on
cost, as reported by the Michigan Union stores. During the latter part of the
fiscal year, the Michigan Union acted as central purchasing agent for these
dormitories, and at the inception of this arrangement, took over control of the
inventories at that time in the hands of the dormitories, thereafter charging
each on the basis of the monthly consumption. On the abandonment of this
plan at the close of the fiscal year, the Michigan Union returned to the dormitories the remaining inventories at prices as shown on the several balance
sheets.
LIABILITIES
All known liabilities as at the close of the fiscal period have been recorded
on the books of the dormitories, and are reflected in the balance sheets herein
presented. Particulars of these liabilities, by dormitories, are shown in the
following summary:
Adelia Cheever House:
Balance  due  E. C. Goddard.........................$4,600.00
Trade   accounts.....................................  60.39

Martha Cook Building:
Trade  accounts...........................  306.78
Reserve  for room   deposits....................  290.00  596.78
T otal.........................................$6,161.10
The balance due E. C. Goddard, representing the unrefunded cost of the Adelia
Cheever Annex and its furnishings, was confirmed to us by Mr. Goddard. The
items "Reserve for Deposit Accounts" relate to deposits made by intending
residents of the dormitories in the ensuing term. These deposits, $10.00 per
student, will be subsequently refunded, subject of course to any breakage or
damage to equipment.
GENERAL
BOOKKEEPING
The books of the Martha Cook Building are kept on a cash basis throughout, and reference to the monthly statements prepared by the bookkeeper indicates that such statements are also prepared on a cash basis. As the major
portion of the operating income is received in September and February in each
year, these months show substantial profits, against which the net expenses of
succeeding months must later be applied. It would appear desirable that the
system be amended to show income and expenses on an accrual basis, so that
the actual operating results month by month might be disclosed on the books
and in the financial statements.
The bookkeeping systems hitherto in operation at the Adelia Cheever House
and Helen Newberry Residence are quite elementary; we understand that arrangements have been made whereby executive control over the Alumnae House,
Adelia Cheever House, Betsy Barbour House, and Helen Newberry Residence
will be exercised by the Business Office of the University, so that this situation
will be amended in the future.
MINUTES OF TRUSTEES MEETINGS
Minutes of meetings of the Board of Governors of The Lawyers Club were
produced for our examination. In no other case were minutes of meetings of




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1933


225


trustees recorded, nor was there presented to us any formal approval of salary
rates, capital expenditures, or major repairs and replacements: this situation
will now be corrected in the case of the four dormitories over which the Business Office will exercise executive control. We believe that the Trustees of
Martha Cook Building should formally authorize the salary and payroll, and
also evidence their approval of capital expenditures and major replacements;
such approvals and authorizations should preferably be embodied in minutes of
meetings of the Trustees.
LAWYERS CLUB-SURPLUS AND PROVISION
FOR i\AINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENTS
The surplus of The Lawyers Club as shown on the appropriate statement
appended to this report is $112,025.72. In the case of this Club, it is provided
in the deed of gift that net income from dormitories and dining room, based
upon fair prices, is available for legal research. Surplus available for legal
research as shown by the books may be stated as follows:
Surplus as at June 30, 1933..........................$112,025.72
Surplus appropriated for building improvements and additions  to  equipment................................  36,302.92
Surplus Available  for Legal Research................$  75,722.80
It must be pointed out, however, that no provision has been made in the accounts
for depreciation of building and equipment.
In view of the fact that operating income is available for legal research,
and that maintenance charges in respect of building and equipment will probably
increase year by year, it would seem desirable to provide, by a uniform charge
to operations, for future rehabilitation of the physical properties. Further, it
might be of advantage to appropriate from surplus at this time an amount
sufficient to insure that maintenance and repair charges for such deterioration as
definitely exists at present, but which as yet has not become apparent, will not
prove an undue burden upon the operating results of any future period.
Yours truly,
PEAT, MARWICK, AMITCHELL & CO.
Detroit, Michigan,
September 16, 1933
Honorable Ralph Stone, Chairman of the Finance Committee,
The Regents of the University of Michigan,
Detroit, iMichigan.
Dear Sir:
In accordance with instructions received, we have made an examination of
the accounts of Mosher-Jordan Halls, dormitory, for the year ended June 30,
1933.
Our work embraced the examination to the extent hereinafter described, of
the accounts relating to the assets and liabilities of the dormitory as disclosed
by the books as at June 30, 1933, a review of the operating accounts, and of
the general principles upon which the accounts as a whole are based, all for the
purpose of enabling us to form an opinion as to the financial condition of the
dormitory, and the result of its operations. Cash transactions of the year were
not examined in detail, except as was necessary in confirmation of the cash and
bank balances as at June 30, 1933. Our formal opinion, based on our examination and information furnished to us, was expressed in the report issued under
date of August 16, 1933. We now submit a report on the accounts in greater
detail, together with relative statements as enumerated in the index appended
hereto.
In terms of a trust agreement, and collateral leases entered into during
1929, between the Regents of the University of Michigan, and The Guardian
Trust Company, Detroit, the Regents leased to the Trust Company certain land
in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for a period of 50 years, at an annual rental of
$100.00.
The lessee agreed to erect buildings thereon, and furnish the equipment
therefor; and in turn leased the premises when erected, to the Regents, for a
period of 27 years and 3 months, terminating December 31, 1957.
The erection of the building, and the equipment and furnishing thereof for
use as a dormitory, capable of housing approximately 450 students, was financed




226                 SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1933
through the issuance by the Trust Company, of dormitory trust certificates to
the extent of $955,000.00, which mature serially to December 1, 1957.
It may here be stated that no mortgage exists on the property. The trust
certificates are redeemable from the rental payments by the Regents to the
Trust Company for the occupancy of the premises, together with such surplus
earnings as may accrue from operations; the rental charges are to be paid from
the operation of the building-no other fund is pledged.
The terms of the trust agreement, dated August 15, 1929, stipulate annual
charges for depreciation, of 1/2 per cent on buildings and 8 per cent on equipment. These rates are to be calculated on the basis of "Total Cost of Construction" defined in the agreement as actual cost of construction, plus interest
and finance charges incurred in connection with, and during the construction of,
the building.
Conditions of a lease agreement dated November 30, 1929, whereby the
Trust Company leased the completed premises to the Regents, stipulate the
following semiannual rental payments:
November  1,  1930.....................................$15,000.00
M ay   1,  1931..........................................  30,000.00
N ovem ber  1,  1931.....................................  30,000.00
M ay   1,  1932.........................................  35,000.00
N ovem ber  1,  1932....................................  35,000.00
November 1  1933-1956................................  38,200.00
M ay   1,  1957..........................................  14,700.00
November  1, 1957.....................................  14,700.00
The above rental payments aggregate $2,008,000.00, and are sufficient to redeem
the trust certificates, and pay interest thereon in full.
It will be observed that the building and equipment form no part of the
assets of Mosher-Jordan   Halls, neither do the trust certificates represent a
liability of this dormitory; the items are, however, carried in the books of the
dormitory and included in the attached statements, so that all transactions of
the year under review may be more clearly set forth.
OPERATIONS
After deduction of charges for depreciation and rental, as stipulated in the
trust and lease agreements to which reference has hitherto been made, the
dormitory sustained a net deficit of $12,434.27 for the year ended June 30,
1933, as compared with net income of $10,632.52 for the year preceding.
The following tabulation sets forth in comparative form particulars of the
operations for the two years, together with a table of percentages based on total
revenue. The figures relating to the operations of the year ended June 30, 1932,
have been taken from the report of your former auditors.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1933                               227
The disparity in the operating results of the two years may be accounted
for as follows:
D ecrease   in   revenue...................................................$40,574.61
Increase  in  rental charge................................................  8,200.00
48,774.61
Less-Decrease  in  expenses..............................................  25,707.82
Decrease in Net Income of Year ended June 30, 1933, as compared with year
ended June 30, 1932............................................$23,066.79
The decrease in revenue is attributable to two main factors-decrease in
number of students resident in the dormitory, and decrease in charges for room
rent and board during the current year. In respect of the year ended June 30,
1933, the greatest number of residents during the first semester was 387, and for
the second semester 349; the relative figures for the year preceding were 438 and
423 respectively. Further, the charges for single rooms and double rooms in the
year ended June 30, 1932, were $115.00 and $105.00 per student, per semester.
During the current year these charges were maintained for the first semester, but
in the second semester were reduced to $105.00 and $95.00 respectively. Charges
for board were also reduced; the weekly charge of $7.00 which has hitherto ruled
unchanged was reduced to $6.50 per week in the second semester of this year.
The increase in the rental charge is in accordance with the lease agreement
already referred to in the opening paragraphs of this report.
Further particulars of the expenses of the year will be found in the profit
and loss account, Exhibit A, and supporting Schedule 1.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The financial condition of the dormitory, including the property accounts
and the relative liability on trust certificates, on which comment has hitherto

ledger account, in which are recorded details of deposits made by residents of
the dormitories, which will be later refunded to the students, after deducting
any charges for breakage or damage to the equipment.

the Trust Company, however, as at February 13, 1933, sufficient only to meet
the coupons falling due on June 1, 1933, in amount $26,940.00 was deposited
with the Trustee, who has so certified to us.
The fee of the Union Guardian Trust Company for the year, $477.50, is
calculated at  2 of 1 per cent of the original issue of trust certificates.

The Secretary filed the following report with regard to the use
of University trucks for the transportation of students (page 141):
It should be understood that the University trucks have not been-at least
not frequently-and will not be in the future, "hired out." The question of
transporting passengers for hire is not involved. The use of trucks comprehended
for example the transfer of groups of Forestry students going to the several
Forestry farms, students in Geography and Geology being taken on excursions
into surrounding country, and the transportation of students at and in the

neighborhood of the Geology Camp in Kentucky, the Forestry and Biological
Camps in Michigan, and the Surveying Camp in Wyoming, and in some instances
the transportation of students between Ann Arbor and the camps, as caretakers
for baggage, etc. By the payment of an additional premium of $30 the coverage
was extended expressly to cover all these uses outside the State as well as within,
and the company also attached to the policy a rider as follows:"It is further understood and agreed that nothing herein contained
shall be construed to permit the insurer to avoid liability hereon upon
the theory of nonliability of the Regents of the University of Michigan
as a constitutional corporation."
The Secretary reported the receipt from the Rutland Trust Company, of Rutland, Vermont, executor of the estate of the late Dr.

estate can be promptly closed (R.P. 1929-1932, page 953).
The Secretary filed the record of the mail vote by which the
Board approved reduction in University Hospital ward rates for state
and county patients from $3.00 to $2.85 per day in accordance with the

Regent Rynd submitted the following resolution, which was
adopted:
Resolved, That the degree of Doctor of Medicine be conferred upon the
persons named in the communication from the Dean, who have been duly
recommended by the Medical Faculty.
The annual Report of the Faculty of the Department of




3


Medicine and Surgery, was presented by the Dean of the Medical
Faculty, and is as follows:
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
The Faculty of Medicine and Surgery in presenting their Annual Report,
beg leave to say: That the session which has just closed has been marked by
new relations and complications, but has been attended by unabated efforts
and labors on the part of the Professors, and by more than the usual success on
the part of the students. Although the requirements for graduation have in
no respect been diminished, but rather increased, yet a larger proportion of
the candidates than for many years before have been recommended for the
honors of this Department of the University; and it is confidently believed
that no previous class has left the institution with so clear perceptions of the
contrast between the broad common-sense principles of what the Faculty
regard as Scientific Medicine and the teachings of peculiar and exclusive
systems.
At the beginning of the term of instruction now closed, a more uniform
and regular system of examinations for admission than heretofore practiced,
was put in operation; by which our numbers were diminished by more than
a dozen rejections, and doubtless to a much larger extent, by the fear of the
examinations; but the quality of the class a whole has been materially improved, and the members of the Faculty have had the satisfaction of feeling
that their instructions have been directed to persons all of whom were qualified to appreciate and profit by them.
The Faculty are gratified in being able to report that this pioneer movement in Preliminary Examinations in American Medical Colleges has been
attended with consequences so favorable; and that there are indications of
the example being followed by a few of the other Medical Schools of the
country.
Though it has been the aim of the Faculty to advance cautiously, and to
keep pace with the advancement of general education and the public needs,
and so that none should be deprived of the advantages of the Institution who
are properly qualified to enjoy them-refusing admission and advising to go
back to elementary studies, or to other pursuits, none but those to whom
such refusal and advice would be a kindness, yet a real advancement has
been made, and it is the wish and intention of the Faculty to increase the
requirements, both for admission and graduation, as fast as is consistent
with justice to the citizens of the State who desire medical instruction, and
as the general interests of all concerned will admit.
Not only has advancement been made in relation to preliminary examinations and the requirements for graduation, but, as will be seen by reference to the Announcement for the next session, distinct provision will be
made for a longer and improved course of instruction continuing three years;
and combining the advantages of a successive or graded course with those
repetitions which are absolutely essential to a full comprehension of the various intricate branches of the profession;-and while this course is not required,
(as such requirement would deprive many who cannot command the time and
the means for so long a college life. of the privileges of the school,) yet it is
strongly advised to all who can possibly avail themselves of it.
It is the earnest request of the Faculty that the subjects of Materia
Medica and Therapeutics, and of Physiology, now embraced in one professor



4


ship, be divided and rearranged;-uniting Materia Medica and Therapeutics
to the present chair of Ophthalmology, and creating a uew professorship of
"Physiology, Pathological Anatomy and Histology," embracing Experimental and Practical'Physiology and the use of the Microscope, and as soon
as practicable appointing a suitable person to take charge of it.
This measure is recommended in view of the fact that the health of
Prof. Cheever, at present occupying the chair of Materia Medica and Physiology, will not allow him longer to perform the arduous duties of the position. The Faculty very deeply regret that they are likely to lose the cooperation of an Alumnus of the University who'has proved himself so competent
and successful, and has so honored his Alma Mater as a pupil and a teacher.
The present importance of Physiology and the subjects proposed to be associated with it calls for a distinct chair and the devotion of one man to its
duties alone.
In consequence of the increased duties which, by the proposed arrangement, will devolve upon the Professor of Ophthalmology and Pratical
Anatomy by his assuming the duties of the department of Materia Medica
and Therapeutics, and a necessary relinquishment of a large part of the labor
in the Anatomical Department, great increase of labor and responsibility
must devolve upon the Demonstrator of Anatomy, and in view of this the
Faculty recommended an Increase of his salary to $1,000. The efficient performance of the duties of that office, (and nothing short of very efficient
service will meet the necessities which exist), deserves at least the conipensation named.
Should these changes be made, it is recommended that Prof. Frothingham's title be that of Professor of Materia Medica and Ophthalmology.
The new Pavilions of the Hospital are now completed, and the attention
of the Board is respectfully called to the necessity of more completely organizing this important adjunct to the Department of Medicine and Surgery,
providing for its support and putting it in successful operation. Without at
present entering into details, it will be sufficient to say that much care and
thought, combined with the results of observation and experience, will be
necessary to secure the best form of organization for the greatest usefulness
to the afflicted, and for the proper supply of materials for illustrating to students the different forms of diseases and injuries, and the best modes of
detecting and treating them.
The Faculty would also call attention to the necessity for certain improvements in the condition of the Lecture-Rooms of the Medical College,
in which large numbers of students spend at least four hours of each day.
The particular seats or spaces on the benches occupied by students are.
numbered, and each student is required to occupy the special one assigned
him, as the uncovering of a number subjects the occupant to a mark of absence. So little space is allowed for each as to render these seats uncomfortable; and a small appropriation is requested for repairing and renumbering
them, giving each more space.
But far more serious than this, affecting not only the comfort but the
capacity to listen to and understand the lectures, and also affecting the health
of students, is the mode of heating and ventilation of the rooms. It is unnecessary here to enter to enter into details, but the complaints on the part
of students are too constant and too earnest, and the justice of such com



5
plaints is too obvious to allow the matter to be longer ignored or neglected.
It is therefore earnestly requested that early attention be given to this subject, and that such alterations be made, which it is believed may be done at
but little expense, as wiAl correct the evils so bitterly complained of,
It is a strange inconsistency to have the science of health taught in rooms
where the principles of that science are violated in a manner so glaring.
Respectfully submitted,
A. B. PALMER, Dean.
March 28, 1876.
The following communication was received and read by
Regent Rynd:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,

Very respectfully,
JONATHAN TAFT, DEAN.
Regent Rynd also presented the following resolution, which
was unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery be conferred upon
the persons named in the above communication from the Dean of the Faculty of the College of Dental Surgery, as recommended.
The following paper was presented by Regent Rynd:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,   1
ANN ARBOR, March 27, 1876. 
The Hon., the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
SIRS, —Finding my health inadequate for the performance of my duties
in an efficient manner, I hereby resign the chair of Therapeutics and
Materia Medica and Physiology.
In so doing I wish to express my most earnest thanks for the kind consideration you have ever shown me during my connection with the institution, and to my honored colleagues for their generous sympathy and support in days of trial.
Trusting that the time is close at hand when the Department of Medicine and Surgery shall have its course lengthened and graded, I sever my
connection with it with profound regret.
Most respectfully,
H. S. CHEEVER.
After having read the foregoing communication from      Prof.
H. S. Cheever, Regent Rynd submitted the following resolution,
which was adopted unanimously:




6


Resolved, That the resignation of Prof. H. S. Cheever be accepted; that
we deeply regret that failing health renders such resignation necessary; that
the thanks of this Board be and are hereby tendered to Prof. H. S. Cheever for the valuable and faithful services which he has rendered to the University; and that we deeply sympathize with him in his affliction, trusting
that he may be restored to health and usefulness.
A paper from Dr. H. S. Cheever was read by Regent Rynd,
and on his motion was referred to the Committee on the Medical
Department, and ordered to be placed on file.
The following resolution was submitted by Regent Grant,
and referred to the Finance Committee:
Resolved, That the Treasurer of the University be and is hereby authorized and directed to deposit the moneys of the University in the First
National Bank of Ann Arbor.
The following resolution submitted by Regent McGowan was
adopted:
Resolved, That the thanks of this Board be presented to S. S. Garrigues,
Ph. D., State Salt Inspector, of East Saginaw, for the gift of a collection of
3,000 species of German plants.
On recommendation of Regent Rynd, duplicate diplomas
were granted (upon payment of the usual fee) to the following
persons, who had presented satisfactory evidence that the originals had been lost or destroyed:
Clarence L. Baker-_ _-______________- Yew York City.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
Wednesday, March 29, 1876. f
The Board of Regents reassembled in the room of the President, at 3 o'clock P. M., Regent Estabrook in the chair.
Present-A full Board.
The following resolution was submitted by Regent Rynd:
Resolved, That the salary of Will J. Herdman, M. D., be fixed at $1,000 per
annum, as Demonstrator of Anatomy.
The resolution was adopted by the following vote:
Ayes-Regents Estabrook, McGowan, Grant, Rynd, E. C. Walker, Climie,

present.
Regent Climie, chairman of the Committee to examine the
accounts of Dr. S. H. Douglas, Director of the Chemical Laboratory, submitted the following report:
To the Regents of the University:
Your committee who were appointed at a meeting of the Board of Regents held December 21, 1875, under the following resolution, to-wit: "Resolved, That conformably with the request of Prof. S. H. Douglas, a committee
of three Regents be appointed to investigate thoroughly his accounts with
the University, and report to this Board, and that they have power to employ
an accountant for such examination," respectfully submit the following report: The committee met January 13, 1876, and organized, appointing Regent
Climie chairman, and employed an accountant; and on the 19th of January
commenced work. After looking over the books, reports and vouchers, it
was determined to commence our investigation with the year of 1864 and
1865, which began with Ledger of Chemical Laboratory, under date of October
13, 1861, and continued until May 9, 1865. In this year the Ledger is not a correct statement of the accounts. In but very few of the accounts during the
year were the credits entered on the Ledger, consequently the accounts were
apparently "Dr." balances against the students, but in the annual report of
Dr. Douglas to the Finance Committee of the Board of Regents they were
reported, so that the account for the year will be as follows:




13
Received from students -___ --- —-----                      $2,108 25

The amount of money paid out as per Report of Dr. Douglas -— _ $1,796 04
Which includes items of interest charged by Dr. Douglas on money
Which he claims to have advanced. Your committee, after making inquiry of Dr. Douglas as to the method of computing interest which is charged to the University by him, were not able to
find the amount of money on which interest is charged, nor the
time for which said interest was computed. A plan of monthly
balances was therefore adopted and carried through the years of
investigation, showing the amount of money received in each
month at the Chemical Laboratory, which will be referred to in
each year, as to whether interest should be allowed in the annual
statements of Dr. Douglas. Taking up the year 1864 and 1865, we
find a balance of money on hand, over and above the expenditures at the beginning of every month; consequently we deduct
the interest charged -       -_ $ 10 70

Your (ommittee also gave some attention to the allegation tlhat excessive prices were paid for the goods purchased; it being reported that responsible parties in the city of Ann Arbor would duplicate the lills, laying the
goods down at the University at prices less than they were charged at in
New York. We have not been able to substantiate this charge.
In the course of the investigation Regent Climie visited New York, and
by the parties of whom goods have been most largely bought, was assured
that the charges made, that Dr. Douglas has been in the lhabit of receiving
commissions for the goods purchased for the University, were without foundation.
Mr. Richard Tregaskis, of I)etroit, the acco'ntant first engaged in this
work, and who has been associated with your Coimmittee during the entire
investigation, has exhibited a pains-taking industry to whiich we desire to
call the attention of your honorable Board. We have beell illpressed with
his honesty and ability, and slhall ever remember the invaluable labor performed by him-frequently working twelve hours per day.
Mr. A. M. McAllister, of Mendon, has been associated with Mr. Tregaskis
for the past four weeks, and has furnished us very valuable aid. Indeed,
without the industry and capacity exhibited by both gentlemen, we could
not have hoped to present any intelligible statement to your honorable
Board, at this time.
In conclusion, your Committee desire to add that va.ious financial operations not included in the above examination, anld to whi(h our attention
has been called during the progress of our examinations, exhlil)it, sO( far as
we have been able to judge, irregularities in their chara(cter, and whi.ch
should be made the sublject of further investigattioln.
Your committee were appointed to "investigate tllolr(ouglIly the accounts of Prof. S. 11. Douglas witli the University." Whllile we have been
unable to cover the whole field, yet the motion under which y(our t  ommittee
were appointed undoubtedly contemplated a ( comnllete, tlor(rough and exhaustive examination. This we llave had in view, )but as oullr labors terminate with the rendering of this report, we reco(mllmtend tlhat thie work still
unperformed be taken up iby the Finance (Collnuittee ofI tle Board, carried to
its legitimate conclusions, and the resullts givenl to thle Botard at the earliest
day practicable.

Regent Climnie having finished the reading of his report,
Regent S. S. Walker of the sante committee announced his nonconcurrence il the nmajority l'e)ort, for reasons which would appear in a Iminority report, wlich he had the honor to present,
and with the permission of the Board would read. Permission
was granted.
To the Board of Refe/ats of the Univcrsity of Michigan:
The undersigned,a memnber of your Committee to whomn was assigned the
duty of examining the accounts of 1)r. I)ouglas, in accordance with his request, would resl)ectfully sub)mit the following as his view of the result of
their labolrs:
The (ommittee Imet January 13th, and organized by the election of Regent (linlie Chairmln, tand engaged MIr. Richard Tregaskis, of D)etroit, 1n
accomplished a(ccutlant, as assistant; afterwards, it becoming evident that
we would not be able to) (conplet te t  work for the March meeting of the Regents, the additional services of Mr. 1. A. N. McAllister were secured.
Early in the prosecution of our lablors we were impressed with the difficulty and intricacy of the task before us, and now at the making up of our
report, are obliged to omiit a largle mass of interesting, though not material,
matter that hlas bcee inl contemplation, but which we have not been able to
saltisfactorily examine and complete.
Our work connlenc(es at the years 186l-65, and consisted in arranging,
compiling, tabulating and verifying the receipts and expenditures in the
Chemical 1)epartment, and in re-examining the Annual Reports of Dr. Douglas, which have, from timell to time, been passed upon by the Finance Committee and the BSoard of RIegents.
In the Alnnual Statements we fotund several clerical errors, which corrected in the balances carried forward from1 year to year would be as follows:
In Statement of July, 18X0;, an error which should be placed to
the Credit of Dr. Douglas of-  -------— ___-_    _         17 S5

Balance of errors against Dr. Douglas _________ _        5 17
$413 02 $413 02
In Dr. Douglas' Statement of 1868, there appears a Credit to the University of $412.50 with no note or memorandum showing its proper disposition. Dr. Douglas claims, and it would seem justly, that this credit covers
the errors in the years 1867 and 1868, which he had discovered, and also collections made on Laboratory accounts not elsewhere reported. Should this be
allowed, it would make the aggregate of errors $157.02 for which Dr. Douglas
should have credit.
Your Committee also find certain errors in tlhe bills audited and allowed
by the Regents, so palpably erroneous that they do not hesitate to note them
as follows:
In the Statement of t1867-68 an item of exchange charged at $18, was
without doubt intended for 18 cents, leaving a balance to the debit of Dr.
Douglas of $17.82.




19


In the Statemnent of 1868-69, Dr. Douglas is allowed a conmmission for
superintending the construction of an addition to the L-aboratory of,$200 on
the estimated cost of the work. Subsequently he charged a comnmission of
$288.13 on the actual disbursements, though in this there is an error, which
latter amount should clearly be charged back to him. In the same report
there is a charge of $100 to P. B. Rose, for which there is no corresponding
voucher, and as the sum of $300, the amount to be paid to himll fromn the Laboratory receipts, is elsewhere charged, and for which there are proper
vouchers, it would seem that this sum should also be charged to Dr. Douglas
as an error.
With the vouchers for 1868 were found two bills and receipts for the sums
of $58.75 and $7.50 respectively that would seem to be proper charges, and
which have evidence of having been examined and allowed, but we failed to
find them charged against the University. It would seem that they should
be placed to the credit of Dr. Douglas.
The houses which have largely furnished the mIaterials used in the Laboratory were requested to forward statements of their accounts. These were
fully verified by the Annual Reports with the exception of an item of $206.82
in 1872 in the account of E. B. Benjamin, who acknowledges receiving pay
for goods purchased for and used in the Laboratory, but which has not been
charged up against the University. Dr. Douglas should also have credit for
this amount.
Summarizing the above we would find, allowing the items ill tle reports
of 1868 and 1867 to be accounted for by the otherwise unexplained credit of
$112 50 in the report of 1868, the corrections ill the Anllual Reports to be as
follows:
1868. Dr. Douglas Dr. to balance of errors  ---------- $ 20 00

The Committee find in many of tile Annual Reports a number of charges
for interest in " Dr. Balances". We were unable to satisfiactorily verify thenm
owing to the mlanner in which the accounts had been kept. Taking the view
of the case that the anmounts reported by Dr. Douglas as received by him as
correct, it is likely that these accounts of interest on advanlces or " Dr. Balances" would be found sufficiently correct. Taking the view that Dr. Douglas should be charged with all Illoneys which lie oatfJ/ to live received, a
large amount of which he claims not to have received-as wlill be hereafter
noted-as the correct one, it would wipe out the matter of " Dr. Balances,"
the only foundation of the interest charged, and of course the charges for illterest.
A very careful and complete analysis and posting of the accoults ill the
"Laboratory Ledgers," and the "stubs," "receipts" and " vouchers" o0l tile
receiving side of the La boratory accounts has been Imade. The result of tllis

21
and not at all adapted to the uses made of chemically pure articles necessary
in analysis.
In the course of the investigation, Rtegent C(linie visited New York, and
by the parties of whom goods have been most largely bought was assured that
the charges made that Dr. Douglas has been in the halit of receivini coinmissions for the goods purchased for the University was, without foundation.
Both Regent (linie and( myself desire to express our very high opinion
of the character of the work dlone by the accountants. A careful examilnation and supervision of it as il progress, principally by Regent Climie and
to some extent by myself, is the basis of our opinion that this portion of thlie
labor accomplished can be relied upon as accurate-at least as nearly so as
could be made from tlhe data had to work upon. It is the basis of this report,
and in any particulars wherein they may not agree, should such be found, I
prefer to take the figures in the work of the accountants, havin been unable
to thoroughly correct and review. There are also several points of decided
interest as shown by the work of the 'accountants, on which I 1have not
touched,-as the matter of uncollected balances, which in the aggregate
amounts to quite a sum, and should more properly be charged to Profit and
Loss than to the deficiency or defalcation with which I think it is now elmbraced.
The labors of your Committee have not been without results in a general way. In the course of our investigation we have been impressed witl
the general lack of proper system in the financial affairs of the University.
We are led to belive that the Steward, who has enough of his own legitimate
duties to perform is largely burdened with duties that properly belong to the
Treasurer of the University. In the course of our investigation we have
found no books belonging to the Treasurer's Department in the posession of
the University, the only records being the Proceedings of the Board of Regents, from which alone it would be very difficult land unsatisfactory to
"pick out" a " Financial History of the University."
The position of the Laboratory with reference, financially, to the University has until the present been an anomaly, a wheel within a wheel, running itself, which it has done most successfully, notwithstandilng tlhe large
deficiency or defalcatioi above shown, netting to the University a large fund
invested in apparatus and mllachinery. It was tle intention of y(our Commlittee to show this in detail, but from the labor and time alreadly consimied
they have been unable to do so. The system at present iu operation places
the Laboratory on the same basis as the otler D)epartments, accoullting
through the Steward and Treasurer for all funds received and all expenditures made. Had such a system been long ago adopted, there would have
been little need of our labors.
In conclusion I have to say that while having full confidlece in the
work of the accountants and tle data now gathered, I am not satisfied that
in the report of Regent Climie or my own the material has been properly
digested, and trust the lmatter may be further arranged land tabulated by tlle
Finance Comnmittee, to whomn I trust the whlole sublject may be referred.

Regent Walker having concluded the reading of his report,
the following resolutions were sublmitted by Regent E. C. Walker,

The report of the Special Committee appointed to complete
the investigation of the Laboratory Accounts, and which was
made the special order for this hour, was submitted, and read by
Regent McGowan:
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University:
Some time in November last the Executive Committee were informed
that there had been discovered in the Laboratory accounts certain irregularities, of such a nature as to require their immediate attention. Regents E.
C. Walker and McGowan, two of that committee (Regent Burt being at so
great a distance was not called), at once came to Ann Arbor, and had an
interview with President Angell at his home, and from there went to the
house of Prof. Douglas, where one of the Laboratory ledgers and one or more
of the stub books were shown them. The examination which up to that
time had been made, and the results reached, were stated by the President
and Prof. Douglas. The committee then learned that the accounts for the
college year of 1874-5 showed a large delinquency, and that the matter had
been brought to the attention of Prof. Rose, who had acknowledged his liability for the same by making with his own hand a list of such delinquent
accounts, and paying over to Prof. Douglas the amount of the same. Also
that the President and Prof. Douglas had pursued the investigation back of
the year 1874-75, and were convinced that there were large deficiencies for
several years prior to that time.
After examining the work which had been done so far as they could in one
evening, the committee determined to send for Prof. Rose the next morning,
and, if possible, make some arrangement to secure the University against all
loss that a full examination of the Laboratory accounts might disclose.
Accordingly, a meeting was had between such committee (Walker and McGowan) and Prof. Rose, at which time the committee stated to Prof. Rose
that they were aware of the deficit in the Laboratory accounts for the past
year, and that he had met the same by payment; but, that further examination showed that there were deficiencies in the years preceding the year
1874-75, and that they had called upon him with reference to the same; but
they desired, if possible, to secure the University against loss. Prof. Rose, in
the midst of great agitation, said he was not aware of any shortage in his
accounts for other years than 1874-75, but that he desired to do what was
right, and so far as he could would secure the University.
Thereupon an arrangement was made by which Prof. Rose deeded over
to Mr. Knight, Treasurer of the University, his house and lot, the committee, on behalf of the Regents, giving him back a written statement setting
forth that such conveyance was made in trust for the benefit of the University, and that upon said Rose paying over whatever sum might be found due
from him to the University the said house and lot should be redeeded to him,
and that he might have one year in which to make such payment.
The committee being unable to remain and personally prosecute the investigation, asked President Angell, Treasurer Knight and Steward Bennett
to continue the work already begun of determining the amount of the
delinquent accounts for the years previous to 1874-75. They also said to Prof.
Douglas and Prof. Rose that they, being familiar with the books and records
of the Laboratory and method of keeping the accounts, should each assist in




30
the work, and they both promised so to do. The gentlemen above named
entered upon the work, taking up the accounts in the order of the years
going backward from the year 1874-75, and as the amount of each year's delinquency was determined upon, an itemized list of the same was passed over
to Prof. Rose who reviewed and corrected it, in some instances rewriting the
whole list, and for the year 1873-74, after copying the corrected list in his own
hand, adding a certificate to the same, stating that the accounts contained in
said list were correct so far as he knew, according to the examination of the
books. Owing to the fact that the gentlemen engaged in this work were at the
same time attending to their ordinary duties, the progress of the examination was slow, and when only a portion of the work had been accomplished,
the fact of a supposed defalcation in the Laboratory was made public in the
newspapers, and from that time Prof. Rose refused to render further assistance.
Soon thereafter the Executive Committee, together with Regent Gilbert
as chairman of the Finance Committee, were called to review the work and
determine definitely what course should then be pursued. Regent McGowan
being unable to attend, Regents Gilbert and Walker carefully reviewed and
verified the work which had been done, and then called a meeting of the
Board, to which they presented the report to be found in the proceedings of
December 21,1875, beginning on page 480. By reference to this report it will
be seen that Prof. Rose, who had been previously notified of the meeting of
the committee, declined giving them the benefit of his knowledge, but, instead gave a formal notice in a document printed with said report and marked
"B," that he did not and would not recognize any of the work done, and
invoking the decision of a legal tribunal upon all matters in dispute. After
the report of Regents Gilbert and Walker had been submitted, the Board, by
a formal resolution, invited Prof. Rose to be present at their afternoon meeting, "and that he be permitted to make a statement, either in person or
otherwise." This invitation the professor accepted, and presented to the
Board a written document, which will be found printed in the proceedings of
said meeting. Following this statement, the minutes show a resolution suspending Prof. Rose from his duties as assistant professor until the further
action of the Board, and at the same time the following resolution was
adopted:
Resolved, That conformably with the request of Prof. S. H. Douglas, a
committee of three Regents be appointed to investigate thoroughly his accounts with the University, and report to this Board; and that they have
power to employ an accountant for such examination.
In pursuance of said resolution, Regent-elect S. S. Walker and Regents
Climie and Rynd were made such committee. They met on the 19th
day of January last, and commenced the work as provided in said
resolution, and, at a meeting of the Board on the 29th of March, submitted the result of their labors in two reports, one signed by Regents
Climie and Rynd, and one by Regent S. S. Walker. At this meeting of the
Board, as will be seen by reference to the minutes, " R. A. Beal being present
was permitted to address the Board in behalf of his friend, Prof. P. B. Rose."
Mr. Beal then stated that Prof. Rose was able to render a complete and satisfactory account for all the money which had come into his hands at the
Laboratory. That his accounts had been examined by experts, and papers
and documents were in the hands of Prof. Rose and his friends that would




31
entirely exonerate him from any charge of wrong doing in connection with
such accounts. Whereupon, after some discussion, the following resolution
was adopted:
Resolved, That Dr. P. B. Rose be, and is hereby restored to his position as
assistant professor in the University, and that he be paid since January 1st
at his former salary.
The reports above mentioned only purported to have fixed the gross
amount of delinquency in the Laboratory accounts without determining to
whom such delinquency should be charged. Hence, pending the adoption
of said reports, the following resolutions were adopted:
Resolved, That the two reports submitted by the committee on the accounts of Dr. Douglas, and now pending before the Board, be referred to the
Finance Committee with instructions to call to their aid the accountant, Mr.
Tregaskis, and determine at the earliest possible moment, so far as they can,
where, or to whom the deficiency in the Laboratory should be charged, and
as soon as their investigation is completed to call a meeting of the Board of
Regents.
Resolved. That the committee be requested to invite Prof. Douglas and
Prof. Rose to appear before them, and to give these gentlemen every opportunity to present such testimony as they may deem proper.
Regent S. S. Walker, a member of said Finance Committee, being a
member of the former investigating committee, was excused from acting,
and Regent Estabrook was appointed to fill his place. Your committee as
then constructed, consisting of Regents McGowan, Grant and Estabrook,
were further instructed by a resolution of the Board, as follows:
Resolved, That the special committee appointed to determine to whom
the deficiency in the Laboratory should be charged, be, and are hereby instructed to arrange for and obligate this Board touching the settlement of
any and all questions in dispute, in case said committee deem such course
wisest and best, by arbitration or by amicable suit.
Owing to sickness and other unavoidable obstacles, the committee were
unable to meet for the prosecution of the work thus imposed upon them
until the 1st day of June inst. The committee met in the Lecture Room of
the Law Building, having previously notified Prof. Douglas and Prof. Rose of
the time of meeting. Both these gentlemen appeared by counsel, and the
committee announced that the examination would be public, and suggested
that all parties giving testimony should be sworn.
After a full statement of the course the committee proposed to pursue
in the investigation, the counsel for Prof. Rose presented a bond in the penal
sum of $10,000, conditioned that if the said Preston B. Rose shall faithfully
pay to the said Regents of the University of Michigan all sums of money for
the payment of which he may be found legally liable to said Regents by the
final judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, or by the award of
any board of any board of arbitrators mutually agreed upon by the parties
within sixty days after the rendering of such final judgment or rendering of
such award, then the above obligation to be void; otherwise to be and remain
in full force and virtue. Provided, however, that this bond shall not become
operative until the said, the Regents of the University of Michigan shall redeed or cause to be redeeded to said Preston B. Rose the house and lot now
occupied by him as a homestead, and situated on the corner of Jefferson and
State streets in the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Nor until the said, the




Regents of the University of Michigan shall repay to said Preston B. Rose
the sum of eight hundred and thirty-one dollars and ten cents ($831.10) with
interest from the sixth day of November, 1875.
Signed,         PRESTON B ROSE,
RICE A. BEAL.     [SEAL.]
In presence of A. J. SAWYER.     RANSOM S. SMITH,
Subsequently the same day, before any testimony had been taken, Prof.
Rose, through his attorney, presented to the committee the following propositions:
1. To at once join issue with the Regents in an amicable suit, and proceed
to the trial of the chief issue at the present June term of the Washtenaw
Circuit Court, and give bond, conditioned that there should be no continuance asked on the part of Prof. Rose, and that he would pay whatever j udgment should be obtained against him within sixty days after the rendition
thereof.
2. Prof. Rose to go before the Board of Regents, give bonds for the deficiency, meet his case, and abide by the decision of the Board; provided
Prof. Douglas would do the same.
The committee felt that the spirit and letter of the instructions under
which they were acting required them to investigate and report on the whole
subject matter. The first resolution creating a committee especially instructs
them to call to their aid the accountant, Tregaskis, and determine at the
earliest possible moment, so far as they can, where or to whom the deficiency
in the Laboratory should be charged, and as soon as their investigation is
completed to call a meeting of the Board of Regents. It is true a subsequent
reselution instructs the committee to arrange for and obligate the Board
touching the settlement of any and all questions in dispute (in case said
committee deem such course wisest and best) by arbitration or by amicable
suit.
An arbitration or an amicable suit is only possible where both parties are
willing to enter upon the same. If either party declined this mode of settlement, the discretion given the committee by the resolution is at an end. The
parties were unable to agree. Prof. Douglas declined any terms offered, insisting that his business was with the Regents, and he could enter into no negotiation with Prof. Rose. Hence the committee determined to proceed with the
examination, whereupon Prof. Rose filed with us the paper hereto attached,
and marked " Exhibit A," and withdrew, declining to take part in or aid the
investigation.
The pending reports of the former Committee, which, by the resolution,
were referred to us, only purported to carry the examination into the Laboratory accounts down to June 30th, 1875; and as considerable sums of money
appearing on said reports as due from the Laboratory and unaccounted for
had already been reported by the Director, between the said 30th June and
the 1st day January last, your Committee determined in entering upon their
work: First, to ascertain as nearly as possible the exact amount of the delinquent accounts as the same should appear by the records of the Laboratory
from the year 1864-65 to Jan. 1st, 1876 inclusive. Second, where, or to whom
this deficiency should be charged; and Third, what other irregularities, if
any, there were in the conduct of the Laboratory.

With this in view, the Committee at once proceeded with the examination of witnesses, first administering to them the oath usually taken by witnesses in courts of justice, after which they were examined and cross-examined on the various points in question. The testimony was taken down by
stenographers, has been transcribed, and accompanies this report. It will be
seen that Richard Tregaskis, Silas H. Douglas, James B. Angell, Edwin C.
Walker, H. D. Bennett, Prof. A. B. Prescott, C. H. Richmond, Alpheus Felch,
and Andrew Climie were sworn, and testified. The Committee also served
notices on Rice A. Beal and Prof. Rose, asking them to come before us, and
present any evidence they might have touching other matters under consideration, aside from what are known as the delinquent accounts, especially
evidence touching the allegations that Prof. Douglas had received commissions on chemicals purchased, had paid excessive prices for chemicals, materials, etc. Mr. Beal appeared by his counsel, the Hon. Judge Crane, and declined the invitation for reasons set forth in a paper by him, filed and hereto
attached, marked Exhibit B.
Prof. Rose's counsel came before the Committee in response to the invitation, and in the absence of Prof. Rose, proposed to submit an affidavit of
his client, which the Committee declined to receive. Prof. Rose was on the
ground, and if he proposed to furnish any evidence, he should have come in
person, been sworn, and testified as the other witnesses, submitting himself
to cross-examination. The Committee offered to allow him to appear upon
the stand and testify to whatever point and upon whatever subject he saw
fit, and they would hold the cross-examination to the subjects on which he
had testified in chief, but this offer his counsel declined.
The first object to which the Committee addressed itself was the delinquent accounts. These are accounts where the ledgers of Laboratory show
payments made by the student, which payments are unaccounted for in the
Director's reports to the Board of Regents.
That the Regents my understand the bearing of the testimony relating
to the deficiency, we quote from the report of Regent Gilbert his concise
statement of the method of keeping the books and accounts at the Laboratory, viz.:
" Each student on entering the Laboratory for a course of instruction,
made a deposit with Dr. Rose, the book-keeper and cashier, which was
placed to his credit in a ledger prepared for the purpose; and for which he
was given a receipt signed by Dr. Rose, and taken from a book prepared with
stubs, upon which entries were were made, corresponding in name, date
and amount with the receipts given. On the side of the ledger opposite his
credit, the student was, from time to time, charged with such material as he
purchased for the prosecution of his studies. All the entries in the ledger
seem to have been made by Dr. Rose. From time to time, when called
upon, Dr. Rose paid over these original deposits to Dr. Douglas, and he acknowledged the receipt by placing on each stub his initial letter, 'D.' The
book of stubs, the receipts detached therefrom and given the students, and
the original credit entries to each student in the ledger should correspond,
and together afford ample facilities for a verification of this branch of the
accounts. We say above, 'the original credit entries,' for we notice no evidence from the stubs that receipts were ever given for subsequent deposits,
made by the students, to cover the value of the materials bought by them,




34
after they had exhausted the first deposit; such subsequent deposits having
been credited in the ledger only, leaving no stub to verify the account, or
call attention to the fact that subsequent deposits had been made. This
mode of conducting the business seems to leave an open door for error and
fraud, and so it would, but for the fact that these original receipts are returned to Dr. Rose by the students at the close of the course, and on the back
of each is a statement signed by the student, in which he certifies to the total
amount he has paid Dr. Rose for chemicals, etc., during the course. If these
students' statements correspond with the ledger, the proof is conclusive as to
the accuracy of the whole. The final liability of Dr. Rose to Dr. Douglas is
the aggregate amount called for by the students' statements on the back of
the receipts, less the amount of the original deposits, previously paid by Dr.
R. to Dr. D., and for which Dr. Rose holds the stubs signed 'D.' by Dr. Douglas, as vouchers. When this final settlement between Dr. Douglas and Dr.
Rose was made, there should have been a careful comparison of these certificates with the corresponding accounts on the ledger. Had this comparison
been made, it would seem as though there was no possible chance for error,
unless the cashier should keep some of the students's accounts on a separate
book, and neglect to produce it, and the corresponding vouchers, of which
we see no direct evidence. It will, however, be seen, that if Dr. Douglas had
habitually neglected to compare the statements of the students with the
ledger, it was possible for the cashier to withold as many of the former as he
might think prudent, and to that extent retain the money he had received.
At the time of the final settlement between Dr. Douglas and Dr. Rose, it was
the practice for Dr. D. to read the vouchers, and Dr. Rose, in his presence,
would draw a red line diagonally across the face of the corresponding stubs.
These books of stubs were left in the possession of Dr. Rose; the letter'D.,
and the red line on the face of the stub being his only vouchers that he had
settled his accounts. Dr. Douglas asserts that he never compared these students' vouchers with the ledger, always accepting the statements, as produced by Dr. Rose, as correct. Whatever may be thought of this mode of
doing business, it affords touching evidence of the confidential relations that
existed between these gentlemen. In his annual settlements with the
Finance Committee of the Board, Dr. Douglas produces the students' vouchers to show what amount of money he has received from Dr. Rose, and
should be held accountable for; and at the same time his bills of purchase
and other evidences of expenditure in behalf of the Laboratory.
"It will now be understood that, if Dr. Rose neglected to produce, in his
settlements with Dr. Douglas, vouchers representing all the money paid him
by the students, or if Dr. Douglas should neglect to produce in his annual
settlements with the Finance Committee, all of the vouchers in his possession for money paid him by Dr. Rose, the result would be loss to the University, and benefit to one or the other of the above named, as the case might
be."
Your Committee find the whole deficiency, from the year 1864-5 to Jan. 1st,
1876, inclusive, to amount to $5,507.43. This amount is made up of the following kinds of delinquent accounts:
First, Stub accounts having the red line and the initial " D" on the stub.
Second, Stub accounts having the initial "D" and no red line on the
stub.




35
Third, Stub accounts having the red line, but no initial "D" on the stub.
Fourth, Stub accounts having neither the red line nor the initial 'D" on
the stubs.
Fifth, Stubless accounts, where the student having such stubless account
had another account with a stub.
Sixth, Stubless accounts where no stub was ever made to the student on
any account.
The following table will show the amount delinquent on these various
kinds of accounts:

From this table, it will be seen that, according to the system of keeping
the accoqnts, there were no vouchers or certificates for the sum of $1,855.26 of
the delinquency. The method of settling between Prof. Douglas and Prof. Rose
as stated by both of them, was invariably by passing over these certificates
by Rose to Douglas, and at the same time paying Douglas the amount represented by them. Where there were no certificates, there could be none passed.
The Committee conclude, from the above and from Prof. Rose's admission that
he was responsible for the stubless account, that the above amount of $1,855.26 is
still in his hands. Again, referring to the system of accounting as practiced
between Douglas and Rose, it would indicate that all sums of money appearing on stub accounts, where tha stubs bore neither the red line nor the letter
" D," should be charged to Rose; of these there are two accounts, amounting
to $38.85. He should also be held responsible for the stub money on any account where the stub showed the red line and not the letter " D." There is
one account of this kind, amounting to $35.60, ten dollars of which should be
charged to Rose. This now leaves to be accounted for, the delinquent accounts having stubs, each with a red line and letter '-D." All this money
having been received in the first instance by Prof. Rose, any evidence show



36


ing that Prof. Douglass accounted to the Regents for what came into his
hands would, of course, fix all the balance in the hands of Rose. The method
of passing money from the hands of Rose to the hands of Douglas is fully set
forth by Prof: Rose in his statement to the Board of Regents at their last December meeting, and is as follows;
"At the beginning of each month, during college year or soon thereafter,
the said Director called upon me, and together we looked over the amount of
deposits made since last settlement, together with the amount certified to by
the student upon the back of all vouchers that had been returned to me since
the last settlement. The amounts so certified to were then footed, and from
the amount so found was deducted the amount of deposits which the stub
book showed that I had theretofore paid over to said Director, and to the remainder was added all deposits which I had received since the last preceding
settlement; and from this sum was then taken all bills paid by me, if any,
and all cancelled tickets, and the amount thus found to be left in my hands
was then and there paid over to said Director."
In the same statement, after referring to a set of books supposed to be
kept by the Director, Prof. Rose goes on to say:
" It is also apparent that the connecting link between the account kept
by myself and that kept by said Director are those certain bits of paper on
which enumeration and memoranda were made in the handwriting of said Director, sometimes debiting, sometimes crediting me in the same column of figures. And when this loose and clumsy reckoning was finally supposed to be
adjusted, the bits of paper were destroyed or thrown aside, some of which,
however, I have since found, and a copy of one I have appended, marked 'A,'
and without any further special memorandum made by either person, the
said Director put the money and vouchers in his pocket and carried them
off."
This statement, except as to the frequency of the settlements, and other
minor points, is fully corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Douglas and
President Angell. Besides, many of those certain bits of paper above referred to, have been preserved, and your Committee agree with Prof. Rose as
to their importance. They are indeed the " connecting link" which seems to
complete the chain of evidence, and fix these delinquent balances where
they belong. The whole number of these bits of paper now in the possession
of the Regents is forty. It appears by the testimony of Dr. Douglas, that it
was his custom, on completing the settlement with Dr. Rose, to take the slip
of paper on which the amount of each certificate was set down and the additions and computations made, and wrap it around the certificates and thus
carry them to his office, and when he came to make his annual report to the
Regents, would return these certificates (which were his vouchers for such
report), still in the wrappers, as he had brought them from the Laboratory.
We find these vouchers for Dr. Douglas' report for the year 1873-1 in twelve
separate packages, each package having a wrapper of thin, soft paper, on
which is set down the amount of each certificate enclosed. These wrappers
are evidently the " bits of paper" referred to by Dr. Rose. They are all in the
handwriting of Dr. Rose, except two, one of which is in the handwriting of
Dr. Douglas and one partly in that of Dr. Rose. The dates on the vouchers
contained in these wrappers run through the whole year.




37


The delinquency for this year is $1,151.40, being the largest amount for
any one year covered by this examination. Keeping in mind the solemn
statement of both the Director and his assistant as to their method of settlement-that the Director called upon the assistant, and they together "looked
over the amount of the deposits made since last settlement, together with
the amount certified to by the student upon the back of all vouchers that
had been returned to me (Rose) since the last settlement," that such amounts
so certified to were footed up on " bits of paper," etc., the conclusion is irresistible that all the money paid by Dr. Rose to Dr. Douglas for the said year
of 1873-'74 was fully accounted for to the Board of Regents, and the delinquency for that year is still in the hands of Dr. Rose.
This disposes of twelve of the forty wrappers above mentioned. The other
twenty-eight have not been kept with the vouchers which they originally
contained. Steward Bennet informs us that before the first Committee commenced their work of examination, these twenty-eight wrappers were in
their places, as returned by the Director, enclosing the packages of vouchers
corresponding with the items in each wrapper. They were detached by the
Committee, and the whole vouchers for the year put in a single package.
The Steward also says that he examined some of these wrappers where they
still contained the corresponding vouchers, and found that the items on the
the wrappers tallied with voucher in number and amounts. The Director's
reports for the five years, beginning with the year 1869-'70 and ending with
the year 1873-'4, inclusive, do not show the receipts from the Laboratory in detail. The amounts are aggregated into large items, corresponding with the
footings on these wrappers, and enter on the reports as received from " sundry persons." This enabled the Committee to readily compare these loose
wrappers with the reports back of 1873-4, and we find that for these years,
1872-3, 1871-2 and 1870-1, there are complete sets of wrappers corresponding with
the amounts on the reports, and for the year 1869-'70, there are seven items on
the report as receipts from "sundry persons," for four of which we find the
corresponding wrappers. Thus it will be seen that there are in all four years
from 1870-'71 to 1873-'74, inclusive, in which there are complete sets of wrappers accompanying the Director's returns to the Board of Regents. These
four years show delinquencies as follows:
For the year 1870-'71 --- —----------------- $ 885 51
" " 1871-'72              ----------------------------- 816 10
"   " 1872-'73      --------------------------- 962 55
" 1873-'74-__ --- —----------------- 1,151 40
Making a total of --- —----------------- $3,815 56
Adding to this the delinquency for the year 1869-'70, where these wrappers are missing, we have an aggregate shortage, for the five years, of $4,386.61.
A tabular statement of these facts annexed to this report and marked Exhibit C
will show that the reports of Prof. Douglas indicate but little difference in the receipts from year to year, for the five years mentioned. From the above, your
Committee conclude that Prof. Douglas reported to the Board for these five
years, all the vouchers that came fnto his hands from his assistant and the
money represented by them, and that the balance of receipts at the Laboratory for that time, viz., the $4,386.61, less a certain amount of deposit or stub
money hereafter mentioned, was retained by Prof. Rose. If this conclusion




38
should be the correct one, then, even without further testimony, the presumption would be strong indeed that he had retained the balance for the
other years covered by the investigation. But other facts, proven in the examination, tend to the same conclusion. It will be observed from the table
of delinquencies hereto attached and marked Exhibit D, that from the time
Prof. Rose entered the Laboratory, up to the time when this defalcation was
first discovered, there was a steady increase of deficiency from year to year,
running from $169 in 1865-6 up to $1,151 in 1873-4.
Prof. Rose became the cashier and book-keeper at the Laboratory in the
latter part-of the year 1865-'66. The examination of this Committee, as well
as of the former Committees, extended back to the beginning of the year
1864-'65. In that year there is an apparent deficiency of $25; $20, at least, of
which Prof. Douglas claims was accounted for in an item of credit of $104.25,
appearing on his report for the year 1867-'68. Accepting this explanation as
the correct one (and we see no reason to doubt it), it leaves the year 1864-'65
without any deficiency, unless it be a possible one of $5. We find that during
the first six months, or thereabouts, of the year 1865-1866, the moneys were
received and also kept, at the Laboratory, by one C. H. Lewis. During this
time, there were no settled accounts which were delinquent, and the whole
delinquency of that year appears to have occurred after Prof. Rose succeeded
Lewis, which was sometime in March, 1866. From this, it appears that the
delinquency in the Laboratory first commenced almost immediately on Prof.
Rose's connection with it, and, as above stated, steadily increased until the
year 1873-4, when it reached the highest amount of any one year. The same
phenomenon will appear in the steady increase of the stubless accounts.
The first year there were any accounts without stubs was 1866-7, when there
were only two. In 1867-'68, there were nine (9). In 1868-'69, there were (8)
eight. In 1869-'70, there were seven (7). In 1870-'71, there were twenty (20). In
1871-;72, there were twenty-five (25). In 1872-'73, there were forty-five (45). In
1873-'74, there were thirty-two (32). In 1874-'75, there were thirty-four (34). The
steady increase in the whole number of the delinquent accounts from 1866-7
to 1873-4 is also noticeable, running from nine (9) in the former year to sixtyfour (64) in the latter.
The attention of the Committee has been called, during the investigation, to the character of the red lines drawn on many of the stubs of the delinquent accounts, and the question has been raised, whether they are genuine or not. If the conclusion is reached, that in any one year the Director
turned over to the Regents all the vouchers transferred to him for the same
time by his assistant, then it would seem clear that any red line stubs on delinquent accounts for that year would be spurious. The red line on a stub
says that the corresponding voucher has been turned over to Prof. Douglas.
If the corresponding voucher has not been turned over to him, then the red
line tells a falsehood. And here we again invite the attention of the Board
to the year 1873-4, when it seems conclusive that all the vouchers received by
Douglas were returned to the Regents; yet there are twenty stubs in the delinquent accounts for that year, bearing the red line and the letter " D." In
the year 1872-3, when the wrappers show that we got all the vouchers surrendered by Rose, there were sixteen delinquent accounts, where the stubs
bore the red line; in 1871-2, there were twenty-seven such stubs, and in 1870-1,
there were thirty-one. To recapitulate, during the.four years of 1879-1 to 1873-4
inclusive, the slips of paper on which the settlements were made between




39
Douglas and Rose (now called wrappers), show that all the vouchers passed to
Douglas were by him passed to the University, yet during these years there
are 91 stubs in the delinquent accounts with the red line and the letter " D"
on them. From the premises reached by the Committee, viz., that these
wrappers conclusively show that the Director honestly accounted to the
Board for the four years named, there can be but one conclusion as to the red
lines on the stubs for the same years, viz., that they are spurious. An analysis of the delinquent list made by Prof. Rose himself for the year 1874-5, leads
your Committee to the conclusion that there were spurious red lines placed
upon the stubs of delinquent accounts for that year.
Prof. Rose, as we are informed, made the delinquent list himself and
placed it in a book, which is one of the exhibits accompanying this report.
At the foot of the list is a certificate signed by him, tending strongly to show
that he knew what he was doing, and knew the accounts there set down were
delinquent, and he had not surrendered to the director the vouchers for the
same. That delinquent list, so made by Prof. Rose, contains 37 accounts, 31
of which are stubless, and six have stubs, each with red line and letter " D."
If Dr. Rose had not before that time surrendered these six accounts, why
were the red lines on the stub? Again, in the certificate in the same book, at
the bottom of another list of accounts, Dr. Rose certifies that he has delivered
the University receipt vouchers, named in said list, excepting the receipts of
Little, Pantlind, Thomas and Hubbard, which have been mislaid or lost.
Now, of the four accounts represented by these four names, three are stubless
accounts, and one has a stub with a red line and initial "D." How could
they be mislaid or lost? According to the system of accounts and of accounting, there was but one voucher in these four accounts, and the red
line is an averment that that was turned over to Dr. Douglas. The other
accounts being without vouchers, it could not be said the vouchers were mislaid or lost.
There is still another subject connected with these delinquent accounts
to which the committee call attention. There are a number of delinquent
accounts with stubs bearing the initial "D." This indicates that Prof.
Douglas received the deposit money. The amount of such deposit money
unaccounted for is $1,174.65. If these initial letters are genuine, then clearly
Prof. Douglas still owes the University this amount. He claims that they, or
a portion of them at least, are not genuine, and that the money they pretend
to receipt for never came into his hands. In proof of this he exhibits one
stub signed with the full name " Douglas " and apparently spelled " Dougles."
This is found in Stub Book No. 2, on stub No. 44, second series, dated Sept. 26,
1867. This signature, Prof. Douglas says under oath, is not in his hand writing, and insists in addition that he knows how to spell his own name. He
has also shown to the committee other "D's" at various places through the
stub books which he claims to be forgeries. There were no expert witnesses
examined on this subject, and the committee feel unable to pass upon the
genuineness of these single letters, although they are all of the opinion that
the word "Dougles," as mentioned above, is not in the hand writing of the
Director. Prof. Douglas, to further support his allegation that these letters
are not genuine, put into the hands of the committee his private books of
account, purporting to show his cash receipts and cash expenditures from all
sources and his annual balances. These books cover a period of about nine
years last past. It is claimed that so large a sum as this stub money could




40
not come into his hands and remain there from year to year without showing a disturbance in his balances. The committee found these books to show
the receipt and disbursement of large sums of money, coming from various
sources. There was an annual balance of the books, but only in two
instances during such period of nine years did the balancing show
anything wrong. On the balance sheet taken oft in December, 1868, it
appears that the professor found himself in possession of about $99 more
than he was able to account for, and again in December, 1870, the sum
of $233.0S. These he had minuted to be accounted for when found. The testimony of Prof. Douglas shows that it was his custom each January to get
from Prof. Rose a statement of the stub money in his (Douglas') hands, for the
purpose of settling and balancing his own private books. He kept but one
bank account, and as this money, what ever there might be of it, would be
part of his bank balance, it would be necessary to know the amount and deduct it in order to ascertain his true bank balance and properly adjust his
own books,
According to Prof. Douglas' custom of doing business with the Board of
Regents and with Prof. Rose, there were three ways in which he finally disposed of this stub money which came into his hands. First, in case the student making the deposit failed to get a table in the Laboratory, or for any
other reason did not enter upon his work there, his deposit or stub money
was withdrawn, and the stub crossed with the black line and marked "cancelled." Second, if a student left the Laboratory without settling, and it
became evident that he would not return or adjust his account, then the
stub to his account was marked "forfeited," and the Director accounted
for his stub money as a forfeiture, the report showing hundreds of dollars
so accounted for. Third, if the student continued his work, and finally settled his account, his receipt was taken up by Rose, as heretofore explained,
and turned over by him to Douglas, and Douglas, in settling with the
Board, accounted for the amount on the back of the receipt, which always
included the stub money or original deposit. It will now be seen that if
the assistant suppressed these receipts, or in any way failed to turn them
over to the Director, there would be nothing to call his attention to the
fact that the stub money still remained in his hands except the condition of
his own cash account. In view of the fact that his cash account only shows
the discrepancy above named, and from the appearance of the stubs the
alleged forgery of the word "Douglas" on one of them, and the evidence
tending to show that the red line in some instances was wrongfully placed
on the stub, Prof. Douglas urges that he should not be charged with the
whole amount of the deposit money in these delinquent accounts.
Your committee believe that a portion, at least, of this stub money is
in the hands of Prof. Douglas. We have found no reason to believe that he
has wrongfully kept it. While we recognize the force of his argument concerning the same, we are quite unable to determine how much, if any,
should be charged bacl to Prof. Rose. To determine that would be to determine how many, if any, of the " D's" were forgeries. This we are unable
to do. Had the Director used proper diligence and care in his settlements
with his assistant, the defalcation would long since have been detected and
the University saved from loss. The fact that we are unable, from any evidence before us, to say what portion of this stub money is in his hands, and
from the further fact of his negligence as above stated, we deem it but just to




41


the University that he should be held responsible in the first instance for
all the delinquent stub money, except that of the stub bearing the word
"Dougles."
A charge was made before the Board of Regents, at a late meeting, that
Dr. Douglas had received commissions for chemicals and apparatus purchased in New York city of the houses of Rohrbeck & Goebeler and Benjamin
for use in the Laboratory. Your committee find that the chemicals and
apparatus used in the Laboratory have nearly always been purchased of
these two houses. The affidavits of Mr. Gcebeler and of Mr. Benjamin were
produced to the committee on this point, also the testimony of Dr. Douglas
and that of Regent Climie, who had been to New York and investigated this
matter. Dr. Douglas also submitted his correspondence with these gentlemen, and the drafts drawn by him in payment for the goods purchased,
which correspondence and drafts are herewith returned. Your committee
conclude that there is no foundation in fact for this charge; that no commissions were received by Douglas, and that the University received the full
benefit of all discounts obtained from these gentlemen in the purchase of
material for the Laboratory.
A charge was also made that Douglas had charged students excessive
prices for chemicals and apparatus. By section 4, chapter 8 of the By-Laws
of the University, adopted Feb. 16, 1864, it is provided that students shall be
furnished witn apparatus and chemicals at cost price, or according to the
price list of a New York dealer, and that the amount so received shall constitute a fund in the hands of the Professor of Chemistry for the purchase of
apparatus, which amount shall be properly accounted for at the close of the
year. The testimony shows that Douglas instructed Rose to charge the students the catalogue price of the New York dealers, adding the premium on
gold, and 10 per cent. to cover freight, breakage and wastage; that Rose had
charge of fixing and marking the price of chemicals, etc., under these instructions; that printed catalogues of the prices of the two houses above
referred to have been constantly kept in the Laboratory, and open to the inspection of Rose and the students; and that after Rose was suspended in
December last, Dr. Douglas went through the Laboratory and marked the
price of chemicals, and, in some instances, reduced the price which had before been charged.
A charge has also been made before the Board that Dr. Douglas had purchased an instrument in London for the sum of $1,168.07 without warrant or
authority from the Board of Regents. and that considerable money had been
spent on this instrument without warrant. By the By-Laws above referred
to Dr. Douglas was authorized to purchase apparatus and chemicals. All the
income in the Laboratory derived from the sale of chemicals, etc., to the
students has been, ever since the organization of the Laboratory, expended
under the direction of Dr. Douglas in the purchase of apparatus and material for the same, and by this means chiefly the University has become
possessed of one of the best equipped laboratories in the United States. Dr.
Douglas has annually accounted to the Board for such expenditures. He
purchased this instrument of W. W. Ladd & Co., of London, in the same
manner and under the same authority as he has purchased other apparatus,
and accounted for it to the Board in his annual report for the year 1873-4. The
testimony taken discloses the fact that the instrument did not come up to
2




42


the expectations and representations of Messrs. Ladd & Co., some parts of it
broke when first used, and the broken part was returned to them for repairs.
It was repaired and again returned to the Laboratory, where it now is. Still
the instrument did not do what was represented, and Dr. Douglas made exertions to have Ladd & Co. take it back. They declined to do this, and Dr.
Douglas opened correspondence with parties in London, who had several
interviews with Ladd & Co. in regard to the matter, and finally, rather than
have a lawsuit, the matter was dropped. The instrument is still in the Laboratory, and does fair work, though not what was expected of it. The correspondence in regard to the matter was laid before the committee, and is
herewith returned. We cannot see that Dr. Douglas deserves any censure for
this transaction.
It has also been charged that Dr. Douglas unjustly or improperly received certain commissions, for superintending additions to the Laboratory
and putting in permanent apparatus in 1868, which commissions amount in
the aggregate to $488; and also commissions for superintending the putting in
of steam heating apparatus in 1869, amounting to $741.29. Dr. Douglas claims
that these commissions were allowed him by a previous agreement with
the Board, through its proper committee. By referring to the report of the
committee authorized to put in the steam heating apparatus, which report is
on file in the Secretary's office, it will be seen that the committee invited bids,
and that the lowest bid obtained was $14,000. The committee thought it could
be done cheaper, and it was put under the charge of Dr. Douglas at a total cost
of $10,077.48 includingsaid commission. All these commissions were promptly
reported to the then Board of Regents and allowed. In view of the fact that
this work was done chiefly during the summer vacation when every professor's time is his own, and the further fact that these commissions were passed
upon and settled by the Board under whose supervision the work was done,
we see no justice in going back seven or eight years and setting aside such
settlement.
On the sixth day of their investigation, an affidavit purporting to have
been made by William Lewitt, of San Francisco, was placed in the hands of
the committee, which affidavit is herewith returned. Said Lewitt was
Demonstrator of Anatomy in the Medical Department for several years. He
says in his affidavit that he was instructed by Douglas, then the Dean of the
Medical Faculty, to retain in his hands any surplus money that he (Lewitt)
might have, and not report the same to the Board, but expend it as the
Medical Faculty might from time to time direct. Dr. Lewitt annually presented to the Board his report, showing an itemized account of receipts
and expenditures in the anatomical department, which reports are now on
file in the Secretary's office. In his final report to the Board, said 'Lewitt
gives a full statement of his disbursements during his term of service, and
in his report says that, by the advice of some of the members of the Medical
Faculty, he held such surplus and expended it for necessary purposes as
the Faculty saw fit for the benefit of the college. Dr. Lewitt further says
in his affidavit, that Dr. Douglas said to him that he (Douglas)" kept back
and retained in his possession and under his control over $1,000, as a secret
fund, and that the said Douglas did not report said sum to said Regents,
nor did they know anything of the same, or of such retention; and the
reason given by said Douglas for such retention and such neglect to
report, was that he could not run his department if he was compelled




43


to go to the Regents for what he wanted." We find that Douglas did
not receive any money from the Medical Department, and had no control over any funds in connection with it. This secret fund, if it existed,
did not then come from any funds received in the Medical Department. The only other source from which it could come is from the
Laboratory, but the history of the management in the Laboratory shows
that no occasion existed for any such fund there, as all the moneys received
were expended there. Dr. Douglas swears that no conversation in regard
to a secret fund ever took place with Dr. Lewitt, and that no such thing
ever existed. The testimony taken upon this point discloses other circumstances tending to throw discredit upon this affidavit. The facts above
stated seem to your committee to form a complete answer to it.
The attention of your committee was called to a charge contained in a
newspaper published in Washtenaw county that Dr. Douglas had let a contract for digging a ditch at twice the cost charged for digging another on
the University grounds. The facts about this are these: Dr. Douglas and
Secretary Bennett, with Regent Climie, were appointed a committee to superintend the putting in of water works now in operation. Bids were solicited from various parties for digging both the said ditches, and in both cases
the work was let to the lowest bidder, and in the opinion of your committee at
very reasonable rates. Both contracts were made by Secretary Bennett, and
were paid for by him. Dr. Douglas had nothing to do with the contract for
digging the ditch, for which the highest price was charged, except to assent
to the contract. The whole transaction is fully set forth in the testimony
of Secretary Bennett and Dr. Douglas.
These matters have no direct bearing upon the deficiencies in the Laboratory, but inasmuch as the attention of the committee was called to them,
and inasmuch as corruption, dishonesty, and fair dealing or falsehood in any
transaction would affect the credibility to be given to testimony produced
in regard to the Laboratory defalcation, and involve the fitness of Dr.
Douglas to fill a responsible position in the University, your committee
deemed it their duty to give them a searching and thorough investigation.
The question of interest charged by Douglas in the University is also
raised in this connection. Unless the amount of the deficiencies was received by him, then we think that the items of interest were correct and
properly charged to the University, and that their allowance by the Board
in former reports was correct.
There are many other facts and circumstances in connection with this
matter, disclosed by the evidence, which throw at least some light upon it,
and to which your committee now call attention.
1st, That Dr. Douglas received from Rose only the vouchers and the
memoranda of figures made at the time of settlement, and that he kept a
bookof his own containing his accounts with the Laboratory, in which he
testifies that he at the time of reception entered the amounts received from
Rose, sometimes entering the names of the students and the amounts received from each, and at other times entering only the aggregate amount received. The annual reports of Dr. Douglas correspond substantially with the
entries made in this book. This book is now in possession of the Board.
2nd, That after Rose had settled with Douglas for the year 1874-5, Dr.
Douglas discovered the names of four students which did not appear in the




44
lists turned over to him by Rose. That upon making this discovery, he went
to the Laboratory, took down the ledger, and commenced to examine it; that
Dr. Rose stepped up immediately, and asked him what he wanted; that
Douglas then showed him the four names, and asked him if he had not made
a mistake; that Rose told him he had, and gave him a due bill for the
amount; that afterwards on different occasions, Dr. Douglas submitted other
names to Rose, and asked him if he had not made a mistake in not reporting them, and that as fast as these names were submitted, Rose admitted
that he had not paid or accounted for them to Douglas.
3d. That Rose, after Douglas began to submit these names to him, voluntarily said to Douglas that he had a list of the names and amounts turned
over to Douglas for 1874-5, and that he would furnish the same to Douglas;
that said Rose did so, and placed the said list in the book herewith returned
and adding thereto his certificate, stating that he had that day delivered the
University receipt vouchers named in the list excepting four which had been
mislaid or lost, said vouchers covering the receipts of the Laboratory from
October 28th, 1874, to June 3( th, 1875, to S. H. Douglas as Director; that said list
contained the names of five students whose accounts had not been paid to
the University, and Douglas swears that the vouchers did not reach him, and
that Rose afterwards paid him.
4th, That after Douglas had submitted several lists of the names which
Rose admitted he had not paid, Rose said he had a list of the names and
amounts which he had not paid over or accounted for to Dr. Douglas for the year
1874-5, and that he would furnish such a list; that he did make out such a list
in the book above referred to, and attached his certificate thereto, stating
that said list embraced all the receipts of the Laboratory, not heretofore rendered, for the time embraced between July 1st, 1874, to October 1st, 1875; that
such list amounted to the sum of $584, and contained thirty-seven names;
that of such list, 32 had no stubs, and that five had stubs marked with the
red line and the letter " D."
5th, That on or about the 8th day of Nov., 1875, before the Executive Committee had been called together, Rose paid over to Dr. Douglas the sum of
about $645, as an admitted deficiency for the year 1874-5.
6th, That Rose said, during the first investigation, that he (Rose) was
responsible for all the accounts where there were no stubs.
7th, That Rose, before any charge had been made against him, and while
all the delinquencies up to that time had been treated as mistakes, said to
Prof. Prescott, with whom he was talking about the deficiency, " I had rather
be under the sod."
8th, That in many instances the delinquent accounts were settled with
the students on the same day that the other accounts were settled and 'paid
to Dr. Rose, and which he paid over to Douglas.
9th, That in several instances, when the stubs were marked cancelled,
showing that the deposit money had been paid back to the students, the
students had accounts at the same time and settled them, as for instance in
the year 1873-4, the accounts of Cady and Avery.
10th, That in several instances, Dr. Douglas had received from these New
York houses commissions for purchases made by other institutions in the
State, on the recommendation of Dr. Douglas, and then the amounts of these
commissions have been credited by Dr. Douglas to the University.




45


We cannot do justice to the whole case without here alluding to the conduct of Prof. Douglas and of Prof. Rose, since the discovery of the defalcation.
Dr. Douglas has furnished every facility in his power for a full and thorough
examination, always, so far as we know, being ready and willing to aid by
counsel or labor. Apparently, he has kept nothing back. The search of
the Committee through his official reports and papers and his private books,
has strongly impressed them that in his business relations with the University and with others, his purpose has been one of honesty and integrity. By
reference to the records, it will be seen that Prof. Rose has refused to come
before or assist any of the Committees appointed to investigate this matter.
He has persistently and determinedly kept in the dark whatever knowledge
hemight have concerning it. In conversation with Professor Prescott and
Regents Walker and McGowan, he exhibited trepidation and feeling,
that seemed to imply guilty knowledge. Being refused permission
by President Angell to carry away a delinquent list on which he had made a
certificate, he exhibited an excitement and violence inconsistent with an innocent purpose. In a word, his whole conduct has not been in keeping with
any theory of honest purpose and fair dealing.
After a careful review of the whole case as the same has reached us, your
Committee recommend that Assistant Prof. P. B. Rose be dismissed from the
employ of the Regents, and the Executive Committee be instructed to take
such measures for re-irbursing the University as they shall deem expedient.
All of which is most respectfully submitted.
JONAS H. McGOWAN,
C. B. GRANT,
J. ESTABROOK.
At the conclusion of the reading of the Report by Regent
McGowan, Regent E. C. Walker moved that the Report be accepted, and that it be laid upon the table for the present. The
motion prevailed.
On motion of Regent Walker, the Board adjourned to 2 -o'clock p. M.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
Monday, June 19th, 1876.

46


tion, as a substitute for the resolution presented by Regent
Climie, and they were adopted:
WHEREAS, Three committees of this Board have examined and reported
upon the accounts of the Chemical Laboratory; and whereas, Professor P. B.
Rose has twice declined to appear before the duly authorized committees of
this Board; therefore,
Resolved, That it is not expedient that this Board should again enter into
the details of said accounts, but that Professor P. B. Rose himself may be
now examined under oath, by his counsel, and the counsel of Professor S. H.
Douglas, and by the Board itself.
The attorney of Prof. Rose (Mr. A. J. Sawyer) being present,
declined to accept the proposal to go into the investigation as
contemplated by Regent Walker's resolution.
On motion of Regent E. C. Walker, the report of the Special
Committee appointed to " continue and complete the investigation of the Chemical Laboratory accounts," was taken from the
table, and, after a full and free discussion of the same, it was
adopted on a call vote, as follows:
Ayes-Regents Estabrook, McGowan, Grant, E. C. Walker, and S. S.
Walker.
Xay-Regent Climie.
The following resolution was' submitted by Regent Grant,
and adopted:
Resolved, That the Executive Committee be and are hereby instructed
to take immediate steps for commencing a suit against Preston B. Rose, to
recover from him the amount of money claimed to be in his hands and to
belong to the University, and to proceed to a trial or hearing of the same at
the earliest practicable moment, at the present June term of Court, if possible.
Resolved, further, That said Committee be and are hereby instructed to
deed back to Prof. P. B. Rose the house and lot heretofore deeded to J. W.
Knight in trust for the University, upon his filing with said Committee a
bond, with two sureties, to be approved by said Committee, conditioned to
pay any judgment or decree that may be recovered against him in said suit.
On motion of Regent Grant, the Board adjourned to 7 o'clock

be and hereby is constituted the only disbursing officer of the University,
and that he is hereby authorized to pay any or all claims against the University, on the proper certificate of the Secretary, and when purchases are made
by other parties authorized to do so, he shall pay for them also, and the bills
for said purchases shall be receipted in duplicate, charging the same to the
proper accounts.
The following preamble and resolution were submitted by
Regent Rynd:
WHEREAS, The Board of Regents have this day, by vote, expelled Preston B. Rose for alleged retention of University funds in his hands, to the
amount of $4,332.65; and
WHEREAS, It appears from the report of the Committee that there is
also in the hands of Silas H. Douglas funds to a considerable amount-to wit,
$1,174.65-which belong to the University, and that portions of the total
amount in the hands of said Douglas have been retained by said Douglas for
several years past; and
WHEREAS, FURTHER, It is evident that he has been recreant to the trust
reposed in him, in that he has, by his own confession, habitually neglected
to examine the accounts of the Laboratory; therefore,
Resolved, That Silas H. Douglas be and is hereby dismissed from service
in the University.
At the close of a somewhat lengthy discussion of the resolution, an aye and nay vote was ordered, and the result was as follows:
Aye-Regents Rynd and Climie.
Nay-Regents McGowan, Grant, E. C. Walker, and S. S. Walker.
The resolution of Regent Rynd was lost.
Regent E. C. Walker submitted the following resolution,
which was adopted:
Resolved, That the Finance Committee, in settling the amount due Prof.
Douglas from the University, (Prof. Douglas having consented thereto,)
charge him with the amount of the deposit money reported due from him in
the report of the Committee made this day, subject to correction by any
future legal decision as to the genuineness of his INITIAL vouchers-this action not to affect any other question growing out of Laboratory accounts.

OCTOBER MEETING.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,     }
Tuesday, October I7th, I876. 
The Board of Regents assembled in the room of the President, at;o o'clock A. M.
Present: The President: Regents Estabrook, Rvnd, E. C. Walker,
Climie, and S. S. Walker.
The meeting was called to order by the President, and opened by
reading of the scriptures and prayer.
On motion of Regent Rynd, the minutes of the last meeting were
approved as printed.
The annual report of the President was submitted, and by request of
the Board was read by him, Regent Climie in the chair.
The following is the President's report:
PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL REPORT.
To/ t/e ZIo1iorable Board of R'egents:
I otelr yott my Report for the University. year which ended
June 30, I876.
The changes in our Faculties have been as follows:
John W. Langley, B. S., was in August, I875, appointed by
the Executive Committee, Acting Professor of General Chemis-.
try and Physics, and in June, 1876, was proloted by the Board
of Regents to the full Professorship.  In March, I876, J. B.
Steere, Ph. D., was elected Assistant Professor of Paleontology.
Pre-.ton 13. Rose, M. A., M. D., Instructor in the Chemical
Laboratory, was in ()ctober. 1875, made Assistant Professor of
Physiological Chemistry, was suspended in December, restored
to his work in March, IS76, and was dismissed fiom his office
in June last. In June, 1876, II. B. Hutchins, Ph. B., Assistant
Professor of History and Rhetoric, resigned his chair and Isaac
N. Demmon. M. A., wNas chosen to succeed him.     In August.

1875, John J. Mapel, M. A., was appointed Instructor in Germnan
and French for one year, during the absence of Instructor Hennequin in Europe. Samuel T. Douglas, Ph. B., Ph. C., was in
June, I875, appointed Assistant in the Chemical Laboratory.
In August, I875, Abram V. E. Young, Ph. B., Ph. C., was
appointed Assistant in Chemistry and Physics.  In December,
1875, V. C. Vaughan, M. S., and Kate Crane, Ph. C., were
appointed Assistants (for temporary service) in the Chemical
Laboratory. In June, I876, Mr. Vaughan received a permanent
appointment to the same post which he had occupied temporarily. In June, I876, M. W. Harrington, M. A., Assistant Professor in charge of Zo6logy and Botany, received permission to
be absent in Europe for two years, and Volney M. Spalding, M.
A., was appointed Instructor in those branches.
The continued illness of Dr. Henry S. Cheever constrained
him to resign in April last, the chair of Physiology and Materia
Medica, which he had so ably filled for several years.  Prof.
Frothingham  is henceforth to give the instruction in Materia
Medica, and the title of his Professorship has accordingly been
modified.
W. L. B. Jenney, C. E., was, in March last, appointed to the
chair of Architecture and Design.
In July the Executive Committee, who at the June meeting
of the Board were charged with the duty of appointing two
Lecturers in the Hiomm(opathic Medical College for one year,
selected F. A. Rockwith, M. D., as Lecturer on Obstetrical Therapeutics. and J. C. Gilchrist as Lecturer on Surgical Therapeutics.
The same Committee have also selected Prof. Burt C. Wilder, M. D., as Lecturer on Physiologyr for one course in the
Department of Medicine and Surgery.
The instruction in Mineralogy and (Geology has been given
during the year by Prof. Pettee.
The whole number of persons on our Facultv roll was
fifty-three. Three were not on duty here.
The total number of students il the University last year was
I,I27, distributed as follows:

Just one-half of all the students this year were from          Michigan, which is a larger proportion          than usual.     Thirty-four of
our States and    Territories, and     Ontario   (Canada)     and Japan,
have furnished us students.        Illinois sent us 98, Ohio 85, New
York 75, Pennsylvania 47, Indiana 46. Wisconsin 36, Iowa 20,
Minnesota 20, Missouri 15. Kentucky Io, California I0.               From

the Middle States, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Dela



58


ware, we had I29.    Seven of the Southern States were represented in the classes. When we consider the financial embarrassments of our people, and remember how professional schools have
been multiplying, the attendance upon the University must be
considered satisfactory.
The number of women in attendance during the past year
is 11o, distributed as follows: in the Department of Medicine
and Surgery, 37; in the Law Department, 2; in the Homolopathic Medical College, 2: in the Department of Literature.
Science, and the Arts, 60. (f these last there were in the Senior
Class ii; in the Junior Class I; in the Sophomore Class I5;
in the Freshman Class 16; in Select studies 3; in Pharmacy 3.
The experience of this last year confirms the opinion we have
been led to form    by the experience of previotis years, that
women who come here in good health are able to complete our
collegiate or professional courses of studyc without detriment to
their health.  It is worthy of note that the number of women in
the University has varied very little during the last three years.
This fact may indicate that we are not to expect at present any
fiurther rapid increase in the proportion of women to men in the
University.  The great majority of women will for the present
probably seek at least their collegiate education in schools and
colleges established for their sex alone.    But we may well
believe that the opening of this University and of other colleges
to students of both sexes, has furnished a healthfil and powerfuil
stimulus to those Institutions to improve the quality and widen the
range of their work.

The degree of Doctor of Philosophy was for the first time
conferred on examination. This degree, which is bestowed only
on candidates, who have pursued extended post-graduate courses,
and sustained most rigorous examinations is sought by some of
our most aspiring and energetic graduates.  After this year
degrees in course will not be given.  Every degree bestowed
will then have a real significance.
The plan of receiving students froml certain approved High
Schools on diploma and without examination )y us has worked
so satisfactorily that the Faculty have deemed it prudent and
wise to ofier to receive students on diploma fi-om a class of High
Schools whose graduates have heretofore been admiitted by us
only on examination.  Wie have, until this year, declined to
approve any school which was not so organiized and equipped
as to be able to prepare students simultaneously for all oilr
undergraduate courses of study.   But we now propose to
approve any good High School, which cIan show that it is thoroughly preparing students for any onle of our classes. It seems
better that a school should be encoulraged to train students well
in one or two courses than by undertaking more than it can do
successfully to fail in doing any of its work well.  And there
seems no reason why a school which call prepare its pupils satisfactorily for our Scientific anlld Engineering courses alone should
not be recognized by us as conmpetent to do that particular work.
It is thought that this modification of our plan will be helpfitl
to many schools, acceptable to the public, and not injurious to
the University.
We received last year on diploma: From  Ann Arbor, 44t
Detroit, 3; Coldwater, I; Pontiac, 3; Flint,; Battle Creek, z;
State Normal School,; Fenton, 4; total, 59.
I think I have not known since my connection with the University so satisfactory a year's work in the undergraduate depart



60


ment. There has been hardly an occasion for the slightest
disciplinary action.  The students as a body have addressed
themselves to their duties with marked assiduity. Another year's
experience confirms the impression indicated in my last report
that the liberty il the choice of studies in the Senior year now
left to the students has greatly increased the value and amount
of work accomplished in that year.  To a limited extent elections of studies have been opened in the Junior and Sophomore
years. We are constantly making progress in the application of
laboratory methods of instruction in botany and biology. Admirable work has been accomplished in these studies. It is hard
to be patient under the delay to which the scantiness of our
mealis forces us, in equipping, our physical laboratory.  If
pihysics are to be adequately taught to advanced students, it
they are to be taught as chemistry, botany and biology are now
taught, we must furnish ourselves with apparatus for our physical laboratory. We are in danger of falling behind miost of the
better institutions of the country in this regard.
Prof. Watson returned fiom his journey to China in time to
res1ume  lis labors at the beginning of the academic year.
Within the past twelve months he has discovered three more
asteroids, making twenty in all, which are credited to him. It
is much to be regretted that anl Observatory, at which so much
work is (dol, giving al wide reputation to the University and
making most valuable contributions to science, is not provided
with ani adequate fund for the payment of assistants and computers, and for the publication of full reports of the labor
accomplished.
The chair of Geology has now been vacant for a year and
a half.  Most of the instruction properly falling to that chair
was given last year and is to be given this year by Prof Pettee.
You are aware that our delay in filling the chair has been mainly
due to economical considerations.  It is at considerable inconvenience that Prof. Pettee rescues time this year from his work
of Mlining ll  Engitierilng to discharge his present duties.  The
claims of his owln department will le so pressing after this year
that some other provision must be made for the instruction in




Geology.  I hope the condition of our treasury will permit us
to call some suitable person to the Professorship.
We had last vear three new schools to organize, the School
of Mines, the Dental School, and the Itom(xopathic Medical
School. The means placed at our disposal for the purchase of
apparatus for the School of Mines enabled us to provide ourselves
with a fair equipment, comprising furnaces, stamp mill, crullsher,
ores, furnace products, etc. Although the annlouncement of the
organization of the school could not be made until just before the
opening of the academic year, fifteen students were registered on
its roll. It is evident that there is a real want for the training
which this school aims to give.
It is with peculiar pleasure that I announce the generous
purpose of the Directors of tlhe Calumet and Hecla Mining Company to present to the School of Miines a beautiful model of their
stamp mill, after the close of the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. It has there attracted much attention. The cost of this
model is, I am told, at least twelve thousand dollars. This gift
is, therefore. larger than any before nmade to the University by
any individual or private corporation.  Mr. Alexander Agassiz,
President of the Company. in a letter dated Sept. Ist, made
known the intention of the company to favor us with this most
valuable addition to our means of illustrating the instruction in
mining. We cherish the gift not only for its intrinsic value, but
also because it evinces on the part of those actively engaged in
the mining industry of our State a most lively and helpful interest in our enterprise.
I beg leave to lirect your attention to a report herewith submitted, fiom the Profsssor of Mining Engineering, concerninlg the
School of Mines, its vwork, expenditures and needs. It will be
seen from his detailed statement that a good b)eginning has becn
made towards the outfit of the School. 'l'he fiunls appropriated
have, I think, been carefullly and judiciously expended. A revlrberatorv furnace, a blast fuirnace anid books are among the pressing wants, for vwhich appropriations are desired. Prof. P'ettee's
suggestions concerning a summer trip of the students to tlle mining regions of the Upper Peninsula for special study there and




62


the inquiry as to what shall be the requisites for the degrees of
Civil Engineer and Mining Engineer are commended to your consideration. Of the great prospective usefulness of this School, if
the Legislature shall provide for its continuance, there is no longer
room to doubt. For the deep interest which our fiiends in the
Upper Peninsula have taken in it, and for the valuable assistance
they have rendered us, we are very thankful.
The act, which establishes the School of Mines, provides for
a chair of Architecture and Design. WVe were unable to fill the
chair in time to begin instruction last year. But Mr. WV. L. B.
Jenney, of Chicago, having accepted the Professorship last spring,
preparations were at once commenced for the work of the new
academic year. Orders were given for books, models, casts, and
other necessary materials for illustrations in teaching. Prof. Jenney also gave two introductory lectures on Architecture. We
have not looked for a large numnber of students the first year,' but
there can be no doubt that there wrill be a considerable demand*
for instruction in this department.  Certainly there can be no
doubt that there is a great need of thoroughly trained architects,
who can bring to their work refined and educated taste and scientific knowledge.
The Dental School opened with an attendance, which in the
circumstances must be deemed fair. It was not until a short time
before the begilnning of the term that the announcement of the
School could be put in circulation. A class of twenty received
instruction, of whom four -raduated with the degree of Doctor of
Dental Surgery. We have aimed to make the course one of
great thoroughness, and to a certain extent to grade the work.
The exceptional advantages furnished to dental students by our
medical college and our chemical laboratory must make this
School especially attractive and serviceable to all who desire a
complete knowledge of dental science. We desire to recognize
with appreciation the hearty support and the timely help, whieh
the dentists of Michigan have given to the School. If the attendance increases, as we have a right to expect it will, ampler accorn-: A class of seven are pursuing this course. In view of the brief notice which
coultd be given of the details ot the work, this must be regarded as a satisfactory numbner.
Several other students regutlarly attend the lectnres of the course.




63


modations will be needed. A somewhat larger annual appropriation is indeed quite indispensable to the largest prosperity of the
School.
I desire to call the attention of the Iegislature and of all the
fiiends of the University, to the fact that the Acts establishing the
School of Mines and the Dental School, provided only two years'
support for those schools. Unless. tlerefore, the Legislature at
its coming session, renews the appropriations, the existence of
those two schools must terminate at the close of the present University year. It is to be hoped that the same egrenerous spirit, whicl
prompted the original endowment, will also lead the Legislature
to provide for their continuance. They are both giving a promise of prosperity and usefulness. which justifies the fostering care
of the State.
The Hom(Xopathic Medical College started under special difficulties. Iike the other new schools it had but small opportunity to make known in advance its plan. The plan, when announced, met with some spirited opposition fiom a certain number of homeopathic physicians inl the State. A class of twentyfour attended the lectures, but as they were all first year students.
none were prepared to graduate at the end of the term. There
was howeveer, a good es/r-it de corps/ among the students, and
now that the Faculty has been enlarged, the prospect for the
School seems satisfactory.
Though it had been feared and predicted by many that the
establishment of the Hlom(iopathic Medical College would cause
a great reduction in the number of students in the Department of
Medicine and Surgery, (the old Medical College), yet three hundred and twelve were actually in attendance. While this is a
somewhat smaller number than the average for several years past,
it is almost exactly the same as the number in attendance in
I872-3. It is prol)able, however, that some were induced to go
elsewhere on account of the founding of the Hom(eopathic College. Diligent, and I mist be permitted to say, discourteous
efforts were several times made by interested persons to breed
(lisaflection atmong our students, and to fi-ighten them away from
here, under the warning that their time of study here would not
2




64


be recognized at other schools, and that, if they graduated, their
diplomas would not be accepted by the profession. These
attempts to interfere with us failed of their end, and a class of
about the usual size was graduated.
Much interest was very properly felt in our second year's
trial of examinations for admission to the Medical School. since
no other school in the country had yet ventured to take this slight
step towards raising the grade of medical education.*  We have
been somewhat criticised, and singularly enough, by fiiends of
schools which hold no examinations for entrance, because our
examination papers were not more difficult. But easy as they
were, making only a demand for a decent English education, they
were severe enough to exclude several applicants, who, however,
found no difficulty in gaining imme(liate admission to other
schools. We shall continue to elevate the standard of examination just as rapidly as the diffiisionl of education among the class,
which fuirnishes medical students and the co-operation of other
schools will warrant.
Owing to various unforeseen delays, our new Hospital Buildlings were not completed in time for occupancy last year. This
was a sericus disappointment.  3ut we are now to enjoy the
advantages, which they will offer, for clinical teaching. This
will be a most valuable addition to our means of instruction.
The buildings are so tasteful that they enhance the beauty' of our
grounds.
A considerable number of the medical profession have seen
fit to indulge in very sharp criticisms of our Medical Faculty. the
Regents and the Legislature, because students in the H-Iomoiopathic College are allowed to attend lectures in the old Medical
School. I do not refer to this fact for the sake of discussing the
position of these critics. btt simnply for the purpose of reminding
vou that these unpleasant attacks have not driven our Professors
from their posts. In these most trying circumstances they have
been faithful to the University, and are deserving of all commendation for their devotion to her interests. \We have abundant and

65


most gratifying proofs that the attacks which have been so fieely
made on us for our plan of furnlishing medical education to students of two schools, have not diminished the respect and esteem
in which the University is held by the citizens of this and other
States.
The ILaw School has had a very prosperous year. Its hold
upon the publlic seems to be deep and strong. Professor C. I.
\Walker, who had at our request held his resignation in abeyance
for a year, was compelled by the pressure of his professional business to ask a permanent release from the duties of the chair which
he had so lolg and so ably filled. \We have been fortunate
enough to secure as his successor, \Villiam P. Wells, Esq., who
has so acceptably occupiel the chair during the absence of Professor Walker.
The School of Pharmacy in its prosperity continues to make
larger and larger demands especially upon the Professors and
Instructors in Chemistry and Botany. In my opinion a larger
force is now required for the proper instruction of our various
classes in Chemistry. To a greater extent than is now possible.
tle instruction of the College class and of the Pharlmacy class in
Chemistry, should be separated. The graduating class in the
Pharmacy School, in June, numbered thirty-one.
The Librarian's report shows that there have been added to
the Iibrary during the past year by purchase 332 volumes and
S pamphlets, by gift IS2 volumes and 131 pamphlets, and by
binding Io7 volumes. Total increase, 621 volumes and 139
pamphlets.
We are suffering a two-fold inconvenience. In the first place
we are not able to supply by purchase more than a tenth of the
books we most urgently need to purchase every year. In the
second place our Library room is too small for the proper accommodation either of our books or of our readers. The Regents
have directed a plan of a new building to be prepared, thougl
private munificence, or public appropriation must furnish the
means for erecting the building. If we are to have a great and
flourishing University here, we must have a great Library.
()Our Museum continues to grow with a good degree of rapid



66


it'. The most valuable additions this year, have been those from
the collections Prof. Steere made il Formosa and the Philippines. He has taken a portion of his collections to London to
identify and name them. He finds that he has many new species
of birds. The books of the Museum give the following figures:
Added Lduring the year, zoology; general donations, 325 species,
1,300 specimens. Prof. Steere's collection 23,900. Botany, general donations, 4,000 species, 6,ooo specimens. PIof. Steere's collection, 2,506 specimens. Archaeology; general donations, 14.
The entire number of specimens in our Museum is nearly 255,000.
If the whole of the collection, which Prof. Steere has brought
home, relmains permanently with us, it is clear tha-t we must have
more spacious quarters for our Museum. We are already straitened for roomn. Our collections have already become so numerous that thev naturalll attract gifts. We are constantlv receiving
valuable donations. Persons, who wish to bestow choice specimens on some institution, generally prefer to add them to a choice
collection. Since, also, we tmake it our constant study to increase
our supply of illustrative scientific speeimens, we may reasonably
hope for a contiLous and;rapid lgrowth of our Museum. WVe
must provide for such a growth. I think we have already reached
the point where a new and conmmodious building for the storing of
our collections, and( perhaps for furnishing us a few more lecture
rooms for classes in Science, a physical laboratory, and liarge
working rooms for the instruction iln mining and in architecture,
is a real and pressing need. \Vhether sucll a building or a new
Library 1 building is most needed, it might be ditficult to say. Bult
it is not easy to see how we can long d(o our work with efficiency,
unless we have them both. At your last meeting, you directed
the Professor of Architecture to prepare a plan of an edifice suitable for both purposes. Reflection has brought me to the conclusion that it will be better to erect separate buildings for the Library and the Museum. To the Library a wing might be added for
the Art Gallery. If for no other reason. I should recoimmend the
separation of the lMuseum fi-om the Library as a precaution
against fire. But our fiiends everywhere should understand the
serious incol)nveience wve are sutflring foir the lack of both )build



67


ings. If the present IMuseum is vacated, it will supply us wXith
additional recitation rooms, for the want of which we are now, at
times, sonmewhat embarrassed.
Prof. Frieze has this year kindly given himself the trouble to
prepare and print a new and instructive catalogu-e of the collections in the Art gallery. It was a long and laborious task to edit
the work with the critical care which he gave to it. This catalogue greatly enhances the value of the collections to all visitors.
At the request of the Centennial Commission fiom Michigan
and of Governor Bagley, we sent to the Centennial Exhibition at
Philadelphia, the following articles to form part of the educational
exhibit of Michigan: A volume containing the last Triennial
Catalogue, the last Annual Calendar, and a very succinct and
interesting Historical Sketch of the University, whicl, at my
request, Prof. C. K. Adams lhad the kindness to write, and Prof.
Frieze's catalogue of the Museum of Art and History. A voltime containing Photographs of oulr IBuildings. A volume of

()ur income barely suffices to meet the pressing demands made
))y our large andl varied work. It is olly by denying ourselves
help whlich we greatly nleed both in teachers and in means of
illustrationsl that we are able to get on. When the Act granting
us the one-twentieth miill tax was passed, we hoped that at
the re-appraisal of the taxable property of the State in IS76, an

The following report, in relation to the School of Mines, was presented by the President, and on motion, it was ordered to be printed in
the minutes:
To the President of te/i University:
DEAR SIR:-In view of the approaching     meeting of the
Board of Regents, I beg leave to submit the following report
and suggstiotns in relation to the School of Mines,




The amount of the special fund provided by the last Legislature for the equipment of the School, exclusive of salaries, was
five thousand dollars.  One-t.hird of this sum was set aside at the
June meeting of the Board for the use of the Departmlent of
Architecture and Design.    The remainder, with the exception of
a small balance of less than seventy-five dollars, hardly sufficient
to cover the necessary incidental outlays of the current year. has
been expended under the direction of the Professors of Metallurgy and Mining Engineering.        The statement below     shows in
round numbers how     much has been used for the different purposes specified.
Cost of material and labor in fitting up metallurgical laboratory $42 oo0
Melting  furnaces, forge  and  settings........................................  650  oo
Assay  furnaces, tools, apparatus.  and  stock..............................  425  oo

Freight  and  express  bills.......................................................   (X)
Printing, advertising,  and  traveling  expenses.....................1......  Io  (X
Total....................3,26 (X)
Nothing further can be added to the equipme   nt of the school.
without aid fioml the Legislature or fiom some other source.
In the metallurgical laboratory as now equipped, there are
goo(l facilities for giving instruction in Assaying, but for the illustration of more extensive operations and the important methods
employed il actual practice, other appliances will be needed.    A
reverberatory fiurnace and a small blast furnace ought to be
erected at an earlv day.
The ores of gold, silver, and leIad, with which the laboratory
has been stocked, were obtained inl part froml the WVvandotte
Silver Works, and in part througll tlle kind assistance of Mr. A.
1. Wood. of Ann Arbor, froml      Colorado.   They are mostly of




7()


high graide, and are Well adapted for the use of students beginning the subject of Assaing.  The pice  paid for them was
simlply their market value, reference being had solely to the
amount of metal contained. as shown by the assays. The laboratory n(ow needs a supply of ores of lower grade. and large quantities of copper rock and iron ores from Lake Superior and other
mineral regions. The chief item of cost of such ores will be the
transportation fromn the mines.
The value of this laboratory to the University is not to be
estimated by the numnber of students entered upon the annual
calendar under the head of Mining Engineering. The courses in
I)eterminative Mineralog  Blogy  ow-pipe Analysis. and Assayilg,
have proved attractive to students, whose principal work was in
other departments, and there will undolubtedly bIe in the future a
large niumber each year of special students, wvho wish to obtain
a knowledge of Mineralogy. or Assaying, witlout being able to
spend the time necessary for a complete course of study. It seems
to be a good policy for the School of Mines to encourage such
students, as farI as it can be (lone without detriment to the work
of regular classes.
In connection with the laboratory a beginning has been made
towar(l the formation of a metallurgic and industrial cabinet.
Through,Mr. C.. \Vells, of Bay City, a collection of iron ores
and products, comprising one hundred specimens, has been secured for this cabinet froml Cincinnati, and Mr. D. T. McDonald,
of Calumlet, has sent a set of sixteen specimens of copper and
silver ores from Lake Superior..  Messrs. Rhodes & Co., of
Cleveland. have expresse(d a willingness to place at the disposal
of the University tleir valuable collection of iron ores and manufactured products, now on exhibition at Philadelphia. Mr. S.
W. Baird, of Cincinnati, agent of the Selma, Rome and Dalton
Railroad, has also generously offered to give to the University a
collection of mineral specimens, selected from the exhibit made
by that road at the Centennial exhibition, at no expense to us but
the fieight. This offer has been accepted, and correspondence
has been opened with other exhibitors, with good prospects of
receiving other contributions similar in kind. A set of forty-two




71


samples, to illustrate the method of separating the metallic copper
from the enclosing rock, was collected by myself at the Atlantic
Mill, near Hloughton, last June, and will be ready for exhibition
as soon as the proper bottles for it are received. For this collection the thanks of the school are really due to Mr. W. J. Evans,
superintendent of the mill, who freely granted me every desired
facility, and spent himself the greater part of one day in the work
of collecting.  From Mr. A. J. Corey, Superintendent of the
Quincy Mine, I also obtained a diamond drill core, illustrating
the character of the country rock.
The mineral collection purchased for the use of the students,
comprises between 675 and 700 specimens. It is at present kept
in drawers in the room adjoining the geological lecture room,
where it is easy of access whenever wanted. A few of the glass
crystal models imported from Germany a year ago, were injured
in transportation. It will be desirable to replace these with new
ones, and to purchase about fifty models in addition to what we
now have. The number of wooden models can also be increased
to advantage.
For the illustration of lectures to be given in Geology, Mining, and Metallurgy, walldiagrams in considerable quantity will
have to be provided.  The most satisfactory way of supplying
our needs in this direction will be by employing a competent
draughtsman upon the work for two or three months, or longer
if necessary. Models of furnaces and of such mining machinery
as cannot be sufficiently well illustrated by diagrams will also be
needed.
The model of the stamp mill of the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co., presented by the Company, will be of great use to
us. The gift is as timely as it is munificent.
The general library, as is well known, is poor in the literature of mining and metallurgy; and the small annual allowance
from the library fund is insufficient to supply the deficiencies.
It is hoped that the next legislature will appropriate a generous
sum, to be available for the purchase of books.
The distance of the University from the mining regions of
the country is so great that it will not be practicable to arrange
3




72


for very frequent excursions to places where works of the kind
described in the text-books and lectures are to be seen in actual
operation. In place of such excursions, which might be made
extremely profitable to the students, it is recommended that
portions of the long vacation be regularly devoted to field instruction. Summer schools could be established at such places as
Marquette, Ishpeming, or Htoughton —at different places in different years-where the students, under the guidance of the professor
or other instructor, could acquire an insight into the methods of
actual practice. A portion of the time could be spent in visiting the mines, mills, and fi-naces of the neighborhood, and(
the remainder in arranging notes, collecting specimens, and
preparing a detailed report upon the work of the season. The
chief objection to such a schene will doubtless be the expense,
and the objection is in truth a serious one. Still, in consideration
of the positive advantages to be gained, it seems worth while
to make the suggestion at this time, in the hope that some means
may be devised for carrying it into effect.
No large sum would be required for the general expense of
such a school. It is the increased personal outlay. both in the case
of student and of instructors, for which provision would have to be
made. If there were a permanent fund. created by voluntary
subscription, or by an act of the Legislature, the income of which
could be used. under the direction of the Board of Regents, for
paying a portion of the extra expenses incurred by meritorious
students, the remaining difficulties could be easily overcome.
During the past ye;.r there has beellconsiderable discussion,
both in public and private, among the leading civil and mining
engineers of the country, upon the subject of technical education.
The discussion has not yet led to the adoption of any definite
plan of action, but there is one point upon which there has been
great unanimity of opinion; and that is, the undesirability of
conferring upon young men, at the time of their graduation, the
degrees of Civil Engineer and of Mining Engineer. The reasons for this opinion are not difficult to understand;l but whether
it would be a wise policy foi this University to make any change
in the style of degree, which it confers, is a question of a com



73


plicated character, but it is a question liable to be called up for
discussion at an early day.

The following communication from the Professors and Instructors in
Pharmacy was presented and read by Regent Climie:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. }
December 22, IS76.
To the Honorable Boarcd of o crenzts:
The undersigned, the officers of instruction in the course in Pharmacy, respectfully recommend that this course, viz: the provisions for the
instruction given under the requirements for the degree of Pharmaceutical Chemist, be constituted a separate branch or department of the University, under the name of The School of Pharmacy.
Our recommendation scems to be supported by the following considerations. The course in Pharmacy is a technical one, throughout. As
such it is not parallel wi,h any course in the literary department, and its
inclusion in this department has been only nominal. It is separated from
other departments by the professional purpose of its work in the University and by its relations to those who supply its students and employ its
graduates. Nearly all the required work of the Pharmacy classes is conducted with them separately, as shown by accompanying statement A,
this separation being demanded by the size of the classes as well as by a
due application of the sciences taught. The permanence of the school
seems to be assured by the steadily increa ing support given it, as nted
in statement B. The officers who now give instruction to undergraduates
in pharmacy are named in statement C.
SILAS H. DOUGLAS,
ALBERT B. PRESCOTT.
G. E. FROTIIINGHAM,
VIM. H. PETTEE.
JOHN W. LANGLEY,
VOLNEY M. SPAULDING.
STATEMENT A.
The work required for the degree of Pharmaceutical Chemist (see
University Calendar) consists of work in classes separate for students of
the first and second years, and work in the chemical and m-icroscopical
laboratories. The work in classes is as follows:
IN FIRST YEAR.
I. Chem. Physics and Inor. Chem., lectures; with Medical Department.
Chem. Physics and Inor. Chern., recitations: separately.
2. Analyt. Chem., Qial.; separately.
3. Pharmacy; separately.
4. Botany; separately.
5. Analytical Chem., Quant. separately.
IN SECOND YEAR.
I. Phar. Botany: separately.
2. Crystallography; separately.
3. Materia Medica; with Medical Department.
4. Organic Chemistry and Pharmacy; separately.
5. Texicology and Anal. Urine; separately.
(It is very desirable that the instruction in Materia Medica should be
given separately and differently to students in pharmacy. The reasons
for so doing were mentioned in the final report of the previous Profess;or
in that brlnch, Dr. Che-ver.)

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, }
December 29, IS76. 
The Board of Regents reassembled in the room of the President at 2
o'clock p. M.
Present: A full Board.
On motion of Regent E. C. Walker the Board went into executive
session, at the close of which the business of an open session was resumed.
Professor A. B. Palmer being present was granted permission to submit and read the following resolutions and report of the Medical Faculty.
which were accepted and ordered to be printed in the minutes:
At a Faculty meeting of the College of Medicine and Surgery of the
University of Michigan, held December IS, I876, the following resolutions were passed:
Resolved, That this Faculty recommend to the Board of Regents to
open negotiations with the society of the " Sisters of Charity" for the
lease of the University Hospital for a term of years.
Carried unanimously.
Resolved, That in the opinion of this Faculty the time has come
when the course of instruction in this department should be extended to
the full college year of nine months.
Carried with one dissenting vote.
It will be remembered that this is a reiteration of resolutions passed
on several former occasions, years ago, but the request has hitherto been
answered by the Board by the statement that the condition of the finances of the University would not justify the increased expenditure.
Whether such objection has been removed, the Board will judge.
There can be little doubt but that the number of students would
be diminished, for some years at least, though it is hoped that ultimately
such diminution would not occur: but whether at the present time, with
other causes of diminished numbers continuing, such extension would be
judicious, will, of course be a matter for the Board carefully to weigh.
With the increase of subjects embraced in a curriculum of a full
course of medical instruction, with the amount of practical work in the
Anatomical, Chemical, and Physiological laboratories so imperatively
demanded, no one acquainted with the subject can for a moment doubt
the great desirableness of the extension of the course suggested by the
resolution.
A. B. PALMER, Dean.

The following resolution, submitted  by Regent Rynd, was
adopted:
Resolved, That the degree of Doctor of Medicine be and hereby is
conferred upon the candidates named in the communication just received
from the Dean of the Medical Faculty, as recommended.
Regent Rynd submitted the following preamble and resolution:
WHEREAS, Certain charges have been made by Dr. Rockwith, a lecturer in the Homoeopathic Medical College, personally, and through the
Dean of that Department, against Professors Maclean and Frothingham,
therefore,
Resolved, That the Homoeopathic Faculty, or any nembnbr thereof
be invited to present such charges in writing at 2 p. M. this day.
The resolution was adopted.
The annual report of the Department of Medicine and Surgery was presented and read by the Dean of the Medical Faculty.
as follows:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. 
Ann Arbor, March 27, 1877. s
To the Honorable, the UBoardt  f oRe fents of tlhe Unizversif of Mic/hig-an 
The Faculty of the College of Medicine and Surgery, in presenting
this annual report beg leave to say that the course of instruction in their
Department just closed, has been conducted in the usual manner, and, so
far as the qualifications 'of the candidates for gralduation are concerned,
with more than the usual success.




- 87 -
Although the standard for graduation has been gradually raised, and
is higher this year than ever before, yet the number failing to reach that
standard has diminished, and never has a class left the college so fully
instructed in what the Faculty believe to be the truth, in opposition to
what they regard as false systems; and never was a class so fully and universally impressed with the errors and absurdities of such systems as the
present.
It has been a source of much satisfaction to the Faculty that the
attention, application and order of the class in the College have been
excellent, and so far as the conditions for graduation of those who have
been more particularly under our observation, are concerned, not a single instance of dereliction of duty, even in the smallest degree, has been
observed.
Improvement in the ventilation of the lecture rooms, which was
urged in the last annual report, has been effected to a fair degree of satisfaction at a trifling expense, and at a further moderate expense entirely
within the limits of the contingent appropriation made for that purpose,
should the size of the class or the condition of the weather render it necessary, the warming and ventilation nma be still farther improved, and
made nearly perfect.
The Faculty would again call attention to the subject of the
lengthening of the term of instruction to the full college year, and would
further say that from statements and intimations from various soul-cesfrom resolutions of Medical Societies, from a report of a legislative committee, and fiomn the expressions of students, the plan seems to me t with
general favor. That it would enable the Faculty to give a much more
complete course of instruction, and to require and effect a higher degree
of professional culture in candidates for the honors of the University and
the responsible duties of the profession, there can be no doubt, the only
objection being the possible diminution of students, and the increased
pecuniary expenditure which it would involve.
The Faculty would earnestly call the attention of the Regents to the
condition and future management of the hospital. The State has undertaken to establish a hospital, not for the benefit of the University alone.
but for the suffering and unfortunate of the State as well, and has placed
it in the care of the Regents; but it requires means to conduct such an
institution successfully, and unless such means are from some source provided in greater abundance than hitherto, failure rather than success
must be the consequence.
A further and more detailed report on the subject from a committee
of the Faculty appointed for that purpose, is herewith submitted.
The wants of a physiological laboratory, and the necessity of making
provision for a permanent professor for that important branch of science




-88 -have already occupied the attention of the Board of Regents and the Legislature, and it is hoped that men and means for the establishment and
support of this indispensable department will be furnished.
The Faculty would also ask attention to the desirability of increasing
the force for giving instruction in the dissecting room. As now constituted, the Demonstrator of Anatomy is charged with the duty of procuring the supplies of material for the use of students, and of superintending their work during the study of the same by dissecting.
Here during four or five months, are from one hundred to one hundred and fifty persons engaged in this appropriate work from three to four
hours in the afternoon. It is obviously impossible if he had no other
duty, for one man to do justice to such a number of students; aud it has
been the practice to secure the aid of some of the better qualified students
to go about from class to class in the dissecting room, giving instruction.
This volunteer service, though useful, is by no means what the students
ought to have, for they need skilled instruction, as it seems to us, just as
much as the workers in the Laboratory; and it is obvious that for the
most successful work, and the best good of the students, we need men
who can give their time and attention wholly to the work, for a compensation which shall secure persons competent for the position.
We believe that two men who have graduated, and who desire to go
beyond the requiremeuts of graduation in the study of anatomy, may be
iuduced to come here for the winter and give their services to the Univerty, having a partial equivalent in recognition in the calendar as Assistant Demonstrators.
If these can be obtained, it might and should be a part of their duty
to increase the permanent means of instruction by additions to the
museum of such interesting specimens as are now often lost for want of
of some one whose duty is to make them available.
Such assistants should also as a part of their duty, render aid to the
Professor of Anatomy, who for more than twenty years has made all his
own preparations for illustrating his lectures-for the Demonstrator renders him no aid whatever. He is no longer a young man with unlimited
powers of endurance, and such aid as a qualified assistant could render,
would increase the facilities for illustrating important regions often
requiring more labor than one man can at ithe time bestow. In no other
college known to us is such preparatory labor performed by the Professor
of Anatomy alone. A competent man could also render valuable assistance to students by examinations.
We believe that $500 a year would secure the services indicated, and
therefore ask that the Faculty be authorized to select from the graduates
such qualified persons as give promise of accomplishing the objects
sought, to be paid $250 a year each, for their service during the six




-89 -months of the session; that time being all that is suitable for the prosecution of this.work.
Respectfnlly submitted,
A. B. PALMER, Dean.
The following report relative to " The Hospital, its Condition
and Future Needs," was received and read by Professor D. Maclean, of the Medical Faculty of the Department of Medicine and
Surgery:
To the Honorable the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN: The undersigned, committee of the Medical Faculty,
desire to approach your honorable body for the purpose of calling your
attention to the urgent necessity which exists for placing the University
hospital upon a different footing in the future.
The conditions upon which this institution has hitherto been conducted have been such that the result could not be otherwise than
unsatisfactory to the patients, humiliating to the Faculty, and discreditable to the University. In view of the inestimable importance of practical
instruction, such as can only be acquired from living cases, the Medical
Faculty have made persistent efforts to build up a clinical department,
and the hospital ever since its inception has been the object of their
warmest solicitude. For years the want of adequate facilities and material for clinical instruction constituted the only plausible objection which
the opponents of the medical school were able to urge against it.
It is therefore matter of sincere gratification that, notwithstanding
the comparatively inadequate hospital accommodations and equipment
furnished by the University, our enemies can no longer reproach us with
want of material for practical illustration of the treatment of patients.
The number, variety and importance of the cases treated before the
students has rapidly increased from year to year, and for several years
past all the essential requirements of a fundamental medical education
have been fully met so far as clinical material is concerned.
This committee are decidedly of the opinion that the time has
come when justice to all concerned demands that one or other of the two
following alternatives should be adopted, viz: either the University hospital must be placed upon a respectable footing, or it must be closed and
the public informed of the fact.
Very little argument is necessary to demonstrate that the former
alternative is the one which should, if possible, be adopted. During the
session just closed, upwards of six hundred patients have been treated at
the University clinique, fully one-half of whom declined to avail themselves of the rather uninviting accommodations provided at the hospital.
Of these patients the great majority belonged to the surgical or the oph



- 9()

thalmological department, and with very few exceptions left here either
completely cured or very greatly relieved.  The benefit thus afforded
directly is very apparent, and may be estimated, but it must not be forgotten that these cases were treated in the presence of nearly four hundred students of medicine, through whom indirectly an amount of benefit is afforded to the public which it is practically impossible to estimate.
The closure of the hospital would inevitably give a most serious check to
the current of patients which now flows annually in this direction, and
which is of the utmost importance to the welfare and usefulness of the
Medical Department.
Through the generosity of the last Legislature supplemented by that
of the people of Ann Arbor, a very suitable building for a hospital has
been provided, and now in order that the benefits of t'lis generosity may
be realized, it is only necessary that a small annual appropriation be
made by which the ordinary and unavoidable running expenses of the
hospital shall be provided for.
The following is a carefilly considered estimate founded on past
experiences, of the indispensable requirements:
Fuel and lighting,......     $oo 0
Supplies,........  300 oo
Medicines,....      200 oo
$I,00O oo
Salary of two nurses, one male and one tfemale.          $400 oo
"   one Steward,......       00 oo 
House Surgeon,...                 250 00
$I,I50 oo
The undersigned would further respectfully suggest that the usefulness of the State University hospital might be very materially enlarged,
if arrangements could be made for the transportation to and maintenance in it of such cases as are to be found in every county house in the
State, and which admit of successful treatment with the aid of hospital
appliances, and which for the want of such appliances are permitted to
languish and to die unrelieved, thereby inflicting a serious loss upon the
State. For the treatment of all such cases the members of the hospital
staff are perfectly willing to give their services without additional remuneration.
By this plan would much human suffering be relieved, and at the
same time a very material saving to the State be secured;
The undersigned in conclusion respectfully ask that so much of this
memorial as shall be deemed in your opinion proper, shall bc forwarded




-91
with the endorsement of your honorable body to the honorable the Legislature now in session.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
DONALD MACLEAN, M. D.,

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
Wednesday, March 28, I877. 7
The Board of Regents reassembled in the room of the President at 8i o'clock A. M.
Present: The President; Regents Rynd, E. C. Walker,
Climie, Cutcheon, S. S. Walker, and Collier.
Regent Rynd submitted the following resolution, which was

Resolved, That the Board of Regents appreciating the faithful services of John Franklin Curry, M. D., who has had charge of the Hospital
during the term now ending, are pained to learn of his recent demise
after a short illness, and hereby extend their sympathy to his afflicted

Rcsolved, That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the family
signed by the President and Secretary of this Board.
The following report was presented and read by Regent
Rynd, chairman of the Committee of the Medical Department:
REPORT OF THE REGENTS' COMMITTEE ON THE MEDICAL
DEPARTMENT.
Your Committee on the Medical Department, to whom were referred
the report of the Dean of the Faculty of the Department of Medicine and
Surgery, the report of a committee of that Faculty, and various other
papers relating to the Department, would respectfully report that careful
attention has been given by them to all matters to which such reports
and papers relate, and they herewith submit the unanimous opinion of
the Committee relating thereto.




-97 —


The first point to which your attention is called is the fact that
PRELIMINARY EXAMINATIONS
are enforced in every instance, and with eminently satisfactory results.
This is shown in the superior qualifications of the present graduating
class. It is hoped that the standard will in every respect be gradually
raised, and that, as the science of medicine advance>, the Medical Department will occupy the front rank in furnishing
MEDICAL INSTRUCTION,
thus giving reputation to the University, doing honor to the State, and
accomplishing more perfectly the work of relieving human suffering.
With the object of inaking this Department of the University still more
useful and efficient, and with the specific purpose of systematizing its
enlarged and constantly enlarging course of study, your committee earn
estly recommend the inauguration of a
FULL NINE MONTHS' COURSE OF LECTURES,
beginning on the first of October next, embodying all the latest researches in Medicine and the collateral sciences, and securing extended clinical
advantages.  The scheme of such extended course, properly graded,
should be matured by the Faculties, and reported to the Board for adoption at the June meeting. This will, in justice to the eminent gentlemen
who are engaged in the work of teaching medicine, involve an additional
expenditure, which we trust the Legislature will furnish.
It is more than probable that such extension will somewhat reduce the
size of the medical classes, while it will materially improve their
quality. Any reduction of our numbers will, of course, cut down our resources. We cannot doubt that the Legislature will second our earnest
determination to make this Department worthy of the University and of
the State, and will furnish aid to meet any reduction of resources which
may occur from this important advance in medical education. Our object
is to give to the people the best possible quality, rather than a large quantity, and in this we anticipate the co-operation of all intelligent people.
In this connection we desire to call the attention of the Board to the
following resolution which was unanimously passed by the alumni of
the Medical Department, composed of many representative men in the
profession, from many parts of the State, last evening:
WHEREAS, The Regents and faculty have repeatedly committed themselves to the policy of advancing the standard of medical education in
the University,
Resolved, That the Alumni Association most heartily approve of the
proposal now before the Board of Regents to extend the lecture term in
the Department of Medicine and Surgery to nine months.
P. B. ROSE, Secretary.
This meeting was largely attended, and its action is an indication of a




-98 -growing tendency on the part of the medical profession to fit itself more
fully and perfectly for the noble work of a humane profession. It will be
seen that the extension will involve one-third more labor than is now
performed, and in justice to the members of the Faculties provision
should be made for the increased labor. This will of course be contin.
gent upon the action of the Legislature.
A PHYSIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,
including the teaching of Histology, is not simply important, but absolutely necessary.  The science of medicine and the interests of the
afflicted alike demand such an addition to our present means of instruction. The best colleges of the country have such facilities. It will be
equally important for students of both schools. Twenty-five hundred
dollars will, with economy, cover the expense the first year, and a thousand dollars per annum will meet the subsequent expense. It is respectfully urged that the Legislature afford us the necessary aid. Under our
present arrangements no duplicating of this department will be necessary.
This department of science contemplates the study of the various tissues and component parts of the
HUMAN BODY,
and must be understood by our students as the ground-work of a correct
knowledge of the various forms of diseased action. The result will be
much more than commensurate with the small allowance solicited.
ADDITIONAL AID IN THE DISSECTING ROOM.
Your committee have carefully considered the report of the Faculty
relating to this subject  While there can be no difference of opinion
touching the importance of the recommendation made, yet in the present
hampered condition of our finances, it were manifestly unwise to make
any expenditure in the direction indicated. Unless, therefore, the legisture will furnish us aid for the purpose of the more t;orough study of
practical anatomy-a science fundamental to a thorough knowledge of
medicine and surgery, and equally important to both schools of medicine
now existing in connection with the University-the idea of expending
any money for such purpose must for the present be abandoned.
If, however, any arrangement can be made by the medical faculty
which will secure the services of two suitable young men, without
expense, who shall be duly and officially recognized as assistants in such
work, your committee recommend your approval of such contemplated
action.
THE HOSPITAL,
is doing a work quite as important for clinical medicine as that which is




- 99 -


being performed by the Laboratory in the interests of chemical and pharmaceutical science.  Duiing the college year now ending, there have
been treated in the
Surgical Department,.....     90
Ophthalmological,... 122
Practical Medicine,.....     29
Diseases of Women,......   3
244
In addition to this about 350 persons have been examined before the
class, their cases have been explained to the students, and other necessary attention to them has been furnished gratuitously.
This is the largest number which has ever been presented for treatment in a single term in the history of the Medical Department.
Many of the operations performed have been of the most important
character, and such as could not well be done at the homes of the
patients; over thirty cases of persons blind from cataract have been successfully operated upon; the interests of the suffering have been thus
guaranteed by the advanced professional science of the time in which we
live, and the Department has not only accomplished well the work of
communicating medical instruction to from 270 to 450 students every
year, but has also proved its right to live because of the incalculable benefits conferred upon the diseased; making hundred of lives which were
otherwise dependent on the charity of the public for support, useful;
saving many from a premature grave, and giving comfort and joy to
many a sorrowing home.
Dr. Frothingham alone has, during his connection with the Medical
Department, operated upon more than 250 cases of cataract. We are
pleased to add that the result has been in almost every case eminently
successful; sight has been restored to the blind; instances of failure have
been very exceptional.
During the college year of '75 and '76 about 450 persons received the
benefits of clinical instruction.
Your committee regret to say that the hospital cannot possibly be
continued unless aid be furnished for the proper and imperative work of
the institution. A suitable person cannot be found to take charge of
this humane interest without some remuneration; we can no longer ask
the afflicted to come to us for care and treatment unless nurses be provided; certain essential improvements are imperatively needed; money
is required, and there is no fund from which we are permitted to draw a
dollar. The hospital can no more sustain itself without aid than can
the Insane Asylum, or any other of our noble public charities, which are
so generously supported by a humane and philanthropic people.
Your committee have no knowledge of any expressed desire of the




- 100 -


HIomoeopathic Faculty to occupy for clinical work, a portion of the present Hospital buildings. Had such desire been communicated to us, we
would not have hesitated for a moment in giving our sanction to the use
of a portion of that institution. Indeed we distinctly understood from
the President of the State Homoeopathic Society, in his official capacity,
while addressing your honorable Board, that the Homoeopathists had no
desire to occupy the hospital in connection with the other school.
We understood him as stating distinctly that they did not wish a place
in the buildings now erected. Now understanding, however, that the
Homoeopathic branch of the profession desire to engage in clinical work,
(although no request has been made to us), we cheerfully grant them the
use of such portion of the present Hospital as they may require, in accordance with the terms of the following resolution offered by Regent Cutcheon, referred to us, and to which we desire your assent:
Resolved, That a portion of the University Hospital be set apart and
placed under the direction and control of the Faculty of the Homoeopathic College, to which section or ward of the Hospital shall be committed for treatment all such patients as shall elect that system of treatment: Provided, That such section or ward of the Hospital shall be
subject to the same restrictions and regulations as to registration of cases,
treatment and results, and in all other respects, that the other portions of
said Hospital are subject to.
This will involve at least the expense of an additional nurse for nine
months in the year. In view of the extra expense of maintaining the
Hospital for nine months (instead of six); the extending of its work by
the Medical Department; the affording its facilities to the Homoeopathic
College: the absolute need of nurses, servants, fuel, lights, and other
incidentals, your committee, with much earnestness, ask that this Board
respectfully solicit from the Legislature a sum of not less than $2,000 per
annum. No other institution in the State will give so good returns on so
small an investment.
Failing in securing the necessary aid the gratuitous work of our professors in the Hospital must cease; nor can we receive the afflicted when
no provision exists for properly taking care of them.

Climie, Cutcheon, S. S. Walker, and Collier.
A communication was received from F. A. Rockwith, M.. D.,
preferring charges of unprofessional conduct against Professor
Maclean, which, on motion, was referred to the Executive Committee.
By request of Regent E. C. Walker the business of the meeting was suspended toenable the Executive Committee to withdraw,
consider, and report forthwith upon the subject matter contained
in the communication of Dr. F. A. Rockwith. The comlnmittee
having retired, carefilly examined the subject under considera



- 103


tion, and on resumingl their seats Regent E. C. Walker stated
that it was the opinion of the Committee that the charge of
" unprofessional conduct" was one of veracity simply, and that
the committee deemed it unwise for the Board under existing
existing circumstances to give the subject further consideration.
He therefore moved that the whole matter lie on the table.
The motion prevailed.
The following resolutions were submitted by Regent E. C.
Walker, and on motion of Regent S. S. Walker, were unanimouslv adopted:
Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan
heard with great regret of the death of Hon. Elon Farnsworth, of
Detroit. He was one of the founders of this now great University, one
of the few men to whom this State owes more than it can appreciate or
repay, from the wisdom and carefulness with which they laid broad and
deep the foundations of the first successful State University of our country. He was an active and influential Regent, both ex officio as Chancellor of the State, and also for many years by appointment.  His care.
judgment, thorough culture and extended reading were influential in
the formative period of the institution. His monument is about us to.
day.
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions, signed by the President
and the Secretary, be furnished the family.
Regent Cutcheon in behalf of the Executive Committee of the
Board of Regents, submitted the following preamble and resolution, to-wit:

defendants;
AND WHEREAS, The bill of complaint in said cause is framed upon
the theory of the report made to this Board at the June meeting, 1876,
that all the so-called laboratory receipts were and are in the hands of said
Rose;
AND WHEREAS, Subsequent events seem to require a modification of
said bill in chancery, therefore,
Resolved, That it is the sense of this Board, and the solicitor of this
Board is hereby instructed that it is the wish of the Board that said bill
of complaint be so amended as to put the said defendants Rose and
Douglas upon an exact equality of footing as defendants in said suit,




104 -both in the allegations of the stating and charging part of said bill, and
in the prayer of said bill, to the end that a full and complete accounting
may be had with each of said defendants, as to any and all moneys whatsoever that may remain in the hands of either of them, whether as deposits, laboratory receipts or otherwise.

GENTLEMEN: The undersigned members of the Legislature of the
State of Michigan, having heard the report made by your honorable conimittee concerning the defalcation in the laboratory of said University,




- 109 -and after having carefully considered the same. and the subject matter
thereof, we are clearly of the opinion that said report is a just, faithful,
and reliable statement of the facts in connection with said defalcation,
and that the conclusions you have therein arrived at are the correct ones,
and are fully sustained by the facts.
And believing further that any money expended in the prosecution
of Dr. Rose is not only a useless expenditure of the people's money, but
is; an expenditure for an unjust prosecution, if not indeed a persecution
of an innocent man. And that it is due to the State;is well a.s to the individual that no stain shall be suffered unjustly to remain upon any of its
citizens, therefore we most earnestly solicit your honorable committee to
respectfilly request the Board of Regents of said University to call a
Ineeting of said Board at as early a day as possible and thereat to take
such action that
ist. Said Preston B. Rose be restored to his old position in said
laboratorv.

ANN ARBOR, May I, 1877.
7)o //he BJoard lof f '.'st/.,:
At your present meeting you will probably be asked, among other
thing:s to discontinue the chiancery suit which you have instituted against
Rose and myself for an accounting in respect to the Laboll:ory deficit.
You will be asked to do this on tlle faith of the recent report of the
Lcgislative colnmittee, without any examination or opportunity for examination, by yourselves of the evidence npon which the findings of that
-cport. so radically difierent from those of your own committces, professes to be based. I -sayv without opportunity, because the evidence is but
just publlisl'ed. and there has as vet been no time for its examination.
(f the relort itself it does not becomiie me to speak. That must be
judgedt of for the present by what is apparent upon its face. reading it iil
the light of the fact that the colnonittee persistently refused to allow -any

B,




-  112 -report as this Legislative committee have made; and I have the satisfaction of knowing, inexplicable as thle fact may appear to my traducers,
that it has not been so impaired in the slightest degree. But I am painfully conscious, almost too painfully, to admit of expression, that
this report has injured my good name with that larger public beyond the
limits of my personal acquaintance, who know nothing of me excepl
what this committee have told them, and are wholly uninformled as to the
influences which have culminated in that remarkable document. I am
conscious that to some extent that injury is irreparable.
It would be an easv task to expose the errors, or worse than errors of
that report, both in its findings in regard to the main facts in controversy, and in respect to innumerable matters of detail. But the great volume of the evidence. its peculiarly dry and uninteresting nature r-elating
as it does to innumerable matters of mere detail, renders public criticisml
of it practically unavailing as at means of repelling its aspersions.
What I ask now, and I submit I amn i- ijustice entitled to it, what I
htlve asked before unceasingly, is a judicial ilvestigation and determnination as to who embezzled the laborato-r diefiit.
Sooner or later. in some form or mode of proceeding, that investigation and determination must be had unless vou arc content to lose t!he
embezzled money. The only question is, when, before what tribunal, and
in what form of proceeding.
I ask that this investigation and determinitation shall be hlad at tlhe
earliest moment practicable, in that form of proceeding which is best
adapted to the nature of the subject mnatter to be investigated, and by the
tribunals most competent to arrive at correct cornclusions, anid to do exsct
and equal justice.
This I have a ri-ght to ak, if not to demand at youlr hands.
I respectfully submit that all these ends can be accomplished by the
speedy prosecution to a final hearin  g o the pendin chance-ry sulit aail)st
all who are now defendants on the re.ordl. and they can tbe fully acc<omplished in no other way.
That suit is now pending and in readiness for lherilng inl June. N,
new suit which might be instituteId could probably be broughit to trial or
hearing at so early a period.
The form of that proceedini. I am advised, is the only one knll)\Vl to
our systemn of jurisprudence, which is adapted to the investigation ot such
matters as are here involved. T'his tihe court in which the stit is pending
have already decided. On the demlurrer of s;ome of tlie defendants to
your bill, that court has held that the proper remecdv in such a case ats
this is in equity, and they have so held on the ground tliat there is no
complete and adequate renmedy at law: that the subject mnatter of it is unfit for investigation in an action at law by a jury.




-  13 ---
No one who is not afraid the truth will be brought to light, and justice done, will object to the fitness of the tribunal before which this cause
is pending, or that to which it may be taken by appeal.  The supreme
court is the highest court known to onr laws. It commands, as it deserves
public confidence in the highest degree. On appeal in this suit it will review every finding of the court below in respect to matters of fact as well
as of law, and may bring up and inspect the mass of doca.mentary evidence which must constitute the main basis of any intelligent co.clusion.
Its decision and that alone can now put an end to popular agitation. The
verdicts of juries would probably only tend to increase it.
The request that this chancery suit shall be wholly discontinued is so
unreasonable that it wiil probably be abandoned after a brief struggle.
But vou will be urged with extreme pertinacity to discontinue it as to
Rose and his sureties.
Whether a discontinnance as to these parties can or cannot be reasonably asked for on the faith of the commnittee's report, and without inquirv )y y ourselves, whether having a due regard to the interests of the
University in reclaimingl to its treasury the missing funds, a discontinuance wonld be wise or prildent, are nmatters with which I have no especial
(coincern, and of which I do not propose to speak.
To Im ptcuniiarily, it is of little moment as to whether there is a discontinuance as to R.ose and his sureties or not. If the suit now pending
-.ocs oi( as against me alone to a final decree, that decree will afford me
the same )rotection against all future pecuniary claims as if Rose had
had -remained a party, whatever may be the result of any subsequent suit
against Rose. Beyond the expense it may impose on me of attending
two accoutlti:lg's instead of one. the discontinuance as to Rose will not
aifect nim pcctuniary interest il any nmanner whatever.
But scll interests are to me imatters of secondary importance. What I
clliefly care for now is the vindication of my character from the aspersions
of tlle Leislativte com ittee; and for thisl purpose mainly I desire,:1nd uinless there are stroong' counterbalancing equities in favor of
otlirs. as I thi lk tihere arc not, I lhave a right to ask that when this suit
is bi ougnht to hearing and al accoruntilg is had with respect to this laboratory monICey, all the parties who are interested in charging me with it.
or witl any portion of it. shall be b)efore tie court, and shall be compelled, ori the protection of their own interests to make the stron (est case
they can against me. and to appeal to the court of last resort if tle result
in the circuit courtt is not to themi satisfactorvy that they shall be coinpelled to make their case agaiInst inc then and there, or foriever after hold
their IpeLae. I desire that no door shall be left open for the charge that:anv decree iln 'y favor1 is collusive a charge which, however gr:-undlesswill certainly be i!madte, and in the pres!ent state of the public mind will




-  114 -
gain no little credence if the suit is against mc alone. I wish an end to
this controversy, and in no way except by retaining Rose on the record
do I see any prospect of it being brought to anl end within any reasonable time.
In this, and indeed in all things I have asked of you, I believe the
great interests which you represent are in complete harmony with my
own.                                  SILAS H. DOUGLAS.

The Faculty of the Department of Medicine and Surgery, in view of
the recent liberal Act of the Legislature of the State, making provision
for extending and improving the course of instruction in this Department; and in accordance with the instructions of your Ionorable Body,
have had under careful consideration the subject of providing a plan for
carrying into effect the provisions made for a higher grade of Medical
Education; and beg leave to present the followillg  ropositions as their
report:
i. The course of Instruction commencing with the approaching session, to be extended to nine months. or the full University year,-it
being understood that the fees of students are not in consequence to be
increa. ed.
2. Students who have already matriculated are to be allowed ti) continue the course on the basis upon which they entered the Department, pre 
senting themselves for graduation, if they shall so choose, at the end of




- 123 -
the first six months of the session; but having the privilege of attending
the additional three months and coming up for graduation at the June
Commencement.
3. Students enteringthe Department after this present date, to be provided with a consecutive course of instruction and study continuing three
years-the first year special attention beinz given to Anatomy, Chemistry, Physiology and Materia Medica and Therapeutics, with the appropriate work in the Chemical, Anatomical and Physiological Laboratories, and such examination of drugs in the Pharmaceutical Laboratory
as will render the student familiar with their sensible properties.
The Second year of this course the students are to review the studies
of the first year, so far as may be necessary to prepare for their examination upon them, and in addition, to take Pathology, (including Pathological Anatomy and Pathological Histology), Hygiene or Preventive Medicine, Medical Chemistry (Physiological and Pathological), including
practical work in the Laboratory; and in addition to attend such Lectures
on the Practical Branches, Didactic and Clinical, as may be thought
advisable in each particular case.
At the end of the Second year, fiszal examinations are to take place in

Hospital and the College Clinics of the principles taught in the didactic
lectures-receiving practical illustrations and drillings in Diagnosis and
Treatment, preparatory to the final examination which is to test their
knowledge of diseases and their management, and their fitness for assuming the responsible duties of the Physician and Surgeon.
4. Students properly qualified may enter the Department of Medicine and Surgery at any time, and pursue such branches of study taught
as they may select, receiving specific certificates for the time spent and for
the subjects pursued; but after the session of S878-9, no student shall be

of having pursued the regular study of Medicine for the period of three
years; but to encourage a higher grade of preliminary acquirements, an
allowance of six months fiom the term of study may be made in favor of
graduates of the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts, in the
University, and of other respectable literary colleges; aad also an allowance of twelve months is made for graduates of the Department of Pharmacy in this University.

Regent Grant, on behalf of the Committee on Museum, School
of Mines and Astronomical Observatory, submitted the following
report.
To the tHonorable Board of' Regents:
GENTLEMEN —The Committee on Museum, School of Mines and Astronomical Observatory, respectfully report that in their opinion the School
of Mines should be continued.. The mining interests of the State are
large and comparatively undeveloped. No more advantageous place for
such a school can be found than at this University. The school has succeeded beyond the anticipations of its most enthusiastic friends. Should
it now be discontinued, we fear that years night pass before a successful
attempt could be made to renew it.
Your committe therefore recommend that Prof. W. H. Pettee be placed
in charge of Mining Engineering without any additional compensation.
That Prof. John W. Langley be placed in charge of Metallurgy and
Chemical Technology, without any additional compensation.
Your committee further report that other necessary instruction in said
school can be rendered by the other Professors, Assistant Professors,
and Instructors in the Polytechnic School.
While this arrangement is not so satisfactory as we could desire, yet
we believe that the school can in this way be maintained with credit for
the next two years.
Your committee further report that Prof. WV. L. B. Jenney has
requested a leave of absence for two years as per his letter which is herewith submitted, and they therefore recommend that he be granted leave
of absence for two years from and after the first day of October next.
This arrangement will involve no additional expense to the University. Unless special assistance should be obtained, the department of




— 127 -Architecture and Design will be without instruction except such as may
be rendered by Instructor C. S. Denison.
Prof. Langley will assume the work of instruction heretofore done by
Prof. S. H. Douglas, and all the otherwork will be done by other Professors and Instructors.
SAMUEL S. WALKER.
C. B. GRANT.
The following resolution, submitted by Regent Rynd was
adopted:
Resolved, That the honorary degree of M. D. be and is hereby conferred on John W. Langley, S. B.
Regent E. C. Walker submitted the following resolutions, which
were adopted:
Resolved, That any medical professor may obtain the assistance of a
medical graduate in his department, whose name may go into the Calen.
dar as assistant to such Professor: Provided, it shall be done without
expense to the University, and shall be acceptable to the Medical Faculty,
and the name of the assistant shall be, as soon as he is appointed, reported
to the Board.
Resolved, That Prof. J. B. Steere's title of Assistant Professor of
Paleontology be changed to that of "Assistant Professor of Zoology and
Paleontology."
Regent Climie, chairman of the Chemical and Pharmaceutiical Department, presented and read the following report:
SCHOOL OF PHARMACY, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
ANN ARBOR, June 25, I877.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
By direction of the Faculty of the School of Pharmacy, I have to
report that the students whose names are here given have completed all
the requirements for graduation in this school, and they are therefore
recommended to you for the degree of Pharmaceutical Chemist:
John Herbert Avery,                 Victor Knapp,
Gleason Fillmore Dixon,            William Herbert Denston Lewis,
William Howard Gates,               Arthur Stephen Lobb,
Will. Frank Griffith,              Robert Logan,
Albert Adam Hallock,               William Lester Long,
Bagley A. Harris,                  Stanley Eli Parkill,
Theodore Hauck,                     Mary Elizabeth Post,
Frank Jackson Hubbard,             Elwood Morris Reed,
Kent P. Humiston,                  J. Hungerford Smith,
Marion Eliza Johnson,               Ransom H. Stevens.
John Sleeper Johnson,               Clarence George Stone,

Joseph John Johnston,               J. Warren Tompkins,
Abram Pitcher Kerlev.               Hugh Sumner Wyman,
David Kirk,                         Arthur Lansing Young.      28
I am glad to be able to report the steadily growing prosperity of the
school, now in the ninth year of its establishment as a course for a
degree. The number of students leaving the required course incomplete
has from year to year diminished, while the number competing for graduation has been quite as large as is favorable to good results.
The addition to the requirements made in 1874, a semester of structural and microscopic botany and pharmacology, following systematic
botany, a decided extension of the basis of pharmaceutical education, has
been carried very well by the classes, and materially strengthens the work
in all the subjects of the curriculum.
The provision for teaching materia medica heretofore. namely,
attendance on lectures in the Medical Department, is not satisfactory to
the Professor of that branch, or to the Faculty or students. Deficiencies
in this subject are especially felt soon after graduation; but they are
repaired to a greater extent than defects in other branches. Professor
Frothingham designs to find time, the coming year, to give some classwork in materia medica, to the senior pharmacy class separately, and by
this or other means it is hoped a thorough drill in the study of doses, at
least, will be effected. Also Professor Spalding will make some extension in the work in pharmacology for the recognition of crude drugs.
Tihe accomplishment of some original work of professional value, by
the undergraduates, has been in view from the first, and since 1873-4 such
work has been regulated as a requirement for the degree, employing fiom
one to two months of the senior year.  rom 1870 to 1876, (inclusive)
forty-three per cent of the graduates have made original contributions in
their profession; the proportion for the last two years being seventy to
eighty per cent.  These contributions have mostly been given to the
American Journal of Pharmacy (Philadelphia) and the American Chemist (New York), afterwards appearing in other periodicals of Chemistry
and Pharmacy. About one-fourth of them have obtained European circulation. Research conducted as undergraduate work in our course is
necessarily restricted in extent and dependent on the instructors for direction and for communication, but it adds life to the work of the school,
favors acquaintance with the professional public, and  renders some
return to science. There is reason to hope that more extended investigations will be obtained in the opportunity of a third collegiate year, as post
graduate work.   Several contributions of value have been furnished
from this source, the present year.
The commercial depression in the United States has borne with
especial weight upon education, as well as upon employment, in a profes



- 129
sion so largely commercial as that of pharmacy. Nevertheless, about ninety per cent of the graduates of last year had found satisfactory employment by Christlias. Our classes are doubtless kept lower by the depression of business, but we are not provided to do good work with much
larger classes, and, should increased numbers present themselves, we
believe that an advance in the requirement for admission must be made
to control numbers. Meantime, it seems evident that a school of Pharmacy, in this country, with a course of two full working years, graded
throughout, and with extended requirements in both chemical and microscopic labor atories, has reason to proceed carefully if undertaking further
extensions.
By direction of the Faculty,
ALBERT B. PRESCOTT, Dean.
On the conclusion of the reading of the report, Regent Climie
submitted the following resolution, which was adopted:
Resolve,( That the report of the I)ean of the Sclool of Pharmacy be
adopted; and that the degree of Pharmaceutical Chemist be conferred
upon the persons named in the report in accordance with the recommendations of said Faculty.
The President submitted the following communication from

and adopted and ordered to be printed in the minutes:
The Committee on Buildings and Grounds submit the following
report of the expenditures entailed by the erection of Hospital buildings.:
That by an act of the Legislature of i875 ther,n was appropriated the
sum of $5,5oo for the purpose of building a hospital in connection with
the University of Michigan, and also the further sum of $2,5oo for equipments, supplies, etc., with proviso that no money should be drawn from
the State treasury until the citizens of Ann Arbor shall contribute the
sum of $4,000, whereupon the city of Ann Arbor did contribute the $4,00ooo
as above mentioned, and the Board of Regents at their meeting of June
28th, I875, adopted the following resolution: ' Resolved, that the Chair



- 140 
men of the Committee on Buildings and Grounds, the Secretary and Professors Maclean and Dunster be and are hereby instructed and empowered to adopt plans and proceed with the erection and equipment of the
contemplated University Ilospital; further, that upon the adoption of
such plans. the work be let to the lowest responsible bidder; and further,
that the total expenditure shall not exceed $io,ooo." The committee procured plans and specifications from E. E. Myers, Architect, of Detroit, and
advertised for proposals for construction of buildings. The lowest offer
by responsible parties was received from Richards & Mickle, to whom the
contract was let on September 6th, 1875, for the sum of $9,271, which said
contract was completed and accepted by the committee in January, I876.
The equipment account for said Hospital, for the sum of $2,728.36,
details of which are fully stated in bill submitted with this report. aud
which have been fully compared with vouchers, is now on file with the
Secretarv of the Board, and found to be correct.
All of which is respectfully submitted, and the committee ask to be
discharged from the further consideration of the subject.
ANDREW CLIMIE, Chairman,
for the Committee.
The following Report relative to the erection of water-works,
was submitted by Regent Climie; was adopted and ordered to
be printed in the minutes.
The Committee on Buildings and Grounds, submit the following report of the expenditures entailed by the erection of Water-works:
That by an Act of the Legislature of I875, there was appropriated the
sum of Five Thousand dollars for the purpose of building Water-works
for the University of Michigan, and the Board of Regents, at their meeting of May 12th, I875, adopted the following resolution: " That Professor
Douglas be and is hereby requested to act with the Secretary of the Boa-d
and Chairman of the Committee on Grounds, in the introduction of water
to the University Buildings and Grounds."
In pursuance witli the above resolution, Professor l)ouglas, the Secretary and Chairman proceeded to build the Water-works, to a large
extent, under the supervision of Professor Douglas, who made most of
the bargains and contracts for said work. The result of the work, as. done,
is more fully explained by the accompanying detailed statement and
vouchers which I have compared with said statement and found to compare, but deem it necessary to state that in such examination I find many
of the bills for work and materials at an extremely high price. All of
which is respectfully submitted, and the Committee ask to be discharged
from further consideration of the subject.
ANDREW CLIMIE,
Of the Committee.

OCTOBER MEETING.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
October I I, S877.
The Board of Regents assembled in the room of the President at Io o'clock A. M.
Present the President, Regents Estabrook, Grant, Rynd, E.
C. Walker, Climie, Cutcheon, S. S. Walker and Duffield.
The meeting was called to order and opened with devotional
services by the President.
On motion of Regent Rynd, the proceedings of the last two
meetings were approved as printed.
The presentation of reports being in order, the President
announced that his annual report had been prepared. The read
ing of the report was called for, Regent Climie in the Chair.
PRESIDENT'S REPORT.
To the Honorable the Board of Regents:
I hlave the honor to present my report for the year ending
June 30, I877.
The folloving changes have taken place in our Faculties:
In March, 1877, Silas II. Douglas, M. A., M. D., Professor
of Metallurgy and Chemical Technology and Director of the
Chemical Laboratory, was dismissed. In June, 1877, Raymond
C. Davis was appointed Librarian to'succeed Rev. Andrew 1Tel
Brook, M. A., on the first of October. Owing to the failure of
appropriations for the School of Mines (including the School of
Architecture), W. L 1. Jenney, C. E., Professor of Architecture
and Design, asked and received leave of absence for two years,
and W. H. Pettee, M. A., Professor of Mining Engineering,
resigned his chair. Prof. Pettee was then appointed Professor of
Geology, in clharge of Mining Engineering. John W. Langley,
S. B., M. D., who had filled the chair of General Chemistry an I




-i50 -Physics, was made Professor of General Chemistry, in charge of
Metallurgy. Charles K. Wead, M. A., was elected Acting Professor of Physics. The resignation of Mark W. Harrington. M.
A., Assistant Professor in charge of Zoology and Botany, was
accepted. The title of Joseph B. Steere, Ph. D., was changed so
as to read, Assistant Professor of Zo6logy and Paleontology.
Volney M. Spalding, M. A,, was elected for another year Instructor in Zoology and Botany. Otis C. Johnson, M. A., Assistant
in the Chemical Laboratory, was appointed   also Purchasing
Agent for the Laboratory. Owing to the pecuniary necessity of
reducing for the present the number of our teachers, leave of
absence for an indefinite period was granted to Alfred Hennequin, M. A., Instructor in French and German, to Charles N.
Jones, M. A., Instructor in Mathematics, and to Abram V. E.
Young, Ph. B., Ph. C., Assistant in Chemistry and Physics. The
Executive Committee, under instruetions given them at the June
meeting, have appointed Miss Louisa M. Reed. M. S., Assistant
in the Microscopical Laboratory, D. J. Higley, B. A., Assistant
in the Museum, Henry B. Parsons, Ph. C., and Henry Stecher,
Assistants in the Chetnical Laboratory, and William H. Dorrance,
Demonstrator in the Dental College. Charles H. Stowell, M. D.,
was appointed in June Instructor in the Physiological Laboratory.
In the Hom(nopathic Medical College John G. Gilchrist, M.
D., was appointed Lecturer on Surgical Therapeutics for the
coming year, and W. J. Hawkes, M. D., was elected Professor of
Theory and Practice of Medicine in place of J. C. Morgan, M. D.
The number actually engaged in instruction last year was
fifty-one. Two Assistant Professors were absent by permission,
pursuing studies in Europe.,
The attendance of students was as follows:

A few more than half of the total number, to be exact, 52 per
cent. were Michigan students.  In the year previous, exactly onehalf were from our State. The proportion of Michigan students
to the whole number is slowly increasing from year to year. Still
tlhe attendance fiom other States is gratifying. Last year Illinois
sent us 103, Ohio 72, New York 7I, Pennsylvania 41, Indiana
37, Wisconsin 30, Minnesota 27, Iowa 17, Missouri 16, Kansas
I3, California I3. As usual, we had representatives from all the
New England States.    We had one student from    Russia, one
Armenian from Asiatic Turkey, and one Japanese.
The number of women in attendance was 97, as follows:
Department of IMedicine and Surgery, 36; Homceopathic Medical College, 9; Law  Department, 2; School of Pharmacy, 2;
Department of Literature, Science and the Arts, 48. These last
were distributed thus: Resident Graduate, i, Seniors, 12, Juniors, S, Sophomores, 9, Freshmen, I5, Select Courses, 3. The
proportion of women to men scarcely changes from year to year.
The women form a little less than nine per cent. of the whole
number of students. It is very gratifying to see how readily the
more gift:e: young women, who have graduated here, especially




152
those who have taken the classical course, have secured consplcuous positions as teachers in High Schools, Seminaries of
advanced grade, and Colleges for women.         In those positions
they are justifying the wisdom    of the Regents, who opened to
them the opportunities for a thorough collegiate training in this
institution, and are doing their full part in winning a reputation
for the University. Since we are pledged to the co-education of
the sexes, it is with special interest that we see one after another
of the higher schools of Europe admitting women to courses of
study and to degrees, and that we see women, there as here, winning their fair share of the honors awarded to brilliant scholarship.
Degrees were conferred during the past year as follows:
Pharmaceutical Chemist...........................................................  28
Civil  Engineer...............................................................  5
B achelor  of  Science................................................................... 
Bachelor  of  Philosophy...............................................................  19

Doctor of Medicine(Homceopathic College)..................................  13
D octor  of  D ental  Surgery...........................................................  I1
Total.........................................................................  362
Henceforth no second degrees in course are to be given.      We
may therefore reasonably expect that the number of applicants for
the degrees on examination will increase. We desire it to be understood that the examinations for the second degrees are by no
means a mere form.      We make them      rigorous and searching.
We intend that the degrees shall have a real significance.   It is a
question worthy of consideration whether candidates for the first
degree might not well be subjected to some special examination
in addition to the term examinations, which they now receive.




- 153 -


Such an examination, if held, should probably not be technical
and directed to minute details, but should rather call for a broad
and comprehensive survey of the course pursued or of the last
two years of it.
We received last year 55 students on diploma from the following High Schools, from Ann Arbor, 29; from Battle Creek, i;
from Coldwater, 4; from Detroit, I; from Fenton, 2; from Flint,
1; from Grand Rapids, 4; fiom Jackson, 4; from Niles, 4; from
Pontiac, 4; from Ypsilanti, i. This system of receiving students
from approved schools continues to justify itself. We take some
students, it is true, who ought not to have been sent to us, and
who prove incompetent to go on with the class. But we always
take some such on examination. And if in any case a Superintendent has been lax in scrutinizing the attainments of a pupil,
whom he has recommended to us, the dropping of the pupil from
our class with a kind and frank statemenlt of the facts to the
Superintendent has always proved a sufficient incentive to him to
greater caution the next year. I cannot repeat with too much
emphasis my testimony to the fidelity and earnestness of the
Superintendents and teachers of our principal High Schools in
directing the preparatory work for the University. I am gratified
to say also that the work shows a steady and rapid increase in its
thoroughness and range, and that the schools are in every respect
worthy of the pride which is felt in them. Whatever success
the University is achieving is due in no small degree to the excellence of the schools, which give their pupils so good a foundation
for their studies here. It is to be hoped that no unwise and false
ideas of economy will lead to the weakening of the High Schools
of Michigan.
The custom of receiving students without examination from
approved schools is rapidly extending. Not only has it been
adopted in some of the State Universities of the west, but some
of the eastern colleges are receiving students without examination from academies of established reputation.  I think their
example will be imitated by other colleges.
The Act passed in 1873, establishing a School of Mines here
(including also a School of Architecture) made provision for its




- 154 -

support for only two years. The Regents organized the School
so that it began the work in Mining Engineering in the autumn
of 1875. The instruction in Architecture was delayed until the
autumn of 1876. Nearly the whole of the sum of five thousand
dollars appropriated for apparatus has been expended, two-thirds
of the amount on the apparatus for the mining work, and onethird on the apparatus for the Architectural School. Competent
professors have been secured, and students have been attracted in
good numbers from various parts of the Union. We had every
reason to expect a satisfactory career for the Schools. To our
great regret the Legislature failed to continue the appropriations
for their support. We could spare nothing from our general
fund to carry them on. It was a grave question whether we
should not drop them altogether, in spite of the great disappointment to the students, who had been drawn hither by the assurance that we could give them full courses of instruction in Mining
and Architecture.  But Prof. Langley having kindly offered to
give for the present the instruction in Metallurgy in addition to
his regular duties, and Prof. Pettee having also offered to teach
Mining Engineering in addition to his duties as Professor of
Geology, (both of them without any compensation for the extra
work), we are able to continue to care for the students in Mining.
But I am sorry to say that the instruction in Architecture must be
suspended until fiom some source we can receive more funds.
The class in Architecture were pursuing their study with great
enthusiasm and with excellent promise. Surely in the downfall
of badly planned and ill-constructed buildings, causing not only
destruction of property but also of life, we are receiving eloquent
appeals for the thorough training of architects. We do not need
to leave our own grounds to be reminded of the advantages which
might accrue to us fiom the employment of architects of chaste
and cultivated taste.
The School of Mines was not established at our solicitation,
but on the suggestion of intelligent legislators from the Upper
Peninsula. It was they also, who decided that this was the proper
place for it. We were gratified at their decision, and have gladly
and in good faith labored to make the school meet their expecta



- 155 -


tions as far as was possible il this brief period. It is therefore
with peculiar regret that we learn that the failure to renew our
appropriations for the school was due in part at least to an
attempt of members of the Legislature fiom the Upper Peninsula to transfer the school from Ann Arbor to some point in the
mining districts. The bill, which was introduced to effect the
removal, proposed however to leave the school in the control of
the Regents and so a part of the University.
I think I appreciate the force of the arguments for the establishment of the school in the mining regions.  I would not
undervalue them.  It is unquestionably advantageous, nay, it is
absolutely necessary that the students should spend some time
with their instructors at the mines. But conceding this, it seems
to me by no means proved that the school should be altogether
removed fiom the University. The results desired can be as successfully and far more economically secured by leaving the main
part of the class-room work to be done at the University and by
establishing a summer school for the students near the mines. If
a separate school is established, a large part of the expense
already incurred must be duplicated. Furnaces, models, crushers,
and other apparatus like that already procured at an expense of
nearly four thousand dollars must be obtained. Such collections
as we possess for illustrating the general scientific teaching, which
is a part of the thorough education of a Mining Engineer, could
be gathered only at great cost and trouble and after a long time.
A laboratory for chemical and metallurgical and assaying work
would be a necessity and must involve a large outlay. But perhaps the inereased cost of instruction would be a more serious
matter still. To give the needed teaching in mathematics, the
languages, and the sciences, would require a considerable corps
of professors and assistants in a separate school. At the University all that part of the instruction of the students is done
without the cost of an additional penny to the State. It need
hardly be said that all this teaching, which is not purely technical, can be done quite as well here as in the Upper Peninsula.
Add to this the benefits to be derived from the library and the
general advantages of culture afforded by life at the University,




-156 -and it seems clear that the school should be retained here. But
must the students forego the opportunity to observe actual work
at the mines? By no means. They should be required, and if
necessary, be aided to spend some time there during each of the
two last years of their course. Appended to my last report was
a somewhat detailed sketch by Prof. Pettee of a plan for such a
summer school. It is estimated that two thousand dollars a year
will suffice to meet its expenses. The students could spend a
part of their time at the iron mines, and a part at the copper
mines, and could reap all the substantial benefits to be derived
from a permanent school in the mining districts and als, the
benefits of life at the University, and their instruction would cost
the State less by many thousands of dollars annually than it
would, if the school should be transferred from Ann Arbor to
any point in the Upper Peninsula.
While I deem it an advantage to the Universtty to have the
school here, I would not say a word to keep it here, if I
did not think it best for the State that it should not be removed.
And although we shall try even at great inconvenience to carry
it on for the present, yet the arrangement now made cannot easily be continued for a long time. If the next Legislature, speaking for the State, do not wish us to take charge of this work,
nay, if the citizens of the Upper Peninsula after careful reflection
wish us to drop it, I strongly recommend that we abandon our
effort to carry it on. Yet I cannot but think that the considerations here presented will ultimately lead the State to the conviction that if a School of Mines is to be maintained at all, the plan
which has here been commended is the wisest one to be pursued.
The history of the legislation on the School of Mines must
impress all, who bestow any careful thought on the subject, with
the desirableness of having legislative action, which affects the
University, shaped so far as possible with relation to some fixed
and definite plan of development of the institution.  To establish a school, and just as it is fairly organized to destroy it, not
only disappoints and incommodes the teachers and students in
that school, it must make it difficult to secure accomplished professors and earnest students for other schools in the University,




- 157 -since, rightly or wrongly, they infer that there is instability in
the whole institution. Of course one legislature cannot control
the action of its successors. But reflection upon the evil results
of a vacillating policy towards the University must impress all
wise legislators with the importance of avoiding hasty and frequent changes in its organization and work.
The Sehool of Pharmacy, which has heretofore been treated
in our Calendar as a part of the Department of Literatnre, Science and the Arts, was, at the request of the officers of instruction
in the School, in Deeember, I876, recognized by you as a separate organization. It had long been so in fact. Its students are
to a very small extent, instructed with the classes in the Literary
Department, and they have never been governed or directed by
the Faculty of that Department. Their course is purely technical. They will henceforth feel an increased pride in their School,
and will cheerfully co-operate with the Faculty in raising its
grade of work. The elevation of the standard of admission will
apparently become a necessity, if for no other reason, in order to
prevent the classes from becoming too large for our accommodations. The growth of the School has been natural and steady, its
courses of study have been made broader and more thorough and
exacting from year to year, and its graduates are doing credit to
the training they have received.
The Law School goes steadily on in its prosperous course
with scarcely any fluctuation in its numbers. Its Faculty have
made so few demands on the Board for help, that possibly there
is danger that we fail to inquire with sufficient care whether its
resources should not at the earliest practicable day, be somewhat
enlarged. While pains have been taken to raise the requirenients
for admission and fo-r graduation in the Literary and Medical Departments, and to lengthen the term of study in the Medical
Schools, the whole scheme of labor in the Law  School has
remained unchanged. It is worthy of consideration whether
something may not be done to increase the efficiency of the
School. I think it would be gratifying to the Faculty and conducive to the best interests of the School, if another Professor could
be appointed, and if more of what we may term class-room work,




- 158 -
drilling. quizzing, could thus be seciured. It is also my own
conviction that there should be some test of admission to the
School, or at any rate of admnission to the senior class. The subject of legal education and especially of the best methods of training meln in law schools for the legal profession, is receiving large
attention just now throughout the country, and we must spare no
pains to retain for our School the high reputation it has always
enjoyed.
The Dental School has had a year of satisfactory work. We
have reason to believe that it has commended itself to the Dental
Profession in the west, and now that the action of the Legislature
has removed all doubts of its continuance, we may expect an
increased attendance. It is now provided with its own building,
and the inconveniences under which it and the Homcnopathic College suftered from being crowded into the same edifice with inadequate room, will henceforth be avoided.
The Department of Medicine and Surgery, in spite of bitter
attacks upon it on account of the establishment of the Hominopathic Medical College here, and in spite of the predictions, which
its enemies have indulged in, of its approaching decline, persists
in continuing a vigorous existence. Indeed, it is taking a bold
step forward. Witl a view to insuring larger attainments in its
graduates, it now extends its annual course from six months to
nine months, and sot grades the work as tO secure an orderly and
systematic education. Only two other Schools in the country,
those at Harvard College and the University of Pennsylvania.
have attempted this marked improvement in medical education.
But all over the land there is among the more iltelligent members of
the medical profession a profound conviction that an elevation of
the standard of medical education is in the highest degree necessary. Yet since a large proportion of the schools graduate students after two courses of six months each, or even of four months
each, while we ask an attendance on two courses of nine months.
and by rigid examinations make stringent delmands on the candidate for graduation, we were prepared to expect. at first, a considerable decline in the attendance. But as the school at Harvard
after an experiment of three or four years has fully regained its




- 159 -


old numbers, so we hoped that after a brief period we should
enroll as many on our books as we had been accustomed to see
for the years past.  But whether we did or not, we resolved to
a(lhere so long as the resources of the University would permit, to
th!e policy of giving the highest grade of medical education which
is provided in the best schools of the land. That we deemed the
only course worthy of a University. WVe believed that if a few of
tlhe leading schools would courageously persist in this policy, they
would not only attract the choicest and most aspiring students,
but they would soon lift many of the other schools to a higher
plane, and so compel the much needed elevation of the training of
the medical profession.
But to our great gratification we find, as our new year opens,
tlhat our expectation of a decline in attendance is disappointed.
The classes bid fair to exceed in size those of last year. And it
is a cause of especial encouragement that students, who have
come from distant States, as well as some who have come from
our own State, assure us that they have been attracted hither by
t!e extension of our term. They desire the largest and best
training they can secure. They do not ask, what is the shortest
ti ne, in which we can obtain a diploma?  They seek rather the
fullest preparation for their professional work. That is the class
of students we have hoped to secure.
The Homoeopathic Medical College had filly twice as many
students last year as in the preceding year, and the number this
v'ear promises to be at least half larger than it was last year.
A, growth so rapid ought to be satisfactory to its fiiends. Now
that it may be said to have passed its experimental stage and that
its existence is assured, it is reasonable to expect that the Homceopathic branch of the medical profession will lend it a cordial
support. It will be borne in mind that the course in this school
is also lengthened from six months to nine months. The remarks
nmade above concerning the importance of the extended course in
the Department of Medicine and Surgery, are, of course, equally
applicable to the Homneopathic practitioners and schools. This
is the only Homceopathic School which has courses of nine months,
and it must attract the students, who desire a thorough training.




-160 -Legislative action has brought some very valuable additions
to our resources for furnishing medical education by aiding in the
support of the hospital and by establishing a Physiological Laboratory. Our funds have heretofore enabled us to keep the Hospital open only a part of the year, and have not sufficed to care
for it as we could have wished. But the appropriation made at
the last session of the Legislature will enable us to provide for
patients through the whole year and insure them every needed
comfort. During the last year a large number of important operation in surgery and on the eye and the ear have been successfully, and of course gratuitously performed, and so the Hospital
has been a great public benefit to the State, which supports it.
But it will now be able to multiply its blessings, while it also
becomes a more valuable adjunct to the Medical Schools. A
portion of the Hospital is to be set apart for the use of the Hom
meopathic College and of the patients who prefer to be treated by
Professors of that school.
The Physiological and Histological Laboratory we also expect
to be of the greatest service to the medical students, who may
avail themselves of its advantages. By experiments upon the
lower animals and by the use of the microscope and other instruments of observation, the minute and scientific study of the structule of the tissues and of the various parts of the human organism
both in the diseased and in the healthy state is pursued with the
most helpful results.
We may therefore confidently affirm tlhat our provisions for
instruction in medicine are not only Inaterially ampler and better
than they have ever before been, but that we may reasonably expeci
them to draw to our halls those earnest men and women, who are
not content to receive the miinilmum of knowledge with which they
can be allowed to practice medicine, btit who aspire to that complete and generous training, which shall prepare them to adorn
their profession and bless their generation. Even if the number
of such should not prove as great as the number of those, who
wish for a mlere smattering of medical learning, and who are willing to play the part of ignoramuses or charlatans, it is very clear
that we should not mourn over the loss of the latter class fromi Our




- 161 -

lecture-rooms, but should use every worthy means to stimulate
and prepare the thorough and high-minded students for the best
work of which they are capable. But the large classes who are
thronging the medical lecture-rooms this year indicate that the
sentiment of the medical profession in favor of improving medical
education was riper than some had supposed, and that the proportion of students who earnestly desire prolonged and thorough
instruction, is already very great. We may well be cheered and
encouraged by the response which is thus made to our endeavor
to lift the standard of medical education.
The Legislative Committee made a very careful inquiry into
the condition and wants of the University, and presented a report
with very generous recommendations in our behalf. Most of
these recommendations, I am happy to say, were adopted. The
following appropriations were made:
For the salary of the Professor of Geology, for IS77, $2,000;
for 1878, $2,000. For the Physical Laboratory, I877, $I,ooo;
I878, $500. For the salary of the Professor of Physics, 1877, $2,ooo; I878, $z,ooo. For the Hospital, 877, $2,000; I87S, $z,ooo. For the Physiological Laboratory, 1877, $2,500; I878, $,ooo. For the General Library, 1877, $2,500; I878,$2,500. For
salaries of Professors in the Dental School, I877, $4,500; I878,
$4,500. For apparatus in the Dental School, I877, $,ooo0; 1878,
$500. For repairs of a building for the Dental School, $I,ooo.
For the purchase of instruments for the Astronomical Department, $i,500. For the extension of the term in the Department
of Medicine and Surgery to nine months, 1877, $4,500; 1878,
$4,500. For the same extension of the term in the Homceopathic
College, 1877, $2,500; I878, $2,500.
Of the specific advantages to be derived from most of these
appropriations, I have already spoken. But I desire to call especial attention to the legislation, which enables us to establish a
fair equipment for a physical laboratory and to provide a Professor, whose whole attention can be given to instruction in Physics.
For years we have been striving to bring to the study of Physics
the same help from laboratory processes which has been furnished to the study of Chemistry and to some extent of the Natnral




- 162
Sciences. We have been compelled to see ourselves outstripped
in that particular by many institutions, whose equipment in most
respects was far inferior to ours. The introduction of the laboratory work renders the division-of the duties of the chair of Physics and Chemistry an absolute necessity. We may now hope to
do far more than we have ever before done in preparing students
to investigate or to teach the science of Physics.
I would also refer to the appropriation for the increase of the
General Library. The Legislative Committee appreciated, it is
believed, the importance of a new fire-proof building for the Library, but did not deem it expedient, it is presumed, in the present depressed state of business to recommend the erection of it.
They saw, however, how inadequate is the Library itself to the
needs of such an institution as this, and wisely urged an appropriation of twenty-five hundred dollars for this year and an equal
sum for the next. This will furnish a most welcome addition to
our shelves and will enable us to do much towards filling some
very bad gaps. The Library must be the fountain of strength in
a University. If our collection of books were trebled or quadrupled in numbers at once, it would not be at all beyond the real
demands of the institution. For in addition to a rich general
library we ought to have for each of our special and professional
schools a large and choice technical library. We trust that coming Legislatures may imitate the last in an appreciative care for
the Library, unless private munificence should make provision for
it. I cannot relinquish the belief that some man will vet be wise
enough to link his name permanently with the University by erecting us a suitable building for the Library.
The total sum appropriated isfor 1877, $27,000, and for I878,
$22,500. The aid thus furnished will prove very helpful to us by
enabling us to enlarge our facilities for instruction in various ways.
We appreciate it also at this time as an encouraging evidence that
even when a temporary excitement caused by exceptional circumstances might be supposed to precludethe hope of generous appropriations from the Legislature, yet that body could be relied on to
express by its action the deep interest which the citizens of Michigan really feel in the prosperity and efficiency of this institution.




- 163 -
But it must not be forgotten that the demands upon us are constantly outrunning our resources. A great institution with a worthy ambition and a vigorous life, is constantly tending to expand
its work and is ever- tempted to increase little by little its outlay
in order to enrich its instruction. But with a firm resolve to keel
out of debt, we have decided for the present to reduce slightly our
teaching force and increase the labor of the instructors and to curtail our present and miscellaneous expenses to the last degree
compatible with the continuance of our work in a manner worthy
of our reputation. It is expected that a saving of several thousand dollars will be made for the current year, and of a suml nearly
as large for the year to come. But this has been made possible
only by placing on some of our college officers an amount of classroom work with undergraduates, which, for the best good of the
University, they should not be asked to do permanently. There
is ground for fear that the efficiency of some of our teaching will
be impaired to a certain extent. Certain it is that less time can
be given by some of our most experienced Professors to the higher
grades of instruetion, especially the work with resident graduates
and specialists, than has been given, and with results which have
reflected great credit uplon us. The present reduction of our force
is absolutely necessary. We Imust at all hazards keep out of debt.
But it should be borne constantly in mind that the reduction in
the Literary Department is in itself considered a misfortune, andl
therefore that if our number of students does not materially dimillish, the number of our staff of teachers must be made good again
as soon as our funds will allo\w.
In reviewing the year, we may say with truth that the work (of
the University in all its Departments has gone on witll larked
efficiency and success. The prosperity of the Institution, \we
believe, has not been checked even by the misfortune, which has
made the Chemical Laboratory the object of an undlesirable not)riety. With the fixed purpose to keep its expenses carefully within its income, to practice in every piarticular the utmost economy,
and to secure the largest an(l best results, which its resources will
aliow, we are confident that the Uiniversity will not forfeit the
place it has so long held in the aflections of the people of Michi



- 164 -gan, nor lose the pre-eminence it has attained as an Institution of
Higher Learning.

ANN ARBOR, Oct. II, I877.
E. C. WALKER.
Regent Rynd presented a communication from the Dean of
the Homaopathical Medical College relative to the assignment
of seats in the Department of Medicine and Surgery, which, on
motion, was referred to the Executive Committee.
The following resolution submitted by Regent Rynd was

adopted 
Resolved. That the resolution of July 12, I877, page 146, be so
amended as to read;-That the President and Secretary be instructed to
have the Calendar, Announcements and Regents' Proceedings printed by
the person or firm furnishing the lowest satisfactory and responsible bid,
and that the printing be contracted for annually.




- 165 -On motion of Regent E. C. Walker, the Board went into
executive session, at the close of which the business of the open
session was resumed.
The following communication from     solicitors of the Board,
in the Rose-Douglas suit, so called, now pending, was read by
the Hon. W. D. Webber at the request of the Board.
LANSING, October 5, I877.
To the Board of Regents of the University of Michtigan:
GENTLEMEN-After being engaged to act as counsel in the suit in
equity, pending in Washtenaw Circuit in May last, we met at Ann Arbor
and examined the case.  We found that there were several questions
raised by the pleadings, which would require time and expense to settle,
and which did not go to the real merits of the controversy. We saw the
solicitors for the defendants and learning from them that they were anxious for a speedy trial on the merits, we proposed to them a stipulation in
which all questions, not affecting the merits were waived, and as the amount
of the Laboratory deficit was then supposed to be known, it was stated, leaving only the question for trial, as to who was liable for such deficit. The
solicitors for the defendants assented to this stipulation, and it was
signed. Before signing it however, the question was raised whether the
trial might not show a deficit somewhat less than it was then supposed to
be, and we then gave assurance that should the trial show that the
amount of the deficiency was overstated, we would ask at the final hearing for a decree, only for so much as the trial should show was actually
due the University. Pursuant to this stipulation an interlocutory decree
was rendered by the Court June I9, 1877, and after the necessary preliminary proceedings, the trial as between defendants Rose and Douglas
commenced on July 5th and the case tried, and was submitted to the
court on the IIth of August, and on or about Sept. i8th the decision was
filed, which determined the general principles relative to the respective
liability of defendants Rose and Douglas, and referred the case to a coinmissioner to ascertain and report according to those principles, the precise amount for which each is liable. This opinion having been pliblished, we assume you are informed concerning it. When the report of
the commissioner is made, a decree will be entered, which will definitely settle, in dollars and cents, the amount for which each of
said defendants is liable. It was deemed best that at least one of tis
should be present during the trial, and Judge Christiancv was present during the entire trial and Mr. Webber was present a portion of
the time. Until the question as between Rose and Douglas shall be
fully decided, so that we can know the items and totals due from eachi,
we can take no step in the case (except by consent) as to the tmatters
B




- 16 -
Mentioned in the resolution adopted on motion of Regent Rynd at your
May meeting, as against Dr. Douglas LAone.   We have, however,
examined as to those matters, as far as is at present practicable, and it is
our opinion that, as to the charges for commissions and traveling expenses mentioned, those charges and like charges have been so often and so
long recognized and approved, the Regents cannot now open the account
and recover the sums charged.
The question as to interest charges rests on a different basis, and
our present opinion is, that you should not concede the right to make
those charges. We do not think them warranted by the law on the facts
as we understand them. As to the other matters mentioned, we cannot
advise until the final adjustment or decree as between Rose and Douglas.
In the management of this case for the Regents, we have had in
view first of all the interests of the University committed to your charge.
We found here a controversy between two men, both conceding that the
Regents had not received what money was their just due, and each charging that the other had the money. To recover it, the first thing was to
find which had it, and this called for judicial inquiry. We have seen
nothing in the case to call for popular attention or to justify popular
excitement. It is the common course, in case of disputed rights to appeal
to the courts for a settlement, and this case is no exception to the general
rule. So far as we have been able, we have endeavored to allay excitement and bitterness, by reason of or growing out of this controversy, on
the part of the public, for the reason that we could perceive no good to
result therefrom, but on the contrary we feared it would injure the prosperity and usefulness of the University.  Allow us also to call your
attention to the large expense attending litigation of this character. We
understand that the trial between the two defendants named, cost each
of them nearly or quite as much as the entire laboratory deficit, and in
the interest of the University, we shall do what we can to bring about an
end to the controversy as early as- practicable and as "near to right and
justice as the great uncertainty, arising from the manner in which the
business has been transacted, and the books kept will permit.
I. P. CHRISTIANCY,
WM. L. WEBBER.
The following resolution submitted by Regent Cutcheon, was
unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That the matter of the separate accounting between Dr.
S. H1. Douglas and the University be entrusted to the counsel of this
Board, Messrs. Christiancy and Webber, with instructions to secure the
substantial rights of the University, whether by amicable settlement or
if necessary, by amendment of the present bill in chancery, or by a




- 167 --


separate suit; this accounting to embrace a.ll matters whatsoever in dispute between the parties, except such as are covered by the decree or
opinion already rendered.  And that said counsel be fully empowered
and authorized on the part of this Board to proceed to such final settlement or suit, according to their best judgment.
The resignation of Prof. W. J. Hawkes was received. and on
motion of Regent Rynd it was temlporarily laid on the table.
The following communication relative to the Physiological
Laboratory was received, read, and ordered to be printed in the
minu tes:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, }
Ann Arbor, Oct. II, I877. 
To the Honorable Board f R  e of Rehes o e University of MichigSan 
The undersigned have the honor to report that immediately on b ing
authorized to purchase microscopes and other needed facilities for establishing and equipping a Physiological Laboratory, we set about ascertaining what was required to accomplish the desired result.
At our request Dr. Stowell came to Ann Arbor for conference on the
subject, and as the result of such conference, Dr. Stowell went to New
York, examined instruments and various other appliances required,
talked with dealers and obtained information fiom various sources in
reference to our anticipated needs.
He subsequently visited Rochester, N. Y., where Messrs. Bausch &
Lomb are making microscopes and all accessory apparatus.
He went thence to Geneva, N. Y., whel-e Mr. Spencer, who has a
world-wide reputation as a maker of object glasses, now resides.
As the result of conference by personal intercourse and by letter, we
decided to order the stands of Bausch & Lomb and Spencer.
Fifteen microscope stands and three objectives for each one were
ordered, which we confidently believe will be entirely satisfactory in
quality for our wants.
Some delay in completing that number of instruments was inevitable, but a part are already on hand and the remainder are to be delivered
this week.
A microscope already the property of the University has been
repaired at an expense of fifteen dollars.
Instruments were purchased of Tieman & Co. to the amount of
$I8.50.
A mahogany case to contain microscopic objects, a reflector for
drawing, and some lenses of common glass, for illustrating the structure
of lenses, were purchased of McAllister for $31.75.




-168 -We have purchased books from the library of the late Prof. Cheever,
o1 volumes, costing $30.
There are also other bills to be paid the precise amount of which
cannot now be given.
Other expenses will be incurred in arranging apparatus and completing our facilities for instruction, as we get fairly at work, for which
we hope the remainder of the appropriation may prove adequate.
The total indebtedness already due for goods on hand and ordered
is about $I300.
Prof. S. A. Jones has shown his interest in the Physiological Laboratory by presenting to the University for the library of the Laboratory,
twenty-seven volumes of microscopic works (among which are I8 volumes
of the " Monthly Microscopical iournal and Transactions of the Royal
Microscopical Society of London ") and has loaned for the use of the
same forty-one volumes. He has also presented two valuable objectives
of high power for the benefit of the department.
We are very respectfully yours,
C. L. FORD,
E. S. DUNSTER.
On motion the Board adjourned to 2 o'clock p. M.

Your committee submit herewith a list of all the officers, professors
aud employes of the University, showing the amount of salary paid each.
The year opens more favorably, financially, than was anticipated at
our last meeting. There has been a gratifying increase in the amount
received from students' fees. But your committee are reminded that we
have an indebtedness which must be liquidated. With the reduction in
expenses, made at our last meeting, and the increase in fees, we think
this indebtedness may be nearly wiped out during the coining year; but
this can only be acco mplished by a strict adherence to the policy adopted
at our last meeting.

The following is the paper read and submitted by Regent
Rynd:
To the Board of Regents:
As defendants we desire to present the following chronological history of the case of The Regents vs. Rose and Douglas since the application
for rehearing:
ist. An application for rehearing was made and argued before his
Honor Judge IHuntington.
2d. On the 30th day of November last the decision was rendered denying a rehearing upon every ground set up in the petition, but granted
a rehearing ex gratia upon certain points, upon the condition, however,




-181 -that the proofs, should be taken in behalf of Rose in fifteen davs, and
that Douglas should have ten days in which to introduce rebutting testimony, and added the further condition that the cause should stan:l for
hearing at the then next term of court without notice. The order allowing a rehearing was settled and filed on the  -   day of
Mr. Bishop, attorney for Rose, asked the court to add to the order
a provision that it should not take effect until signed and filed; this request the court refused. By the terms of the order Rose was compelled
to give Douglas four days' notice before he could take his proofs, and the
order was not signed and filed by the Judge until eight days after it was
announced orally from the bench, although it was dated upon the day it
was orally announced by the Judge. Thus before Rose could get his
order, and get notice served for taking his testimony, twelve of the fifteen
days allowed had elapsed. The proof tha; Rose desired to make consisted of the testimony of students, whose accounts were involved in the
controverted items, or delinquent accounts. Two of these students were
residing in Ohio, when last heard from, one at Grand Trunk Junciion,
another was in the United States Army, and his precise whereabouts unknown. It was impossible to obtain the witnesses within the time mentioned in the order. Mr. Rose secured what proof he could within the time
mentioned in the order. Mr. Rose secured what proof he could, and on
some of the points involved it was absolute and conclusive. As, for instanee, on the question whether or not there was an annual settlement
between Rose and Douglas each year.
On the first day of the present term Rose made application to the
court in the usual form for further time in which to procure the remainder
of his testimony, and asked the court to be permitted to take his proofs
during the time which must elapse before the court could reach the case
during the present term, thus avoiding any delay in the final hearing of
the cause. This application the court denied, with ten dollars cost against
Rose, thus allowing a defendant costs against a co-defendant in the same
cause, stating at the time that he denied the motion because the application was made for delay. The order granting the rehearing provided that the interlocutory d cree should be set aside, except that portion
ordering an accounting before a commissioner. On the i8th day of January. 1878, Douglas made a motion to restore the original decree. On
the argument of the motion, the counsel for Rose cited two decisions
of the Supreme Court of the State in which that court, on granting a
rehearing did precisely what Judge Huntington had done in this case,
namely, set aside the decretal or interlocutory decree, and ordered a rehearing. The Judge, in order to comply with the request of the attorney
of Mr. Douglas in this case, was compelled to overrule the decision of the
Supreme Court which he did in the following language. "The case of
Sheldon vs. Howe, 15 Mich., is the case apparently most in point. There the
Supreme Court did substantially what was done in this case, but it is not
clear but that it was done with as little thought as the decree was made
in this case." Thus, this decision of the Supreme 'ourt was overruled,
and the request of the attorney of Mr. Douglas complied with, for no
other apparent reason than to forestall the action of the Board of Regents
at its present session. This was manifest from the fact that Judge Douglas forced the motion to a hearing by the declaration that they had an
object in having the motion disposed of at that time, which he did not
choose to disclose, and the court recognized that to be the object of Douglas by using the following language in the decision of said motion, viz:
"Each party seems to be seeking to bring about something that they no
doubt very properly withhold from the court."
On the 2ISt inst. the counsel for Douglas moved the rehearing of the
cause in the absence of the counsel for 1hose, and without any notice to
Rose or his counsel, and although the commissioner had not reported the




182 -

testimony taken, under such order for rehearing, or made a report under the order of reference for accounting, and the court upon the motion
of the counsel of said Douglas, dismissed the petition for rehearing and
vacated the order for rehearing, thus excluding from the consideration
of the court all the testimony taken under such order for rehearing on
behalf of said Rose, which is material and important to this case.
These facts appear by tile records and files in said cause and by the
notes of the reporter of said court, and ean be corroborated by the testiinonv of disinterested persons present in caurt.

P. B. ROSE.

- 186 -


To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
The undersigned have read the statement of R. A. Beal and P. B.
Rose in respect to the proceedings in the Laboratory suit since the granting of the order for rehearing on the 3oth day of November last. To us
it appears to contain numerous misstatements which the time at our disposal does not enable us to correct, but we beg leave to refer to some of
them
It is true that the order for rehearing made on the 3oth of October
was not settled and signed until the 7th of November. But under the
construction claimed for it for the defendants Rose, Beal and Smith, and
which we believe to be correct, they were entitled to fifteen days from the
time when the order was signed and filed to take their testimony, and
they actually took this time with our assent, and they even took some testimony after the expiration of said fifteen days.
The two students claimed by this statement to be residing in Ohio
when last heard from were Mr. Massey and Mr. J. E. Hewitt, and Mr.
Massey is the same person claimed in the statement to be in the U. S.
Army. and whose whereabouts is unknown. As to diligence used by
Rose to obtain the testimony of Hewitt, and the value of that testimony
if obtained, we refer to the accompanying affidavit of Samuel T. Douglas, and the correspondence thereto annexed. As to the character of testimony which was taken before the commissioner, it will best speak for
itself. It is now in the hands of the commissioner and accessible to the
Board. We submit that on the question as to annual settlements between
Rose and Douglas of the kind described by Rose, it neither proves nor
tends to prove them.  The testimony of two students named in the
petition for rehearing zwas taken, namely, Mr. Hoyt, of Grand Trunk
Junction, and Mr. 0. C. Johnson, assistant in the Laboratory. The object
of the testimony of these students was to explain why the last credit
entries in their accounts, and the red lines on the stubs of their accounts
were in a kind of red ink which was not used in the Laboratory until
November, 187I, by showing that they were not paid until after the settlement between Rose and Douglas near the close of the fiscal year 1870 -7I. The red line was drawn on the stub, as a voucher when the student's
ticket corresponding was turned over to Dr. Douglas, and as evidence of
that fact, Rose has testified on all previous occasions that the tickets of
these and the other students named in the petition for rehearing were
turned over to Dr. Douglas in the fiscal year I870-71. If such was the
fact, the color of the ink of the red lines, as we claim, showed that they
were forgeries. Hoyt testified that he paid his account in March, I87I,
which corresponded with the date in the ledger, and showed that if he
(Rose) paid Hoyt's account to Dr. Douglas, it must have been in the fiscal
year 187o-7I. IIe also produced his ticket from which it appeared that
it never had been turned over to Dr. Douglas, whence it appeared that the
red line of the stub of his account was a forgery.
Mr. Johnson testified to nothing which we deem at all material to the
matter in controversy.
The action of the court in refusing to extend the time for taking testimony under the order for rehearing was based upon affidavits on the
part of defendant Douglas, to which we beg leave to refer, and which set
forth fully the course of proceedings in taking testimony under the order
for rehearing, and refer at large to the testimony which has been taken,
from which, as we claim, the court was fully justified in refusing to extend
the time.
The court at the same time announced that if the defendants, Rose,
Beal, and Smith should be able to produce any further testimony, it miiht
be heard in open court on the final hearing of the case. The giving of
ten dollars costs against Rose, and in favor of his co-defendant Douglas
was, we submit, proper? and in accordance with the practice of the court;




187 -these co-defendants being as to this matter of the accounting the only
adverse parties. The decretal order of October 26th, which was vacated
in part on the granting of the petition for rehearing was restored on the
motion of the defendant, Douglas, on the ground that the court had no
power to vacate it, and that it had been vacated inadvertently and erroneously, without any discussion or examination as to the proper practice
in such cases. His decision on this point is subject to review by the Supreme Court. Whether it is right or wrong is a pure question of law,
which cannot be discussed here. It is certainly right that the decree
should stand as a protection to the rights of parties till it is found on
rehearing or review by the Supreme Court to be erroneous. We deny
that in restoring the decree the court overruled any decision of the
Supreme Court, or that Judge Huntington made the statement imputed to
him.
As to the proceedings which resulted in a dismissal of the petition
for rehearing we beg leave to state that the cause was placed on the calendar for the present term on application of counsel for the Regents on
the first day of the term, none of the defendants interposing any objection thereto; this occurred on January 2d. The cause was not taken up
until after the jury business, and all other business of the term was disposed of, and the court was about to adjourn, this being the last case on
the docket. On Thursday of last week the court in the presence of the
counsel for the defendants Rose and Douglas set down the rehearing for
Monday morning, January 2Ist. On Monday morning, the case being
called up on the opening of the court, the counsel for Rose and Beal were
not present, the counsel for Douglas announced their readiness to proceed with the rehearing. The court suggesting that possibly Mr. Sawver was ill, waited until about ten o'clock, meanwhile sending an officer
in search of him. He had been seen by the party in charge of the court
house. near the court house between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning in
conference with defendant Beal. The officer in search could not find him
in his office. He was then directed by the court to go to his house for
him. On his way he met the defendant Beal, and was informed by him
that Mr. Sawyer had gone to Detroit, and said soon after that he had
gone to Chelsea. The officer went to his house, did not find him in his
house, but found him in his barn. The officer notified Mr, Sawyer that
this case had been called on and the court desired his presence. Mr.
Sawyer soon thereafter came to his office, and in the meantime the court
took up another case, and postponed the hearing of this until it should
be disposed of and sent Mr. Davis, who has charge of the court room to
notify Mr. Sawyer that this case would be taken up as soon as the case
then before the court wais disposed of. Mr. Davis did so, to which Mr.
Sawyer replied, go on with the hearing and be damned, that he would
give it no further attention, and would not attend upon the hearing. The
case was not again reached until the evening session, and no counsel
appearing on the part of the defendants Rose, Beal, et al., and the petitioners not being present, but having refused to attend, the petition was
dismissed according to the established practice in chancery in such cases.
It i- true that the testimony taken before the commissioner under the
order for rehearing had not been filed, and we venture the prediction that
it never will be, for the reason that it is favorable to the defendant Douglas and adverse to the defendant Rose. On the part of the defendant
Douglas, repeated applications have been made to the commissioner to
return that testimony into court, to which his only reply has been that he
would see Mr. Sawyer about it. It is also true that the commissioner has
not yet filed his report under the reference for an accounting, but it was
not in any way important that it should be filed for any purpose of the
rehearing.
As counsel for Dr. Douglas, we hereby consent that the testimony




- 188 -

taken under the order for rehearing may be filed and may be used as part
of the evidence in this case on appeal to the Supreme Court.

The following paper, from Mr. A. J. Sawyer, Attorney, was
received, and by request was read by Regent Cutcheon:
To the Honorable the Board of Regents of the Universitlv f li/chiioan:
The undersigned would most respecfully request that he may be permitted to correct some erroneous statements contained in the conmntunication this day filed with the Steward and signed by E. D. Kinne and S.
T. Douglas.
ist. The statement that Hoyt testifies that he paid his account in
March, 1871, is not correct. He testified that he had no knowledge on
the subject, but presumed he had paid it from the fact that he always
intended to pay his debts,




191 -The testimony of O. C. Johnson, I deem very material, and if this
testimony was so favorable to Douglas, can any reason be assigned why
Douglas should make such frantic efforts to suppress it?
2d. Whether the court was justified in refusing to extend the time
for Rose to complete his testimony, will depend entirely upon whether it
is the object of this suit to arrive at justice irrespective whom it may benefit, or to arrive at a decree within a given time.
3d. The statement that the court at the time he refused the application of Rose for further time, announced that if the defendant Rose should
be able to produce any further testimony, it might be read in open court
on the final hearing of the cause, is so wide of the truth that it requires
the exercise of great Christian meekness not to pronounce it designedly
false, as it is certainly untrue in every particular.
The truth is that counsel for Rose fairly supplicated the court to be
permitted to introduce their testimony at the hearing, if Rose should be
able to obtain it at that time, to which counsel for Douglas objected, and the
court refused the request.
I have in my possession a copy of the stenographer's notes of the opinion of the Judge in restoring the decretal order, and the extract from it in
the statement made by Beal and Rose is correct, and I will produce the
entire decision for the inspection of any person interested.
4th. To the statement that no counsel for the defendant objected to
the placing of the case on the docket on the first day of the present term,
I desire to say the statement is a mistake. I not only opposed it but the
court himself intimated that he had some doubt about such a practice.
5th. To the statement that on Thursday, of last week, the court in
the presence of the counsel of defendants Rose and Douglas, set down the
rehearing for Monday morning, January 2Ist, I desire to say I heard no
such thing and had no knowledge thereof.
6th. To the statement that on Monday morning I was seen between
8~ and 9 o'clock in the morning in conference with defendant Beal, and to
the effort to make it appear that I hid away or evaded meeting any responsibility, I wish to sav that the statement does not contain a word of truth.
The following are the facts: On Saturday afternoon, my brother called
to visit me; I visited with him until Monday morning. While I was
assisting him in getting up his horse, the officer came and notified me
that the court desired to see me. This was as late as Io o'clock A. M. I
had not seen Beal that morning. As soon as my brother had taken his
departure, I repaired to the court room, where I found the court engaged
in the trial of another cause, which could not well have been if the RoseDouglas case had been the last case as stated. I make this statement
because of the unprovoked attack made upon me, and beg to call the
attention of the Honorable Body hereto as an act of self-defense.
Respectfully,
A. J. SAWYER.
At the conclusion of the reading of the paper, Regent Rynd
moved that it be accepted and printed in the minutes, which
motion prevailed.
Regent Duffield, in behalf of the Ccmmittee on Literary
Department, submitted   the  following resolution  which  was
adopted:
Resolved, That the condition of the funds of the University is such
that it is inexpedient to incur any additional expenses for lectures during
the present year.

193 -UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, '
Wednesday, January 23, 1878.     }
The Board of Regents reconvened in the room of the President at 9 o'clock A. M.
Present, a full Board.
The resolution submitted by Regent Climie yesterday, which
was made the special order for this hour was taken up, and
Regent Grant addressed the Board at length. At the conclusion of Regent Grant's remarks the discussion of the resolution
was continued by Regent Rynd, and during his address he submitted and read the following communication from Hon. I. P.
Christiancy:
UNITED STATES SENATE CHAMBER,
Washington, January 4, 1878.  5
DR. C. RYND, Regent of the University:
Dear Sir,-Yours of the first inst. received. Being a Regent of the
University, gives you the right to call upon me for the information you
seek; and if I had all the papers relative to the Rose-Douglas case here,
and the necessary time for the purpose, I should answer all the specific
inquiries which you make, with more certainty than I can now. But
want of papers and want of time compel me to answer more generally
and in a briefer form than I otherwise should.
I consented to go into the suit on behalf of the Regents with the
hope that, by a fair and impartial trial, and one which should be seen by
the public to be so, the popular excitement and hostility to the University
which had been created, would be allayed, and the University strengthened in the confidence of the people. But to accomplish this end, it was
not only necessary that entire impartiality should be observed by the
Regents as between Rose and Douglas, and that the trial between them
should be fair and impartial, but it was equally necessary that it should
be shown to the public to be so.
As, in a prior stage of the case, much feeling had been excited between
one of the parties and the Judge, or the active friend of one of them against
the Judge of that circuit, and a large portion of the people had been
made to suspect that the Judge would not be able to lay aside all feeling or
prejudice which they feared would naturally grow out of prior occurrences in the suit; and as the Judge himself would naturally feel the
embarrassment of his position from this cause, in trying the suit, under
the consciousness that such a feeling existed, and would be much more liable to have his actions and motives misconstrued, than a JudMe who had
never had any connection with the case; and that even the same rulings
and decisions by another Judge, would be more likely to command the
ready acquiescence of the people, and allay public excitement, and avoid
popular prejudice, I did hope and believe that the Judge of this circuit
would see the propriety of calling some other Circuit Judge to hear the
cause. And the Judge seemed at first, if not afterwards, to have felt the
force of these considerations himself, and made arrangements with another Judge to come and try the cause. On the part of Rose and his
friends, the feeling was very strong against having the case tried by Judge
Huntington; while they seemed to be quite willing that it should be tried
before any other Circuit Judge. But on the other hand I could not fail
to see that Douglas and his friends were unwilling to try the case before




- 194 -any other Judge. It seems to me that both parties erred in this. Jielieving Judge Huntington an honest man, and that he would decide the case
upon his own convietions of right, I thought Rose and his friends erred
in judgment through what I deemed an honest prejudice; and satisfied
that any other Circuit Judge would be just as likely to decide it correctly
I thought the other side equally erring in insisting that the case should
not be tried by any other Judge.
Some days previous to the commencement of the trial the Judge had
announced that he expected another Judge to come and try the cause;
but a day or two before the trial was to open, I learned that the other
Judge would not be present, and that Judge Huntington intended to try
the case himself. I regretted this, not because I had any doubts of the
integrity of Judge Huntington, but because I saw from the agitation in
the public mind, that the rulings and decisions which he should make, if
against Rose, would not be likely to quiet the public excitement, nor to
secure the popular acquiescence; and that the University would still be
likely to feel the force of popular hostility. And I felt that justice might
have been just as well subserved, and all public prejudice and hostility to
the University avoided. Now in this connection I will answer your question as to a jury trial of the facts. It was a case in which the Judge had
a right, but it was not his imperative duty to call a jury. The question
of forgery was a proper question for a jury; but it involved all the evidence in the cause, and all the accounts between the parties; and
the Judge in trying the case would not have been bound by the
verdict.  It was purely a matter of discretion  whetherhe would
order a jury or not. But in deciding the question, the Judge would
have probably avoided some unfavorable comments, if he had decided it
at once, when the argument was made on the motion for a jury, instead
of reserving the question for a future stage of the case, for the purpose
of seeing more clearly the nature of the questions. These were as apparent after the first day's evidence as they ever became afterwards. But he
waited until all the evidence was in, and then proposed to remove the
case to the Jackson Circuit and call a jury, for which, to sav the least.
the power is very questionable, and the whole evidence would have had
to be taken again before the jury, just as it had been already for five or
six weeks before the court, and the whole proceeding might have to be
disregarded for want of power, and even if the power existed, he might
refuse to be bound by the verdict. But the course taken by the Judge,
while it may have been an error of judgment, does not warrant any impeachment of his integrity.
As to your first question whether I think the Regents could or should
have held Douglas, as director and manager responsible primarily for
any defalcation which may have existed; and the second qvestion, whether the financial interests of the Regents required that Rose should be
made a party to the suit?
I think it quite clear that for defaults happening during the fore part
and greater part of the period while Rose was assistant, and certainly
until the Regents expressly recognized him by name as such, Douglas could have been held primarily responsible. After that period it is
not so clear that he conld, though I am inclined to think that he
could. But to avoid this doubt, and because a bill against the two would
give each an opportunity of trying the whole controversy in a single suit,
itwas entirely proper to make both parties defendants, and place them
upon an equal footing, as was done by the amended bill, not by the
original.
As to your eighth question, on what points in your resolution for
amendmlent to the bill have the Regents a legitimate claim? I have
not that resolution before me; but speaking from recollection, I should
say that the only legitimate claim under those amendments would be




-195 -

that for interest against Douglas. The others, as I remember them,
besides the objection for multifariousness, could not, so far as the examinations by Mr. Webber and myself extended, be substantiated by the
proofs; or at least we did not find such proofs. But all right of amendment is still reserved by stipulation as against Douglas, until the
accounting is complete between Rose and Douglas.
The fifth and sixth question I answer together. As to the question of
forgery of the letter "D" and the "red lines," upon which the merits
mainly turn, I will say that the direct evidence bearing upon this point,
such as given by experts, by comparison of hands, and the color of the
ink, failed to make upon my mind the strong impression which they seem
to have made upon the mind of the Judge. And upon the hearing of the
evidence, and such examination as I was able to make of the papers
during the trial, I looked upon this evidence as a failure. But I am bound
in candor to say that I did not have, and could not get, during the time,
the same full opportunity for thorough examination and comparison that
the Judge had when he came to take up the papers at his leisure, and
which it is fair to presume he made before, or at the time of writing his
opinion. And it is therefore possible that if I had had the same opportunity
and made such thorough examination at my leisure, I might have found
some force in the evidence furnished by comparison of hands, and of
colors of lines, which with the opportunity I had, I failed to discover.
But there was another and very important branch of evidence in this
cause which must not be overlooked; and which has an important
bearing upon the question of forgery. If there was no forgery of letters
" D" or of red lines or others upon stubs, then Rose was not a defaulter; or
at least a defaulter to any amount which would have been so material as to
lead to this, or to any other litigation. And yet the conduct of Rose upon
being charged with the default in reference to a large part of the items,
and for some time after the investigation commenced, was such as might
well be construed into an admission of the charge. This conduct, and
the reasons for it, Rose undertook to explain; and the force o'f the evidence, and its effect as tending to prove forgery, must depend upon the
view taken of the explanation. I can readily see that this conduct and
this explanation of it, will naturally make very different impressions upon
different minds To me, the explanation seemed probable and reasonable;
and I therefore saw nothing in the case satisfying me of Rose's guilt. But
I can well see that minds equally honest and equally intelligent might
reach the opposite conclusion.
I have not had the testimony before me since the trial, having handed
over the copy belonging to the counsel of the Regents to the Judge. He
has had a better opportunity than I had to make a critical examination.
It is fair to presume that he has made it. Cettainly under these circumstances, I can see no ground for charging the Judge with dishonesty; nor
even for asserting that he has reached a wrong conclusion because it
happens to be a different conclusion from what I drew at the time with
less opportunity for careful examination.
As to your seventh question-whether the ends of justice will be fully
subserved by the Regents collecting the amount of the defalcation based
upon the judgment given by the court-this upon the explanation
already given is a question which the Regents are as competent as I am
to decide.
Very respectfully yours,
I. P. CHRISTIANCY.
On the close of Regent Rynd's remarks on the resolution the
following '" statement and petition, subscribed and sworn to by
B




i196 
k. A. Beal," was submitted, read, and ordered to be printed in
the minutes of the meeting.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of the State
of Michzigan:
The statement and petition of Rice A. Beal respectfully states and
shows to your Honorable body that he was induced to become the surety
of Preston B. Rose, upon the bond upon which his alleged liability
arises, in the case of this Board against him and others, in the Circuit
Court for the County of Washtenaw, in Chancery, and procured Ransom S.
Smith, deceased, to become such surety, upon the express arrangement and
agreement with some of the then members of your Honorable body that an
action at law should be instituted by your Board for the purpose of settling
the laboratory defalcation, and that an issue should be joined between the
parties at the then term of said court, and he would not have entered
into said bond, or procured said Smith to have executed the same, except
for such arrangement and agreement; and subsequent to the execution of
such bond and its delivery the members of your Board, giving such
assurance, failed and refused to carry out such arrangement and agreement, but instituted the suit now pending in Chancery, in violation of
such arrangement and agreement and in violation of good faith towards
this petitioner.
Your petitioner further states and shows that he was induced to
consent to enter into the stipulation upon which the interlocutory decree
in said case was rendered upon the representations and assurances of the
Honorable Isaac P. Christiancy, the senior counsel of your Honorable
body that said cause would be tried by some other Judge than the Hon.
Geo. M. Huntington; that said Christiancy gave your petitioner to understand that an arrangement had been entered into by which said cause
would probably be tried by some Judge other than said Huntington; that
subsequent to such representations on the part of your counsel, he called
upon the Hon. Geo. M. Huntington, the Judge who tried said cause, and
had a friendly conversation with him, in which said Huntington stated to
your petitioner, that he ought not to try said cause, and would not do so,
if in his power to procure another Judge to do so, and that he would use
his best endeavors to procure another Judge to try the same, and upon
such representations and assurances of said Christiancy and of said Huntington to enter into such stipulation, which he would not have consented
to have done and would not have done except in reliance upon such representations and assurances.
Your petitioner further states and shows, that after all the evidence
had bee   v   n given in said cause before Judge Huntington, in said cause, and
after said Judge had decided to refer the questions of alleged forged red
lines, and initial "D's," and other questions for trial by jury, he was
induced to withdraw his claim to a jury to try such questions, upon the
statement and representations of said Christiancy, who had been present
and heard all of the evidence given upon said trial, that there was no evidence in the cause, by which the Judge, Hon. George M. Huntington,
would be authorized to find any of such red lines or initial "D's" were
forged, and that in case he should so find, he would make a representation
of the facts to this Board, by which your petitioner would be relieved in
the premises, and upon such representations and assurances of the senior
counsel of your Honorable Body, and upon those alone, he was induced to
withdraw his right to a trial of such questions to a jury, which had already
been ordered and directed, and he would not have consented to have withdrawn such right to a jury, and would not have withdrawn the same
except in reliance upon such representations and assurances.
Your petitioner further states and shows, that in case such decree,




- 197
which has been indicated by Judge Huntington, shall be insisted upon
by this Board, your petitioner alone will be obliged to pay and satisfy the
same, which he respectfully submits, would be a gross fraud upon him
and his rights in the premises, and one which neither your Honorable
body or the people of the State of Michigan, whose representatives you
are, in the premises, cannot afford to perpetrate as against one of its own
citizens, and he humbly submits his rights, and the rights of his co-defendants in said cause to the consideration of your Honorable Body, in
implicit reliance on receiving justice at your hands.
And as in duty bound, &c.

HON. S. S. WALKER: Sir-It is necessary that a new Altitude and
Azimuth Instrument be provided for the Engineering Department. In the

The above is very respectfully submitted to your notice.

Regent E. C. Walker announced that the Senior Class of the
Department of Law desired to present a petition to the Board
relative to the remission of the diploma fee for the current year
for reasons stated in the petition. He also stated that the Chairman of the Committee of the Senior Class, who was appointed
to present the petition was present, and asked that leave be
granted him to read it. Permission was granted. The petition
having been read, it was referred to the Committee on the Law
Department.
The Chairman of the Committee on Museum submitted the
following report:
The Committe to whom was referred the communication of Rev.
Marcus Lane relative to the sale of a Cabinet of Mineralogical Specimens
would report that it is, in their opinion, inexpedient to purchase the same
at this time.
S. S. WALKER, Chairman.
The Committee on Literary Department, through Regent E.
C. Walker, submitted the following report:
The Committee on the Literary Department, to whom was referred
the communication of Professor H. S. Frieze and Prof. M. L. D'Ooge,
relative to the purchase of "some drawings in architecture," recommend that in the present state of our finances the request be not granted.
E. C. WALKER,
Of the Committee.
On motion of Regent Rynd, the Committee on Buildings and
Grounds were requested to examine the mode of lighting building
with gas manufactured from gasoline, and report at the Mar_.
meeting of the Board.
The following report was submitted by the Chairman of the
Committee on the Law Department and was accepted and adopted:
To the Hon. the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN-The Committee on the Law Department, to whom was
referred the petition of the Senior Class for a remission of their diploma
fee, in view of the fact that the plans of the Regents for the more corn.
plete instruction in their department have not been carried out, report.
That the additional diploma fee was added as a means of increased
income to the University, and was made to apply to every student alike in
all departments. That although it was the intention of the Regents that
the Law Department should have additional help in instruction, and those




plans have failed from inability to procure the desired aid-yet this additional help was not predicated on the additional diploma fee.
The Committee therefore recommend that the request of the Senior
Law Class be not granted.
E. C. WALKER,
Chairman Committee.
Regent Climie, Chairman of the Finance Committee submitted the following resolution:
Resolved, That the sum of $236 55 be and hereby is appropriated for
Regents' expenses.
The resolution was adopted by vote as follows:
Ayes-Regents Grant, Rynd, E. C. Walker, Climie, Cutcheon, S. S. Walker, Duffield and Maltz.
On motion of E. C. Walker, the Board adjourned.

Present, Regents Rynd, Climie, Duffield and Maltz. No quorum present.
Regent Rynd read the following paper and asked that it be
spread upon the minutes.
The undersigned, Regents of the University of Michigan, deem it
their duty to place on record the following statement of facts. They find
themselves assembled, under the call of the President, and at the usual
time, unable to proceed in the proper exercise of their functions as Regents, because of the fact that a quorum of the Board is not in attendance at the appointed and usual place of meeting, and they further find
that from the above cause the work of the University is being obstructed,
and its interests are being neglected. The cause or causes which have
resulted in the present condition of affairs may be stated as follows:
On the 26th day of March, 1878, Regent Maltz introduced the following preamble and resolutions:
WHEREAS, In the judgment of this Board, Preston B. Rose, late
Assistant in the Chemical Laboratory, is not a defaulter in the matter of
the so called Laboratory Deficit; and,
WHEREAS, such opinion based upon the researches and investigations
of this Board, is supported by the Legislature of the State, and confirmed
by the written opinion of Senator Christiancy, late senior counsel of this
Board; therefore,




- 211 -


Resolved, That in the matter of the suit of the Regents of the University of Michigan against Preston B. Rose, Silas H. Douglas and Rice
A. Beal, and Willard B. Smith, John Q Wilson and H. S. Street, executors, in the Circuit Court for the County of Washtenaw, State of Michigan, in chancery, that so much of the decree in said suit as orders or
adjudges any sum of money whatever to be paid by said Preston B. Rose
as principal, or his sureties, is fully remitted and cancelled; and that B.
F. Granger, solicitor and counselor for complainants in said suit, be and
is hereby directed to discharge decree of record as against said Preston B.
Rose and his sureties, saving and reserving all the rights of the complainants in said suit and under said decree as against Silas H. Douglas.
Resolved, That Preston B. Rose be, and is hereby, appointed Assistant Professor of Physiological Chemistry, at a salary of $I,8oo per annum, commencing April I. I878.
This matter coming before the Board in due form and according to
parliamentary usage, a free discussion of the preamble and resolution
was permitted.
Regent Grant made a lengthy speech in opposition thereto. During
the progress of Regent Grant's speech, Regents E. C. Walker and S. S.
Walker retired. On the conclusion of his remarks the Board was notified
by that gentleman that " he did not care to stay any longer." As this
action would leave the Board without a quorum, Regent Climie moved
the previous question, which was recognized by the chair before Regent
Grant left the room. This was done to secure a vote on the question at
issue, it being the evident purpose of the voluntary absentees to prevent
a quorum, regardless of the consequences which might ensue, either to
the students who had not been graduated, or to the University.
Since that time there has not been a quorum present. The undersigned have adjourned from time to time, with the hope thut a sufficient
number of the Regents would be present, to perform the duties of the
office to which they had been elected. The President of the Board and the
undersigned Regents have earnestly invited their presence, and have aforded them every possible facility for such attendance.
They have refused except on terms which involved the surrender of
the rights of the Board in the business which is properly before it; and
the further surrender of the parliamentary rights of a majority present,
to an absenting minority.
We have no design at this time to discuss the merits or demerits of
the resolutions. For our official action we are responsible to the people.
We do not wish to shirk by absenteeism or otherwise, such responsibility.
Our absent colleagues were not denied the right of making such record
as to them might seen proper, We were anxious to settle the unfortunate
B




-212 -

difficulty and so far as we had the power, right the wrongs of the past two
years.
We believe that we are right. We solemnly assert that we are acting according to our convictions of duty. The minority, from their stand-point,
may have been honest in their opposition. We were willing and anxious
to join with them in making a record, leaving such record to the supreme
arbiters,-the people of Michigan. We will add:
Ist. The resolutions of Regent Maltz were not presented in a surreptitious manner to the Board, as similar action was proposed at the January meeting.
2d. Due notice was given at that meeting that we should, in future,
endeavor to accomplish what was then proposed.
3d. No advantage was taken of Regent Cutcheon's absence. We had
no knowledge touching his probable vote. His absence was due to the
serious illness of his wife. We repel the insinuations made by interested
parties that General Cutcheon either absented himself from unworthy
motives, or that his vote in January was given on the merits of the
case. He distinctly stated in his place that his action "was not based
upon a consideration of the merits of the case, but upon what he believed
to be the well established rules of legal procedure." This much in justice to a gentleman who is, in our judgment, incapable of an unworthy
motive, and who would not consent to occupy a dishonorable position.
4th. The recommendations of the various Faculties were referred
to the appropriate Committees, on motion of one of the absentees. That
of the Law Faculty was at once reported upon, and action taken by the
Board without obstruction or opposition. The recommendations in the
hands of the Medical Committee could not be so disposed of, as there
were disputed questions, involving investigation on the part of the Committee, and the re-examination of a number of candidates. We are convinced that our duty required us to do justice, by patient and careful investigation, to every candidate, at the same time protecting the interests
of the University.
5th. We submit that no such action as that taken by the minority
was ever attempted by the undersigned, when in a minority on questions
connected with the same case.
6th. In June, I876, the absentees with others, then a majority of the
Board, at a meeting held at an unusual time, and against the earnest protest, in writing, of General Cutcheon, and the verbal protest of Regent
Climie, then present, proceeded to expel, and did expel Preston B. Rose,
in the absence of two members of the Board, who were known to be opposed to such expulsion, and before any action had been taken in the
courts touching the guilt or innocence of said Rose.




-213 -

7th. Dr. Angell, the President, and the undersigned members of the
Board have been and are now present for the transaction of its business.
We respectfully submit the above to the people in the full confidence that
a course which necessarily, and from present indications permanently,
obstructs the business of this Board will not meet the approval of fairminded and honorable men.

ANDREW CLIMIE,
GEORGE DUFFIELD,

S. S. Walker in behalf of the committee on the Museum read
the following paper:
ANNARBOR, APRIL II, I878.
To the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
The undersigned, Rice A. Beal and J. B. Steere, hereby promise and
agree to and with the said Board of Regents, that we will transfer and
convey an undivided one-half interest in and to the collection, now on
deposit with the University, known as the Beal-Steere collection in full
liquidation of the decree recently rendered in the Circuit Court for the
County of Washtenaw, in chancery, against Preston B. Rose and his




-223 -sureties, and on the acceptance of this proposition by the Board of Regents, we hereby agree to make a good, clear, and indefeasible title to
our one-half interest in said property, which half interest in said property
we hold at the sum of ten thousand dollars.
And we further undertake and agree that we will sell and convey to
the said Board of Regents the remaining one-half interest in and to said
collection, at any time within two years from this date, at the option of
said Board of Regents, for the sum of ten thousand dollars, or we will
sell the said one-half interest in said collection at a valuation to be fixed
by a committee of two or more referees to be appointed by the Executive
Committee of the Board of Regents, be the said valuation more or less.
Or at the option of said Board, we consent to a partition of said collection, provided that the first part of said proposition alone is accepted.
Provided, that so far as practicable the said collection shall remain intact, and continue to be known as the Beal-Steere collection.
RICE A BEAL,
JOSEPH BEAL STEERE.
I make the foregoing proposition upon my part not because I recognize the above mentioned decree as a just and equitable claim against
me, but because the court, Judge Huntington presiding, has rendered
the decree against me.
RICE A. BEAL.
Regent S. S. Walker, having finished the reading of the fore.
going proposition from Messrs. Beal and Steere, submitted the
same to the Board without recommendation and asked that the
committee be discharged from the further consideration of the
subject.
On motion of Regent Grant the paper read         by Regent
Walker was accepted and the committee discharged.
Regent E. C. Walker submitted the following resolution,
which was accepted by Regent Maltz, to stand in lieu of the
first resolution which was submitted by him and which was
made the special order of this hour.
The resolution of Regent E. C. Walker is as follows:
Resolved, That the proposition of R. A. Beal and J. B. Steere, as reported to the Board by the Committee for the Museum, be accepted so
far as the purchase of an undivided half of said Beal-Steere collection is
concerned and so far as the option is given to the Board to buy the otherhalf or divide the collection.
After some discussion of the resolutions of Regent Maltz and
the proposition of Messrs. Beal and Steere, Regent Grant submitted
the following resolution and moved its adoption:
Resolved, That the further consideration of this subject be postponed

The substitute above referred to and submitted by Regent
Grant reads as follows:

WHEREAS, by the consent of all parties and the unanimous vote of

Resolved, That the interests of the University require that neither
Professor Douglas nor Rose should ever be appointed to any position in

Ayes-Regents Grant, Rynd, E. C. Walker, Cutcheon, S. S.

The following is the paper submitted by Regent S. S.
Walker, and referred to in Regent Grant's resolution:
STATEMENT OF A PORTION OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.
We, the undersigned, members of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan make this statement to the public in explanation and
defence of our course to-day in leaving the Board without a quorum and




-227 -tlereby preventing the passage of the following resolutions introduced
by Regent Maltz:
WHEREAS, In the judgment of this Board, Preston B. Rose, late an
assistant in the Chemical Laboratory, is not a defaulter in the matter of
the so-called Laboratory deficit, and
WHEREAS, Such opinion based npon the researches and investigations of the Board is supported by the Legislature of the State and confirmed by the written opinion of Senator Christiancy, late senior counsel
for the Board, therefore
Resolved, In the matter of the suit of the Regents of the University
of Michigan against Preston B. Rose. Silas H. Douglas and Rice A.
Beal, and Willard B. Smith, John 0. Wilson, and Harvey S. Street, executors, in the Circuit Court for the County of Washtenaw, State of Michigan, in chancery, that so much of the decree in said suit as orders or
adjudges any sum or sums of money whatever, to be paid by said Preston
B. Rose as principal, or his sureties, is fully remitted and cancelled; and
that B. F. Granger, solicitor and counsel for the complainants in said
suit, be, and is hereby directed to formally discharge said decree of Record, as against said Preston B. Rose and his sureties, saving and
reserving all the-rights of the complainants in said suit and under said
decree as against Silas H. Douglas.
Resolved, That Preston B. Rose be, and hereby is appointed Assistant Professor of Physiological Chemistry at a salary of $I,8oo per
annum, commencing April ist, 1878.
After two years' contest in the Board over the Laboratory defalcation
it was at the October meeting of 1877 considered that it was forever
taken out of the hands of the Regents and transferred to the courts. All
the Regents expressed themselves gratified that the contest was forever
ended and that the University would soon get the money that had
so long been its due. This was stated with special vigor by Regent
Rynd.
At the next January meeting upon the coming in of two new Regents,
Maltz and Duffield, we were astonished by the unexpected introdnction
by Regent Climie of a resolution proposing to surrender without any
consideration all claim of the University to the decree for $4,624.40,
rendered in the Circuit Court for the County of Washtenaw, in chancery, in favor of the University and against Preston B. Rose and his
sureties. Regent Rynd advocated the resolution in a prepared, elaborate speech, but the resolution was lost by a vote of four to four,
Regent Cutcheon voting with the undersigned.
Immediately thereafter, Regent Maltz, a new member of the Board,
who could have known little of the merits of the case, introduced a
resolution, declaring the innocence of Dr. Rose in the face of the decree
of the court and restoring him to his position in the University, which
resolution failed to pass by the same vote.
At the present meeting of the Board Regent Cutcheon was detained
by the dangerous illness of his wife. Immediately this morning upon
the opening of the Board, Regent Maltz introduced the above resolutions,
being almost the identical resolutions introduced at the January meeting
and voted down. A motion was made to make the resolutions the special
order for two o'clock in the afternoon, which was voted down by an aye
and nay vote, Regents Rynd, Climie, Duffield and Maltz voting no. A
motion was then made to separate the resolutions, which was voted down
by the same vote. After Regent Grant had discussed the resolutions a
short time, the previous question was moved, pending which we left the
room and the Board was without a quorum.
The reasons for our course are as follows:
ist. The question of the relative liability of Rose and Douglas had
by the unanimous action of the Board and consent of the parties inter



228
ested been transferred to the court. It would be most unfair, after a
final decree for the University to override and reverse the decision of the
legal tribunal as to one only of the contestants.
2d. Prior to entering upon the trial of the case in court all the parties
to the litigation had voluntarily entered into a written stipulation that the
amount dne the University, was $5,671.87, and that the court was to
ascertain how much of this amount was in the hands of each of the parties defendant.
3d. Under this stipulation the parties went to trial and the court
fixed the liability of Rose for $4,624.40, and the payment of that
amount was well secured by his bondsmen. We consider it a gross breach
of trust on the part of the Board to surrender without consideration, in
obedience to outside and partizan pressure, that sum of money to the
bondsmen of Dr.i Rose, money which should be in the treasury and
belongs to the people of this State.
4th. The bondsmen of Dr. Rose signed his bond with full knowledge
of the circumstances and that Rose had been charged with the defalcation and after a committee of the Board, upon a careful and searching
investigation had found Rose liable for about the same amount as the
decree fixed upon him.
5th. We consider the surrender of a legal and collectable decree in
favor of the University, without consideration, to be illegal, and beyond
the power of the Board. The Board might as lawfully vote away the
people's money to any other party or for any other purpose, benevolent
or otherwise. The funds of the University are placed in our hands for
other and specific purposes.
6th. We consider the appointment of P. B. Rose to any position in
the University to be most unwise, because, ist, there is no vacancy in the
University and the duties of the position, to which by the resolution he
is to be appointed, are very ably performed by a competent person at less
than half the proposed salary; 2d, we believe him to be a defaulter to
the University and unworthy of any place of honor or trust in the gift of
the Board; 3d, no committee of investigation has ever exonerated him
from liability for a portion of the defalcation.
7th. Here was an attempt to set aside the conclusions of two committees of former Boards of Regents and the decisions of the Board based
upon them, and to reverse the decree of the court, by four Regents, not
a majority of the Board, two of whom have just become members, and
not one of whom, we venture to say, has ever read the testimony taken
upon the trial of the case before the court.
We desire to treat the questions involved in this controversy on the
basis of accepting the judgments of the-courts as final, and we believe
that the reinstatement of either party to the controversy would be unwise,
of no possible good, but of great injury to the interests we have sworn to
protect.
We did not withdraw from the meeting in any captious spirit. The
only business of importance left undone was the conferring of degrees
upon the graduates of the Medical Department, the Homeopathic College and the Dental College. We proposed to the other four members of
the Board present, to meet with them for the purpose of acting upon the
degrees, if they would agree to postpone action upon these resolutions to
a full meeting. We further proposed to telegraph Regent Cutcheon to
know if he could be here to-morrow and then bring the resolutions up,
but these propositions were rejected, thereby showing a determination to
force a vote on the resolutions without a full meeting.
Under the circumstances we saw no other way to prevent the perpetration of an outrageous wrong and injustice, the perversion of trust
funds, as well as injury to the University, than to withdraw. In doing




- 229 -
this we think we did our whole duty and we willingly submit it to the
judgment of the people.
C. B. GRANT,
E. C. WALKER,
SAMUEL S. WALKER.
ANN ARBOR, March 26, 1878.
The following is the!" Answer." which has been communicated to the Secretary by Regents Rynd, Climie, Duffield and
Maltz.
The undersigned, Regents of the University of Michigan, desire to
place on record the following statement of facts, touching certain points
made (or attempted) in a document signed by Regents C. B. Grant, E.
C. Walker, and S. S. Walker, who absented themselves from the regular
March Meeting of the Board, and thus, by leaving only the undersigned
in attendance, who did not constitute a quorum, succeeded in preventing
the transaction of all business,-the graduating of the Medical and Dental students included. Although the paper of the absentees was not presented to the undersigned, nor, so far as we know, to either the President or
Secretary, but was prepared for the newspapers, yet we have made no
objection to its being spread upon the minutes, and are willing that the
absentees should have all the credit of their voluntary withdraw al, and
also of the above document, which seenms to be a sort of argument in defense of such an unusual and revolutionary proceeding.
I. The public are told that " by the unanimous action of the Board,
and consent of the parties interested, the case (of the University vs.
Douglas and Rose) has been transferred to the courts." The public are
not told that Regents Cutcheon, Collier, Climie and Rynd voted in May,
I877, to dismiss the chancery suit as against Rose and his sureties,-just
what the undersigned proposed at the March, 1878, Meeting; that the
original suit in chancery was not instituted by authority of the Board of
Regents, but was the surreptitious action of a part of the Executive
Committee; that it was held in chancery by a tie vote of the Regents;
that four of the Regents endeavored to mend what they could not dismiss,-this being the "unanimous action" referred to; that the attorney
of Dr. Douglas, one of the defendants, was the solicitor of record for
the Regents in a suit against Douglas and Rose; that Rose was willing
as stated by Senator Christiancy, to have his case submitted to any other
judge, but Douglas was opposed to the submission of his case to any
other judge than Mr. Huntington; that Judge Huntington refused to
grant a jury; that he finally offered to submit certain points at issue to a
jury in Jackson County; that such submission would have necessitated
a partial rehearing, involving great expense to the litigants; that the
counsel of the Regents doubted the legality of such transfer to Jackson
County, and that from the beginning of the case till this time every step
taken by the prosecutors and the court seemed to be eminently satisfactory
to one of the defendants, and to compromise the interests of the other.
2  The public are told that " all the parties to the litigation voluntarily entered into a written stipulation that the amount due the Universitywas $5,671.87."
That this amount, and much more, was due the University was never
questioned by the undersigned, and we were fully satisfied that not only
was the late Director of the Laboratory primarily responsible for the defalcation, but also that the Legislature, through its able and impartial
joint committee, was correct in tracing all, or nearly all, the defalcation
into the treasury of Silas H. Douglas. Unquestionably the defendant
Rose entered into this stipulation, conscious of his innocence, and fully
believing that an able and unprejudiced judge would so determine.




-230


The public are not told that the " voluntary" action of Rose and his
bondsmen was secured by the grasp of an existing suit in chancery, from
which they could not escape; the information is not given that the
chancery suit, at least, so far as it might prejudice the interests of Rose's
bondsmen, was a violation of good faith and common honesty; that it
was a trick to which honorable men would not resort; and that the bond
was given in view of a simple suit in law (before a jury).
The "voluntary stipulation" was necessitated by a combination of
circumstances which neither Rose nor his bondsmen could have prevented, and which were the outgrowth of the machinery set in motion by
some members of the Executive Committee, maintained throughout by
the defendant Douglas, and sustained by the court,-a decree being granted which, we presume, was eminently satisfactory to the absentee
Regents, and which was equally satisfactory to Douglas, if we may be
permitted to judge from the urgency of his counsel in having it entered.
The " stipulation " was forced on Rose by measures iniquitously legal,
and from which he had neither appeal nor remedy, except through the
Regents, and the four men who voted to discontinue in May last were not
a majority.
3. The attention of the public is called to a decree in favor of the
University of $4,624.40, and which cannot be surrendered without a
"great breach of trust."
If the absentees had been as anxious to prevent the occurrence of a
' great breach of trust" when they permitted Douglas to " run " the concern for so many years, without let, hindrance, or examination, as they now
are to make R. A. Beal pay for the result of the Ex-Director's mismanagement and utter neglect of duty, the defalcation never would have
occurred. Had they been as faithful in the effort to hold Douglas, as
agent of the University, to a strict accounting, as they now seem to be in
extracting money from the bondsmen of Rose by measures, which mav
meet their approval, but which certainly do not command the respect of
the people of Michigan, the expense, strife, and wretchedness, growing
out of nearly two years of tortuous litigation would have been unnecessary. Whether viewed in the light of simple justice to Rose and his
bondsmen, or from the stand-point of public morality, we pity the men
-who can, without compunction, take from Rose that which the Legislature of the State traced to the capacious pockets of Douglas, a finding
which we believe to have been essentially correct. Without, at this time,
committing ourselves in regard to the collecting of the defalcation, on
the basis of Judge Huntington's decree, we snbmit that the people of
Michigan could better afford to lose the money, than appear as aiders
and abettors to the meandering course which has culminated in a verdict,
-a verdict which has utterly failed to secure the assent of the people.
and which cannot be considered as either equitable or just. If the refusal
to stamp with our approbation, a verdict at variance with our ideas of
right; if our hesitation to take, even nnder the forms of law, money from
the bondsmen of a person whom we consider innocent, and which we
firmly believe is in the possession of another, be considered a " great
breach of trust" by the absentees, we shall make an appeal to the people,
who generally give an ultimate verdict for the right. Let our constituents decide as to who has committed an official "breach of trust."
4. The public are informed that the bond was given " with full
knowledge. of the circumstances," and " after a committee of the Board
had found Rose liable."
The public are not informed that the chancery suit had not been instituted when the bond was given; that the bond was given with the
clear understanding on the part of the sureties that the cause should be
tried before a jury. There is no intimation that the attorney of Rose
presented himself, by "stipulation," in court, to join issue in a suit at




law; that the person who then assumed to direct the interests of the
University refused to meet the issue as had been agreed upon, and subsequently, instituted a chancery suit, based on a bill of complaint which
was a special plea for Douglas, and an argument against Rose; that in
view of the history of the case in relation to the institution of chancery
proceedings, " the bond was not given with a full knowledge of the circumstances." The information is not given that the " Committee of the
Board" but registered the Dec. '75 findings of Douglas. The public are
not told that Rose " had been found liable " without any form of hearing;
that he was expelled on an ex-parte investigation, against the remonstrance
of two absent members of the Board, and at an unusual time of meeting,
and that the late absentees voted for the dismissal, in the light, and as
the result, of thtir own investigation.
5. The absentees object to the reinstatement of Dr. Rose, because
" a competent person performs the work" at a salary of $750per annum.
This is a transparent begging of the question. This method of appointing men has never obtained in the University. An examination of
the case may not only convince our absentee friends, but may also satisfy
the public, as to the economy resulting from the dismissal of Rose. By
referring to the reports made to the Superintendent of Public Instruction we
find that, (in addition to the salary paid Douglas, whose place as Professor of Chemistry is now filled by Dr. Langley, and also omitting the
salary paid to Dr. Langley) there were employed in the Laboratory in
I873, two persons, salaries $3,500,-48 students in Pharmacy.
1874, two persons, salaries $3.500,-70 students in Pharmacy.
1875, three persons, salaries $4,ooo,-68 students in Pharmacy.
1876, seven persons, salaries, $6,750,-79 students in Pharmacy.
1877, seven persons. salaries, $6,ooo,-64 students in Pharmacy.
In 1876, the son of Dr. Douglas was provided for. Rose was first
dismissed in 1875. Vaughan and Crane were appointed in his place, and
the amount given is what the salaries would have' aggregated had all
been employed and paid for a full year which was not the case. In 1877,
Mr. Young was employed in " Chemistry and Physics," therefore we
have charged but half his salary, in the above exhibit, to the Laboratory.
In 1878, we are employing seven persons in the Laboratory, besides three
others, with "Divided duties in the Literary and Pharmaceutical Departments," at a salary of $3,600.
It is true that Dr. Vaughan has been receiving a salary of $750.00 as " a
competent person," in the Laboratory. He also graduated in the Medical
Department in April, 1878. The duties of the senior year in the Medical
Department usually occupy the full time and entire energies of an ordinary man. This young man was a successful student; graduated with
honor, and proved to be a " competent person," as an instructor in the
Laboratory, all at the same time. It would be interesting to ascertain
the exact nature and extent of the work which he performed and for
which he received $750.03. We do not understand the matter. Probably
the absentees can enlighten us. To us it appears that the expense has
been greatly increased since the dismissal of Rose in I875, and we would
be gratified to learn the number of persons now engaged in performing
the work which the late assistant was required to perform alone. In addition to the above we' might question the economy of paying Douglas at
the rate of $2,500.00 per annum, during the years ending in 1876 and
1877, when engaged in the laudable work of vindicating himself from
the consequences of his own short-comings. What duty did he perform
for this $5,ooo.oo? What did he teach? Tell the public specifically the
nature of the duties which the late Dr. D. performed.
6. The absentees tell the public in March, 1878, that the reinstatement of either party would be unwise, of no possible good, but of great
njury to the interests we have sworn to protect."
2




This is the most remarkable statement in the letter of our colleagues;
In December, 1875, the Douglas Committee found in substance as the McGowan-Grant Committee of June, 1876, and as the Iudge has lately decreed. In I875, the absentees voted to suspend Rose; they refused to suspend Douglas; (Regent S. S. Walker was not then a member of the
Board); in June, 1876, they voted to expel Rose and voted against the expulsion of Douglas; in March, 1877, when Douglas was expelled, they
voted against such expulsion. Those of the undersigned, who were then
members of the Board, labored and voted to purge the University of the
man who had been false to the great trust reposed in him, in that he
habitually neglected a very important duty; we believed him guilty, and
with the aid of Regents Cutcheon and Collier dismissed him in March,
I8`7 -two of the absentees voting against his removal, the third being
absent. We are now told by the men who, in the light of all the facts,
uniformly supported him, ' that it would be a great injury to the interests
we have sworn to protect" to "reinstate" him. What has occurred since
the close of March, 1877, to accomplish such a wonderful change? Is this
wonderful virtue the offspring of necessity? What has Douglas done
since March, 1877, to produce such a radical change in the opinions of our
conscientious colleagues? He has not been a defaulter to the University
since. He has had no opportunity. No better endorsement of our conduct as regards Douglas could be furnished. We believed and have acled
as Regents on the ground that his presence in the University "would )e
unwise, of no possible good, but of great injury to the interests w_ have
sworn to protect." We rejoice over the conversion of our colleagues, and
it costs us nothing to accept the remarkable change which they so solemnly publish to the world as genuine, and the result of their belief in
his giilt.
We desire to reinstate Rose, because we believe with the legislative
committee in his innocence; because we think our constituents, so
believing, desire his reinstatement; because we consider him thoroughly
adapted to the work as an Assistant Professor in Physiological Chemistry; and because we believe that it is always "good" and "wise" to
repair, so far as may be, the wrongs of the past, and administer justice,
however tardy. We have no apology to make. With our present information we are now (and shall be) ready to vote for his reinstatement.
Finally. The absentees were unfortunate in that they prejud ed the
case in December, I875. Without meaning disrespect, it was the na!u;of the human mind to receive a bias from the character ot the primary
influences which were brought to bear by Douglas, through the Executive, on the Regents, then controlling affairs.
In our opinion they made a great mistake when they refused in I875,
tO place both on the same footing. Their second grave mistake consisted
in appointing on the June, 1876, Committee, the most active member of
which testified that he believed Rose guilty before commencing the investigation. The third serious blunder made was in dismissing Rose without a hearing. The fourth mistake consisted in cutting off Rose from all
proper means of defense by the June, 1876, resolution, which shut him off
Irom all books, papers and records.
Then came the infamous chancery bill, as originally constructed.
The sixth blunder was of long duration, and consisted in sustaining
Dougrlas by voice, vote and personal influence, until he was finally dismissed by vote of the opposition in March, I877; In addition to these
there is the placing of the counsel of Douglas as solicitor for the Regents; permitting the acconntants of Douglas to carry the books to Detroit; allowing the ex-Director free access to the counsel first employed
by the Executive Committee, together with various other acts, indicating
an unfortunate bias, which, in our opinion, has been equally disastrous
to the interests of Ross and the cause of justice.




- 233 -

There is an essential difference between the three absentees and the
undersigned. They were committed to the Douglas report of December, I875.
We were untrammelled by preconceived opinions. They have stood for the
June, I876. report. We think conviction without a hearing, and by a tribunal without powers, unusual. We accept the findings of the Legislature-from our own investigations we have arrived at substantially the
same conclusions. They have been cribbed, confined and limited by their
original endorsement of the Douglas findings. We refuse to make Rose
the scape-goat of another man's transgressions.  We believe Douglas
guilty and will oppose his reinstatement. We have confidence in the in.
tegrity of Rose, and think the long travesty on justice will be defeated by
his reappointment.
Our colleagues resorted to revolutionary methods to defeat the will of
the March, 1878, meeting. We are opposed to every such act, and con.
sider it unjustifiable. Confident that full and exact justice will yet be
extended to Rose, we submit the whole question to that court of last resort-our constittents.               C. RYND,

The following is the communication which the Hon. I. P.
Christiancy has furnished in response to the above resolution:
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 20, I878.
DOCTOR J. B. ANGELL, President Board of Regents:
DEAR SIR:-On my arrival here from Michigan, whence I have just
returned, I find a letter from Regent Cutcheon, of April I2th, and one
from Mr. Bennett, Secretary, covering a resolution of the Board and
what purports to be a printed copy of part of R. A. Beal's memorial or
petition to the Board, none of which I ever saw before, except a part of
the third paragraph (on page I96 as printed) which I think is the same in
substance as purported to be quoted in the Free Press in a printed letter of
Messrs. Douglas and Pond. To this part, so quoted in the Free Press, I
have already replied in my published letter to Messrs. Pond and Douglas
to which I refer. And I will here reiterate that I never represented or
promised to Mr. Beal that " in case he (the Judge) should so find, etc.,"
as then stated, nor in any other contingency, I would make a representation of the facts to the Board by which he, (Beal), would be relieved in the
premises;" nor did I ever think of making any such promise or agreement; nor was any inducement held out or offered to Mr. Beal, so far as
I know, for his withdrawing his demand for a jury. In confirmation of
this I refer to the letter of Mr. Webber of the I3th February last, which
I inclose. And I will here say that my letter, which was published in the




Post & Tribune, was written just as it now is and shown to Mr. Backtig
of that paper here, before I had concluded to telegraph Mr. Webber, and,
though I retained that letter until I got Mr. Webber's reply, I did not find
it necessary to alter a single word of my letter as previously written.
Now, as to the second paragraph on page I96 of the printed slip sent
me, which represents that Mr. Beal was induced to enter into the stipulation upon my representations and assurances that the cause would be
tried before some other Judge than Judge Iiuntinuton, I will say that I
never gave any such " assurances," but always told him that was a matter over which I had no control. I did, however say, substantially, to
Mr. Beal and to one of the counsel of I)octor Douglas, that I thonght for
several reasons, it would be better that some other Judge should try the
cause; not because I doubted the integrity of Judge HIuntington-for I
never doubted his integrity nor have I ever said anything which I supposed in any manner impugned his integrity. But as much feeling had
been aroused in the case in some of its former stages before Judge IHuntington, and Mr. Beal, who was the active party in the defence of Rose,
had once been fined by Judge lluntington for contempt, and the matter
had been discussed in the papers and talked of among the members of'
the le'islature and others, and people had taken sides upon the case, and
some distrust seemed to exist in. the minds of some wlho favored Rose,
that the Judge might not feel entirely unbiased-which though I believed
to be without any real foundation, I nevertheless saw would be likely to
weaken the confidence of some portion of tile people in the findings of
the Judge, if he should lind against Rose, and because the Judge himself,
owing to these and like reasons, might feel more embarrassed in the trial
of this than of ordinary causes. For these and like reasons and to protect the University against the effects of popular prejudice and excitement, however groundless, I did think it wise and best for the public
interest that the case should be tried before some Judge who had had no
previous connection with the cause and whose decisions and rulings
would be more likely to command the confidence of all the people. I did
not keep those views a secret from either side, but expressed them freelv
to both. I soon found however that none of these considerations had
any weight with the counsel of defendant Douglas. and that they were
or, at least one of them was, strongly opposed to having any other
Judge try the cause. I never approached the Judge upon tile subject of
calling in another Judge. But through a mutual friend, a gentleman of
high character on intimate friendly relations with the Judge, and who
thought as I did, I learned that the Judge was inclined not to try the
cause himself, but to call in another Judge. This was, I think, after the
stipulation to which Mr. Beal refers. And I think after the stipulation
was filed I received a letter from the clerk of the court, (or it may have
been his depnty, for I have not the papers here), stating, I think, in substance, that Judge Huntington had determined to call in another Judge or
thought of doing so, and wishing to know whom I preferred, or whether
I had any preference; to which, I think I replied substantially, that I
had no preference, so that it should be one wl.o had had no connection
with the cause, etc.
I am truly yours,       I. P. CHRISTIANCY.
The following is Mr. Webber's letter, referred to above:
EAST SAGINAW, February 13, IS7S.
Hon. I. P. CHRISTIANCY, Washington, D. C.:
DEAR SIR:-I received your telegram to-day, dated February I2th
and referring me to the Free Press of the 8th inst., where a quotation
was made from Beal's petition to the Regents relative to the reasons
which induced him to withdraw his demand for a jury. In your telegram
-you say that the interview was in your room at the hotel and that I




-238 -


WAs piesdht. The statement as made in the Free Press of the Sth is that
he (Beal) "was induced to withdraw his claims to a jury to try such questions (questions of the forgery of the letter 'D' and the red line, etc.)
upon the statement and representations of the said Christiancy, who had
been present and heard all the evidence given upon said trial, that there
was no evidence in the cause by which the Judge, Hon. Geo. M. Huntington, would be authorized to find that any such red lines or initial
' D's were forged; and that in case he should so find, he (you) would
make a representation of the facts to this Board by which your petitioner
would be relieved in the premises."
In response to your request I can only say that there was no such
language used nor anything that would bear that construction or which
represented that idea, in any interview between Beal and yourself at
which I was present. I never heard you express such an intention either
in the presence of Mr. Beal or at our private consultations. I would
state further, that my recollection of the interview at your room where
Mr. Beal was present and at which interview I was first informed that
Mr. Beal had concluded to withdraw his claim for a jury and submit the
caie to the Judge, is substantially this:-Premising that Judge Huntington had expressed his intention of removing the case to Jackson county
and submitting it to a jury, and that I was very decidedly of opinion that
he had no jurisdiction, sitting in chancery, to transfer a feigned issue to
another county for trial, and had consequently so argued in court and
that you entertained grave doubts, as you stated in open court, concerning the legality of such a course, and the matter being submitted to the
Judge (after counsel for all parties had been heard) for his consideration,
the interview spoken of was at your room. My recollection is that Mr.
Beal, without any representations from either of us, at that time announced that he had concluded to instructed his coansel to withdraw
their demand for a jury nnder the circumstances, assigning as reasons,
that as counsel in the case seemed to entertain so much doubt about the
legality of that course, and as the verdict of the jury when obtained, (as
all conceded) would not be binding upon the Judge but would be merely
advisory, and as the expense of a trial was so exceedingly burdensome,in view of these considerations, he had concluded to instruct his counsel
to withdraw all opposition to the question being submitted to the Judge
for his decision.
Very Respectfully, Your Obedient Servant,
WM. L. WEBBER.
Regent E. C. Walker presented the following resolution,
which was adopted:

referred to:
COLDW\ATER, June 19, IS78.
Dr. J. B. Angell, Ann Arbor, Micll.:
Will you oblige me by bringing the matter here referred to to the attention of the Regents, and if I have not addressed the proper officer, will you
please refer this letter to such an one as you shall deem proper. It would
afford great relief to the State Public School and the class it would aid, if the
State would make provision for the maintenance and treatment of dependent children who are afflicted with chronic diseases or requiring surgical
operations. They are not admissible to this school, and when they are
sent here we are obliged, reluctantly, to return them to the poor houses,
where they have no proper treatment. If the Regents would recommend
the action here suggested by the Legislature, it would have much influence
in the desired direction. The proper place for such maintenance would
be of c,)urse at the State Iospital at Ann Arbor.




-242


Should it be desired, I will write more in full, giving statistics, number requiring treatment, reasons for State aid, etc, etc.
Yours truly,
C. D. RANDALL,
Sec. Board of Control State Public School.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
The Committee on Medical Department, to whom was referred the
above communication from lion, C. D. Randall, have given the subject
careful consideration, and would respectfully report that we are ready to
afford accommodation to all such afflicted persons to the extent of the
room at our disposal, and that we will guarantee to them kind and careful treatment. As we have no fund for the support of such persons, or
indeed, of any persons brought to the hospital for treatment, we must
await the action of the Legislature for the necessary funds for this work.
We shall cheerfully join with the State Public School officers in asking
that such afflicted, dependent children be provided for, and hereby express
our entire willingness to give them all the advantages of the University
Hospital.

A report fiom Professor C. L. Ford relative to the Physiological Laboratory was read by Regent Rvnd, which was accepted
and ordered to be printed in the minutes.
To the Honorable Board of Refgents of the Univzersity of i.ichgran:
GENTLEMEN-It will doubtless be remembered that in October, 1877,
a report was presented, showing what had been done at that date in
equipping the Physiological Laboratory for the work contemplated in its
organization.
The microscopes then expected were duly received, and work was
commenced immediately.
The room and instruments would accommodate fifteen students at a
time; and to give the benefit of such instruction to as many as practica.
ble, six classes of fifteen each were formed.
Each of these classes devoted one afternoon everv week to practical
work on the following plan:
A lecture varying, as the subject of study required, was the first
exercise, and the balance of the afternoon was devoted to personal work
with the microscope and such tissue or fluid as formed the subject of
study, each student having the use and care of an instrument, the necessary accessories for that afternoon.
The course of study consisted of ten lessons, occupying the same
number of weeks. Thus three courses have been given, and over two
hundred and fifty students have received instruction in this department
during the year.
It is not, of course, to be presumed that all these students have, in
this brief time, become experts in microscopy, but they have been
instructed how to use the microscope, how to prepare specimens, and how
to recognize the minute and important substances which form the objects
of study, and are thus fitted to go on with their investigations elewhere




-245
until they become proficients in the work thus inaugurated on a right
basis.
In this connection it is proper to state that for purposes of instruction in the Laboratory we have the following facilities, viz:
Fifteen American microscopes of superior construction, each instrument having two eye pieces, micrometer, camera-lucida, a one-inch, onefourth-inch and one-eighth-inch Spencer objective.
There is also a Marcy's stereopticon, with an attachment for exhibiting microscopical preparations on the screen.
The 'cabinet' is supplied with some four hundred specimens, illustrating normal and pathological tissues.
The Library contains about one hundred volumes of standard works
on microscopy and allied subjects.
We have likewise a Sphygmograph, transfusion apparatus, and such
accessories as are required for thorough work in this department.
Respectfully submitted,
C. L. FORD.

The Executive Committee, to whom were referred the charges and
specifications filed against Dr. S. A. Jones, respectfully report that the
Committee is of the opinion that the Board cannot sit as a court to try
charges preferred as prosecuted by parties outside the University, and
that to do so would establish a most unfortunate and troublesome precedent.
But your Committee is of the opinion that whenever matters of sufficient gravity to require the attention of the Board, as affecting the usefulness of any instructor, or his fitness to be an instructor of youth in the
University, are presented, the Board owes it to itself to examine into such
matters, to the end that the University may take no detriment.
And your Committee are of the opinion that the matter embraced
in the second specification of the first charge, and the first anid second
specifications of the second charge, and the first and second specifications
of the third charge, are of a nature and importance to require some
examination at the hands of the Board, and your Committee therefore
recommend that the matter embraced in the above named specifications be
referred to a Committee of this Board for examination and report at the
earliest date practicable.
The Committee therefore submit the following resolutions:
Resolved, That the matter embraced in the
Second specification, first charge,
First and second specifications, second charge,
First and second specifications, third charge,
of the paper presented by F. Woodruff, M. D. and DeForest Hunt,M. D,
against Prof. S. A. Jones, M  D. be referred to the Executive Committee
for examination, report and recommendation.
Resolved, That said Committee notify the person representing the
parties preferring the paper in question, and also Prof. S. A. Jones, of the
time and place where said Committee will sit to conduct their examination, and where said parties may present such evidence as said Committee
may deem pertinent and proper.
B. M. CUTCHEON,
Chairman.
Regent Cutcheon presented the following resolution which
was adopted:
Resolved, That Hon. J. G. Ramsdell, counsel for the Board in pending suits, be and hereby is authorized to call to his assistance Mr. A.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, \
Wednesday, June 26, i87S.
The Board of Regents reassembled in the room of the President at 4' o'clock P. I.
On being called to order a fill Board was prescnt except
Regent Grant.
Regent E. C. Walker read and then sublitted to the Board
the following report:
The special committee to whom were referred the charges brought by
Prof. Donald Maclean of the Department of Medicine and Surgery against
"Prof. J. G. Gilchrist, of the Honceopathic Medical College, respectfully
report:
That the substance of the charges was that Dr. Gilchrist had falsely
and maliciously in the public prints accused Dr. Maclean of gross unprofessional conduct in enticing away from the Homceopathic clinic patients
who were under treatment by Dr. Gilchrist, that he (Dr. Maclean) might
operate upon them as a surgeon, especially in the case of one Sheriff who
had been under the care of both for " perineal fistula."




- '51 -


Your committee being of the opinion that the disagreement between
the parties was the result of a misunderstanding of the facts, called before
them both parties to the controversy, and Mr. Sheriff himself, whose case
had caused the difficulty.
Mr. Sheriff stated that he never saw Dr. Maclean till after he had
ceased to be under the care of Dr. Gilchrist, and had been considered by
him incurable. That he then approached Dr. Maclean and stated his
case; that Dr. Maclean made no advances to him; that he afterwards
returned to Ann Arbor, was operated upon by Dr. Maclean to his almost
perfect cure.
Upon hearing these facts, Dr. Gilchrist at once withdrew all charges
of unprofessional conduct against Dr. Maclean, and admitted that he wass
entirely mistaken in the facts on which he had made his charges.
Dr. Gilchrist then detailed the evidence given to him by different
parties on which he had founded his opinion of Dr. Maclean's conduct,
and Dr. Maclean admitted that if the statements so made to him had been
true, that he (Dr. Gilchrist) would have had reason to think that his
charges of unprofessional conduct were correct.
These admissions being made on both sides Dr. Maclean thereupon
withdrew his charges and requested us to make this report.
Your committee wish it to be distinctly understood that their action
and the action of the Board in this case shall not be considered a precedent for the future.
That this Board is not a tribunal for the settlement of disputes and
difficulties between professors, and had not this harmonious result
been arrived at in this case it is very likely that we should have reported
that it was a matter outside of our jurisdiction.
E. C. WALKER,
S.S. VALKER.
At the conclusion of the reading of the report by Regent E.
C. Walker, Regent Rynd moved that the report be accepted and

Louis, Mo., for appointment to the chair of surgery in the TIomneopathic
College of the University.




We are unanimous in the reconmmendation of this name after serious.
consideration of the need of our College and the honor of our cause.
Respectfully,
SAMUEL A. JONES, M. I).
CHAS. GATCHELL, M. D.
Regent Duflield, fiom the special committee on the investigation of the charges against Professor Samuel A. Jones, made the
following report, which on motion was ordered to be spread at
length in the minutes:
The committee to whom was entrusted the charges and specifications.
against Professor Jones of the tomceopathic College, and Iean of the
Faculty of the same, would respectfully report:
I. That after carefully reading the various charges, and eliminatingfiom them all such specifications as they deemed irrelevant, they gave a
long and patient hearing to Dr. Jones, and his prosecutor, through their
respective counsel, Messrs. Miller and Babcock, hearing all the witnesses
and letters they had to present; the closing argument of counsel being
submitted in writing.
2. That after the argument hlad been submitted, and the heavy mass of
oral and documentary testimony had been carefully reviewed and canvassed, your committee came, with great unanimity, to the following conclusions:
I. That in reference to whlat was known as the " Ilelmuth matter,"
the charge of deliberate falsehood against Dr. Jones is not confirmed
either by the testimony of Dr. Gilchrist, or by the letters. As a matter
of fact there is reason to suppose that Dr. Jones was in error in the
reasons assigned for the failure of Dr. H-elmuth to lecture according to
invitation, but the error is not to be ascribed to willful falsehood, when it
can be more charitably accounted for by erroneous information.. That the charge of " unseemly behavior in the lecture room," is
not substantiated by good and sufficient evidence, and that owing to a.
chronic excitement and prejudice on the part of the witnesses, certain
circumstances were exaggerated beyond their real significance.
3. That the charge of improper language and conduct towards his
colleague, especiaily in what occurred in the office of Dr. Backus, is not
of such a character as to demand any very special argument or attention.
Words spoken in private are not to be put in the same category with those
spoken in public.
4. The charge that at a certain lecture he used a very opprobrious
epithet in reference to the President of the University, we did not find
well sustained as to tine and place, though we had little doubt that his




- 2t -


custom of speaking evil of dignitaries at other times and places is one
more to be honored in the breach than the observance.
5. There was one charge, however, which we name with profound
regret-the more so because Dr. Jones was frank enough to admit there
was too much occasion for the charge, viz: the use of profane and obscene expressions in the lecture room. Profanity in such a presence is bad
enough; obscenity that would offend and pollute the mind and heart of
ingenuous youth is still worse, but to mingle obscenity in the same
breath and sentence with the holy name and reverend attributes of the
Almighty, is, to accommodate to a simile of grand old Milton, "enough
to give Satan himself a vomit." Dr. Jones is too good a scholar not to
know those golden lines of the satirist:
Nil dictu frduin visuque 1aec limina tangat,
INTRA QUA; PUER EST."
Hereafter every time he enters his lecture roomi we hope he will remember it. Even the ingenuity of his able counsel, that "there was
sometimes a wrong way of saying a right thing," did not deceive himself
or any one else. The sole redeeming feature in this offense and of which
we gladly and gratefully make the record, is the earnest and instantaneous
reprobation of such language by the young gentlemen of the class room.
Sorry indeed are we to say it, but it is only simple justice and truth.
In a proper sense of courtesy and decorum the large majority of the students of the Homoeopathic College have achieved the rare and enviable
distinction of being wiser and better than some oftheir teachers.
The history of this trial, humiliating as it is, we have reason to
believe, will not be without its permanent value to all concerned. It has
revealed to us a state of things in the HI-omeopathic College which exists
in no other department, and of which one and all we think, are most heartily
ashamed. The manly confession of one of the lecturers when on the
stand as to disorderly words, and for which confession we do him all
honor, is a sure pledge that we shall have no similar occasion to censure
hereafter. Our professors will know better how to settle their personal
matters with each other, than by encroaching on the precious time of their
pupils in the class room, by rushing into the newspapers, or by bringing
their infinitesimal troubles to the Regents. As the offense of Dr. Jones
is probably the first and last of the kind that will come before the Board
your committee recommend that if any further action be taken in the
premises, justice shall be so tempered with mercy that no one will have
occasion to complain, either of lax supervision or of undue severity.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
GEORGE DUFFIELD.
On motion of Regent Rynd, the committee were instructed
to transmit to Prof. S. A. Jones, a copy of the report, together




- 25 -


with a letter expressing the sense of the Board on the questions
considered in the report.
The President being required to attend the Commencement
exercises, Regent Climie was called to the chair.
Regent Duffield submitted a report embodying the views of
the majority of the Committee on the Literary Department relative
to the changes of courses recently announced by the faculty of
that department.  A  minority report was also submitted by
Regent E. C. Walker of the same committee, setting forth his
views upon the same subject matter under consideration.
On motion of Regent Rynd both reports were received and
ordered to be placed on file.
Regent Cutcheon    moved the adoption of the resolution
appended to the minority report of the Committee on the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts.    The resolutions
referred to were as follows:
Resolved, That the degree of Bachelor of Letters (B. L.) be and the
same is hereby established in the Department of Literature, Science and
Arts, to be conferred upon such persons as shall complete the Course in
Letters as prescribed by the Faculty of said Department.
Resolved, That such modifications be made in requirements for existing degrees as the Faculty of the Department of Literature, Science and
the Arts deem wise and expedient, to adapt the several degrees to the
new scheme of courses in that Department, as provided for in the recent
Announcement of that Faculty subject to the approval of this Board.
Pending a vote on the above resolutions Regent Rynd moved
that the following resolution be added, to stand as No. 3:
Resolved, That while we thus ratify the new scheme of the Faculty
of Literature, Science and the Arts we consider its action in announcing
and publishing so vital a change in the course of studywithout first obtaining the approval of this Board to be improper and inexcusable.
The motion of Regent Rynd to accept the above resolution
prevailed, whereupon a motion to adopt the three resolutions was
unanimously adopted.
The following communication from the Faculty of the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts contains their requests
referred to in the above resolutions.
To the Honorable the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN-By direction of the Faculty of the Department of LiterB

the Arts, to be known as Bachelor of Letters and Master of Letters.
Resolved, That the Board of Regents be respesctfully requested to
provide for certain changes in the degrees now conferred in the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts, to take effect after Commehcement, I88I, as follows:
I. The substitution of the degrees of Bachelor of Letters and Master
of Letters for those of Bachelor of Philosophy and Master of Philosophy.
2. The abolition of the degrees of Civil Engineer and Mining
Engineer as first degrees, and the substitution of the degree of Bachelor

To the Honorable the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN-It having been represented to nre that my continuance
in the Faculty of the Homoeopathic Medical College might lead to fresh

from the Lectureship of Homceopathic Surgery, we desire to express our
appreciation of the faithful services and gentlemanly conduct of Dr.
Gilchrist, and that we part with him with sincere wishes for his future
success.
Regent Duffield of the Exeeutive Committee submitted the

The Executive Committee to whom the revision of the By-laws was
entrusted would report progress as follows:
That the subject has been carefully considered, first by a sub-committee and afterward at a regular meeting of the Executive Committee;
that the various by-laws were submitted to the several Departments,
to be considered and returned with their suggestions to your committee
at the present meeting of the Board.
When these suggestions are all returned, your committee expect

Regent Duffield presented a communication fi-om Prof. J. W.
Langley, which was received and, on motion, laid on the table.
Regent Cutcheor submitted a report on the question of salaries, which was accepted and ordered printed in the minutes.
The following is the report referred to:
The Executive Committee, to which was referred the resolution of
Regent Rynd, offered at the January meeting of the Board, as follows:
" Resolved, That from and after the present college year the salaries
of all employees in every department of the University receiving more
than $I,700 per annum be reduced ten per cent., with the exception of
those of Professors Frieze and Pettee, whose salaries have been already
arranged, and the further exception of the Professors of the Law Department-"
Would report that they have given the same the careful examination
and consideration which its great importance demands.
While we have a strong desire to do that which the financial interests
of the University imperatively require, we are equally desirous to do
nothing that is unjust to the faithful and learned gentlemen most immediately concerned.
The facts whieh surround the case seem to be these:
I. The present rates of salaries were fixed in I87I, when the purchasing power of our currency was much less than now, and the cost of
living correspondingly greater.
There can be no doubt, we think, that the reduction in the necessary
cost of living since that time has been fully equal to an increase of 15 per
cent upon net incomes.
2. Meanwhile the stringency of the times has operated to reduce the
number that would otherwise have attended upon the University, and
thereby largely diminished the available means of the Board. Thus,
while we were required to pay more, we have had less with which to pay,
and a deficit, large and constantly increasing, was the natural consequence.
This deficit, at the end of the last fiscal year, had reached the amount
of nearly twenty thousand dollars, while we had been compelled to apply
to the Legislature for special appropriations to meet expenses which
naturally ought to have been met out of the general fund. This evil
became so manifest that one year ago the Committee on Finance and the
Executive Committee took it in hand to devise ways and means to overcome it. After considerable study of the problem, at a special meeting
held July I2th, I877, they came to the conclusion that a better way to
meet the difficulty would be to secure an increase of income from students,
fees, than to reduce salaries.  Accordingly, five dollars was added to
yearly dues and diploma fees in all the Departments, and at the same time




- 259 -

some reduction was made in the working force in the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts.
The effect has been very noticeable. Not only has the growing deficit
been checked, but, owing to the very large attendance in the various schools
and Departments, our income has been so increased that our deficit has
almost wholly disappeared, and we see in the near future the prospect of
wiping it out entirely. But still we are confronted with the fact that we
are constantly compelled to go to the Legislature for special appropriations, where we ought to be able to meet the expense out of the general
fund.
During this same period from I871 to the present, there can be no
doubt whatever that there has been an almost, if not quite, universal
shrinkage in incomes, over and beyond the corresponding shrinkage in
the cost of living. Among the laboring and mechanical class universal
stringency, and in multitudes of instances distress have prevailed, while
the thousands and thousands of cases in our bankrupt courts attest how
terrible has been the strain upon the mercantile class.
Among professional men there have been but few indeed who have
not found their incomes falling off in the last five years to a degree that
has compelled the practice of unwonted economies, even among the most
fortunate, while the great body of professional men have, by hard work,
been scarcely more than able to live. And to add to the difficulties of all
these classes was the difficulty of collectingf what had been honestly earned
and was honestly due. Most fortunate of all during this period of financial distress have been salaried men working for some thoroughly competent employer like the State or the University. While their salaries have
remained fixed, the purchasing power of every dollar has been enhanced
from ten to twenty per cent. While their pay has been constantly
increasing it has been regular and constant and reliable. This last is no
small consideration. There has been no weariness of the flesh or spirit
in hopes long deferred in pursuit of dishonest or embarrassed or bankrupt
paymasters. Gentlemen engaged in the quiet and scholastic pursuits of
the class room or the study, with their salaries awaiting them promptly at
the end of the quarter, have little conception of the trials of the professional man who earns his fee once in the service rendered and then earns
it a second time in collecting it, and perhaps fails to get it after all. All
these things must be taken into consideration in determining what is just
and fair in the premises. During the last five years there has been an
almost universal reduction in the wages of teachers of from ten to
twenty-five per cent. throughout the State and country.
Our Legislature at its last session took notice of these facts, and with
very great unanimity adopted the following resolution, to wit:
Resolved, That the Board of Regents and the State Board of Educa



-260 -

tion be and are hereby requested to reduce all salaries of professors,
teachers and employees in the several institutions under their control, as
follows: on all salaries over $I,500 to $2,000 inclusive, Io per cent, and
on all salaries over $2,000, 20 per cent.
This resolution, we believe, has never been communicated to us in
any official form, and through an accident never received the official sanction of the Governor. But we believe this resolution exhibits the tendency of the general public opinion of the State. While we cannot think
it wise to reduce to the full extent indicated, we do think it advisable to
report back the resolution referred to us and recommend that it be
adopted.
Respectfully submitted,
B. M. CUTCHEON.

of salaries, which was accepted and ordered printed in the

The report of the Finance Committee was adopted by the
following aye and nay vote:
Ayes-Regents Rynd, E. C. Walker, Climie, Cutcheon, S. S.
Walker, Duffield and Maltz.
Nay-None.
The following resolution was presented by Regent S. S.
Walker:
Resolved, That the Faculty of the Department of Literature, Science
and Arts be requested to prepare a General Catalogue of the Alumni of
the University to be published by the University at as early a day as
practicable, and that there be and is hereby appropriated the sum of $Ioo,
or so much thereof as may be necessary for the payment of the expense
of preparing the same.
The resolution was adoptee by the following vote:
Ayes-Regents Rynd, E. C. Walker, Climie, Cutcheon, S. S,
Walker, Duffield and Maltz.
The following report, presented by Regents Rynd and Duffield, relative to the question of salaries, came up for further consideration:
To the Board of Retens:
The Executive Committee, to whom was referred the consideration
of the question of salaries, have given the subject, together with the
expenditures in this direction for a number of years past, careful consideration.
At the January meeting Regent Rynd subjnitted the following:
Resolved, That from and after the present college year the salaries of
all employees in every department of the University receiving more than
$1,700 per annum be reduced io per cent, with the exception of Professors
Frieze and Pettee, whose salaries have been already arranged, and with
the further exception of Professors in the Law Department.
The matter was duly referred to the Executive Committee, and on
motion of Regent Duffield, at the last meeting, was further referred to said
Committee, to report at the June meeting.
Your Committee have endeavored to carefully and faithfully consider
the whole question of University expenditures, of which the salaries of
our employees constitute the largest share. An earnest effort has been
made to so regulate this matter, in our report to your honorable body, as
to satisfy the people, who have expressed their wishes through the Legislature, while at the same time, the services of capable professors and
instructors have been duly appreciated.
It were useless to ignore our dependence on the Legislature for sup



port. Nor do we underrate the importance of acting in harmony with
that body in the interests of economical management. This we do without yielding the constitutional right of the Regents to manage the internal affairs of the University.
Our resources for the year now ending have been:
Legislative aidTo pay salary of Professor in Geology.....................................$  2,000
To  pay  salary  of Professor in  Physics.......................................  2,000
For equipment of Physical Laboratory....................................  I,ooo
For Physiological Laboratory, equipment and salary.................  2,500
Hospital-current expenses of................................................  200ooo
For  General  Library..............................................................  2,500
For Astronomical Observatory................................................  1,500
For salaries of Professors in Dental College............................  4,500
For apparatus  in  Dental College.............................................  I,000
Repairs on Building for Dental College....................................,ooo0
For extra term of instruction in Medical Department.................  4,500
For extra term of instruction in Homceopathic College..............  2,500
A id  from   M ill tax..................................................................  31,500
Interest from University Fund-about......................... 38,400
Students' fees and Deposits-about.............................. 46,000
84,400
Total.....................................................  $I43,900
It will thus be seen that of the total amount available for University
expenditures for the year now ending, $58,500, or about forty per cent.,
of the whole, is thc result of the intelligent liberality of the Legislature.
This exhibit clearly demonstrates the necessity of our co-operating with
the people in the economical management of the University.
The following exhibit may be of interest as showing the increase in
expenditures tor the last eleven years. We also append the attendance of
students:

-267 -It will thus be seen that the great increase in expenses has not grown
out of an increased attendance. Deducting the number of Hoiceopathic
and Dental students, and women, now in attendance, the number of students in the University is less than it was ten years ago. Indeed, including the new departments lately established, the classes this year are
only seven in excess of I868, while those of last year fell II3 below the
number in actual attendance eleven years ago. It is not now our province to discuss the causes which have operated in diminishing the total
attendance in the departments, as compared with I868.
It is but just, however, that we call the attention of your honorable
Board to the fact that the founding of the Dental and Homceopathic
Departments, and the extending of medical teachings to a full College
year has largely increased our pay-roll. Apart from these expenditures
a careful analysis of the salary question shows that the amount paid for
instruction has been increased by
I. Increase of salaries;
2. Increase of teachers.
The teaching force was somewhat reduced last year, but the salaries
were permitted to remain as fixed several years ago. Your Committee
are not prepared to advise any material reduction in the teaching force,
but we feel that the time has come for a review of the whole question, particularly the reduction of salaries.
The last Legislature passed the following:
Resolved, That the Board of Regents and the State Board of Education be and are hereby requested to reduce all salaries of professors,
teachers and employees in the several institutions under their control as
follows: All salaries over $I,500 to $2,000 inclusive, Io per cent, and all
salaries over $2,000, 20 per cent.
This resolution is an indication of the purpose and ultimate intention
of the Legislature which we cannot wisely overlook. In view of this
expressed desire; recognizing the indisputable fact that $2,500 has a
much greater purchasing power at this time than six or seven years ago;
feeling the necessity of reducing very considerably the sum total of our
expense account, and with an honest desire to accommodate our business
affairs to the general stringency which exists in monetary affairs, and
which is seriously felt by the great body of the tax-payers of the State,
your Committee submit the following schedufe. It will thus be seen that
we are not governed altogether by the resolution of the Legislature, notwithstanding our profound respect for that body. While we believe a
reduction proper and recognize the desire of the Legislature to aid this
Board in maintaining the great educational work of this University, yet
we cannot think that as large a reduction would have been advised, as
affecting a large number of the professors, had that body been as conversant with the wants and works of the institution as is this Board.




-268 -We wish to accommodate our action, as far as we deem                                         it wise and
prudent, to the expressed desire of the Legislature on the one hand; we are
anxious to secure the hearty support of our professors and instrnctors on
the other. While we would act in harmony with the Legislature, wcannot think that either the Legislature or the people would consider it
wise to pay salaries so scanty as to involve faithful and hard-working
men in financial embarrassment.

A PLEA
FOR
EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC DUTY.
WITH sincere reluctance, with only the plea of the persuasion of friends, and my own sympathy with this occasion, do
I attempt to fill this place to-day.
The occasion must suggest what I shall say to you. We
now stand at a parting of the ways. The conditions have
changed here and observances must change with them. This
place of learning has become less the College and more truly
the University. It now puts on, as it were, its robes of manhood. It recognizes that to-day it represents a stage of riper
education arid scholarship, which must be symbolized in its
annual festival. Hence, while the college of the undergraduate is still here in larger scope and promise than ever before,
yet this place of learning is no longer exclusively his, nor
even principally his. It has passed to a larger and maturer
constituency. It is a center to which converges the ripest and
highest scholarship of a large, wealthy and cultivated community. And henceforth this day must be no local occasion, but
the Olympic of one of the great seats of learning of the Republic. And on this day, with its annual return, shall its scholars,
its scientists, its artists, and artisans, its professional men, and
perchance its prophets and poets, gather here to take account
of whatever new has been accomplished in science, in letters,
in polity, in art, and in all that concerns the State, or the
whole commonwealth of man.
Standing here to-day, with such realities and such auguries,
we can perhaps best weigh their significance by a rapid glance
at the past. We may, indeed, be sure that what we thus enjoy




- 4 -

is by no accident, or mere chance. All sound moral growths
have an honest and instructive history.
Thirty-three years ago this month, the University of Michigan-a University only in name-asserted its entrance into a
large sisterhood of colleges, by sending forth eleven young
men bearing its diplomas. It bore the name of the State, but'
that name then gave no renown. The State was young and
poor. It was raw from the wilderness. Save along the old
French border, there was hardly a field in which the blackened stumps did not witness the new clearing. Its whole population was hardly 250,000. Its metropolis had only about
13,000. It had no accumulated wealth. It had few who
claimed to be scholars, and very few who aimed at scholarship as a pursuit. No men ever saw more clearly that
their work was to subdue the wilderness, and to found the
homes which should lead in the future civilization.
Yet let no one think that these vigorous pioneers-founders
of a new State-were strangers either to letters or to science.
Their lineage was that of the best races of the globe. The
greater part were children of the American free school; a system which somehow educates beyond its few books of instruction, and thus broadens its own pathway. Many were of that
stock, which, with inspired hope and courage, had founded
Harvard, and Yale, and Dartmouth. And, acting from a principle so native that it seemed almost like instinct, our farmer
statesmen, when founding their State, founded also their seat
of advanced learning, and wedded the two in indissoluble
union.
We well know what some of the leading actors in this work
hoped, and what some thought they foresaw. But it is not so
easy to say what was the general hope and foresight. It is
certain, however, that it was expected-and perhaps this was the
common thought-that the College would furnish here at home
an opportunity for a fair College education, and so become of
great local usefulness. This was a reasonable hope. This was
surely enough to justify what was done. More than this
might well seem but the fire and ardor of the enthusiast.




- 5 -

As we look back on the history of any great enterprise, it
is never easy to tell how much is due to the wisdom of the
plan, and how much to the spirit and genius of the actors.
The clear and concise Compact of the Mayflower seemed to the
wise and learned of that day much inferior to the elaborate
Constitution of Locke. And the blood of the Cavalier was
held of more generous strain than that of the Pilgrim. But
how vast the difference in the outcome! There is probably
always something in the surroundings which throws its decisive weight into the scale.
Our fathers had this advantage. The field was one which
not only inspired hope, but almost predicted success.
I have said that many of our pioneers were of the heroic
blood that founded Harvard, and Yale, and Dartmouth.
Already the best genius of that blood had impressed itself on
the Northwest. In advance of the coming millions, it had, as
it were, shaped the earth and the heavens of the sleeping
empire.
It was a graduate of Harvard, who, in 1787, when framing
the Great Charter of the Northwest, had consecrated it irrevocably to Human Freedom, to Religion, Learning, and Free
Thought.
It was the proud boast of Themistocles that he knew how
to make of a small city a great State. Greater than his was
the wisdom and prescience of Nathan Dane, who knew how
to take pledges of the future, and to snatch from the wilderness an inviolable Republic of Free Labor and Free Thought.
And here it seems not irrelevant to say that this one act is
the most dominant one in our whole history, since the landing
of the Pilgrims. It is the act that became decisive in the
Great Rebellion. Without it, so far as human judgment can
discern, the victory of Free Labor would have become impossible.
The influence of this act upon education in Michigan is
what specially concerns us here to-day.
The care of education enjoined by the Ordinance of '87
seems to have fallen like a ray of light on the soil of Michigan,




-6 -

kindling a fire which has never gone out. It begot and guided
a policy which has been respected from the earliest history of
the territory. I cannot state this matter so well as by adopting the judicially accurate words of Judge Campbell: "This
early recognition of the necessity of schools and colleges,
enforced in the form of a perpetual compact between the Government and the people and States in the Territory, has
been a source and stimulus of intelligence, the importance or
which cannot be estimated. The duty of the State to educate
her children generously and thoroughly can never be disregarded, without violating the pledges on which the rights of
the State and Territory were created." Pol. Hist., 221.
These are weighty and true words.
In the act of 1805, organizing the Territory of Michigan, a
grant was made'by Congress of a section of land in aid of a
University. The appropriation of the sixteenth section of
every township in aid of common schools, was made earlier.
In 1817, the aim for higher education took form in the
extravagant scheme of Judge Woodward. Yet this scheme
was not fruitless. It served as the nurse of such schools as
were then most needed, while it kept in view what was beyond.
In fact it was the birth of that corporate life which survives here in the University of to-day.
In 1835, the Territory came to its manhood in the State.
By the same step it rose to higher efforts in behalf of education.
In our first Constitution a special article was devoted to
education. No article of that instrument was more carefully
considered, more wisely framed, or more cordially assented to.
It laid broad and deep foundations on which our whole system
of education has been built, on which it stands in wholesome
vigor to-day, and on which it may safely stand forever. The
system did not outrun present wants, but was capable of any
enlargement required by any wants of the future. It cared
equally for the education of the common school and the University. It wisely adjusted them as parts of a great whole, and
as equally necessary to the best well-being of the State. It




-7 -

was made the duty of the legislature to establish township
libraries; to maintain common schools; to promote by all
suitable means, intellectual, scientifical, and agricultural
improvement; to promote literature, arts, and sciences through
a University; and to keep:forever inviolable the common school
and University funds.
I say again, no men ever built more wisely for the future
State. They deserve perpetual remembrance and honor. Nor
are their monuments wanting. The district school houses
which stud the State like stars, our noble graded schools, and
this University, the jewelled crown of our civilization, shall
bear imperishable testimony in their honor.
It was under such influences, on a soil thus fertilized
and quickened, that the University began its work. In
1845, as we have seen, it began to yield its fruit. I have said
that it is not easy to say what was the general expectation.
But the actual result within a few years, was a surprise and a
joy. So rapid was the increase in the collegiate department
that the next steps were easy. In 1850, the Medical College
began its work, and, nine years later, the institution of the Law
School put into activity the three general departments of the
University.
The thought that I have aimed to bring out is, that the
University is the result of no accident, but the offspring of a
wise and thoughtful policy. In attainment and result it may
exceed all that sober reason could have foreseen; but its growth
and greatness are certainly in the exact line of its founders.
And here, in thankfulness and congratulation for what has
already come; for the pure spring of learning set flowing here
for all; for the swelling stream of instructed young men and
women yearly sent forth with influence and power; for the
accomplished instructors whose teachings are gladly sought
and heard in other colleges; for the words written and spoken
here, which are cited in courts and senates with as much
respect as those of Grotius and Blackstone, and for the scientific scholarship which has inscribed the name of the Univer

sity imperishably among the Asteroids;* in pride and congratulation for this already done, but with renewed hope and
enthusiasm for the future, it were perhaps well to leave it. We
might say that never was wisdom better justified of her children;
and that, in the splendid exemplification of to-day, all argument ends.
But still we cannot close our ears to objections sometimes
heard, and it may be best briefly to consider them.
It is said the result is all well, but it were better attained
by other agencies and other methods. It is sometimes said it is
a business that should be remitted to private hands, or perhaps to religious bodies; that it is not the office of the civil
power to provide for higher education, but only for common
schools; and that it is only for the latter that taxation can
justly be imposed.
In reply, first, it is clear these objections run counter to our
historical policy; but still, if they are sound they ought to
prevail. Are they sound?
In this discussion let us exclude everything not really in
dispute.
We do not oppose any education whatever, whether at private hands or by religious bodies. They sail with us the same
seas, by the same courses, and with the same lading, only in
different measure. The more of private education the better.
But we all too well know, that such agencies lack means, certainty and universality. All private enterprise is limited by
its private and special end. It has no spur and no obligation
beyond. And at last, as a promotive for education it must
partially fail, if not saved by public aid. And so even this
returns to the State.
We are sometimes pointed to some of the great eastern colleges as private institutions. The assumption is not correct. Their
management, it is true, is more or less withdrawn from direct
State control. But it will be found that they have been care

University but one of its graduates, of the class ol 1857.

fully nurtured and fostered by public aid, until by accumulated capital and endowments, a liberal portion of the general
wealth has become appropriated for their permanent support.
Whether this is really a duty of the State is best seen when
we get a right idea of what the State is.
In modern intelligent communities, the State becomes more
and more but the organized will of the people. It exists
because there is a civil life of society, as truly as there is individual life. This civil life which we call the body politic, or
the State, is not a mere convenience, but a necessity. It
encloses the individual not as a prison, but as a shelter. Civilization can exist and grow only in and under law, which is the
organism of civil life. The laisser faire, or let alone doctrine,
is a delusion. It is not true that that country is best governed
that is governed least. The quality of rule is the test. That
country is best governed that has the best laws, few or many,
and the best administration of them.
The State and the man cannot be set apart. The perfect
life of each is necessary to the perfect life of both.
If society can exist only under law, the best form of society can only continue and grow under the best laws.
But society is made up of individuals, and such as are its
citizens, so is the State. The free State can have no guaranty
of its own life, save in the intelligence of its citizens. The
corporate and individual life must be of the same kind. The
one cannot ascend while the other sinks. The life of the State
must be fed by the life of the citizen.
While I assert this as universally true, it is absolutely true
of that form which we call a republic. This form is " of the
people, by the people, and for the people." As water cannot
rise above the level of its source, so this form of civil rule
cannot rise above the best intelligence of its people, nor exist
longer than it receives vital power and force from the people.
Does it not follow plainly, that it is a condition of the survival of a free State that intelligence shall be secured to the
citizen?  But as the individual passes away, and his off



-10 -

spring takes his place, the process must be continuous. And
this process is education.
And here, perhaps, I ought to say, what might better have
been said before, that by education I do not mean merely instruction in physical laws. These are not all that there is, either
in the external world or in man.  It is his moral or ethical
nature that is sovereign in man and in Christian society.  No
education would be worthy of the name which should overlook this. Instruction is necessary here, that we may intelligently comprehend the claims and duties that subsist between
us and government, society, neighborhood, family and religion. It then comes to this, as the sum of our political wisdom:
The free State is essential to the best condition of the people,
and an educated people is indispensable to the existence of the
free State.
Does it not then follow that it is the duty of the State to
see that its citizens should be educated? It is a duty primary
and fundamental. It is a duty that cannot be delegated. For,
as we have seen, other agencies lack means and motive, certainty and universality of operation. The power of the State
is alone large enough to encircle all of its citizens; it alone
can provide and maintain the machinery of complete education, and it alone can see that, to the proper extent, it reaches
all.
But the objector still insists that, conceding that this duty
rests on the public, as to common schools, the duty stops
there.
The objection, fairly stated, is that the common school is
the only one that can or will be used by pupils at large, and
therefore taxation should go no further. To do more than this,
it is said, is to favor some at the expense of others. This is
wrong, it is said, because one man is as good as another.  As
to that, one might answer with Beecher: "That depends on
who the other man is." As to the public, he is best who serves
best. I am by no means so good as another who serves society
and humanity better than I do or can.  That other is the one




- 11
that society can least spare. My limits are not to be imposed
on another who can lift up, where I can only weigh down.
In truth, when we analyze it, any objection against the
higher schools is an objection against all schools. For, first,
there is no natural limit to the common school. It may be
one where only the merest elements are taught. On the other
hand, the advanced common school of Prussia, of Massachusetts, or of Michigan, offers a comparatively liberal education.
The common school, then, conforms to conditions of time and
place, and is a varying utility and power. Still, in the heart of
every common school system, the objectionable inequality exists. The wants and attainments of all p upils are not the same
The first operation of the rule that would limit education to
such education as is accepted by all, would degrade our existing schools, and forever bar all progress.
The simple words of the Mayflower Compact, which declare
as the object and end of the State, to frame just and equal
laws for the public good, contain the marrow of all sound
political philosophy. Civil rights should indeed be equal;
and the greatest of all these rights, both in the interest of the
State and the individual, is that the opportunity should be
equally open to every man and woman to make the most of
his or her gifts.
Men are not, in intellectual gifts, a level plane. The needs,
powers and aspirations of the mass cannot be the measure for
all. No community can be completely served or saved by the
dead level. The best average intelligence needs impregnation
from the superior intelligence of the best minds. The highest
thought is necessary for the maturity of the common thought.
It is the light and warmth of the pre-eminent minds, which,
shining down into the midst of us, and infusing the common
mind, ripen the great harvests of civilization and progress.
Nor can the influence of leading minds ever be dispensed
with or supplied by common instruction. Though to the poet
it has seemed that


" The individual withers, and the world is more and more,"




-12 -

yet, I think this is more apparent than real; that it is because
the general surface has risen, and not because gifted individual
life is less powerful or less needed.
Nor is partial growth enough. The State needs all the gifts
and powers of all her children. She needs the whole of every
man; the whole that his expanded powers can make him.
She must therefore hold open to all men and women the door
by which they can come to their full estate.
And why should not a man's education be the concern of
the State? We now know that his physical condition is a
matter the State must inspect and guard. Air must not
only be free; it must be pure. Alleys and living-houses must
not breed typhus or small-pox. Food shall not be adulterated.
Water shall not be drawn from wells poisoned by steepings
from city refuse, but must be brought from  nature's pure
springs and reservoirs. Yet we live not by bread alone.
Vice and ignorance are great social and political sores.
They subsist and grow at the public cost. It is better to prevent than to pay. What builds so many barriers against vice
and crime, or provides so many means of rescue as education?
Education does not draw the man within himself. Its
function is to open to him a better understanding of all his
relations in life. It enlarges his powers. It instructs him as
to his duties. It unfolds to him his rights, and it arms him
for further defence.
It is true that the highest education will be sought only by
a few comparatively. Only a few will thirst for it.  Only a
few are competent to acquire and use it. But of those who do
so will be those whom the world most needs.  Yet, because
there will be comparatively few who seek and use it, it does
not thereby become a class privilege. Genius and mental gifts
are not hereditary. The divine spark drops into the homeliest
cottages, and into the obscurest corners; and for such the
world's welfare demands that the door should be kept wide
open. What I claim as just and equal in this behalf is, that,
as the State is interested in the full mental growth of every
child who seeks knowledge, it shall afford to every child




- 13 -

full opportunity to acquire it. It is equal, because equally
open to all. It is just, because it promotes the power and the
welfare of all.
I have said that learning is no class privilege; that it is no
selfish possession. I gladly borrow the words of a scholarly
statesman, uttered last week in another place: "What you
gain," said he, " to adorn and feed your mind, you gain for all
around you. When you use your property, you take away its
use from all others; when you use your knowledge, you can
only do so by giving it out to the community in which you
live."*
This diffusible quality of the use of knowledge is what
gives places of learning their great power in the world. And
in our system of government it is what makes them so productive of good citizenship.
We have seen that the objector's sole ground is, that, because
his children do not want the higher education, he ought not
to be taxed for others. The objection might be unanswerable,
if the question were as narrow as he sees it. A wiser and
deeper view would answer him out of the very warp and woof
of his own daily life.  He would know that the fruits of
knowledge become the common heritage. He would know
that they are indeed twice.blessed-blessed to him who gives,
and him who takes. He would know that taxes to promote
useful knowledge are indeed golden grain, from which comes
the best bread of his living. He would know that his family are
better housed, better clothed and better taught; that his reaper
has replaced the sickle and cradle; that his thresher has
superseded the flail; that his plough is better fashioned; that
he is better treated in sickness; that he is better vindicated
and defended in the courts, better ministered to in the church,
and better represented in the Senate, because somebody's culture has been carried above the level. The dweller farthest
inland cannot afford to put out the lamp lighted for the ship.
The broad highway is built, not wholly at the cost of those who
ride or carry, but that it may be a way for general business,

commerce and defence. The same truth meets us at every
step. We contribute to many things in which we take no share
except in the general good that results. Indeed, the idea on
which many public institutions rest is, that the service which
they render is one which reaches the mass of private persons,
only as they share in the public welfare.
The simple truth then is, that the educatson of the common
school, and that of schools of higher learning, do not stand apart.
They are really but parts of one system. One heart animates
both; one vital current flows through both. Whatever injures
either impairs the whole. Eich pledges the health and usefulness of the other. And I again praise the wisdom of our early
Statesmen, who, upon the broad base of an advanced system
of common schools, reared this University to stand as a great
beacon, strearning to our farthest horizon, with the purest
and brighest light of learning.
I have thus far only spoken of education as necessary to the
safety of the State. Let us, for a few moments, look at it as it
bears on the power of the State.
" Knowledge is itself power" is the well known aphorism.
It is as true of nations as of individuals. Lord Bacon, its
author, one of the wisest of thinkers and observers, has also
declared that it "is manifest that the Romans never ascended
to the height of empire till they had ascended to the height of
other arts." And some here will recall those noble passages in
which he celebrates, amidst the decay of everything else, the
fertility and immortality of learning. '. But the images," says
he, "of men's wits and knowledges remain in books, exempted
from the wrong of time, and capable of perpetual renovation.
Neither are they fitly to be called images, because they generate
still, and cast their seeds in the minds of others, provoking and
causing infinite actions and opinions in succeeding ages. So
that, if the invention of the ship was thought so noble, which
carrieth riches and commodities from place to place, and consociateth the most remote regions, in participation of their
fruits, how much more are letters to be magnified, which, as
ships, pass through the vast seas of time, and make ages, so dis



-15 -tant, to participate of the wisdom, illuminations and inventions
the one of the other."
If learning can thus borrow the wisdom, illuminations and
inventions of all ages, can thus cast its seeds into the minds
of men, provoking and causing infinite actions and operations, it may be, indeed, truly said that " Knowledge is itself
power."
There is a striking passage in Butler's Analogy, of the
power of virtue. He supposes a community, or State, perfectly
virtuous for a succession of ages, and shows how naturally it
would rise to pre-eminence in moral and material power. " It
would plainly," he says, " be superior to all others, and the
world must come gradually under its empire; not by means of
ceaseless violence, but partly by what must be allowed to be
just conquest, and partly by other kingdoms submitting themselves voluntarily to it through a course of ages, and claiming
its protection, one after another, in successive exigencies.'
This is a charming picture, but I think not overdrawn. Perfect virtue is the fine fruit of perfect knowledge and wisdom.
And were it possible to secure perfect knowledge and wisdom,
in civil rule, we should thereby lay the foundation of universal and eternal empire.
We may not hope for perfect knowledge or wisdom, but
knowledge is the path to wisdom and power.  In the modern
State, power sides with those who have the highest knowledge.
The people, who, by their skill and insight, command the trade,
commerce, and production of the world, command the world
itself. The quiet, but far-seeing, power that dwells at St.
Stephen's, or in Threadneedle street, is infinitely greater than
the broad brute empire of the Czar. The rule follows down to
the citizen and the soldier. The musket and bayonet is powerful
just in proportion to the intelligence that guides it. Look at
the late great wars in Western Europe.  Of the French army
it is said that only 43 per cent. could write, while of the German army 98 per cent. could write. This has led a great
orator to say: "In the great conflict between Germany and
Austria it was the German school house which destroyed the




-16 -Austrian military forces. In the conflict between Germany
and France it was again the school house which overthrew
France."
And yet it was not for want of lavish expenditure that the
French armies failed. It is said that 90 per cent. of all her
revenues is spent by France on her armaments, while only 4
per cent. is spent on education. Let France give 20 per cent.
to instruction, and not only in war, but, far better, in peace,
she may hope to see her eagles mount to the zenith.
The same truth has been taught in our own home experience. At the outset of the Rebellion the South sneered at the
North as an emasculated race of tillers, traders and artisans.
In peaceful pursuits, thetaste for arms, and their use, had died
out, and with these, it was thought, manly courage had also
died. And on the surface it so looked. There was no love of
arms, no pride in military display. A meagre militia fanned
the ashes where no real fire remained. It so happened that
during the year before the war, I saw a good deal of Southern
men. It was in vain that I remonstrated that it would not do
to disparage the physical courage and aptitude for arms of any
race of educated men. The proof, however, came swiftly. The
instructed head and skilled hand showed themselves as much at
home on the field as in the factory.* The school houses
again wrote their lesson of mastery-a lesson usually taught
in love, charity and. beneficence-but written this time in
fire and blood!
But this overmastering power of knowledge and intelligence was still more impressively taught. Of the bravery and
patriotic fire of the North, I never had a doubt.       What
oppressed me was the apparent difficulty of subduing and
holding in subjection a territory so vast and so varied as the
South, and inhabited by a proud and spirited people. I recalled
* When Baltimore was seized by a rebel mob, at the outbreak of the war, and the
Massachusetts volunteers were obliged to approach Washington by way of Annapolis,
they found the railroad destroyed, the track torn up, and the engines dismantled. At
Gin. Butler's call, there stepped from the ranks, workmen skilled in every department
of machinery and railroad work, and the railroad and its equipment was restored
almost as fast as the troops could march.




-17 -

all I knew of history and it answered with little hope. I remembered that Washington, when pressed hardest, had resolved, if
need be, to retire to the fastnesses of the Alleghanies, convinced
that he could there keep alive the fires of independence against
the whole power of the British crown. As the forces of the world
then were, he was right. Yet, ninety years later, the North
hemmed in, as with a girdle of fire, that vast Southern land,
and then, with lightning and steam furrowed and scourged it
from center to circumference. It was the victory, not of mere
men, but of the schools, not of brute force and courage, but of
these spiritualized and crowned with thought and knowledge.
Neither Grant, nor Sherman, nor Farragut were our greatest
leaders. For above them, leading our leaders, were Fulton
and Stephenson, Morse and Ericsson, marshalling the irresistible
forces and enginery of this warfare-the steamers, the railway,
the telegraph, and the ironclad. These were the forces that
saved this Union, and the victory of the Union was the victory of the highest thought and science of modern times.
I cannot pursue these thoughts. I must, however, add
that, while it is clear that education arms and qualifies a people for the highest triumphs and successes in war, this is not the
highest stage of its power. War, at best, is the offspring of the
old barbarism from which we slowly emerge. The promise of
peace on earth will surely be fulfilled. In the eye of Infinite
Reason I doubt not, that the skill and heroism that has covered any inhospitable land with refined and happy homes, or
has whitened rocky and cold seas with a hardy, chivalrous, and nourishing commerce, shines with a glory greater
than rests on any battlefield on earth. The policy that shall
rear statesmen to whom peace and right is the supreme interest of the State; to whom national injustice is the highest
national dishonor; to whom any victory is but spoil unless it
vindicates the right; to whom politics are a science above the
arts of the demagogue; who can secure the steady reign of the
natural laws of public finance and economy, and dispel the
sophisms and delusions that often wreck and always threaten
legitimate business; who can so arrange the order of capital
B




-18 -

and labor that harmony and co-operation shall supersede
menace; who can lighten the necessity of toil to the limits of
wholesome industry; who can teach society how to eradicate
disease, or to curb its ravages; and who can broaden the pathway to culture to serve the needs and wants of all, is, I profoundly believe, better than a system that breeds generals,
though as great as Caesar or Napoleon.
There is another field which the line of our thought tempts
us to enter, but where we must be content with the merest
glance.
The demand for material work in the world is not diminished by the forces that science has brought under man's
dominion. Newton is said to have described his own discoveries as but a child's gathering of curious shells on the seashore. Such I think is the feeling of every true explorer.
Nature still abounds in forces not yet subdued to human use.
We know not what may now stand waiting at the door. Edison has lately startled us with a new world, the possibilities of
which no one can yet define.
Nature certainly has neither weariness nor poverty. It is
only a question whether we can bring under our dominion her boundless powers and fertility.  Is it too much
to hope that we may yet attain such mastery, that
the abundance which nature often throws down with prodigal
hands, shall be made certain and constant at our bidding? If
this can be secured, is it too much to hope that human wisdom
can devise such wise order of distribution that want and poverty shall cease, and the shameful selfishness of inordinate
accumulations become impossible? I confess that I have
sometimes thought that along this path would be found the
solution of social problems, which now grow more and more
onerous and menacing. At any rate, whatever may be the
solution, I am sure it must be found by the movement of society in an ascending and not in a descending plane. And this
movement calls for the best minds and the largest men that
the best education can give to the world.
But time will not permit me to pursue this further.




-19 -To sum up here, our propositions are:
1. That education is the duty of the free State, because
necessary to its safety.
2. That the higher education is but a necessary part of
any sufficient system of education.
3. That, historically, Michigan is pledged to provide for
and maintain this complete system of education.
4. That it enhances the power and the welfare of the State
in peace and in war.
5. That only by this means can we hope for that conquest
over the forces of nature so necessary for the safety of society.
6. This University is not only the consummation of what
has been done, but the promise of what shall be done by
Michigan in the great duty of offering her children the privileges of the most liberal instruction.
And here let us turn back a little in our path.
We have seen how rapid the University was in its development. In the fall of 1850, the Medical School was opened,
to be followed, nine years later, with the Law School. In 1851,
there were 159 students; in 1860, 519; in five years more the
number had risen to 1,000; and in 1872, to over 1,200. As they
were gathered from many States, it is apparent how the circle
of its fame and influence had widened.
How is it now equipped for. its future work? How is it
furnished with teachers, books, collections, apparatus, laboratories, and the other means which measure its teaching power?
It has an active corps of about 75 teachers.
The library contains in all about 33,000 volumes.
There is a valuable museum of Anatomy and Materia
Medica:
An ample and growing Geological collection:
A Zo6logical collection, said in some respects to be superior
to any other in this country:
Creditable collections of Botany, ArchEeology, and Art:
A most thoroughly equipped general Laboratory, with three
other special Laboratories:
A fine Astronomical Observatory:




-20 -And, finally, hospitals for clinical study and practice.
This, of course, is the briefest! outline of the institution of
learning to which we pay honor to-day. In three short decades
it has done its work so well that it has won a name that, I
think, the people ' will not willingly let die." It exists in no
hostile jealousy, but in generous sympathy and emulation for
whatever is best done elsewhere.
But it may be asked, does not this impose a heavy burthen
of taxation?
Even were it so, would this be a fatal objection? Would
not the just inquiry be, is it fairly worth its cost. There are
few great blessings which come without cost. Nature is the
only free almoner; to write and to read even, does not come
by nature, whatever any Dogberry may say.
Let us count the cost. First, however, we must put one
side the University fund, for the revenue from this is its own.
In 1838, to launch the University, the State made a loan of
$100,000, which seems to have been all repaid. I think no
other money aid was granted till 1867, when an annuity of
$15,000 was voted by the Legislature. In 1873, by the grant of
a tax of the one-twentieth of one mill, the amount was raised
to about $31,000.  In 1875, special appropriations of about
$20,000 a year were added for new schools of instruction, and
also a specific grant of about $'26,000 for improvements on the
University property.  In 1877, further appropriations were
made of $27,00()  or that year, and $22,500 for the year 1878.
It gives me pleasure to recite this generous public aid.
But surely this is not a burthen.  It is but a pittance from
the great wealth of the people; it is but a trifling share of the
public revenue, and every dollar is certainly thrice repaid.
The equalized assessment roll of the State fixes the taxable
property of the State at this time at $630,000,000.  The real
value of this property can hardly be less than three times that
sum. But suppose it be $1,50,00,000000. A tax of one-thirtieth
of one mill would give $50,000, or an annuity about equal
to the largest annual aid ever granted to the University.
It should shame us to call this a burthen. It is but the




-21 -

sowing of a handful of seed, that we may gather the full
sheaves of a precious harvest. Let us reflect on the broad
stream of wholesome influence carried hence yearly by accomplished and aspiring young men. Are we proud of our wise
and intelligent public opinion? Is it not largely moulded and
purified by men trained here? Are we proud of the charity
and humane providence of our institutions? Is not their best
guide and defence the liberal learning of this place? Do all
our varying religious creeds, casting out uncharitableness,
unite to sweeten society? Is not much of this due to the tolerant and catholic spirit, which reigns like a benediction here?
Does every calling, every industry, every art among us, feel
the power ot knowldge? Is it not because they are raised and
led by standards held up here? Do we count the things that
give us renown abroad? What of Michigan is so well and
widely known as this University?
This is what has been done, and is to-day doing, through
this University. And the changes lately announced here in
the methods of instruction seem to me most wise. They open
to each student the path to which his tastes and gifts invite
him, and take from him the fetters of the old class routine.
They will give, it seems to me, the impulse of a freer life and
of increased power.
It should be our aim that this house of learning should,
indeed, be set on a hill, that its light cannot be hid. Its doors
should be wide open to the four sides of heaven, that whoso
will may enter, and find the help of knowledge. I would that
there should be no young man or young woman in the State,
who shall really desire an education in any useful secular
science, calling, art, or industry, who may not find here the
amplest instruction.
It is sometimes complained that youth from other States
flock hither for education. For my part, I rejoice that it is so.
What splendid testimony to the work done here! What
though they return to their own homes. They do not rob us
by what they carry away.  They are but ships, to use the
imagery of Lord Bacon, which carry riches and commodities,




-22 -

and consociate remote regions in the participation of fruits.
Wherever they go, they go, not only better equipped for good
and true service for mankind, but also as heralds of the learning and power of this University.
Indeed, I can conceive no nobler destiny for this University
than that it should rise to such true eminence, as to draw
votaries from the wide world; that it should hold its lamp of
learning, so high, so bright, so full, that scholars from all
lands should come hither to share its beams.
"Hither, as to their fountains, other stars
Repairing, in their golden urns draw light."
It was once gallantly said of a noble and inspiring woman,
that to have loved her was to a worthy man a liberal education. So would I have it here. I would have such power
dwell here, that to have studied in its halls, and breathed its
atmosphere, should ennoble with a broader and higher life.
GENTLEMEN REGENTS! My final word is to you.
In the care of this University, the care of maintaining and
advancing the highest forms of education in Michigan is
entrusted to your hands. No more sacred trust can ever be
given you. I invoke for it your utmost fidelity and wisdom.
Let no personal or selfish interest divide your counsels, or
betray your judgments. Let those who were its founders, and
those who have been its guardians in the past, be your models.
Let not one jot or tittle fail of the high hope and noble spirit
with which the University was founded. Give generous sympathy and help to the lofty aims which now possess it. Let it
keep full step with the best thought, enlightenment and progress of the world. Jealously guard and maintain it as a great
school for true science, knowledge, and virtue, a nurse and
monitor of free ideas and enlightened citizenship, and Michigan will for ever cherish it as its chief ornament and defence —
decus et tutamen.




OCTOBER MEETIN(G.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. \
Thursday, October io. 1878. 
The Board of Regents assembled in the room of the Presi(lent at I o'clock A. M.
Present: The President; Regents Rynd, E. C. Walker, S. S.
Walker, Climie, Duffield and Maltz.
The meeting was called to order and opened with reading of
the scriptures and prayer by the President.
Regent Rynd called the attention of the Board. to a typographical error in the printed minutes of the last meeting of the
Regents relative to the salary of Dr. Alexander C. Maclean, Hospital Physician and Surgeon. The amount of his salary for the
year commencing October I, 1878, as per schedule of salaries
adopted at the last meeting of the Board was $500, and not $450,
as printed. The statement of Regent Rynd on examination was
found to be correct.
It was moved that the correction be made, and that the minutes thus corrected be approved as printed. The motion prevailed.
A communication from Prof. A. B. Prescott was received and
on motion it was referred to Committee on the Chemical Laboratory.
The annual report of Purchasing Agent Johnson was received
and also referred to tlhe Committee on (Chemical Laboratory.
The President submitted a communication fiom the Secretary
of the State Board,f Health; also one from Dr. Samuel S.
Moffatt, which were accepted and referred to the Committee on
the Medical Department.
On motion the Board adjourned to 2^ o'clock i,. M.

The Committee on Medical Department to whom was referred the
accompanying letter from the State Board of Health, would respectfully
report:
I. Our entire sympathy with the resolutions of the Board of Health.
2. Our inability to make such appointment at present from lack of
funds for such purpose.
3. The fact that at present marked attention is given to the subject of
Hygiene by the Chair of Theory and Practice.
We would further express the hope that the condition of our finances next year will enable us to make ample provision looking to the end
sought by the Board of Health.
Your Committee would further add that the instruction given by the
Professor of Theory and Practice last year was supplemented by a
very able course of lectures given by Dr. Lyster of Detroit. Dr. Lyster




-275 -

rendered his services gratuitously; they were well received by the students
and productive of much good. For such services your CQmmittee feel
under renewed obligations to Dr. Lyster, who has always exhibited his
devotion to his alma mater.

PRESIDENT'S REPORT.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
I have the honor to present to you my Report for the University year ending June 30, I878.
The changes in the Faculties have been -ewer than usual. In
June, I877, W. J. Hawkes, M. D., was ap)pointed Professor of
the Theory and Practice of Medicine in the Homceopathic Medical College. October 8th he resigned his:lace. Acting under
instructions from the Board, the Committee on the llomoeopathic
College on October 32d invited Charles Catchell, M. D. to the
chair vacated by Dr. Hawkes. Dr. Gatchell accepted and entered
on his duties on the 29th of October. HLis appointment was
formally confirmed by the Board at the January meeting. At the
same meeting Assistant Professor Pattengill was granted leave of
absence until the beginning of the next College Year, with permission to apply prior to the June meeting for a further extension
of his leave. Elisha Jones, M. A., was appointed Acting Assistant Professor of Greek for the period of Professor Pattengill's
absence. The title of Mr. Spalding was changed from that of
Instructor in Zoology and Botany to Instructor in Biology and
Botany. In June, 1878, as the term of Dr. J. G. Gilchrist's Lectureship on Surgery in the Homeopathic hMelical College then
expired, E. C. Franklin, MI. D.. was appoiit -l Professor of Surgery in that College.  He was also appointed by the Board Dean
of the Homoopathic M/edical Faculty. The title of Dr. S. A.
Jones was changed from Professor of Materia Medica and Therapeutics to Professor o'f Materia Medica, Therapeutics and Experimental Pathogenesy in the tIomeopathic Medical College.
Charles N. Jones, B. A., Instructor in Mathematics, who had
been absent on leave for a year, was elected Assistant Professor
of Mathematics.

Total in the University...................I.................     1233
The total number in the University was greater by               123 than
in  1876-7.     In  the Department of Literature, Science and              the




- 280 -

Arts the total number was less by 2 than in the previous year.
This slight shrinkage is dute to the falling- off in the number of
Resident Graduates fiom  14 to 7. The undergraduates were
more numerous by 5. In the School of Plarmacy the gain was
5, in the Law School 75, in the Department of Medicine and
Surgery 12, in the HIomceopathic Medical (College 22, in the Dental College io. This increase of numbers in the days of financial stringency was as unexpected as it was gratifying. Owing
to the lengthening of the medical term firon six months to nine
months we had expected a falling off rathe. than an increase in
attendance on the Medical Schools.
In the Department of Literature, Scie!ice and the Arts the
attendance of undergraduates by courses w is as follows: Mining
Engineer, 13; Scientific, 20o Civil Enginee:r, 39; Latin and Scientific, 71; Classical, 195; Select, 3z.
T'he number of women in the Univer;ity was 93, or about
seven and a half per cent of the whole. Tlie percentage heretofore has been about nine. They were distr buted as follows: In
Literary Department, 51; School of Pharmacy, I; Department
of Medicine and Surgery, 25; Law School, i; Homoeopathic
Medical College, i5.
A little more than 49 per cent. of the students were from
Michigan. In the Literary Department 6S per cent. were from
Michigan; in the aggregate attendance in the Medical Schools
and Dental School, 49 per cent.; in the Law School about 34
per cent.; in the Pharmacy School, 50 per cent. Illinois and
Ohio each sent us 98 students; New York 89; Pennsylvania, 59;
Indiana, 60; Wisconsin, 32; Canada, 24; Minnesota, 25; Missouri, 22; Kansas, I9; California, io: Kentucky, 8.  Every
New England State was represented here, Massachusetts sending
the largest number, io. We had students fromn Armenia (Asia),
Japan, Russia, Porto Rico, and the Hawaiian Islands. Thirtyfour of our own States and 'Territories, and five foreign lands
were thus represented in the body of students. These simple
figures indicate howvwide is the influence of the LUniversity.
In the Department of Literature. Science and the Arts the
xear's work has beeni oin the whole exceedingly satisfactory. The




-281 -

reduction of the teaching force has made it difficult to render the
best aid to our large classes in some branches, especially in Mathematics. But by the industry of our Faculty all that was possible
was accomplished, and the provision for the next year relieves us
of the embarrassment we have exptaienced in caring for the
classes ill Mathematics. WVe do, however, greatly need still one
more teacher in the Mlodern Languages. Never have our students
devoted themselves to their duties in a more orderly, earnest and
commendable spirit than during the past year. There has not
been a single case of serious discipline.
The desire which we have long cherished to open a Laboratory for special instruction in Physics has this year been gratified.
The Legislative appropriation of fifteen hundred dollars for
apparatus and of a salary for a Professor enabled us to begin this
much needed work with a good degree of success. It is to be
hoped that we shall be able to add to our means of illustration,
until we shall be as well furnished for teaching Physics as we are
for teaching Chemistry.
The appropriation of fifteen hundred dollars made by the last
Legislature for the purchase of astronomical instruments has
enabled us to erect a small observatory near the large one.
The Director has secured an equatorial telescope of six inches
aperture, and a transit instrument with zenith-telescope attachment, so mounted as to be used either in the meridian or in the
prime vertical.  These instruments can be used for instructing
students, while the large telescope and the meridian circle will
be used by the Professor in his observations. The transit of Mercury on May 8th was successfully observed by Professor Watson.
The necessary expenses were met chiefly by an appropriation by
Congress, but partly by a small appropriation by the Board.
It is proper to add that at the recent total eclipse of the sun
Professor Watson has discovered two new planets between Mercury and the sun. lie hlad been a firm believer in the theory
advanced by the French Astronomer, Leverrier, of the existence
of an intra-Mercurial planet, to which, in anticipation of its discovery, the name of Vulcan had been given. In his search he not
only found Vulcan, but also another planet. This is by far the




282 -

most brilliant of the many achievements by which Professor Watson has won renown, not only for himself, but for the University.
It has awakened the deepest interest on both sides of the Atlantic.
I cannot but take this occasion to renew my expression of the
desire that either by private or by public munificence some adequate provision should be made for a publication fund to enable
the Director to print the results of his work at our Observatory.
The Faculty of the Literary Department, ever watchful for
the good of the University, have repeatedly during the last few
years made such changes in the requirements for admission to
the courses of study and in the methods of teaching as seemed
to them to promise an increase of the usefulness of the Institution.
Indeed from the beginning of the life of this University its authorities have been distinguished for the boldness and originality of
their policy. They have had the pleasure of seeing not a few of
their innovations, which were at first criticised, adopted by many
of the leading colleges of the land.  They have aimed, not so
much to follow blindly the traditionary course of older colleges,
as to seek with wisdom to make this Institution accomplish most
successfully the largest and best work possible for it with its
resources. Animated by this spirit the Faculty have for several
months past been diligently inquiring whether some important
and useful changes could not be made in our plans. 'he halppy
results, which had followed fiom opening elective studies to the
senior class, impressed them with the belief that some liberty of
choice might properly be extended to all the students. Again
they had long felt that while the University courses were co-ordinate with most of the courses in certain prominent high schools, still
the so-called English course, which is prolonged and thorough, in
many schools covering the same period of study as the preparatory classical course, had no natural sequel here, which led to
any degree. The question was forced on them whether while
this was the case, the University was doing all that it ought to
do in discharging its duty as an integral part of the State system
of public education. Ought it not to try without sacrificing the
interests of good scholarship and sound culture, to bring itself
into some harmonious and useful relation with that large number




- 283 —


of High Schools which provide no classical course, but do provide a thorough English course of education which may form a
suitable preparation for some scholarly course of training here? It
seemed to the Faculty that an honest effort should be made to accomplish that end. Therefore they requested this Board to establish a new course, for which the thorough English course as given
in our best High Schools should form the preparation, and to confer the degree of Bachelor of Letters on those who should complete the proposed course.  The required work in this new
course is largely in the English, French and German Languages
and Literatures and in History.
Again, the Faculty were of the opinion that undue importance
had been given to the element of time in fixing the requirements
for graduation.  In every class there are some persons who
can easily do much more work than the majority of the class,
and who, if permitted, could complete the studies required for
graduation in less time than their less gifted associates. Since
the work for a class must be so set that the pupils of average talent can perform it fairly, the best men do not under ordinary collegiate arrangements have the highest stimulus presented to them
to do their best work. Indeed, when no electives are offered they
are often kept back in order to accompany the class. It is true
thev may spend thei' leisure in reading. But ought not the collegiate system to be made flexible enough to furnish all needed
opportunities for these exceptional students to use their best energies in some regular work? It has seemed to the Faculty that by
taking proper precautions to prevent mere cramming, by requiring of each student the use of so much time as is needfil for him
to digest and assimilate his intellectual nutriment, they may wisely
allow every one to do as much work as he can do well, and may
recommend him for his degree whenever he has completed the
work required for it. It. will be possible for the most gifted students to obtain the first degree in a little less time than four years,
and the second degree in It little less than five years, or if they
choose to remain the full time, which is better, they can broaden
and enrich their course by the election of studies not required for
their graduation. It seems probable that while this will stimu



-284


late each one to make the largest attainments possible for him,l it
will also lead an increased number to push on their studies to the
attainment of the second degree.
Again, the Faculty have thought it wise to try the experiment of admitting to the privileges of the University, without
passing the regular examinations for entrance, persons of somne
culture and of mature years who do not desire to graduate. We
have with great caution received a few such during the years
past. There are men and women, especially school teachers,
who have had a good deal of intellectual training, perhaps at
some time have been nearly or quite prepared for college, but
have been prevented from taking a college course, who greatly
desire to pursue certain special studies, which they are thoroughly
prepared to pursue in a manner creditable to themselves and to
the University. There seems to be no good reason why at least
a limited number of such persons may not be admitted to the
privileges of study here. The Faculty therefore decided to permit persons of not less than twenty-one years of age, who should
give satisfactory evidence of their ability to pursue the studies
which they wish to take, to enter our class-rooms and avail themselves of such help as we can offer them.
It is proper to say that in making the changes named, which
some may deem rather bold experiments, the Faculty had constantly in mind the mature age and the earnest purpose of our
undergraduate students. For a series of years the average age of
our students on entering the Freshman class has been about nineteen and a half years. Consequently we may say the average age
of our students is over twenty-one. Very few of them are unwillingly here. The mass of them have not come because they were
sent. A large proportion of them have toiled hard to earn the
means by which they are enabled to stay here. It is but simple
justice to say that they. are here with a manly purpose to make the
best use they can of the opportunities afforded them. If any body
of students can safely be entrusted with large liberty in the choice
of their studies, our undergraduates can. The disposition, which
is manifested in all the large colleges, to leave wider freedom in
the election of studies, can nowhere be more prudently indulged
than here.




- 285 -

It is highly probable that some of the details may call for
modification in the actual working of the scheme. We are not
so wedded to any theory, which underlies it, that we shall not be
ready to alter, amend, or abolish, as shall seem wise on trial. But
we believe that we shall increase in a marked degree both the
usefulness and the popularity of the University. The proposed
changes have been received with great enthusiasm by our students
and have already brought us warm commendations from many
quarters, both from within and from without the State.
These were the principal considerations which led to the modifications of our plan of work, which were announced in May last.
The occasion was seized however to make a distribution of the
work, which should be better both for students and for teachers.
It was thought that the earlier part of our courses was too exclusively given to a few studies, that it tended thereby to become
monotonous and wearisome.   Opportunity is now afforded for
diversifying the course by judicious elections of studies. In all
the courses save the Engineering courses, it is possible for the
student during every term to elect some study. Previously the
work of some chairs of instruction was intolerably heavy in
certain parts of the year and too light at other parts. The rearrangement of our work has enabled us to remedy this evil.
Since the Class Day of the Seniors has been brought into
Tuesday of Commencement week, the Alumni have found themthemsclves crowded for an opportunity for their meetings. The
Board, justly deeming it of the first importance that the Alumni
should have every facility they desire for their reunions, decided
to try the experiment this year of giving up Wednesday to them
and to fix Thursday as Commencement Day. The Alumni, in
an appreciative spirit, made special efforts to render Alumni
Day attractive. An unusually large number of graduates was
present and the exercises were of marked interest. In the evening
the University Senate, comprising all the Faculties, gave a
reception in University Hall to the Alumni and other friends of
the University. A large concourse was present. Commencement Day was marked by a noteworthy change. No speakers were
appointed from the graduating class, but an oration was given by




- 286 -

Hon. Geo. V.N. Lothrop,LL. D., of Detroit. It maybe well to place
on record here the principal reasons which have led us to abandon
a mode of observing Commencement, which has been general,
and I think, universal, in this country. In the first place, as we
have no marking system, it was very difficult to make appointments, which were satisfactory either to the Faculty or to the
class. When we had selected ten speakers, there were always
some of their classmates who seemed equally as deserving as some
of those who were appointed. Again, and perhaps partly because
of this difficulty, for the last few years the opinion had been gaining
ground among our students, until it had become very general,
that it was not desirable to have members of the graduating class
speak on Commencement Day. Some argued that such declamation was unknown in European Universities and that it was more
appropriate to High Schools and Academies than to Colleges.
From whatever cause there was great dislike among the students
to the traditionary custom. In the third place, the lengthening
of the Medical term to nine months and the prospect that possibly
before long the other Professional Schools would extend their
terms to nine months presented a new embarrassment. We must
either have in addition to the Commencement of the Literary
Department a separate Commencement for each of the principal
schools, or we must have a University Comlnencement for the
graduation of all who complete their courses in June. The latter
alone was to be thought of. But if the Professional schools joined
in the University Commencement, and the graduates of the Literary department were appointed to speak, why should not the
graduates of the other schools also be appointed? Clearly graduates from all the schools must in that case be placed upon the
stage to speak, or else none should be appointed, but some distinguished scholar or orator should be chosen to deliver a University oration at the University Commencement. After deliberation it was thought wisest to pursue the latter course, though
it was not without reluctance that many saw the old usage
given up.! But any fears that tie change would cause a diminution in the attendance or the interest on Commencement Day
must have been dispelled by the result of our first experiment:.




-287 -We were fortunate in securing the services of so eminent an
orator to introduce the new custom and we have reason to be
especially grateful for his choice of a theme. No better use
could be made of Commencement Day than to present so cogent,
statesmanlike and eloquent an argument in favor of the support
of Higher Education by the State.
The experiment of lengthening the term in the Medical schools
from six months to nine months has now been thoroughly tried.
We had anticipated a decline in the attendance. It was supposed
that some students would be unwilling to incur the additional
expense involved in prolonging their residence here three months,
and that others would prefer for other reasons to attend schools
which would graduate them on easier conditions than are imposed
here. Probably some were diverted fiom us by such considerations. But on the other hand we have been much gratified to see
that not a few students came here avowedly because the term was
lengthened. This indicates an encouraging desire on the part of
many in the medical profession to encourage the most thorough
preparation, and on the part of those who are aspiring to enter
the profession, to secure such preparation for themselves. The
attendance in the Department of Medicine and Surgery was larger
by eleven, and that in the Homeopathic College by twenty two,
than it was in the previous year.
The Physiological Laboratory which the generosity of the last
Legislature enabled us to establish, has been of great service to
our medical students. More than two hundred and fiftv of them
have availed themselves of its advantages.
In the Law School there were seventy-five more students than
in the previous year, the total attendance being three hundred
and eighty-four. The seating capacity of the lecture room was
taxed to the utmost. It is becoming a serious question how our
increasing classes are to be accommllodated. It is well known to
you that the Faculty of the Law Department have for some time
thought it highly desirable to add one instructor to their present
force. At the meeting in October, 1877, this Board authorized
the Faculty and the Committee on the Law Department to provide additional assistance for the last year. It did not prove prac



- 288


ticable to act in accordance with this suggestion. But it is to be
hoped that some arrangement like that then contemplated may
yet be made.
It was expected that the general depression in business would
make itself felt in the diminution of the attendance on the Pharmacy
School. But the number of pupils was a little larger than during
the previous year. The reputation of the school is now so firmly
established that we may expect its prosperity to continue. Our
chief solicitude arises from the difficulty of accommodating the
students in the crowded condition of our Chemical Laboratory.
Never before were so many pupils under instruction in a single
year in the Laboratory.  Although we have one hundred and
seventy-five tables, not unfrequently during the past year it has
been necessary to place two students at the same table.
The Dental School has a steady and healthy growth. Its
work is regarded with much favor by the Dental Profession, and
there can be no doubt that its classes will increase in numbers
and the instruction become more and more efficient. It is to be
hoped that the State will continue to supply it with the means
necessary for its vigorous life.
The work at the medical clinics and at the Hospital is
becoming of increasing importance. It appears from the report
of the Resident Physician of the Hospital that six hundred and
nineteen patients were treated between October I, 1877 and Aug.
3I, I878. Two hundred important operations were performed.
There were thirty-three operations for cataract, and thirty of them
were successful.
The Secretary of the Board of Control of the State Public
School at Coldwater has shown the desirableness of making some
provision here for the surgical care of dependent and needy children. This Board has expressed its willingness to render them the
needed help if the State will furnish us the means. This suggests
again the great advantage which would accrue to the State, if
provision were made here for caring for the sick and disabled persons, who now crowd our county Alms-Houses. There is no doubt
that many of them might be restored to lives of usefulness, if they
could have proper medical and surgical attention. A large pro



-289


portion of them have curable ailments of the eye. Our Medical
Professors would attend upon these sick poor gratuitously, and it
would probably cost the counties little more to support their
invalid paupers at a Hospital here than it costs them now. There
can be little question that it would be a measure of wise economy
as well as of humanity for the State to establish a Hospital here for
the relief of the inmates of county Poor Houses.
The appropriation of five thousand dollars voted by the Legislature for the purchase of books has enabled us to make a most
valuable addition to our General Library. But we must still say
that for the purposes of a University, where there is such a concourse of students, and where so many and so various kinds of
intellectual work are done, our collection of books is tar too small.
It is to be hoped that in some way we may be able to Imake
adequate provision for the support of our School of Mines,
including the School of Architectnre. It will be remembered
that owing to the failure of the last Legislature to make an appropriation for that purpose, we were obliged to drop our instruction
in Architecture. We were enabled without expense to the State
to make temporary provision for the instruction in Mining. But
we cannot continue the work on the present plan after this year. I
am still of the opinion that the plan broached in the Legislature
in l877 to remove the school to the Upper Peninsula is unwise.
If the students are permitted to do their principal work here, and
can witth teir instructors visit the Upper Petiinsula in the
summer, the best results will be obtained in the most economical
manner.
I venture to repeat a suggestion I have made in a previous
report, that it would be of essential service to the cause of education in the State, if a course of lectures on Pedagogics could be
given here by some competent man. A large proportion of our
students engage in teaching after graduation. Some adequate
exposition of the Science and the Art of Teaching, some methodical discussion of the organization and superintendence of
schools, would be most helpful. Our new system would easily
yield a place for such instruction. Perhaps for a time at least a
non-resident lecturer occupying a part of a year, might meet the
B




-290


wants of our students, and might afford us an opportunity to test
the value of such a course as is here suggested.
I cannot refrain from again reminding the friends of the University that we are in pressing need of two new buildings, one for
the Library and another for the Museu:n of Science and Art and
for lecture rooms to be used in connection with the Museum by the
Professors of the Physical and the Biological Sciences.  We
expect to be patient and to bear with many inconveniences in these
times of financial distress. But we may meantime call attention
to the fact that we are suffering great inconvenience and exposing
our Library and our rare and extensive scientific collections to
the risks of destruction by fire for the lack of new fire-proof
buildings.
With great pleasure I call attention to the Finance Committee's Report, which is hereto appended, and which shows that
we closed our fiscal year with no indebtedness and with a handsome balance in the Treasury. It is a cause of great satisfaction
that we have been able to liquidate the debt which had been for
some time accumulating. There seenis no reason to doubt that
our receipts from students' fees will be materially larger this year
than they were last year. The increase in the number of students
which makes this result certain, also makes it in my judgment
absolutely necessary that we have some addition to the Faculty of
instruction in the Literary Department. We cannot maintain,
and we do not deserve the favor of the public, if we undertake to
give collegiate instruction to sections so large that each student
cannot receive proper attention and assistance.
We must all feel encouraged by the appreciation which is
shown in this State and in other States, of the work of the University. Colleges and professional schools are everywhere growing and improving; yet the number of students who resort to
our halls steadily increases, and the influence and reputation of
the University are constantly extending. If the State continues
to us its cordial support and if we wisely administer the trust confided to us, still larger possibilities of usefillness are easily within
reach of this Institution.  Respectfully submitted,
JAMES B. ANGELL.

[It is proper to say that the following bills have been paid from the
Contingent Fund; but in the estimate made in July, 1877, of probable
expense on account of that fund, no items of this class were included.
This will explain the discrepancy between the estimated and the actual
contingent expenses. The following are the bills referred to, and are included in the above item of $9,857.16, designated "contingent expenses."]

Paid special appropriation for Prof. Watson........  200 oo-$ 5,III 43
All other items of the Treasurer's contingent expense account might
be given, but it is not deemed necessary, as all of the vouchers are herewith submitted, and will remain on file.
It will be seen on examination that the aggregate amount of receipts
covered into the General Fund, during the year was $I32,827.55, and that
the amount paid out on account of that fund was $133,776.80, which shows
the Fund to have been overdrawn $949.25.
The amount received from the State Treasurer on account of special
appropriations made by the State Legislature during the fiscal year was
$42,000.00. The amount paid out during the year on account of these
special funds was $30,938.86, showing a balance in the treasury to the
credit of the Special Funds of $II,06II4. If we deduct from the aggregate Special Funds balance the amount of the General Fund overdraft, viz: $949.25, the balance in the treasury will appear as above
stated, 10, 1.89.
Under an act entitled " An act making appropriations for the general and other expenses of the University of Michigan," approved May
22, 1877, there was appropriated for the year I877, the sum of 827,o00,
and for the year 1878 the further sum of $22,ooo000 —$49,ooo. Of this
amount $32,000 had been drawn on the requisitions of the Treasurer before the close of the last fiscal year, leaving a balance of $I7,000, subject
to draft by that officer, a part of which has been drawn by him as will

The objects for which the balance of the appropriations were made
are as follows:

The annual report of the Treasurer with a full list of the warrants
drawn by the Secretary and countersigned by the President, is herewith
submitted. The list of warrants has been carefully compared with the
books of the Secretary and found to be correct. The vouchers of the
Treasurer for bills paid, have also been examined and compared with
his books, and found to agree. The annual report of the Treasurer herewith submitted is a transcript of his books.
The Steward's statement of the amount received for students' fees,
Laboratory deposits and receipts, and for Diploma fees, has been examined, compared with his books and found correctly stated.
It will be remembered by the Board that at the beginning of the last
fiscal year, the indebtedness of the University was $I7,000. During the
year that amount was unavoidably increased to $32,000. In consequence
of the generous appropriations made by the last Legislature of the State
and of the large increase of the amount received from students' fees, and
because also of the rigid economy practiced in all of the expenditures of
the University, your Committee are now able to announce that thc entire
indebtedness of the University is cancelled. It gives us great pleasure to
make this statement, and also to add that with a proper regard to economy, we may hope to meet the most pressing wants of the University for
the present, without again incurring debt.
Respectfully submitted.
ANDREW CLIMIE,
Chairman Finance Committee.
GEORGE L. MALTZ.
The above report is fully concurred in with the exception that the
undersigned has not personally examined the warrants and accounts
herein referred to,

The following communication was received from the Dean of
the Dental College, and was read by Regent Rynd:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, DENTAL DEPARTMENT, )
Ann Arbor, October io, I878. 
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN-In view of the fact that since the close of our last term
quite an increased amount of labor over that of other years has devolved
upon me, as Dean of the Faculty of this Department, in more extensive
correspondence, and in procuring apparatus, models, books, etc., I ask
your honorable body for an appropriation of $200 for this year at least,
as a compensation for this service,




-301 -I am the more encouraged to do this from the fact of the prosperous
condition of this Department. It now numbers 54 in attendance, and
will exceed 60 within a few days.
This class has not been brought together without effort. I am also
encouraged to thus ask, because it can hardly be said that the teachers in
this Department have extravagant salaries.
In the special advertising we have heen very economical this year,
having expended only about $40. The larger share of this work has
been done with the pen.
Trusting that this request may be in entire accord with your judgment and inclination, I am yours very respectfully.
J. TAFT.
The following report was also read by Regent Rynd, and on
motion it was accepted and adopted:
The undersigned, Committee on Medical Department, to whom was
referred the communication of Dr. Taft asking for an appropriation of
$200 per annum in view of his duties as Dean of the Dental College,
would respectfully refer the matter to the Board without recommendation.

half ago, when the present accommodation for this work was made, it
was supposed it would be quite sufficient for some time to come, but that
time has proved to be short, it is now at an end. The demand now is
for double the present accommodation in some directions at least. The
present Laboratory room is not sufficient for more than eighteen students
and yet there are over forty seeking entrance; about thirty are now
crowded into it, but the work attempted fails in a marked degree for want
of room.
Our lecture room is also too small, having comfortable seating room
for only 45 or 50. How shall we accommodate 60 or 70?
I will further state that there is no room for the safe-keeping of the
apparatus, models and specimens. The material of this kind on hand is
placed about here and there through the building, wherever a resting
place can be found.




-302 -

The special want for the present, at least, lies in the three particulars mentioned. The laboratory work must prove an utter failure without additional facilities. In arranging for this it will doubtless be well
to have some reference for the future. The probabilities are that ere long
the demand will be greater than now.
As to the best method of meeting this emergency, I can hardly venture to suggest. The demand is immediate, and involves much labor.
Your wisdom will devise the plan and your resources enable it to be executed in as short a time as possible. This is the hope of those interested.
Yours very respectfully,
J. TAFT.
Having concluded the reading of the above communication
Regent Rynd read the following report which was accepted and
adopted:
Your Committee on tne Medical Department and Dental College to
whom was referred the petitiou of Dr. Taft, Dean of the Dental College,
asking for the necessary accommodations for the students in his department would respectfully report:
We have made a careful examination of the building now used by
the Dental students, and find that the lecture room is entirely inadequate
to the accommodation of the students now in attendance. There are now
in attendance 54, and this number will be increased so as to reach the
number of 65.
In the Laboratory, which should accommodate every student in the
Dental College, we find only room for 17 students. In view of the pressing and imperative needs of the College your committee feel that accommodations must be furnished by an addition to the present Dental College of a Laboratory and also a lecture room. The present lecture room
can then be used as a Dental Museum, a room now very much required.
Indeed every portion of the present building can be utilized without any
additional expense.
It can hardly be doubted that the next Legislature, in view of the
imperative demands of this college. will make provision for the small expense of the work contemplated. We are forced, against our usual purpose, to anticipate such action on the part of the Legislature.
We respectfully recommend that the whole matter be referred to the
Committee on Buildings and Grounds, and trust that the Board will see
fit to order the immediate erection of the necessary addition to the Dental building.

Regent E. C. Walker submitted the following resolution.
which was adopted:
Resoloed, That the Treasurer of the University be directed to procure

The following communication from the Instructor of Botany
was received and read by Regent Duffield:
ANN ARBOR. October 9, 1878.
To the Board of Regents of the Universziy of M'chig-an:
GENTLEMEN-I present herewith a statement of some of the most
pressing needs of the Microscopical Laboratory with the request that
they may be taken into consideration at your present meeting. The
work of students in this Laboratory has been uniformly satisfactory and
excellent results have been attained. At the same time we have always
suffered a very considerable waste of time owing to the fact that no more
than one-third of the students can be supplied with high powers at the
same time. At present about thirty students are doing Laboratory work
with only nine high power objectives. Much time is wasted in consequence of this lack of Instruments.
Five one-fifth inch objectives at $12 apiece would in a great measure
supply this deficiency.
Another pressing want is felt in the lack of a set of crude drugs properly put up and labelled for the use of the senior Pharmacy class. The
members of this class are expected to become familiar with the character of the principal crude drugs in commercial use. It is impossible
to attain this result without a good set of specimens which can be made
accessible to the class.
About 175 specimens would be required. Swift & Dodds, of Detroit,
offer this number put up in salt mouth bottles with glass labels for $69.40,
and dealers in Ann Arbor will probably make quite as advantageous
offers.
These articles are permanent, and would not have to be renewed.
Of articles to be consumed by students in their regular work the expense
for the present year is estimated at about $45.0o. The items for which
an appropriation is asked are:
I.  Five  objectives  at $12  each................................................ $60  oo
2.  I75 specimens crude  drugs in bottles.....................................   40
3. Reagents and materials for use in Laboratory........................ 45 60
$175 oo




— 310 -

It becomes necessary to determine the fee to be paid by each student to
cover incidental expenses such as the cost of drugs, reagents. etc., actually consumed. In view of the fact that in other departments of the University no charge is made for the use of instruments, it is respectfully
recommended that the charge for the use of microscopes be discontinued,
and that each student be charged a fee of $2 for materials and reagents
each semester's work, a sum, it is believed, which will fullycover actual
expense.
VOLNEY M. SPALDING, Instructor in Botany.
At the close of the reading of the above communication, Regent Duffield submitted the following report and recommendation:
The committee recommend: I. That the charge for the use of microscopes be discontinued; 2. That each student be charged a fee of $2 for
materials and reagents for each semester's work; 3. That an appropriation of $I75 be made to the Laboratory, viz:
I.  Five  objectives  at $12  each..................................................$  60   oo

Professor W. H. Pettee being present stated that he desired
to make a few suggestions to the Board relative to the condition
of the school of Mines. Permission being granted, the Professor read the following paper:
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
I beg to offer a few suggestions for your consideration in relation to
the affairs of the School of Mines.
It is well known that the Legislature of 18'5 appropriated the sum
of $21,000 for the establishment of this School (including a department
of Architecture), and for its maintenance for two years. Some of that
part of the appropriation which was available for equipment purposes
was lost to the University, because the Professor of Architecture and De



-312 -

sign, wishing to keep well within the limits of the appropriation, and
not being aware that the money would have to be expended, if at all,
before the end of December, 1876, postponed the completion of his intended purchases until it was too late. For information as to the expenditure of the equipment fund, so far as relates to the departments of Mining and Metallurgy, reference may be made to my letter to President
Angell, published as an appendix to his report for theLyear ending June,
1876.
The Legislature of 1877 failed to make any appropriation for the further support of the School, and all that has been done in and for the
School during the past year has had to be done without aid from the
State; nay, more than that, without expense to the University. The instruction in architecture was suspended at the beginning of the year; and
not a single dollar, so far as I am aware, has been drawn from the University treasury, either for the payment of salaries or for the purchase of
any apparatus or supplies to be used in the Department of Mining or
that of Metallurgy.
For the first two years of the existence of the School I held the Professorship of Mining Engineering. At the opening of the School in
1875, there were no students far enough advanced to take up the special
topics of Mining or Metallurgy, and the services of the Professors of
those branches were, therefore, to a large extent, available for other University work. I assumed charge of the classes in the Literary Department in Mineralogy and Geology, and of the Senior Pharmacy class in
Crystallography. This work I repeated in the second year, giving in
addition instruction in Mineralogy to the Junior class in the Mining Engineering Course, taking them in a separate section by themselves.
Upon the failure of the legislative appropriation in 1877, I resigned
the Professorship of Mining Engineering, but was subsequently appointed
Professor of Geology at the reduced salary  provided for by special
legislative apropriation, with the understanding that I was to have
charge of the classes in Mineralogy, Geology and Crystallography, as in
the previous year, and to give in addition the instruction in Economical
Geology and in Mining Engineering to the Senior class without extra
compensation. This arrangement was made after considerable discussion in the Board of Regents upon the general question of the advisability of attempting to keep up the organization of the School at all. Professor Langley also volunteered to give the metallurgical instruction to the
Seniors without pay; Mr. Douglas made provision for the quantitative analysis of the Mining Engineering course in the Chemical Laboratory; and Mr. Joy rendered gratuitous assistance in blow-pipe analysis. This extra work bore heavily upon us all, but we carried on
the instruction to the best of our ability under the unfavorable condi



-13 -tions. Professor Langley and myself accompanied the Senior class in the
spring vacation on a visit to the mines, smelting works, and mills of
Pittsburgh and vicinity, bearing our own expenses. All was done that
could be done to make the school successful. At Commencement the degree
of Mining Engineer was conferred upon four students.
The work of the present year has been begun upon substantially the
same basis as that of last year, though with some modification of details.
Noone, so far as I know, regards this arrangement as anything more than
a temporary provision for an interval not otherwise provided for. It cannot be made permanent. The principal objections to it are three in number: It is unfair to,the students; it is unfair to the Professors; it is not
worthy of the University. The students cannot receive that amount of
personal attention which they ought, as students of an important branch
of applied science, to receive; the Professors can do neither themselves
nor their subjects justice; the University will gain no renown.
What then is to be the future of the School? I will not discuss at the
present time the general question of the importance of sustaining a mining school in the State of Michigan, but will assume that you all agree
with me in the opinion, that if there are good and sufficient reasons for
having such a school at all, the proper place for it is at the University,
with, if possible, a summer school, open for two or three months in the
year, as an adjunct in the Upper Peninsula. In the present condition of
affairs there seem to be three courses of action from which to choose,
the first two not being necessarily inconsistent with each other. The
three courses are: ' I) To attempt to secure permanent aid from the State;
(2) to carry on the school as one of the branches of the University, dependent for its support upon the condition of the General Fund; (3)
to suspend temporarily the operation of the School. I will endeavor
to set forth briefly some of the principal considerations which bear
favorably or unfavorably upon each of these three plans.
i. Shall the State be asked to providefor the support of the School?
This question is involved with that of the general policy of the University and of the Regents as to their relations with successive Legislatures,
but it would be out of place for me here to enter upon any discussion of
that broad and more comprehensive question. I will take for granted
that there is no insuperable objection against going before the Legislature with a request for aid.
It seems to me desirable that the School should receive direct support from the State, if it can be obtained in the form of a permanent
appropriation, not requiring to be renewed at each legislative session;
but I am in doubt as to the wisdom of attempting to reorganize the
School solely on the foundation of an appropriation which covers two
years only, and which is liable to be lost at the end of that time through




-314 -

the failure of the Legislature to take action. Of course there would be
nothing objectionable in accepting legislative aid for a period of two
years, or even for one year, if the main support of the school were to
come fiom some other quarter.
One argument in favor of seeking aid from the State lies in the probability that in this way a larger sum can be obtained for the immediate use
of the School than can be spared at once from the General Fund. To place
the School upon a sure footing, and to make it an efficient branch of the
University will require the expenditure within a short time of considerable sums of money. When the school is well equipped, a moderate annual appropriation will be sufficient to supply its wants. Several thousand dollars could well be spent immediately in the purchase of books,
apparatus, diagrams, models, mineralogical and geological specimens,
and other means of properly illustrating the special subjects taught in
the School. Indeed, without some such expenditure, the School cannot
be carried on satisfactorily for any length of time.
There ought to be furthermore, (to say nothing about the Department of Architecture,) two Professors employed, one of Mining and one
of Metallurgy, whose time can be given mainly, if not entirely to the
work in those Departments. The Professor of Mining might, to be sure,
have charge of one or two classes in some allied branches of study for a
part of the year, and the Professor of Metallurgy might be able to render
more or less assistance in the Chemical Laboratory, but it should be distinctly understood that such extra work was subordinate to the principal
duties of the Professorships. The greater part of the salaries of these
two officers, therefore, would have to be provided for in addition to the
salaries now paid, and would be a fresh burden upon the University funds,
unless relief were given by the State.
Another argument in favor of seeking aid from the State is, that, in
building up a new department in the University, especially one which
is expected to acquire importance, not by the large number of students
attracted to it, but by the quality of the work done by those who are on its
rolls, and by the value to the State of the trained young men who receive
its diploma, there is a certain danger that the amount of money necessarily expended upon it will seem to be out of proportion to that
appropriated for other purposes, and that some real or fancied injustice
will be done to the older departments for the sake of fostering the new
one.
Still another argument for seeking State aid is found in the belief
that the growth and development of the School of Mines will be much
more rapid and healthy upon a regular and definite annual appropriation
which cannot be diverted to other uses, than it will if dependent upon
the varying fortunes of the General Fund.




- 315 -


In making the request for aid the attention of the Legislature should
be called to the best form of granting the appropriation.  The Board of
Regents ought to have considerable discretion in its expenditure, so as to
be able to devote such part to the payment of salaries and such to the
purchase of apparatus as may seem best to them from time to time.
2. If the Board of Regents, upon deliberation, decide not to ask for
special aid from the incoming Legislature, or if the Legislature shall fail
to grant the aid asked for, the question assumes a different form. Can
the School be carried on in a satisfactory manner at the expense of the
General Fund? That it cannot be carried on without expense is obvious. I will speak only of what will be indispensable in the Departments
of Mining and Metallurgy, omitting, as before, any reference to the Department of Architecture, which stands in a certain sense by itself.
Good instruction in all the preparatory studies which lead to the
special courses in Mining and Metallurgy, can be provided without employing any instructors in addition to those now on the ground, excepting in Geology and in a part of the Chemistry. The University instruction in Geology, including all that is understood by that term, cannot be
given permanently and satisfactorily by the person who also has charge
of the classes in Mineralogy and in Mining Engineering,-at least not
by the present incumbent. There is work enough in those Departments
for two men.
The deficiency in Chemistry alludei to above is in the quantitative
analysis. The students in Mining and Metallurgy ought to have a course
of study in this branch of the subject, different in many respects from
that taken by the general student, or by the classes in Pharmacy. This
makes it necessary to give them separate class instruction and special
drill. The force in the Laboratory at the present time is insufficient to
do this work well. By appointing to the chair of Metallurgy a person
who could spend a part of his time in giving Laboratory instruction, or
by appointing an additional Laboratory assistant and adding the instruction in Metallurgy to the duties of the assistant now in charge of the
quantitative analysis (Mr. Cheever), it is probable that a fairly satisfactory arrangement can be made, to hold in force until something better
can be done.
There is a pressing need of diagrams for lecture illustration, and of
models for showing the principal parts of machines and furnaces with
their mutual relations. These cannot as a rule be purchased in the market. The most:of them will have to be made for our special use.
The accumulation of an adequate equipment in these respects is necessarily a work of time, and a liberal appropriation ought to be made each
year towards the increase of the collection.
The conclusion then is, that if assistance in Geology and either in




-316 -

Metallurgy or in Chemistry can be provided, leaving the Mineralogy and
the Mining Engineering in my hands, or putting them into those of some
other person, and the sum of five hundred or a thousand dollars a year
can be spared for the accumulation of apparatus, the School can be carried on with the probability of attaining a good measure of success,
though it will take longer to bring it to the highest stage of efficiency
than if it had a more ample endowment. Whether or not the General
Fund can be depended on for supplying the additional instruction, and
the needed apparatus, is a question, not for me, but for your Board to
decide.
3. Shall the school be given up for a time? The principal argument
that can be advanced with any force for taking this step is, that the
expenditure necessary for the support of the School would not be warranted in the present financial condition of the State or of the University. Against this argument many strong objections might be urged,
which need not be dwelt upon at length at this time. If, however. the
School has to be suspended at the close of the current year, its projectors
and those whose fortune it has been to be connected with its management will have the consolation of feeling that circumstances entirely
beyond their control have led to the unfortunate result.
Respectfully submitted,

October II, I878.
At the conclusion of the reading of the paper Regent S. S.
Walker, moved that it be accepted and printed in the minutes.
The motion prevailed.
The following report was read and submitted by Regent
Maltz. Regent Grant moved that the report be printed in the
minutes.  The motion prevailed:
Report of Purchasing Agent for the Chemical Laboratory for the
year ending June 3oth, 1878:
Receipts (as by  Secretary's report).................................  $6,560  97
Expenses (as by Laboratory bill-book and Treasurer's report) 5,563 28
Balance to help pay for next year's stock..............................  $  997  69
Inventory of stock on hand:
Chemicals........................................................ $  666  64
A pparatus........................  -.................................   3,836   46
Total.....................................................................  4,503 
The chemicals are valued at the price paid for them.




- 317 -

That portion of the apparatus (such as glass ware), which is as good
as new, is valued at present lowest wholesale price without regard to
original cost.
That which is worn or damaged by use is estimated according to the
time which it will probably last.
This report does not include the following: Assay Furnaces; Smelting Furnaces; Stamp Mill; Lathe for working metals; Tools for same;
Minerals and Ores; Beindorf's Steam Apparatus; Steam Jet Exhausters
for producing vacuum: Large Steam Ovens and Steam Baths; Sturtevant Blowers; Working Tables for students, and permanent fixtures.
Some of the permanent apparatus of the Laboratory needs very much
to be increased. This is especially the case with the microscopes and
chemical balances.
I have delayed purchasing some of these much needed articles as I
could not run any risk of overruning the receipts and the amount of
these could not be exactly known till the close of the year.
OTIS C. JOHNSON.
The following report and resolutions were presented and read
by Regent Cutcheon:
The joint Committee on Literary Department and on Astronomical
Observatory, etc., to which was referred the application of Professor
Watson for an assistant in the Astronomical Observatory, also the application of the Faculty of the Law Department that Prof. Adams may
deliver a course of lectures before that school on the Constitutional History of England and America, also the subject of the reassignment to
duty of Asst. Prof. Pattengill, and the matter of additional help in the
Department of Modern Languages would respectfully report, that they
have had the several matters under consideration, and submit herewith
resolutions covering and embodying their conclusions in the premises.
i. Your Committee recognize the very eminent services rendered to
the cause of astronomical science and discovery by Prof. J. C. Watson.
which have done much to extend the fame of this University; and also
consider that outside of his duties as Professor of Astronomy, and outside
of his work of instruction as connected with the Observatory, Prof.
Watson has done and is doing a large amount of work in the field of
original research, and computation, not coming strictly within the
scope of his work of instruction, and which he has hitherto performed
voluntarily, and without consideration.
The eminence which Prof. Watson has attained, has attracted the
attention of other States which are now seeking to secure his services.
Your Committee consider it important to retain the services of Prof.




- 318 -


Watson, and believe it will be a wise, and in the end an economical thing,
to grant the assistance he requires in the Observatory.
2. In regard to the application of the Law Faculty, your Committee
gladly bear witness to the fact that while that Department has yielded the
largest pecuniary return, it has been less frequent in its demands upon
our aid, than the other Departments, and we are especially anxious to
meet all their requirements,-for the fullest efficiency of that Department.
One year ago we gave them permission to select an additional
instructor in that Department, which permission they have not yet availed
themselves of. They now request that Prof. Adams, of the Chair of
History be assigned to duty as Lecturer upon Constitutional History in
the Law Department. We are somewhat doubtful of the policy of permanently dividing the duties of a professor between the two schools. And
after consideration your Committee think it a better way to secure a Lecturer on Constitutional History for the Law Department, rather than to
disturb the present efficient work in History in the Department of Literature, Science and the Arts.
3. In regard to the matter of Prof. Pattengill, your committee find that
in the month of January last this Board granted him leave of absence
till the end of the year for the purpose of studying in Europe. In tne
readjustment of salaries at the June meeting, the name of Prof. Pattengill
was omitted from the salaries bill. There seems to have been a misunderstanding in the Board as to the effect of this omission. It now appears
that about half of the Board did not notice this omission, and there seems
to be doubt as to the effect of this omission upon the tenure of office of
Assistant Professor Pattengill. According to the statement of Prof.
D'Ooge the full work of one assistant in Greek, of a high grade, is
required in that department, while further assistance in the department
of Modern Languages appears to be imperative, for which work Instructor
Thomas, now upon the ground, would seem to be excellently adapted.
The Committee therefore report and recommend the adoption of the
following resolutions:
i. That Prof. J. C. Watson be assigned to duty as the Director of the
Observatory, in addition to his duties as Professor of Astronomy, and
that as such Director his salary be fixed at the sum of five hundred
dollars per annum.
2. That J. M. Schaeberle be and is hereby appointed Assistant in the
Astronomical Observatory, at a salary of five hundred dollars per annum.
3. That the Secretary and Steward be and is hereby authorized to
employ a suitable person for the performance of mechanical work and
Janitor's service in and about the Astronomical Observatory, at an
annual salary not to exceed three hundred and fifty dollars.
4. That the Executive Committee, in conjunction with the Dean of




-319 -

the Law Faculty, be and are hereby authorized to secure the services
of a Lecturer on Constitutional History, for the Law Department for the
current year, at a salary not exceeding a thousand dollars.
5. That Assistant Professor Pattengill having reported for duty,
he be again assigned to duty in his former position of Assistant Professor of Greek, and that his salary as such be fixed at sixteen hundred
dollars per annum.
6. That Instructor Calvin Thomas now on duty in the department
of Greek be and is hereby transferred to the department of Modern Languages and History with the title of Instructor in Modern Languages and
History, salary at nine hundred dollars.
It will be seen that Prof. Pattengill simply resumes his duties, with a
reduced salary; that the assistance in Modern Languages is simply
restored to the status it occupied before the reduction of working force in
July, I877, when it was thought possible to avoid a general reduction of
salaries, and that so far as the Astronomical Observatory is concerned, it
restores it upon the same basis it occupied years ago. Your Committee
believe that from present indications, in the large increase of attendance
in the several departments, involving increased revenue, with the present
signs of returning prosperity, we are warranted in strengthening our
corps of instruction, and that such increase is necessary to keep our
University in the present leading position among the great Universities
of our land.

ANN ARBOR, February 6th, I879. 
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN-The Laboratory of the Dental College is greatly in
need of some additional facilities for the prompt and successful prosecution of the work in that Department. The most urgent of these are
three dental lathes, which will cost about $75. For this we ask an appropriation.    Most respectfully,
J. TAFT, Dean.

erection of the Observatory building, which on motion was referred to the Committee on Finance.
The presence of the Joint Committee of the Legislature on the
University was announced by Regent Cutcheon. He also explained the object of their visit. At the conclusion of his remarks
Regent Rynd moved that any member of the Joint Committee
who desires to do so, be permitted to address the Board. The
motion prevailed.
Hon. D. W. Sharts, in behalf of the Joint Committee, then
read the following paper:
To the Honorable Board of Regents, University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN-The undersigned, members of the University Committee from the Senate and House of Representatives of this State, visit you
to examine the work which is being done, to consider your needs, and to
aid you according to our best ability in promoting the interests of this
institution of learning.
We have received a communication from your Executive Committee
touching the work and requirements of the University, and also a courteous invitation to make a personal examination of your condition and
needs.
From a careful examination of the paper which has been presented
to the Legislature, we have determined at this time to
Ist. Ascertain whether your expenses either for tuition or incidentals
can properly be reduced.




- 326 -

2d. Whether a new fire proof building for Library and Museum is
very important, if so, the probable expense, and the amount per annum
required for books.
3d. Whether a steam heating apparatus would be wise and economical.
4th. Whether you require a Homceopathic Hospital building.
5th. The lowest sum necessary for general purposes.
6th. The manner now practiced of keeping your accounts; the character of the work being done in every department of the University; the
amount of labor performed by individual professors, and the length of
time professors are permitted to be absent from duty for any purpose
whatever.
7th. We shall be glad to have any other matter not indicated above,
which may occur to you, presented for consideration. We desire to aid
you in this great work of maintaining a University which shall inculcate
that knowledge which is " power and liberty and peace."
We recognize the University as one source of just pride to the people
of the State, and that they should not grow weary in its support, we ask
that its affairs be conducted ably, honestly, and economically. We can
afford to be just, but the University must be in sympathy with the people.
And now in conclusion, permit us to call your attention to a single
thought. You will aree with us that the unfortunate,defalcation which
occurred in the Laboratory, and which had been in existence for many
years, the loose, irresponsible and irregular practices, which have been
brought to the public attention, the partial and unfortunate position of
a majority of the Board of Regents, in the treatment respectively of Douglas and Rose, in December, I875, and the public indignation growing out
of the tortuous and inequitable management of a case which should have
been settled with the Director alone, these have been and still are prolific sources of great danger to the moral and financial interests of the
University.The committee appointed by the last Legislature carefully examined into the matter, and came to the conclusion that Dr. Rose is innocent. They, with many members of that Legislature (83 in the House)
asked for his appointment to a responsible and valuable position among
the instructors of the University. We are encouraged by this action to
make this important request. The people mean to do right, and to act
honorably and judiciously. Their 132 representatives, coming immediately and directly from them, have no other object in this matter. We
are satisfied that the great majority of the people desire the restoration
of Dr. Rose, whom they believe not only to be an innocent, but a deeply
injured lnan. As the representatives of the people, and in our present
position, in some sense representing the Legislature, we look upon the
history of Dr. Rose, his gallantry on the field of battle, a limb given to




- 327


his country, a crippled patriot, the excessive work he performed in the
Laboratory, his economical method of living, his acknowledged poverty,
uncomplainingly bearing all this, possessing the confidence of nearly all
who know him, a quiet. meek and modest man, a good citizen, and, we
believe, an estimable Christian gentleman-believing this, we must respectfully ask your honorable Board to restore him to a position in the
University suited to his talents and industry. By so doing you show your
sense of justice, your magnanimity becomes apparent, your disposition
to correct the wrongs of the past is clearly evidenced to the people, and
thereby you will be enabled to settle many of the difficulties surrounding
the institution. Thus you will have the confidence of the people, the
support of this Joint Committee, and that satisfaction which ever emanates from the discharge of duties imperatively demanded by justice and
equity.
With these suggestions, hoping you will carefully weigh them, we
anxiously await your action.

Regent Maltz, chairman of the Committee on Buildings and
Grounds, stated that Mr. Harvey, of Detroit, who had, by request,
examined the steam heating apparatus now in the University
buildings, was present; and that he was prepared to submit an
approximate estimate of the cost of heating all buildings on the
Campus, from one central boiler house. Regent Maltz moved
that Mr. Harvey be permitted to make a statement relative to the
feasability and cost of heating the buildings on the grounds as
above mentioned. The motion prevailed, whereupon Mr. Harvey

the facts and report at the next meeting of this Board the extent to which
this habit of absenting themselves from duty at the regular lecture hours

Hon. E. Lakin Brown, of the Senate Committee on the University, being present, stated that in consequence of being absent
last evening, when the paper prepared and signed by the Joint
Committee of the Legislature was read by Hon. D. W. Sharts,
he would, with the permission of the Board, state his views in
a written communication touching the matters which he deemed
of interest to the Board and to the University. No objection being made, the following paper was read by Mr. Brown:
MR. PRESIDENT-It is now fifteen years since I was familiar with this
institution and its management, its work and its wants. Six years devoted in large part to the care of its interests, and to acquaintance with
the distinguished men who then formed its corps of Professors, and with
those my associates in the Regency, could lot fail to interest me in its
prosperity and success far beyond my natural interest as a citizen of the
State. I have not failed to observe with delight the increasing number
of its students, the advanced standard of its teaching, and the high rank
it has taken amongst institutions of learning, not only of this country
but of the world.
And with no less satisfaclion do I observe the deep hold it is gaining
in the affections of all good and intelligent men in our own State. I
know there is a class of men who feel the University a burden, and who




- 332 -

cringe as if with pain if they can discover that even a feather's weight
of taxation rests upon them from this source. I cannot but think that,
they do not reflect how little is the burden and how great is the beneficence. A more enlightened public opinion assisted by the influence of
the hundreds of young men constantly flowing out from your halls and
mingling with the people, and assuming the positions of influence and of
power which their culture and training cannot fail to give them amongst
their fellow-citizens, must surely correct these false and narrow views
wherever they exist, and the University will become, as it deserves to be,
in the hearts of the people the pride and glory of the State.
Mr. President; we come as Committees of the Legislature, to whom
is entrusted this duty, to observe the progress you are making in your
great work, to discover if we can, the needs and wants of the institution,
and to do all in our power consistent with the general interests of the
people, to aid in its work and to further its interests. We cannot but be
gratified with the evidence of the noble work it is doing, and encouraged
and elevated by the prospect of its more noble future.
I know something, Mr. President, from the experience I have had
upon its Board of Regents, of the many wants of such an institution
that it may do the best work, and for the best interests of the people.
But the full acquirement of all that is needed is, of course, a matter of
slow growth, and only to be attained with the growth of the State in
wealth, intelligence and refinement, and as the University becomes
blended with the knowledge, the affection, and the pride of the people.
In the meantime, moderation in demand, care and economy in expenditure, and a wise and judicions liberality in public grants will lead gradually to the attainment of all that its best friends foresee and desire.
And yet, Mr. President, while my own feelings are so friendly to the
University, and while I am assured that those of my associates of the
committees are no less so, I have a few words to say which I trust the
Board of Regents will receive kindly and consider wisely. My former
position on the Board of Regents may give added force to my right to say
what I think we have all a right to say, as members of Committees of both
Houses of the Legislature. I feel that it is incumbent upon me to say,
and I think my associates will confirm me in the opinion, that there is a
widely prevalent belief amongst the people of the State, and a no less
confident belief amongst the legislators at the capitol, that in a case of
most unfortunate notoriety occurring in the administration of the affairs
at the University connected with the Laboratory, justice has not been
done in the premises; that great injustice has been done; and while conceding to the Board of Regents the absolute right to decide for themselves
all questions which properly come before them in the conduct of the affairs of the University, that it will be wise in them to give due deference

to so prevalent an opinion. I need not state the matter more definitely,
nor enter into argument upon the subject. The last Legislature with
great pains and expense inquired fully into the merits of it, and by a
unanimous joint committee, and an almost unanimous Legislature expressed their opinion upon it. I think I may say that that opinion is the
opinion of this Joint Committee, and is the opinion of the two Houses
of the present Legislature.
This being so, it can scarcely be expected that while this wrong is
unrighted, the Legislature should go on voting moneys for the University with the same freedom and liberality as they would be glad to do, if no
cause existed to outrage their sense of justice. I fear it can scarcely be
expected that they will permit laws to remain which already exist granting it a much needed subsidy. I say this with the most ardent love for
the University, and the greatest anxiety to subserve its interests. Indeed
nothing but this would impel me to animadvert upon, to call in question
any of the acts of the Board constituted by law the guardian of its affairs.
They will, after all, act according to the dictates of their own judgment
and conscience, giving due weight to the opinions of the public, and remembering that another body, responsible also to their conscience and
public opinion, have to act in the premises.
At the conclusion of the reading of the above paper Regent
Rynd moved that it be accepted and printed in the minutes.
The motion prevailed.
Regent Climie read and submitted a communication from the
Hon. B. F. Granger, relative to services rendered while acting as
solicitor of the Board. Referred to tle Executive Committee.
Regent S. S. Walker read the following communication:
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
In a communication which I addressed to your Board in October last
and in a memorial which I presented to the Executive Committee in December, in relation to the affairs of the Sehool of Miues, I stated that, so
far as I knew, there had been no expenditure on account of the School
since the close of the academic year in I877. I made this statement in the
belief that the Legislative appropriation of 1875 was exhausted at the
close of the second year of the school.
Since the meeting of the Executive Committee I have learned that
there is still in the hands of the Treasurer an unexpended remainder.
amounting to several hundred dollars, of that portion of the school of
Mines fund which was appropriated by the Legislature of I875 for the
payment of salaries and for the general expenses of the school.
I need not recall to your minds that Professor Langley and myself




- 334 -

have undertaken to give the special instruction in metallurgy and in
mining engineering to the students of the School for two years without
compensation. When this arrangement was made, we both supposed
that there were no funds available for the use of the school in any way.
I do not now ask for any change in that arrangement for my own
benefit; but for the sake of increasing the efficiency of the instruction in
the school, and in view of the fact that there are funds available for the
purpose, I respectfully request your honorable Board to provide for an
assistant in mineralogy and metallurgy, to serve for the remainder of the
current year. I also ask that a sum not exceeding one hundred dollars
be appropriated for suitable cases of drawers in which to keep the mineral specimens which have been purchased for the use of the school.
Very respectfully yours,
W. H. PETTEE.
Ann Arbor, February 6, I879.
On motion of Regent S. S. Walker an appropriation of $Ioo
was made for the purpose stated in the above communication by
the following vote:
Ayes-Regents Rynd, Climie, S. S. Walker, Duffield and
Maltz.
Nays-None.
The following report was read by Regent Duffield and
adopted:
The committee to whom were referred the letters of Mr. V. M. Spalding, Instructor in Botany and Zoology, while they feel the force of some
of the considerations therein presented, yet in view of other considerations already laid before the Board, do not deem it advisable until the end
of the year to recommend any change in the schedule of salaries already
adopted.                            GEORGE DUFFIELD,

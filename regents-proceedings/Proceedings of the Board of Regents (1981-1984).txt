JULY MEETING, 1981
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1981
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellors
Jenkins and Nelson, and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye,
Overberger, Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson and VicePresident and Secretary Kennedy also were present.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order. He indicated  Tuition, Budget,
the first subject for consideration was the recommendation for Three Campuses
1981-82 tuition rates for the three campuses and related budget
information.
Vice-President Frye reviewed the budget information related
to the tuition proposal for the Ann Arbor campus.
He noted that in refining the budget planning model based
on the latest available information, revenue increases of up to
$30 million would be required to meet both the fixed and
variable expenditure requirements for the coming year assuming
an 8% salary/nonsalary program. Of that amount approximately
$15.5 million would be required to meet just the fixed cost
increases.
Thus, starting from a revenue base of $234 million (adjusted for the $11.6 million in base reductions from current year
levels) a total general fund of $264 million for the Ann Arbor
campus would be required. The additional $30 million in revenue
would be derived in the main from two sources, state appropriations and tuition increases. If the current appropriation increase
of 12% is sustained, an additional $11.5 million would be
realized. If the recommended tuition increase of 18% were
adopted, an additional $15.3 million would be available. These
two sources plus other miscellaneous revenue increases would
enable the Ann Arbor campus to meet its fixed cost increases
and mount an 8% salary/nonsalary program.
The uncertainty of this plan, however, arises from the tentative status of the appropriation. Current indications suggest the
full 12% will not be sustained. Given this uncertainty, a firm


1

JULY MEETING, 1981


budget will not be recommended now in order to avoid a further
round of budget cutbacks such as was sustained last year when
a budget was adopted assuming a 3% appropriation increase.
That increase eventually turned into a 5% decrease.
It is necessary to act on tuition rates now in order that
students and families can plan for the coming year. It is possible
to proceed with tuition now since even under the most favorable
appropriation scenario, a tuition increase at the recommended
18% level will be essential in order to meet fixed cost increases
and mount a minimal salary/nonsalary program which will
inevitably fall short of the inflation rate.
Vice-President Frye concluded that the recommended increases of 18% at Ann Arbor and Flint and 22% at Dearborn
are the minimum necessary to maintain the campuses for the
coming year. These recommendations are within the ranges
currently being adopted among the public institutions in Michigan and our private peers elsewhere. These new rates are not
expected to affect enrollment levels adversely as application rates
remain strong.
Vice-President Frye commented briefly on the outlook for
federal financial aid programs for 1981-82 and subsequent years.
He noted that if the tuition proposals are enacted, a corresponding increase of 18% in general fund financial aid will also be
allocated in order to offset the effect of federal program losses
as well as the impact of the tuition increase itself.
Even with these tuition increases, program reduction will
need to continue, but hopefully at a somewhat slower pace than
was the case in the past year.
Finally, Vice-President Frye commented that when a formal
budget is brought to the Regents, every effort will be made to
include as large a salary increase as possible depending on
available revenue. This will be necessary to maintain our competitive salary position among peer institutions.
Regent Nederlander wondered exactly how much in new
funds was really necessary. Vice-President Frye observed that
that was largely dependent on the size of the salary program.
There is a minimum required increase of $15.5 million for fixed
costs without any provision for salary funds. To this one must
add the financial aid increase of $3.2 million. The final variable
then is the amount of salary/nonsalary funds. If the entire 12%
increased State appropriation is realized, there would be enough
funding for a salary program of just under 9%. Even this may
not be possible, however, since the State appropriation includes
funds for special program revisions which the University requested. If these were funded, the salary program would need to

be reduced by approximately 1%. If the State appropriation is
somewhat reduced as we now expect, a corresponding decrease
in the salary program may be necessary.
Regent Power commented that perhaps the Regents ought
to determine what the minimum acceptable salary program
should be. She asked how the University would manage to deal
with that circumstance.
Vice-President Frye pointed out that the answer to Regent
Power's question again depended upon the size of the State
appropriation. He stated that even with the recommended 18%
tuition increase and a maximum appropriation, the salary program would still fall short of where it should be.
President Shapiro commented that the only other alternative
would be to undertake another round of drastic budget reduction
steps again which would be extremely difficult given the size of
the reductions that the University has sustained in the current
year.
Regent Dunn asked how much of the 18% tuition increase
would be used up in meeting the $15.5 million fixed cost increments.
Vice-President Frye indicated that almost all of the tuition
increase would be taken up by fixed cost, however, other revenue
increases such as indirect cost would still make possible a 2%
salary program.
Regent Dunn continued that if there is no increase in State
appropriation and the Regents mandated a 6% salary increase,
then the administration is suggesting that such a program would
not be possible because of the $15.5 million in fixed costs. If
such is the case, then the Regents will need to review all the
items in the fixed cost list to see whether they are necessary
or not.
Vice-President Frye agreed that when a specific budget
proposal is brought to the Regents, a listing of fixed cost increases would be provided. He warned, however, that many of
these increases such as utility costs are simply unavoidable. The
officers will continue to review these fixed increases and to
reduce or defer them where possible.
Regent Baker pointed out the fragile nature of the $264
million general fund "best case" and noted that reductions from
State appropriations could only be made up through tuition increases or budget reductions. He was concerned that circumstances might force even higher tuition increases during the year.
He also pointed out that one of the reasons for such a high
tuition increase grew out of the Regents' decision not to ask for a




4


JULY MEETING, 1981


mid-year tuition increase during the past year, choosing instead
to reduce expenditures to meet the budget crisis.
Regent Roach wondered whether taking a posture on tuition
now would make it easier for the State to reduce its expected
funding level. The lack of State appropriations is clearly what is
driving tuition as high as it is.
He also observed that in the unlikely event a surplus were
generated through the tuition increase and appropriations, the
University must be prepared to reduce future tuition rates rather
than allow expenditures to rise unnecessarily.
Vice-President Frye agreed that expenditure control will be
a paramount goal in coming years. The question is complex,
however, since one cannot bring everything to a standstill if the
University is going to continue to accomplish changes that will
keep it not only current but in the forefront in areas of scholarship and research.
Regent Roach reiterated his concern that the University must
hold to its commitment to become smaller and better and not
become lax in its commitment to keep program reductions
moving forward. He added that with other fee increases already
adopted the real cost to students will increase between 19%
and 20% if the tuition recommendation is adopted.
Hopefully, such increases will not be brought in the future.
The market will simply not stand it.
Regent Baker felt that some of the fee increases could have
been deferred. The only way not to spend money is not to spend
it. He was fearful that indeed the tuition increase might not be
enough. He asked whether it would be feasible to defer the decision on tuition until the Legislature and Governor could provide
more clarity on appropriation levels.
Vice-President Frye noted two reasons why action was
preferable now. Students and their families needed to make
their budget plans before starting school in September, and
there may not be a definitive appropriation status for several
months as occurred in 1980.
Regent Dunn felt that the likelihood of an appropriation
reduction via an executive order is very high.
Regent Baker said if that was the case, was there any
assurance that another tuition increase wouldn't be requested
later in the year?
Vice-President Frye indicated that unless a budget disaster
occurred an additional tuition increase would not be requested.
Expenditure limitation would be the first course of action in
the face of unanticipated appropriation reductions. If those

reductions proved so monumental that cost reductions could
not entirely accommodate them, wisdom would dictate that
tuition might be an option the Regents would want to exercise.
President Shapiro commented that tuition levels are not a
function of cost increases alone. They also reflect a judgment
of the market impact of those levels and the University's ability
to continue to attract a high quality, diverse student body.
As for the budget, there will be careful consideration of not
only fixed costs increases but also of the possibility of further
program reductions if indeed that becomes necessary to sustain
an acceptable salary program.
Regent Power added that the University must consider not
only what the students can bear but also what the faculty can
bear in terms of increasingly small and at some levels, noncompetitive salaries. She noted that the report on faculty resignations included in the agenda shows individuals with ten to
fifteen years experience leaving for positions elsewhere.
In response to a question from Regent Baker, President
Shapiro noted that the agenda list of reductions in unit general
fund budgets have already been accomplished.
Regent Baker commented on the criteria that have been put Real Estate
forward for the continuation of the Real Estate program which  Program
would require fee increases to make the program completely
self-sustaining within the School of Business Administration.
Additionally, a chair in real estate is to be established from
contributions from individuals in the real estate profession as a
means of enhancing the quality of the program.
Chancellor Jenkins reviewed the tuition increase proposal
for the Dearborn Campus which is set at 22%. He noted the very
serious fiscal position of the campus which necessitated that large
an increase.
The Regents commented on the highly competitive enrollment circumstances in the Dearborn area and the large number
of Dearborn students who are working while going to school.
In turn, Chancellor Nelson described the rationale for the
18% tuition increase recommendation for the Flint Campus.
Regent Baker inquired about the support elements being
provided for the Flint television operation and the Chancellor
clarified the budget figures that sustained that station.
The President noted that the tuition recommendations will
be presented for action at the Friday session. In addition the
question of financial aid programs will be included in the Friday
agenda.

JULY MEETING, 1981


RHosepiPrjc t  President Shapiro then turned to a discussion of the recommendation to approve an amendment to the Replacement Hospital Project Certificate of Need which would raise the cost
limitation from $210 million to $285 million. He noted that, as
previously reported, intense negotiations with State officials had
resulted in agreement to seek a revision in the cost limitation to
incorporate all of the essential elements of the project that were
a part of the original Certificate of Need request. The Michigan
Legislature has now concurred in this new strategy by adopting
in both Houses a concurrent resolution raising the project limit
to $285 million and setting State participation at $173 million
plus related interest/issuance costs. The discussion will include
both the physical characteristics of the revised project and its
financial feasibility.
Dr. Douglas Sarbach, Director of Hospital Planning, Research and Development, reviewed the essential elements of the
project which will now include all of the original elements, such
as, ambulatory care, Women's Hospital renovations, Mott renovations, adult and child psychiatric care facilities.
Mr. Saunders Midyette, Associate Director of Finance, University Hospital, reviewed the financial feasibility documents
which demonstrated that at the $285 million level and with State
participation at $173 million, the project is viable from a fiscal
standpoint. This has been verified with Touche Ross and Company, financial feasibility consultants. He noted that with debt
service and depreciation costs built into the hospital rate structure, those rates remain competitive with comparable local hospitals. Including the related St. Joseph acquisition and renovation
project, this adds an additional $10 million to the $285 million
replacement project.
Regent Nederlander inquired about the size of the depreciation schedule which amounted to $26 million annually. It
was noted that this included the depreciation of not only the new
construction but the existing plant and equipment as well.
Regent Dunn then moved authorization to proceed with the
total Replacement Hospital Project at a cost not to exceed
$285,000,000. Regent Nederlander seconded the motion and it
was adopted.
I. MINUTES
At President Shapiro's suggestion, the minutes of the June
meeting were deferred for incorporation of some changes which
were regarded as substantive. Regent Power also suggested that
the sections dealing with the Geography discontinuation be reviewed by others at the discretion of the Officers.

to the Regents.
Regent Power commented again on the resignation of longtime appointees including several tenured women faculty mem



16


JULY MEETING, 1981


bers and the importance that must be attached to an adequate
salary program. If in fact these resignations can in any way be
attributed to a lack of competitive salaries, this information
ought to be communicated to State officials.
Public Comments  There were no public comments although the President of
the Dearborn Student Government Council submitted a statement to the Board of Regents commenting on the proposed
tuition increase.
The meeting was adjourned.
FRIDAY, JULY 17, 1981
The Regents reconvened at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach, and Waters. Chancellors Jenkins
and Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger,
Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson, and Vice-President
and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent Varner was
absent.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order and announced
that Ray Salah, representing the student government at the
Dearborn Campus, had been scheduled to speak at the Public
Comments portion of the meeting on Thursday, but because he
was not familiar with the Ann Arbor campus, arrived too late
to participate in that session. He wished to apologize to the
Board.
President Shapiro then asked Mr. Harvey Grotrian, Director
of the Office of Financial Aid, to address the prospects for student financial aid for the coming year.
Financial Aid  Mr. Grotrian listed the major sources from which students
Report can acquire financial support: the federal government, state
government, private sources (which includes alumni clubs, companies, and individuals interested in supporting students), and
institutions. Institutional aid consists of gifts, grants or scholarships, loans, and employment. The federal supplemental appropriations recision bill which was recently signed by the President
of the United States will cause some loss in the federally funded
basic educational opportunity grant (now called the Pell Grant
Program) for undergraduate students in the National Direct
Student Loan (NDSL) program.
The United States Congress is currently considering modification of the eligibility criteria for the Guaranteed Student Loan
(GSL) program which, if passed, is likely to become effective
on October 1, 1981. The GSL program has been available
to all students regardless of family finances and has become a




JULY MEETING, 1981


17


very important source of income and support for the students.
It is hoped that if these changes do become effective on
October 1, students applying for support for the Fall semester
will be allowed to do so under current conditions. With this in
mind, the Financial Aid Office has been processing applications
as rapidly as possible and is well ahead of last year.
It is anticipated that the appropriations for 1982-83 would
be funded at the current level and the National Direct Student
Loan program might actually be expanded.
Mr. Grotrian described the funding losses that would occur
if the GSL program becomes available only on a financial need
basis. He also described a new federal program which would
enable parents of undergraduate students to borrow funds at
14% interest. It has been proposed, however, that this program
be extended to include parents of graduate students as well as
independent students. Mr. Grotrian concluded by saying that he
did not anticipate losses of funds for students during 1981-82,
but there was much greater concern for 1982-83 and beyond.
President Shapiro indicated that the vote on tuition would be  Tuition Rates,
1981-82
taken separately for each campus. He felt that summarizing the  Approved
preceding day's discussion on the subject would not be necessary.
Regent Baker again asked for assurance that the administration would not raise tuition further during 1981-82 if the 18%
tuition increase passed.
Vice-President Frye responded that he would make a firm
commitment, and he felt the executive officers would agree,
unless there was an unanticipated extraordinary circumstance
that could not be reasonably resolved in any other fashion, the
administration would not recommend an additional tuition increase for the coming year.
President Shapiro commented that the University's fundamental commitment was to the viability and quality of the institution and to the University's responsibility to students, faculty,
and people of the State. Therefore, an additional increase would
be recommended only if the University was forced to do so to
sustain that fundamental commitment.
Regent Baker indicated that he understood the problems
with which the University had to deal, but he felt there should
be some constancy through the year. On the basis of the foregoing remarks, Regent Baker moved to approve the recommended tuition increase of 18% for the Ann Arbor Campus.
Regent Nederlander seconded the motion.
Regent Roach mentioned the letter distributed to the Regents
from David Yesh, President of UM-Dearborn's student government, in which he suggested the increase be spread over more




18


JULY MEETING, 1981


than one term. Since the appropriations were uncertain at this
time, would it be possible to increase tuition by 16% in September, then, if necessary, make further adjustments at the
beginning of the Winter term?
Vice-President Frye indicated that in the most optimistic
view there would be no advantage in such a delay for several
reasons: the revenue generated by the 18% rate would be
needed to mount a salary/nonsalary program that still falls short
of inflation rates; a greater increase would likely occur at midyear to generate the same dollars because enrollments are
typically lower in the winter semester; a rate increase, as opposed
to a surcharge, would negatively affect tuition rates next year;
it would present budgetary problems for students and their
families; and finally, it would create problems for the Financial
Aid Office because financial aid assessment and packaging is
based on an academic year rather than on a term basis.
Regent Power commented she would hope the salary program for 1981-82 would be as near as possible to that approved
last year. She also expressed her view that another across-theboard adjustment would have a long-term deleterious effect.
In response to Regent Waters' inquiry regarding the planned
increase for the Opportunity Program, Vice-President Frye
stated that a determination had been made to increase the financial aid funds by 18% if the proposed tuition rate was approved.
Decisions on specific allocations for the various programs have
not been made as yet. Each program must be evaluated to
determine need.
President Shapiro pointed out that there were a whole series
of additional important issues in the financial aid area that
remain quite unclear. For example, there is some question about
the funding of the National Science Foundation and the National
Science fellowships and traineeship programs within the National
Institute of Health. These are very important sources of support
for some University programs, and are critical to budget determinations.
Regent Roach, recognizing the difficult situation this year,
hoped that finalizing of the budget would not extend beyond
September, and that hereafter budget and tuition recommendations could be considered simultaneously. He reiterated his
concern that, as unlikely as it might be, if excess funds are
generated they would be used to diminish future student tuition
costs rather than for discretionary purposes.
Regent Baker commented that he did not like to make the
motion to increase tuition, but he felt it was the responsible thing
to do in light of the problems described by the President and the




JULY MEETING, 1981


19


Vice-President for Academic Affairs. He said he had voted
against five motions over the past year which raised the cost to
the students by about $40.00. He felt that had these proposals
not been passed, the proposed tuition increase could have been
lowered by 2% or 3%. Regent Baker indicated that he would
continue to vote against any proposal that would add to the
cost to the student unless these were absolutely necessary.
President Shapiro then called for the vote on the recommendation to increase tuition for the Ann Arbor Campus by
18%. The motion was unanimously adopted.
Regent Dunn moved approval to increase tuition at UMFlint by 18%. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Chancellor Jenkins, UM-Dearborn, indicated that the problems at the Dearborn Campus were more critical because of the
lack of reserves. He said it would be impossible to balance the
budget this year unless the recommended 22% tuition rate was
approved. Plans were underway to reduce the base budget
another $500,000 this year.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff explained that Dearborn not only
had an obligation to repay a loan beginning in fiscal 1983, but
also had to generate enough resources in order to have working
capital with which to operate.
Regent Dunn then moved approval to increase tuition at
UM-Dearborn by 22%. Regent Waters seconded the motion
and it was adopted.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff commented that preliminary  School of
plans for the four components (library learning resource center, udsniration
computer facility, management education seminar room and  Addition
offices, and executive dormitory) to be added to the School of
Business Administration had been completed. The recommendation before the Regents at this time was to approve these preliminary plans and to authorize proceeding with working
drawings on a phased basis so that the development of the plans
coincide with the success of the fund-raising efforts.
Mr. Frederick Mayer, University Planner, described the
schematic design for each component and indicated that the
first phase would include the library learning resource center
and the computer facility.
Regent Baker asked if the proposed executive dormitory
could be utilized on a yearly basis.
Dean Gilbert Whitaker, of the School of Business Administration, responded affirmatively and indicated the executive
dormitory building and classroom for the management education
program would be self-sustaining and would also provide in



20


JULY MEETING, 1981


come to help support the credit program. The new facility would
attract greater levels of executives than can be attracted at the
present time for lack of proper facilities.
In response to Regent Power's inquiry concerning the cost
of the project, Dean Whitaker answered that it is estimated at
about $15 million-$7.5 million for the credit educational components and $7.5 million for the continuing education components. A consultant had been retained to work with the
School to identify prospective donors, and a volunteer committee
of top level executives, of whom many are alumni, have accepted
a leadership role in the fund-raising campaign. Dean Whitaker
stated that there has been very good cooperation between the
Central Development Office and the School of Business Administration on this project, and they hope to be the pacesetter
for the University-wide capital campaign.
Regent Roach commented that the plant extension report
indicated that this project was to be financed by gifts and University funds, and asked what would be the University's commitment and from what source would these funds be derived?
Dean Whitaker indicated the University has not committed
any funds to the project. The University had been asked to
consider a commitment that would be approximately 10% of
the total only if inflation or unforeseen situations cause problems
toward the completion of the project. To know that the University was in support of the project would be of great help in
approaching prospective donors. Dean Whitaker said he would
prefer not to have to rely on the University for funds if it can
possibly be avoided. All expenses up to this point, including
the architect's fees, have been provided by the Business School.
In response to a question by Regent Roach on maintenance
costs of new facilities and their adverse effect on the budget,
Dean Whitaker stated that the library and computer facility
which are a part of the educational program would be maintained by general funds, but certainly not the management education facility which generates its own revenue.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that buildings which
are financed from gifts and are directly related to the University's
educational programs have been for the last several years incrementally absorbed in the state appropriation. Vice-President
Brinkerhoff said scheduling any construction would depend upon
the success of the capital campaign for the various components.
Regent Power then moved to approve the preliminary plans
and to authorize proceeding with working drawings. Regent
Baker seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated there is beginning to
be an overload on the V/8 computer at the Computing Center.




JULY MEETING, 1981


21


Based upon the projected demand for computer services, the  Amdahl
Amdahl 470V/8, purchased about five years ago, should be   Purchaeof
replaced. Financial obligations would essentially continue at the
same level as the current budget allocation. Vice-President
Brinkerhoff corrected a statement on page 6 of the agenda report
indicating that because of a change in specification, instead of
an unfavorable comparison of the Amdahl to the IBM 3081
from a power standpoint, it is actually the reverse.
Vice-President Overberger commented that there is a revolution going on in the development of computer use in education
which created a need for more terminal facilities and another
batch station. The basements of the ISR building and the
Michigan Union are being considered as possible areas in which
a batch station could be established.
Dr. Aaron Finerman, Director of the Computing Center,
responded to questions by Regent Baker concerning computer
cost recovery and the use of the computer system outside the
University on a fee basis. Dr. Finerman said the computer cost
is recovered by adjusting the user fees downward if recovery
is more than the cost and upward if less than the cost. As for
outside use of the computer, the perceived attitude that the
University did not want this business is gradually being changed.
The University is encouraging outside usage only to the degree
that there would be no interference with the University's research
and instructional work. The new, larger computer would make
more computer time available to outside groups thus providing
some additional income.
Dr. Finerman explained the use of the terminals and batch
stations used by the students in their various courses. He concluded that the University's emphasis would be on the use of
terminals, but one more batch station was needed immediately
to accommodate users more conveniently.
Regent Baker moved the adoption of a resolution providing
for the borrowing of funds from the Amdahl Corporation to
finance the purchase of an Amdahl 5860 computer. Regent
Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of eleven faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted.
LYLE FORD ASELTINE, Associate Professor of Dentistry, retired  L. S. Aseltine
from active faculty status as of June 30, 1981, following 26 years of service
to the University of Michigan School of Dentistry.
Born in Mason, Michigan, he attended Michigan State College for two
years prior to entering the U-M School of Dentistry, where he received
the D.D.S. degree in 1941 and the M.S. degree in oral surgery in 1944.
He completed his residency in oral surgery in 1945.




22


JULY MEETING, 1981


Dr. Aseltine opened a private practice in oral surgery in Chicago in
1945. In 1949, in addition to maintaining his private office, he joined the
faculty of Loyola University as assistant professor of oral surgery. He was
a member of the senior attending staff at Henrotin Hospital in Chicago.
In 1953, he entered military service as a major with the U.S. Air Force
in Wiesbaden, Germany, and served as consultant in oral surgery to the
Surgeon, U.S. Air Force Europe, for two years.
Dr. Aseltine joined the staff of the U-M School of Dentistry in 1955
as associate professor in oral surgery. In 1965, he received the additional
appointment of associate professor of dentistry in surgery in the Medical
School. His teaching, both to undergraduate students and to postgraduate
dentists, centered on aspects of anesthesia and psychosedation. In addition
to his work in the oral surgery clinics and his teaching, he conducted a
private practice in Ann Arbor.
He is a member of many professional organizations, including the
American Society of Oral Surgeons and the Chalmers J. Lyons Academy
of Oral Surgery (of which he was president). In addition, he served as
president of the Chicago Society of Oral Surgeons and as associate editor
of the Journal of Oral Surgery.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his
dedicated service by naming him Associate Professor Emeritus of Dentistry.
D. H. Byers     DOHRMAN H. BYERS, Professor of Environmental and Industrial
Retirement Health, School of Public Health, retired from  active faculty status on
June 30, 1981, after having completed a long and distinguished professional
career.
Professor Byers graduated with a B.S. in Chemistry from Mount Union
College in 1936 and received his M.S. in Analytical Chemistry from Purdue
University in 1938. After three years on the faculty of the Chemistry
Department of Michigan State College (University), he joined the scientific
staff of the Division of Industrial Hygiene, U.S. Public Health Service in
1941. During his 28 years with the Public Health Service, he gained broad
and varied experience in the field of Industrial Health. This included technical services and research in the laboratory, numerous field investigations,
states relations and program development, and administrative positions. He
was Associate Chief, Bureau of Occupational Safety and Health, and Director
of the Bureau's research and technical service facility in Cincinnati at the
time of his retirement from the Public Health Service in 1969 to join the
faculty of the School of Public Health, The University of Michigan.
Throughout his career he was active in the professional societies in
industrial health. He served in several offices and on numerous committees
of these societies. For 17 years he served as Editor of the American Industrial
Hygiene Association Journal, during which years this Journal grew from a
quarterly to a monthly publication recognized as the leading scientific and
technical professional Journal of this field. While with the Public Health
Service, he developed an early information storage and retrieval system for
industrial health and established an Occupational Health Technical Information Service. For 10 years, he served as the official U.S. representative to the
International Occupational Safety and Health Information Center, of the
International Labor Organization, and as Director of the U.S. National
Center for this activity.
He came to our faculty in 1969 with both national and international
recognition and with comprehensive experience in industrial health to contribute to his teaching and service. He was deeply interested in the education
and development of students into professionals in industrial health. He gave
generously of himself and contributed greatly to the maintenance and growth
of The University of Michigan's excellent reputation in this field.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher for his dedicated
service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Environmental and Industrial
Health.




JULY MEETING, 1981


23


RICHARD B. COUCH was appointed Professor of Naval Architecture    R. B. Couch
and Marine Engineering and Chairman of the Department of Naval Archi-  Retirement
tecture and Marine Engineering in 1957, having served previously with distinction as Chief Naval Architect of the Bureau of Ships of the Navy
Department since 1953. His career with the Navy began after his graduation
from Webb Institute of Naval Architecture in 1933 and graduate study at
New York University the following year, and included periods at several
Naval Shipyards and from 1946 to 1953 at the David Taylor Model Basin in
Maryland. He continued to serve the Navy Department and the Department
of Defense in various capacities after coming to the University, being named
to the Nuclear Propulsion Group, the Shipbuilding Study Group, the Carrier
Review Board, and other similar organizations, by the Secretary of the Navy
or the Secretary of Defense with increasing regularity.
In 1967, after completing his ten-year tenure as Chairman and having
had the satisfaction of seeing the number of faculty and the student enrollment more than double in size and their quality so improve that a viable
doctoral program had been initiated, Professor Couch spent two years as
Director of Engineering at the General Dynamics Shipyard, Quincy Division,
while on leave. Upon his return in 1969 he resumed his teaching activities
and again assumed the responsibilities of Director of the towing tanks that
he had greatly improved and augmented and which were now identified as
the Ship Hydrodynamics Laboratory of the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering.
Recognized internationally for his contributions to the discipline of naval
architecture and for the knowledge and judgment he brought to the practice
of ship design, Professor Couch was designated the David Taylor Medalist
by the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers in 1966. This is the
highest award this professional society confers for technical achievement. The
Society's membership also made him an Honorary Vice-President for Life
in 1973 following his service as Vice-President from 1966 to 1971, as first
chairman of the Journal of Ship Research Committee, as chairman of the
Papers Committee for a number of years, and in many other positions. He
continues to be active in and to assume responsibility for many of the undertakings of this Society. He is also a member of the American Society of
Naval Engineers and of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects.
Professor Couch retired from formal teaching, effective on May 31, 1981,
but he continues to be active professionally and to add achievements to his
already most distinguished career and to the stature and competence of the
Department and the University with which he has been associated.
In recognition of this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service the Regents now salute Richard B. Couch by naming him
Professor Emeritus of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering.
JOSEPH THURMAN HARTSOOK, Professor of Dentistry, retired from     J. T. Hartsook
active faculty status as of June 30, 1981, after 39 years of service to the  Retirement
University of Michigan School of Dentistry.
Born in Columbus, Ohio, Dr. Hartsook received the B.A. degree from
Ohio State University in 1937 and the D.D.S. degree from The University
of Michigan in 1942. He joined the staff of the U-M School of Dentistry in
1942 as instructor and was made assistant professor in 1947 following
receipt of the M.S. degree in pedodontics. An associate professorship came
in 1952, followed by promotion to professor in 1960. In 1962 he additionally
was made professor of pedodontics in the Medical School and attending staff
member of University Hospital. From 1947 until 1962, he maintained a
private practice in Ann Arbor with a specialty of dentistry for children.
In 1962 Dr. Hartsook assumed the post of chairman of the Department
of Pedodontics in the School of Dentistry, serving in that capacity until
1968 when he returned to full-time teaching. An active member of many

programs in Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Canada, in addition to his
regular courses.
The author of a number of publications, he served as contributing editor
for The Journal of the Michigan Dental Association and for the Journal
of Dentistry for Children.
Dr. Hartsook's contributions have been felt in many parts of the
University. In recent years, he was active as a preprofessional counselor
in the LSA College and served for several years on the University Senate
Advisory Review Committee. In addition, he held membership on various
School of Dentistry committees.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Dentistry.
F. E. Hartsuff    FLORENCE E. HARTSUFF, Assistant Professor of Medical Technology
Retirement in the Department of Pathology, retired from the Department on July 1, 1981,
after a most productive career.
Ms. Hartsuff graduated with a B.S. in Pharmacy from The University
of Michigan in 1935 and went on to become an apprentice pharmacist for
Mack and Co. in Ann Arbor, Michigan. From 1936 through 1938 Ms. Hartsuff
worked as a pharmacist at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Michigan.
In 1938 she joined the staff of the University of Michigan Health
Service as a laboratory technologist and shortly thereafter transferred to the
Simpson Memorial Institute as a research technologist and laboratory
technologist.
In 1944 she became supervising technologist of the Main Hematology
Laboratory, University Hospital, and began her teaching career as a technical
supervisor of the Medical Technology Teaching Program with Dr. Frank
Bethell, Department of Internal Medicine. She continued to work with the
Medical Technology Teaching Program under Dr. A. James French, increasing her administrative and teaching load as the program formalized and grew.
In 1950 she was promoted to the rank of Instructor of Medical Technology in the Department of Internal Medicine until 1952 when this program
became a part of the Department of Pathology. This was followed in 1970
with a promotion to Assistant Professor of Medical Technology in the Department of Pathology.
Ms. Hartsuff should be recognized for her ability as an outstanding
teacher, administrator and as a counselor to the Medical Technology Teaching
Program.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and administrator
by naming her Assistant Professor Emeritus of Medical Technology in the
Department of Pathology.
L. Kish     LESLIE KISH, Professor of Sociology and Research Scientist at the
Retirement Institute for Social Research, retired from active faculty status as of June 30,
1981, after a very productive career as a scholar and teacher.
Professor Kish was born in Poprad, Hungary in 1910 and moved to
the United States in 1926. He graduated from the City College of New York
with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics in 1939. He obtained a
Master's degree in the same field from The University of Michigan in 1948
and a Doctorate in Sociology in 1952.
Leslie Kish began his professional career with an appointment at the
Bureau of the Census in 1940. He served as a meteorologist in the Air Corps
during the Second World War and came to Michigan in 1947 with the
founding of the Institute for Social Research. He became an Associate
Professor of Sociology in 1956 and in 1960 was promoted to Professor.
Professor Kish is extremely well known for his popularizing the use of
sampling in the social sciences. Today, businesses and governments throughout the world make decisions on the basis of information they gather from




JULY MEETING, 1981


25


samples of the population. This is a recent phenomenon. Forty years ago,
sampling was used in agricuture and, to a limited degree, in quality control,
but the sampling of individuals for purposes of obtaining information was
extremely rare. The change in these decades is attributable, in no small part,
to Leslie Kish's writings and teaching. He regularly offered courses in survey
sampling to numerous students and through the summer program of the
Institute for Social Research. Within the central statistical offices of almost
all nations, there are sampling experts who were trained at The University
of Michigan by Leslie Kish. He is the author of the definitive work in this
field, Survey Sampling.
Professor Kish has won a variety of honors in his career. In 1975, he
was awarded the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award by The University of Michigan. In 1977, he served as President of the American Statistical
Asssociation. In 1978, he was elected a Fellow of both the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences. In 1980, he became a Fellow of the Royal' Statistical Society
and in 1981, he delivered the Henry Russell Lecture at The University of
Michigan.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar and teacher for his
dedicated service of thirty-four years by naming him Professor Emeritus of
Sociology.
WERNER      S. LANDECKER, Professor of Sociology, retired from        w. S. Landecker
active faculty status as of June 30, 1981, after a productive career as a scholar  Retirement
and teacher.
Werner Landecker was born in Berlin in 1911. He obtained a law degree
from the University of Berlin in 1935 and a Juris Utriusque Doctor degree
from the same institution one year later. He came to the United States in
that year and began graduate studies in the Department of Sociology. He
obtained a doctorate in Sociology from The University of Michigan in 1947.
Werner Landecker first taught for the Department of Sociology in the
fall semester of 1940 when he served as a teaching fellow. Shortly thereafter,
he moved to the University of Indiana where he offered courses during the
war years. In 1947, he accepted an appointment as an Assistant Professor
of Sociology at The University of Michigan. He became an Associate Professor
in 1952 and was promoted to the rank of Professor in 1961.
Professor Landecker has a wide range of interests within the field of
sociology including sociological theory, criminology and social stratification.
In 1952, along with several colleagues from this department, he published
Principles of Sociology which became the most popular introductory text
in the discipline.
Perhaps he is most widely known for his research and writings concerning social class identification and social class stratification. He has written
extensively about class crystallization, that is, how do individuals make
judgments about their own position in the social structure and that of their
friends or colleagues. His book on this topic, entitled Class Crystallization,
will be published by Rutgers University Press this year.
Professor Landecker is pursuing his sociological studies. He was one of
the faculty investigators in the Department's 1980 Detroit Area Study and
he will continue to work on this study of ideological beliefs in the future.
Professor Landecker offered a wide variety of courses at both the
graduate and undergraduate level. He guided the dissertation research of
numerous students and has held many administrative positions within the
Department of Sociology.
The Department, the College, and students have been very fortunate to
have had Professor Landecker as a teacher and colleague for forty-one years.
We look forward to his continuing contribution to the field.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher by naming him
Professor Emeritus of Sociology.

12 years before coming to The University of Michigan in 1946 for graduate
work.
He earned the Master's degree in periodontics at the University in 1948
and the Ph.D. in oral pathology in 1951. Joining the faculty of the School
of Dentistry in 1950, he was made chairman of the Department of Periodontics in 1963, a position he maintained until he retired.
The recipient of many honors for his far-reaching contributions to

service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Dentistry.
WILLIAM B. TAYLOR, Professor of Dermatology, retired from active   W. B. Taylor
faculty status as of June 30, 1981, after a most productive career as a teacher,  Retirement
researcher and clinician.
Dr. Taylor graduated from The University of Michigan in 1931 and
received his M.D. degree from The University of Michigan in 1935 where he
was elected president of his graduating class. He served one year of internship at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio followed by 15 years in
general practice in Jackson, Ohio. In 1950, Dr. Taylor returned to The
University of Michigan and served a three-year residency in the Department
of Dermatology. He has been a member of the faculty since 1953, starting
as Senior Clinical Instructor. He was promoted to Assistant Professor in
1955, Associate Professor in 1963, and Professor in 1971. In addition to his
work at the University, Dr. Taylor has been a staff member at St. Joseph
Mercy Hospital since 1953 and was Attending Physician at Veterans Administration Hospital from 1955 to 1970.
Dr. Taylor is well known as a teacher and clinician and has given
generously of his time and expertise since he joined the faculty 28 years ago.
As a consequence, he has probably influenced as many academic and practicing dermatologists as anyone in the United States, and due to the
tremendous size of the Medical School class here at Michigan (237 students),
he has also influenced the thinking of many medical students towards the
field of dermatology.
In addition to his main interest in the teaching of medical students and
residents, his primary area of expertise has been in the area of Mohs chemosurgery for advanced cancer of the skin. Dr. Taylor has rendered a major
service to the State of Michigan as a referral service for advanced cancers of
the skin and was recently listed in the Best Medical Specialists in the United
States where he was cited for his expertise in this area.
During his career at The University of Michigan, Dr. Taylor has written
many articles ranging from  case reports to retrospective and prospective
studies on various clinical problems. He is a member of several prestigious
societies in the field of dermatology, most notably the American Dermatological Association.
On December 1, 1979, at the annual meeting of the Dermatology Foundation at the Chicago Hilton in Chicago, Illinois, Dr. William B. Taylor
received the 1979 Clark W. Finnerud Award. This award was given in
recognition of outstanding service as a teacher and clinician in dermatology.
The award was given to Dr. Taylor by the President of the Foundation,
Coleman Jacobson, M.D., who read from the inscription on the plaque, "This
is presented to William B. Taylor, M.D., a superb clinical physician, excellent
teacher, and humanist. He has given inestimable service to his patients and
by the example of his dedication to his specialty has inspired and influenced
scores of residents and countless medical students over a generation."
The Regents now salute this distinguished dermatologist for his dedicated
service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Dermatology.

University (MA). He also was a Nieman Fellow in Journalism at Harvard
University (1945-1946) and a Ford Fellow in Mass Communications at The
University of Michigan (1957-1958).
Professor Yablonky has worked on newspapers and in broadcasting in
Chicago and New York. In his native Chicago, he worked as a reporter and
editor for the Chicago Herald and Examiner and the Chicago Sun. In New
York City, he was associated for six years with the experimental, adless daily
newspaper, PM.
In recent years, he has specialized in broadcasting journalism, serving
NBC News and CBS News, the latter for twelve years. In 1964 and 1966,
during the national presidential election campaigns, Professor Yablonky
established and supervised special nationwide staffs of correspondence for
CBS News, for the Republican and Democratic national convention in 1964,
and for reporting the results on Election Night in 1964 and 1966. Since 1962,

competitive basis. Under the Fellowship Program, which is funded by the
National Endowment for the Humanities, a federal agency, eighty-three
American reporters, writers, editors, publishers, and general managers from
all the news media have spent nine months at the University in a study of
the humanities and related areas under a non-degree, non-credit program.
In addition, twelve foreign journalists have participated through funding
from other sources.
Professor Yablonky also supervises the Honors Program in the Department of Journalism for selected undergraduates, who in their senior year
produce a thesis suitable for publication.
Prior to joining the faculty at The University of Michigan in 1959, he
was for eleven years at New York University. He was a Fulbright Visiting

and Visiting Lecturer at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Journalism
in Latin America in Quito, Ecuador, in 1963. He was a Visiting Professor of
Journalism at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu in 1972.
As a teacher and scholar, Professor Yablonky has a special interest in
press history, comparative world media systems, and in the study of the
performance of the media.
In January, 1976, Professor Yablonky was invited by the Foreign
Ministry of the Swedish Government for a visit to study the Swedish press
and broadcasting system and to confer with educators in the nation's two
schools of journalism. This was his fourth visit in his continuing study of
the Swedish press. He also is the ghostwriter of "Swedish Immigrants" in
Lincoln's Time" by Nels Hokanson, published by Macmillan in 1940.

society. He also is a member of the board of directors of the National
Broadcast Editorial Association.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher for his dedicated
service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Journalism.
Regent Dunn commented that he had distributed copies
of an early retirement plan that some institutions have been
studying and asked if the administration had any comment at
this time. He indicated that one way to approach the current
fiscal problems was to introduce an attractive program for early
retirement.
President Shapiro responded that a number of early retirement options were being studied and these would most likely
be discussed with the Regents sometime in the fall.

abstained from the vote.
Doctoral Degrees  The Regents approved the list of doctoral degree candidates,
Approved as recommended by the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies for August 1981 Commencement exercises.
IX. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Hospital Audit  The Regents received an audit report concerning University
eport Hospital property and equipment.
Annual Fee    Regent Roach moved to authorize the Vice-President and
Allocation Chief Financial Officer to establish an annual fee allocation
amount to cover utility costs for the University of Michigan
Union, League, and North Campus Commons. Regent Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Parking Structure  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the resolution for the
Fee Bonds issuance of fee bonds to finance the parking structure for the




JULY MEETING, 1981


31


Medical Campus. He indicated the changes incorporated into
the revised document which he had distributed at the beginning
of the meeting. Mr. Brinkerhoff also reviewed the bids which
were received for the structure and explained that changing the
maximum cost of the replacement hospital from $210 million
to $285 million did provide for selected site development funding
which had originally been included in the project.
There were questions by the Regents concerning pledging
tuition revenues for future construction, and the loop roads to
be constructed for access to the new hospital. It was pointed
out that pledging student fees for the bond anticipation notes
enabled the University to obtain a better interest rate from
the lending institution. Student fees will not actually be used to
repay such loans.
Regent Dunn then moved to award the contract to the low  Contract
bidder, Darin and Armstrong, Inc., of Southfield, Michigan, for Aared focur
the construction of the parking structure for the Medical Campus, and to approve the project budget of $5,707,861. Regent
Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Nederlander moved to authorize and approve the Fee Bond
issuance of the Regents of The University of Michigan parking  approved
structure fee bonds in the principal amount of $7,000,000 subject to a change to reflect market conditions; authorize the VicePresident and Chief Financial Officer to proceed to arrange a
public, competitively-bid sale of the bonds and take such other
action as he may determine necessary for the successful sale of
the bonds, including: (1) changing the manner of sale to a
negotiated sale if he determines that market conditions might
preclude a successful public sale; (2) preparing and circulating
an Official Statement; (3) preparing and publishing a Notice
of Sale; and (4) participating in rating meetings. Regent Waters
seconded the motion.
Regent Baker indicated that, in his view, the replacement
hospital was a state-wide responsibility and eventual payment
for the cost of the hospital ought not lie with student tuition.
He said he was fully cognizant of the fact this was a remote
possibility. Nonetheless, it is implicit and specific in the agreement that if payments should be in default, tuition fees must
be applied. Regent Baker objected to the use of student fees for
this purpose and would vote against the motion.
President Shapiro then called for the vote. The motion was
adopted with Regent Baker voting no. The Resolution appears
as Appendix A to these minutes.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff stated that the proposed renova- Renovations
tions for the School of Education building would provide general
office space to be utilized by the Bureau of School Services. This




32


JULY MEETING, 1981


would enable the University to vacate the Argus I Building
which could then be reassigned, sold, or demolished, thus providing a substantial utility savings. If for some reason the Bureau
of School Services did not need this space, the University could
house other units currently in rental space.
Regent Dunn moved to approve the renovations in the
School of Education as described. Regent Roach seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
Towing Tank  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the necessary renovaRenovations tions to be made to the towing tank for Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering. He also explained the conflict of interest
problem in connection with a part-time research engineer in the
College of Engineering who is also a chief consultant in the
local company the University wishes to retain for this purpose.
The Regents' approval is required for appointment under the
Conflict of Interest Statute.
Regent Brown moved to approve the project as recommended and to authorize the appointment of Integrated Engineering Services Corporation of Ann Arbor as the engineer of
the project. Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was
adopted unanimously.
Central  Regent Nederlander moved approval to complete the Central
Envirolmn  Environmental Control project by adding twenty buildings to the
system. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Parkview/Turner  Regent Nederlander moved approval to award a construction
Facility contract to the low bidder, Henry deKoning Construction Company of Ann Arbor, Michigan, for the renovation of the Parkview/Turner facility for the Department of Ophthalmology.
Regent Baker seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Replacement  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed in detail the proposed
Hospital Project
Access Road west loop road on the Medical Campus. He indicated that by
proceeding with this project at the present time, savings and
benefits would be gained from disposing of excess soil from the
Replacement Hospital Project and by providing a temporary
bypass for Glen Avenue. Regent Brown then moved to approve
proceeding with the project as outlined. Regent Dunn seconded
the motion and it was adopted.
North Ingalls  Vice-President Brinkerhoff commented that at an earlier date
Building
Renovations the Regents had approved only the basic building improvements
of the recommended renovations to the 300 North Ingalls
Building. Approval was now being sought to proceed with the
balance of the project. Renovations would be undertaken on the
6th, 7th, and 8th floors to accommodate wet laboratory space
for the Center for Human Growth and Development and the
Dental Research Institute with shared animal and support facilities, and the Institute of Gerontology at a cost of $2,900,000.




JULY MEETING, 1981

Regent Baker remarked that a motion had just been passed
to raise tuition and now the Regents were being asked to approve
a very substantial expenditure. He asked why this project could
not be deferred.
Vice-President Frye responded this would provide badly
needed space for the aforementioned units. Deferring this action
would affect the viability of the Institute for Human Growth and
Development. Dr. Frye said that this is the result of an accumulative problem of not providing adequate space over the years,
and the project would be phased over a three-year period.
Regent Power then moved to approve proceeding with the
balance of the project at a total budget figure of $2,900,000, as
recommended. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Regent Baker moved to approve awarding a construction
contract to the low bidder, Allied Fence and Supply Co.,
Ypsilanti, Michigan, for the "fencing" portion of bid package #3
and to approve awarding a construction contract to the low
bidder, R. E. Davis Construction Company, Ann Arbor, Michigan, for the "general conditions" portion of bid package #3
of the site preparation work for the Replacement Hospital
Project. Regent Nederlander seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve awarding a construction contract to the low bidder, Utley James Incorporated,
Pontiac, Michigan, for the Phase III renovations for Interim
Facilities at University Hospital's 300 North Ingalls Building.
Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Roach moved to accept the offer of $13,300 from
Bruce D. Hukkila for a quit claim deed to an 89 acre parcel of
land in Ely Township, Marquette County, from the Estate of
Helen F. Weber, subject to a reservation of the mineral rights.
Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The Regents received the Auditor General's report for The

certified or registered mail postage prepaid, addressed to the last known
address of such bondholder as it appears upon the bond register or list maintained by the Paying Agent for such purpose, not later than 30 days prior
to the date fixed for redemption; but failure to give any such notice by
mailing, or any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of any proceeding
for the redemption of any Bond with respect to which such failure has
occurred. Notice need not be published if all Bonds to be redeemed are
registered as to principal and 30 days notice is mailed to each registered
holder. Bonds so called for redemption shall not bear interest after the date

States of America, the principal of and interest on which when due, will be
sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds as the same
become due by maturity. Notice of such provision for payment shall be
promptly thereafter sent to the registered holder of each Bond registered as
to principal and to each holder of a bearer Bond who has requested such
notice in writing, by certified or registered mail postage prepaid, addressed
to the last known address of such bondholders as it appears upon the bond
register or list maintained by the Paying Agent for such purpose. Upon the
happening of the above conditions, the Bonds shall cease to be entitled to
any source of payment, security or benefit under the Resolution other than
the right to receive payment from the aforesaid cash or direct obligations
placed with the Paying Agent.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount of
or interest on this Bond or any claim based thereon against the State of
Michigan, the University or any member of the University, or any officer
or agent thereof, as individuals, either directly or indirectly; nor shall these
obligations become a lien on or secured by any property, real, personal, or
mixed, of the State of Michigan or the University, other than the Student
Fees, as defined in the Resolution, which are pledged to meet or provide for
the payment of said obligations; and the liability of the University, as a body
corporate, shall be limited to said Student Fees, all other liability, except as
expressed in the Resolution, being by the acceptance hereof and as a part
of the consideration for the issuance hereof expressly waived.

SECTION 502. Student Fees as Source of Payment of Bonds. To the
extent that on the fifth day preceding any Interest Payment Date the moneys
then on deposit in the Bond Fund are not sufficient to meet the interest or

the University shall, commencing March 26, 1982, and on each subsequent
fifth day preceding each Interest Payment Date while the Bonds remaining




JULY MEETING, 1981                           47
outstanding, pay into the Bond Fund an amount of Student Fees sufficient to
pay the interest or principal and interest payment coming due on such
Interest Payment Date.
SECTION 503. Funds Legally Available Therefor as Source of Payment
for the Bonds. The University reserves the right to use any Funds Legally
Available Therefor for the purpose of paying principal or interest on the
Bonds.
ARTICLE VI
Flow and Use of Funds
SECTION 601. Application of Bond Proceeds. Immediately upon the
receipt thereof, the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds shall be apportioned
among and deposited in the Project Fund, the Bond Fund, and the Reserve
Fund in the following manner:
1. Any accrued interest and premium received on sale of the Bonds
shall be deposited in the Bond Fund;
2. A sum equal to the average annual principal and interest payable
on the Bonds shall be deposited in the Reserve Fund; and
3. The balance of the proceeds of the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Project Fund.
SSECTION 602. Use of and Disbursements from Project Fund. Moneys in
the Project Fund shall be used pursuant to the following priorities:
1. Payment of accounting, financial consulting, legal, printing, and other
expenses of the University's in connection with the preparation, issuance, sale and delivery of the Bonds;
2. Payments necessary to finance the construction costs of the Parking
Structure Project; and
3. Moneys in the Project Fund may be transferred to the Bond Fund to
pay interest accruing through completion of construction, or $590,000,
whichever amount is less.
Any amount remaining in the Project Fund after completion of the construction of the Project and payment of the costs thereof, shall be promptly
transferred to the Bond Fund. The University covenants that it will deposit
in the Project Fund from Funds Legally Available Therefor amounts that
may be necessary to pay expenses incidental thereto and to the issuance of
the Bonds to the extent that the proceeds of the Bonds are not sufficient
therefor. The depository for the Project Fund shall make disbursements from
the Project Fund upon the order of the University, and shall have no duty
or liability with respect to the manner or method in which moneys are
withdrawn by the University from the Project Fund or in fact are used
or applied by the University.
SECTION 603. Use of and Disbursements from Bond Fund. The Paying
Agent shall use moneys in the Bond Fund to pay principal and interest on
the Bonds as the same become due and the Bonds or coupons evidencing
the same are presented and surrendered. The Paying Agent may use moneys
in the Bond Fund for the acquisition of Bonds in the open market at the
written direction of the University. Any amount remaining in the Bond
Fund after the Bonds have been paid or provision made therefor under the
Resolution shall be returned to the University.
SECTION 604. Use of and Disbursements from Reserve Fund. If at any
time there are not sufficient funds in the Bond Fund for the payment of the
principal of or interest on the Bonds as the same become due, the Paying
Agent shall withdraw from the Reserve Fund and deposit in the Bond Fund
sufficient moneys which when added to the moneys in the Bond Fund will
be sufficient to meet the payment of principal of and interest then due on




48


JULY MEETING, 1981


the Bonds. The University covenants and agrees that if at any time moneys
are withdrawn from the Reserve Fund for such purposes, there shall be
promptly deposited from time to time in the Reserve Fund from the first
Student Fees received thereafter which are not required to make principal or
interest payments on Parity Obligations, a sum sufficient to replace the
amount so withdrawn. To the extent that Student Fees shall not be sufficient
for such replacement and for the replacement of withdrawals from reserves
for other Parity Obligations of the University, the amount deposited in the
Reserve Fund in accordance herewith shall be in proportion to the total
requirements for replacement of withdrawals from reserves for other Parity
Obligations and shall be measured by the principal amount of Parity
Obligations at the time outstanding.
At the written direction of the University the moneys in the Reserve
Fund shall be finally transferred to the Bond Fund by the Paying Agent
and applied in payment of the Bonds and interest thereon at such time as
the balance in the Reserve Fund, together with any amount in the Bond
Fund, shall be sufficient for payment in full of the principal of all Bonds,
including interest thereon through maturity, and payment of all fees and
expenses owing to the Paying Agent. Any balance remaining thereafter
in the Reserve Fund shall be returned to the University by the Paying
Agent.
SECTION 605. Investments. Moneys held for the credit of the Bond Fund
and the Reserve Fund not required for immediate use or disbursement shall,
as nearly as may be practicable, be continuously invested and reinvested by
the Paying Agent in accordance with the written direction of the University
in the following investments:
1. Direct obligations of the United States of America or the State of
Michigan or in obligations, the principal and interest of which are
unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America or the
State of Michigan; or
2. Interest bearing savings account or accounts or certificates of deposit
of any bank whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Moneys in the Project Fund shall be invested at the direction of the
Regents in any investments legally available for University funds.
The above investments shall mature not later than the respective dates
estimated when the moneys in said Funds shall be needed for the purposes
provided in the Resolution. All investments may be sold at the prevailing
market price. All investments shall be deemed a part of the Fund with whose
moneys they were acquired, and all profits and losses shall be charged to
such Fund; provided, however, that all Investment Income as received shall
be deposited in the Bond Fund.
SECTION 606. Arbitrage. The University shall not invest, reinvest, or
accumulate any moneys deemed to be proceeds of the Bonds pursuant to
~103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and the applicable regulations thereunder, in such a manner as to cause the Bonds to be
"arbitrage Bonds" within the meaning of said ~103(c) and the applicable
regulations thereunder.
ARTICLE VII
Additional Parity Obligations and Defeasance
SECTION 701. Additional Parity Obligations. The University reserves the
right to issue additional Parity Obligations for any authorized purpose

Obligations and the proposed additional Parity Obligations during any
future Fiscal Year of the Bonds are scheduled to be outstanding; and
(b) the proposed additional Parity Obligations shall be payable
as to principal only on April 1 of the year or years of maturity and

principal of and interest on the Bonds or provision for such payment with
cash or direct obligations of the United States of America the principal of
and interest on which when due will be sufficient to pay the principal and
interest on the Bonds as the same become due through maturity and notice
to the Bondholders as hereinbefore specified, the Student Fees shall be released from the lien of the Resolution, the University shall be released from
the terms of the Resolution, and except for payment thereof only from said
cash or direct obligations of the United States of America, the Bonds shall
not be deemed to be outstanding.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1981
The Regents met at 11:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach, Vamer, and Waters. Chancellors
Jenkins and Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye,
Overberger, Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson, and VicePresident and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent
Baker was absent.
Professor Ronald Teigen, Chairman of the Committee on the  CESF Report
Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) indicated that he wished
to restate the Committee's position with respect to the 1981-82
salary program, as presented in April. The Committee strongly
feels that the percentage of increase for the salary program
should correspond to the rate of inflation. Professor Teigen mentioned that the rate of inflation had decreased to 9.7% since last
April, therefore, that was the Committee's recommendation at
this time. The 6% salary program proposed by the administration would produce another significant reduction in the faculty's
real income. Professor Teigen said that the faculty is well aware
of the University's financial problems, but other Universities in
Michigan have announced larger salary programs even though
they are in the same situation. Teacher salaries in the public
school system in Ann Arbor are catching up and in some cases
passing the University's faculty salaries. The University must
place salary determination in the highest priority each year to,
at the very least, prevent continuing erosion of real income
from inflation.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the year-end financial Financial Report
report and displayed some slides showing budget to actual figures
of all funds for the three campuses. He explained charts showing
a ten-year comparison of current funds, general funds, expendable restricted funds, designated funds and auxiliary funds.
The Regents then recessed for lunch.
The meeting reconvened at 1:15 P.M. Regent Baker joined
the meeting.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981


Audit Report,  President Shapiro asked if there were any questions regarding
the financial information presented earlier and reminded the
Board that there was a request for the approval of the Price
Waterhouse Audit report for 1980-81.
Regent Baker then moved to approve the audit report for
fiscal 1980-81. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Budget, 1981-82  Vice-President Frye, in speaking of the proposed operating
budget for 1981-82, indicated that, although the Legislature
approved an appropriation increase of approximately 12.1% in
March for the Ann Arbor campus, adoption of a budget was
delayed because of the possibility of an executive order recission.
Since there would be no advantage in further delay, a recommendation for approval is presented at this time despite continuing
difficulties and uncertainties.
Vice-President Frye listed those uncertainties as: the capacity
of the State to actually sustain the 12.1% appropriation; the
anticipation of an executive order recission of 4% to 5% on
the 1980-81 budget which would effect the 1981-82 budget
because of the fiscal year differential between the State and the
University; and the possibility of another executive order recission on the 1981-82 budget, perhaps as great as 5%. If this
second cut should occur, it would have the effect of reducing
the State appropriation this year to approximately 1% less than
was actually received last year.
Vice-President Frye reviewed the principle elements of the
budget including the $10.4 million base budget reduction that
became effective on July 1 of this year, and the staff benefits
component that was added to this year's budget, making a total of
$11.6 million in internal reductions that are being rebudgeted
in the 1981-82 budget. Dr. Frye also highlighted the principle
expenditure elements in the proposed budget: approximately
$10.1 million for a 6% salary program and staff benefits of
$1.6 million for a total compensation increase of approximately
7%; $2.1 million (18%) increase for student aid; $2.8 million
for utilities; $3.6 million for academic program development; and
$1.7 million for nonsalary program improvement. The administration is aware of the inadequacy of the salary program with
respect to the rate of inflation, the cumulative slippage of academic and nonacademic salaries, in relation to other job families
in the State and the nation. However, a greater salary program
would cause greater difficulties for the faculty in terms of
accelerated rates of retrenchment and higher workloads. The
administration has and will continue to consider the salary
program a high priority item, and it is always uppermost in their
minds when preparing the budget.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981


55


Vice-President Frye indicated that the rising cost of utilities
is steadily consuming a greater proportion of the general fund.
Moreover if federal support for student aid should continue to
decline, the general fund budget would be unable to bear a
greater portion than it does now. Elaborating on academic program development, Dr. Frye explained that its components include the cost of new dean appointments, increments for underfunded costs, such as the Ann Arbor police force contract, the
tuition grant program and special allocations for enrollment
increases in some units, particularly business administration, and
a variety of other essential costs that are incurred by the schools
and colleges. This latter item has been vigorously reviewed and
significantly reduced during the last few months, and now comprises only about 1 /2 % of the general fund budget.
In continuing, Vice-President Frye said that since the budget
is so inadequate in comparison with our needs, it might be appropriate to state what the budget does not do. It does not provide
for an adequate salary program which will adversely affect external market pressures in fields like business, engineering, computer sciences, and pharmacy; it does not provide adequately for
a number of high priority expenses that are seriously underbudgeted, such as research rental space, legal fees, and equipment purchases. The budget makes too little provision for
significant program development, e.g., badly needed growth in
engineering, business administration and other technology areas;
the vitality of the University is in jeopardy because the ability
to appoint young, new faculty is virtually at a standstill; and the
budget does not provide a special fund drawn upon indirect cost
to provide for research incentives and the augmentation of
research activity in the University.
Should the proposed budget be free of additional cutbacks,
further internal adjustment would not be necessary in the coming
year. However, contingency plans have been prepared and would
be immediately implemented if another executive order recission
should become a reality.
In conclusion, Vice-President Frye stated that there has been
an erosion of the University's fiscal resources for several years
as a result of the rising cost of utilities, health care, general
inflation, and a serious decline in the level of State support. In
the near future these problems will be further aggravated by the
decline in the State and national pool of qualified student applicants, increasingly reduced flexibility for internal reallocation,
and a further accumulation of delayed maintenance and other
costs that will become critical. With this in mind, a multiple year
plan of action will be necessary to develop a comprehensive view
of what the total underfunded costs are now and expected to be




56


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981


in the future and to reconcile those costs with the maximum level
of available resources. The University will continue to do everything within its power to help itself through these difficulties.
Also, it is imperative that the legislature and the citizens of the
State recognize that this institution is vital to the long-run
economic and intellectual well-being of the State, and it cannot
be preserved unless adequate State support is received.
Regent Baker commented that, even considering all these
difficulties, could the administration continue to maintain their
pledge not to increase tuition at mid-year except under extraordinary circumstances?
Vice-President Frye indicated that, as he stated previously,
short of a financial disaster, the University would adhere to that
pledge.
President Shapiro remarked that as Vice-President Frye indicated, the proposed budget already incorporated the 5%
executive order being considered in Lansing, and it anticipates a
possible second executive order of approximately the same magnitude. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the
State budget in the next year including the priority given to
higher education. He said he did not believe it would be appropriate to have a further adjustment in tuition, and he was quite
confident that it would not be necessary. However, it is important for the Board to know that the University is close to the
edge and cannot be pushed much farther. A tuition adjustment
would be the very last resort.
In response to a question that Regent Power had posed
earlier, Vice-President Frye indicated that the larger salary programs proposed by the University's sister institutions appear to
be based upon the assumption that the State appropriation approved in March would be sustained. It was the University's intention to try to minimize a possible very serious shortfall by
being more conservative in the budgeting process at the outset.
Financial Aid  Mr. Harvey Grotrian, Director, Financial Aid Office, was
riteria asked to respond to a question concerning the change in the
eligibility criteria for the Guaranteed Student Loan program. He
said the two positive changes were that the need factor was kept
simple and more liberal in the standard needs test for loans
applied for after October 1, and the parental loan program was
opened up to the parents of graduate students, independent
undergraduate students, and all graduate students. There was
some concern about the rate at which banks would participate
in that program, but it would be an important source of relief
for students. On the negative side, 5% of the loan proceeds are
taken as an origination fee, and for loans made after October 1,
the monthly payment would increase to $50. The students, how



SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981


57


ever, would not sustain the loss of a loan for education costs
either this year or next year, as had been anticipated.
Regent Roach moved to approve the 1981-82 General Fund
budget for the Ann Arbor campus. Regent Brown seconded the
motion.
With respect to the continuing erosion of the University's
resources, and even worse, the acceleration of it, Regent Power
delivered the following statement concerning an article in the
Detroit Free Press dated September 17, 1981:
Today's Detroit Free Press carried a story by David Kushma discussing Governor Milliken's recent executive order which would have
reduced state aid to higher education and community colleges by 4.5%
from current budget levels. In The University of Michigan's case, this
latest cut would have amounted to $6.2 million.
Coming as it does as yet another slash for higher education and
during the middle of a fiscal year, after hiring patterns and other operating
plans are set, this cut will have a horrible impact. The State of Michigan
has declined dramatically in state support for higher education when
compared with other states. In the ranking of 50 states' appropriations
to higher education (appropriations per $1,000 of personal income), the
State of Michigan has fallen from 19th in 1966-67 to 38th in 1980-81.
The Free Press also quotes Mr. Gerald Miller, the state budget
director, as insisting that "aid to educational institutions and local and
county governments were the only areas in which substantial cuts could
be made so late in the fiscal year."
The same Mr. Miller, together with the Governor himself, has said
time and time again that if Michigan is to diversify its economy and
develop a high technology growth sector, the talent and experience at
the University is the state's most priceless asset.
That Mr. Miller should now justify such a massive slash to an
already beleaguered University on the grounds that it's too late in the fiscal
year to cut anywhere else reveals either a practice of decision making by
expedient whimsy or a simple failure to recognize that while it may take
50 years or more to build a great University, you can easily kill it in five.
The proposed cuts are at the wrong time (i.e., now), in the wrong
place (i.e., higher education), and cannot help but be terribly damaging
to the State of Michigan's attempt to rebuild and diversify its economy.
President Shapiro thanked Regent Power for her statement
and then called for the vote on Regent Roach's motion to approve the 1981-82 general fund budget for the Ann Arbor
campus, and it was unanimously adopted.
Chancellor Nelson reviewed the budgetary situation and
strategy for the Flint campus. He indicated that the 1981-82
budget was prepared on the assumption of $1.2 million in new
revenues. Nearly half of this would be devoted to a salary program of 6%. The remaining funds would be allocated for debt
service to complete the Physical Education/Recreation building,
the substantial rise in utility costs, academic program development, student aid and certain other costs. Chancellor Nelson
said the budget would not provide adequately for equipment,
books, supplies, and maintenance. Academic program develop

ment, the major priority for the Flint campus, was inadequately
funded in this budget. Contingency plans have been developed
to assume further cuts, if that should be necessary.
Regent Dunn moved to approve the 1981-82 general fund
budget for UM-Flint, as recommended. Regent Nederlander
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Chancellor Jenkins commented that UM-Dearborn followed a similar pattern as the other campuses, but their resources
are considerably less. The base budget reduction, and the anticipated executive order recission reduces the available funds
considerably. At the present time, plans are underway to prepare
for a second cut in State funding. This creates a situation which
would be unique in the University's history-the Dearborn campus would be unable to recommend a salary program equal to
that of Ann Arbor and Flint. A 3% salary program, which is
totally inadequate, is all the budget will allow this year. By exercising prudent measures during the year by reducing the base
budget another $500,000, there may be additional funds in the
course of the year which could be made available to augment
the salary program.
President Shapiro remarked that a special situation existed
on the Dearborn campus which had been accumulating for quite
some time. He said that, in his judgment, the academic program
had expanded beyond the financial base provided by the State
and student fee income. The shortfall in State support and the
capital outlay for new facilities had compounded the problem
for the Dearborn campus. The State appears to be unwilling to
adequately provide for the quality programs that are needed at
UM-Dearborn.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve the 1981-82 general
fund budget for UM-Dearborn, as recommended. Regent
Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.

his A.B. degree in 1933 and his Ph.D. in 1938. In 1938 he went to Iowa
State University as Instructor in Zoology, and was promoted to Assistant
in 1943. The following year he returned to The University of Michigan
as Associate Curator of Fishes in the Museum of Zoology and became
Curator of Fishes in 1948. He was also Assistant Professor (1944-50),
Associate Professor (1950-59), and Professor (1959-  ) in the Department of Zoology of this University.
An internationally known ichthyologist, Dr. Bailey has published
widely on the systematics, hybridization, and zoogeography of North
American fresh water fishes. He is also an authority on the nomenclature
of fishes and for thirty years has been a member of the Committee of
Names of Fishes of the American Fisheries Society (serving as chairman
from 1951-71). He also served as President and Chairman of the Executive Committee of that society (1974-75), and is one of eleven ichthyologists to receive the prestigious American Fisheries Society Award of
Excellence. He also served as member of the Editorial board and president
of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (1959). He
served on the Council of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (1968-72), and has been active in several other learned
societies.
Field studies on fishes were conducted by Dr. Bailey in several parts
of the United States, as well as Michigan, and his papers are the basis
for much of our knowledge of the classification and distribution of the
most important groups of fishes in the Mississippi and Great Lakes
drainages. His studies in Iowa and South Dakota led to major works on
the fishes of thoses states. Amazonian, Bolivia, Paraguay, Guatemala, and
Lake Tanganyika have also been sites of his field work.
In his thirty six years as senior curator of the Division of Fishes,
Dr. Bailey maintained exemplary standards in the collection, identification,
and processing of new material, as well as encouraging and aiding many
significant studies based on the fish collection. The nearly three million
catalogued specimens in the collection are a renowned resource for scientific research and a major attraction for students and evolutionary
biologists. The leading position of the University of Michigan Museum
of Zoology in the graduate training of ichthyologists is to a considerable
extent the result of Dr. Bailey's work with graduate students, who hold
important positions in the field.
The Regents now salute this distinguished researcher, teacher, and
curator by naming him Professor Emeritus of Biological Sciences.
RICHARD B. BRANDT, Professor of Philosophy, retired from the     R. B. Brandt
active faculty on May 31, 1981, after seventeen years of effective service  Retirement
to the University.
Professor Brandt graduated from Denison University in 1930, with
majors in both philosophy and classical studies. He did graduate work
at Cambridge University and the University of Tubingen and received
his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1936. Professor Brandt taught at
Swarthmore College from 1937 to 1964. He joined The University of
Michigan faculty in 1964 as Chairman of the Department of Philosophy,
and served ably in this capacity for thirteen years. During his tenure the
Department grew from twelve to twenty faculty members.
Professor Brandt has had many professional honors: Guggenheim
Fellowship; Fellow at Center for Advanced Study of the Behavioral
Sciences; John Locke Lecturer at Oxford University; President of the
American Philosophical Association (Western Division); and president of
two interdisciplinary societies, one dealing with political and legal philosophy and the other with philosophy and psychology. Within The
University of Michigan, Professor Brandt has been awarded the Distinguished Achievement Award and has been the Roy Wood Sellars
Distinguished College Professor of Philosophy.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981


Professor Brandt's work in ethics is outstanding. His Hopi Ethics:
A Theoretical Analysis (1954) was a landmark in the use of anthropological data to examine fundamental philosophic issues. His Ethical Theory
(1959) has been reprinted several times; it is a systematic treatise which
includes his own position, on original form of rule-utilitarianism. His
crowning achievement, A Theory of the Good and the Right (1979),
argues that a rational person would choose a moral code based on rules of
action that maximize utility. He has supplemented these books with a
wide variety of articles which apply his ideas to practical issues.
In view of these many accomplishments and contributions to the
University, the Regents now salute this distinguished scholar and teacher
for his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Philosophy.

WHEREAS, the bid of Goldman, Sachs & Co. (& Associates) has been
determined to produce the lowest interest cost to the University;
Now, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:
1. The bid of Goldman, Sachs & Co. (& Associates) as above stated,
be and the same is hereby accepted.
2. All other bids are hereby rejected and the good faith checks of
the unsuccessful bidders are hereby ordered returned to each bidder's
representative or by registered mail.
3. The form of the notice of sale and the publication of the notice
of sale as aforesaid are hereby ratified and confirmed.
4. The preliminary Official Statement on file with the Secretary and
on which has been endorsed by the Secretary the date of adoption of this
resolution is hereby approved. The action of the Vice-President and Chief
Financial Officer and legal counsel in preparing and distributing the
preliminary Official Statement be and they are hereby ratified and confirmed, and all actions of the Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer,
other University staff, and legal counsel heretofore taken in connection
with the sale of the Bonds be and they are hereby ratified and confirmed.
The Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, upon request of the
successful bidder, is hereby authorized and directed for and on behalf
of the University to execute a final Official Statement in substantially the
form of the preliminary Official Statement hereby approved, together with
insertion of the Paying Agent, interest rate and price and such further
necessary or desirable changes, insertions or omissions that are not
materially adverse to the University. Said final Official Statement and the
information contained therein are hereby authorized to be used in connection with the sale of the Bonds to the public.
5. The President, Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of the
University, Secretary and other officers and staff of the University and
each of them be and they hereby are authorized and directed to execute

Vice-President Brinkerhoff commented upon a meeting that       Replacement
had taken place in August with Carl Johnson, of Johnson,            ospital Proec
Johnson, and Roy, Dean Metcalf, of the School of Architecture,
and others to review in detail the various exterior materials
chosen by the architect, Albert Kahn, for the Replacement Hospital Project.
Dr. Douglas Sarbach showed a brief slide presentation of the
site for the new hospital and the surrounding buildings of the
medical campus. He pointed out the importance of consistency
of color in choosing the brick and precast cement for the replacement hospital. Samples of the range of colors suitable for that
area will be erected on the site, so that selection can be made in
the natural light and in the natural surroundings.
Regent Nederlander wanted to see a scale model of the
project, and since one did not exist, he suggested that the study




82


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981


model be brought to the next meeting of the Board. He indicated
that the decision on the coloration of the brick and precast would
be made by the Regents.
Regent Power remarked that before the next decision was
made, perhaps it would be helpful to see a revised sketch of the
entire project to include the addition of the ambulatory care unit
which had previously been deferred.
President Shapiro explained that the deferred items were not
in the same stage of design as the rest of the project. It was
important that the project proceed as scheduled; therefore, certain decisions would have to be made prior to the completion
of those plans.
After further discussion, it was determined that both the
samples of brick and precast cement and the study model of the
project would be on display for viewing by the Regents in
October.
Auditor   Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the Auditor General's
General'Rerrtn report for the Dearborn Campus and the University's responses
to it. He recommended approval so that the document can be
transmitted to the Auditor General.
The Regents raised questions concerning the library expenditures for magazine and paper subscriptions, the appropriateness
of charging the general fund for the Early Learning and Child
Development Center, and the record keeping of the auxiliary
activity funds for all three campuses.
Regent Roach moved to approve the Auditor General's
report and the University's responses for the Dearborn Campus.
Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Hospital  The Regents received a semi-annual report of University
Accounts Hospital accounts receivables.
Receivables
Regent Roach moved to accept the terms and conditions
of the Thurnau Charitable Trust, and to authorize designated
individuals to accept, on behalf of the Regents, any and all payments from the trustee. Regent Dunn seconded the motion and
it was adopted. The resolution of acceptance follows.
RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN ACCEPTING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE
THURNAU CHARITABLE TRUST AND AUTHORIZING DESIGNATED INDIVIDUALS TO ACCEPT PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF
THE REGENTS FROM THE TRUSTEE
WHEREAS, Arthur F. Thurnau of Wilmette, Illinois, died on September 27, 1979, leaving a last will which has been admitted to probate
in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Probate
Division, in cause No. 79 P 7401; and




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981


83


WHEREAS, by Section 3 of Article SIXTH of said will Arthur F.
Thurnau created the Thurnau Charitable Trust; and
WHEREAS, the said Thurnau Charitable Trust is, by the provision of
said will, to be held for the benefit of the Trustee to pay all of the net
income and so much of the principal of said trust as shall be necessary
from time to time to satisfy the provisions of Section 4943 of the Internal
Revenue Code, to the Regents of The University of Michigan to be used
by the Regents in such proportions as they shall determine for the four
purposes set out in Section 3 (a) of said Article SIXTH of the will of
Arthur F. Thurnau;
Now, THEREFORE, be it resolved that the Regents of The University
of Michigan hereby accept the terms and conditions of the Thurnau
Charitable Trust, as set forth in the will of Arthur F. Thurnau, Deceased;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that J. F. Brinkerhoff, Vice-President and
Chief Financial Officer, C. W. Matthews, Controller, and R. K. Daane,
General Counsel, or their successors, be and each of them hereby is
authorized to accept on behalf of the Regents of The University of Michigan any and all payments from the Trustee of said Trust to the Regents
of The University of Michigan and to execute and deliver receipts therefore, hereby ratifying, confirming and approving any such receipts heretofore given to the Trustee by any of said persons.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve the following additions of common stock to the University's Master List: Digital
Equipment Corporation, Geosource, Inc., Lowe's Companies,
The Washington Post Company, McDonald's Corporation, Hospital Corporation of America, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.,
and Dover Corporation. Regent Power seconded the motion and
it was adopted.
Regent Roach moved to authorize awarding a contract to the
low bidder, Michigan Electric, Inc., of Ravenna, Michigan, for
electrical power augmentation-North Switching Station-at the
University Hospital. Regent Varner seconded the motion and it
was adopted.
Regent Dunn moved approval to proceed with the renovations of the Medical Science I building for wet laboratories, as
recommended. Regent Nederlander seconded the motion and it
was adopted.
Regent Power moved to approve the commitment of funds
to the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration Hospital to provide
wet research laboratories for faculty in the Department of
Surgery. Regent Varner seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Regent Dunn moved authorization to purchase 1.316 acres
of land from Consolidated Rail Corporation for the price of
$20,000. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the bids received for
the demolition/earthwork/utilities for the Replacement Hospital
Project. He said many discussions were held to determine the

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981


manner in which the bids were let-should the three components
be considered together, or should they be considered separately?
It was felt that treating the components as one would preclude
smaller bidders from participating. Meetings were arranged for
minority and small business enterprises to become familiar with
the University's bidding process and to encourage them to enter
the bidding. As-a result of these meetings two contractors did
submit bids.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff stated that his recommendation
for the awarding of contracts would differ from the agenda item
in that he would award the contracts to the low bidder in each
case. The agenda item recommends a single contractor for the
three components of Bid Package #4, even though that contractor is third lowest for the demolition work. There is a sound
management reason for having one contract, but, if separate bids
are requested, then the University is obligated to retain the low
bidder in each instance. He recommended awarding contracts to
Homrich Wrecking, Inc. for the demolition component.
After further discussion, Regent Nederlander moved approval to award construction contracts to Homrich Wrecking
Company, of Maybee, Michigan, for the demolition element of
Bid Package #4; and to B & V Construction Company, of Novi,
Michigan, for the earthwork and utilities element of Bid Package
#4. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Dunn commended Vice-President Brinkerhoff and
those involved in the process for the diversification of the bids.
X. OTHER
Budget, 1981-82  President Shapiro indicated that only the General Fund
budgets for the three campuses had been approved on Thursday,
and asked for a motion to approve the remaining portions of
the proposed budget.
Regent Dunn then moved to approve the 1981-82 operating
budgets for Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint. Regent Nederlander
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Easement   Regent Nederlander moved approval of the following resoluAuthority tion concerning delegation of easement authority. Regent Power
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
WHEREAS, in November 1963, the Regents delegated to then VicePresident Wilbur K. Pierpont authority to execute in the name of the
Regents of The University of Michigan necessary easements to utility
companies, and
WHEREAS, since the retirement of Vice-President Pierpont, such easements have continued to be executed by his successor, Vice-President and
Chief Financial Officer James F. Brinkerhoff,




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981


85


Now, THEREFORE, IT IS RESOLVED that James F. Brinkerhoff, VicePresident and Chief Financial Officer is authorized and directed to
execute in the name of the Regents of The University of Michigan easements to utility companies, including, but not limited to, Consumers Power
Company, Detroit Edison Company, Michigan Bell Telephone Company,
Michigan Consolidated Gas Company, which may be necessary to obtain
or maintain utility services to University property, and
THEREFORE, IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that any such easements heretofore executed by said James F. Brinkerhoff be and they are hereby
ratified and affirmed.
The Regents approved the following schedule for Regents' Regents' Meetings

Regent Brown moved to approve the change in the name of       Department
the Department of Anatomy to the Department of Anatomy and        Name Change
Cell Biology, effective July 1, 1981. Regent Roach seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
The Regents approved the following resolution honoring         T. HI. Cheng
Dr. Tso-Hsin Cheng, of the People's Republic of China.            Resolution
It is very special privilege for The University of Michigan to honor
Dr. Tso-Hsin Cheng, a native of the People's Republic of China, who
received his doctorate here in Zoology a half century ago.
He was trained in embryology under the late Professor Peter Okkelberg, but upon his return to China he was asked to devote his scientific
efforts to research in ornithology. Dr. Cheng thus became a self-taught
ornithologist, with a special interest in pheasants. He was truly a pioneer
in developing the systematic study of the birds of China, and today is
considered the leading ornithologist of the PRC. His administrative and
scientific accomplishments are channeled through a variety of top-level
appointments: At the renowned Chinese Academy of Sciences (Academia
Sinica) in Peking he is Distinguished Professor of Ornithology, head of
the Division of Vertebrate Taxonomy, and member of the Scientific
Council; in addition he is Deputy Director of the Peking Natural History
Museum and President of the Chinese Ornithological Society. Currently
he is also Vice-President of the Chinese Zoological Society and is active
in ornithological societies of Japan, Germany, Britain, and the United
States.




86


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1981


Dr. Cheng gained a national and international reputation through his
monumental 1200-page work, Distributional List of Chinese Birds, which
covers 2000 species and subspecies and is recognized as the definitive work
on the distribution of Chinese birds. This study, as well as more than 50
associate papers were the result of intensive field studies throughout China
by Dr. Cheng and his students.
As Editor of the comprehensive series of volumes entitled Fauna
Sinica, he is continuing his foundational work in zoology. He has personally already prepared a volume on the waterfowl of China and another
on its gallinaceous birds. At the age of 74, Dr. Cheng has exciting plans
for further work and is happy that there is no compulsory retirement for
scientists in his country.
Dr. Cheng has gained prestige for himself, for his country, and for
his alma mater. We are proud to present this citation in recognition of an
illustrious career.
Bylaw Revision   Regent Dunn moved to approve the revision of Section
11.151B of the Regents' Bylaws; approve the resolution requiring a two-year review; and approve the revision of the Bylaws of
the Executive Board of University Hospital, Article I, Section
3C, as follows. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Sec. 11.151B. The University Hospital Public Advisory Board. There
shall be a Public Advisory Board, composed of no more than fifteen public
members serving three-year terms, staggered so that five will be appointed
each year. A representative of the FRIENDS of University Hospital will
serve a one-year term and be appointed annually by the FRIENDS. Members
shall be appointed by the Board of Regents upon recommendation of the
President, and one member shall be named as chairman and one member
as vice-chairman by the Board of Regents on nomination of the President.
The Public Advisory Board will provide advice and assistance on
general Hospital operations, public relations, future planning, governmental relations, and fund-raising.
The Public Advisory Board will report to the Director of University
Hospital, to the Executive Board of University Hospital and, through the
President, to the Board of Regents. The Board shall submit its minutes
to members of the Hospital Executive Board and the Board of Regents.
The Director of University Hospital shall be responsible for providing

APPENDIX A
Conferred August 23, 1981
THEODORE M. HESBURGH
President, University of Notre Dame
The University of Michigan speaks for all of higher education today
by recognizing one of its finest leaders, Father Theodore Hesburgh. His
career illustrates the many-faceted role of a contemporary leader in
American education, a role which highlights the increasingly interrelated
areas of education, government, and public affairs. As the President of
Notre Dame, he has been involved in national studies of such issues as race
relations, campus unrest, a volunteer armed force, and the refugee policy
of the United States.
Two of Father Hesburgh's greatest interests have been in civil rights
and international development. He was appointed to the United States
Commission on Civil Rights in 1957, became chairman in 1969, and served
in that capacity until 1972. Notre Dame, with the help of the Ford Foundation, has established a Center for the Human Rights which promotes
the cause of human rights in this country and abroad. Likewise, President
Hesburgh has been active as chairman of the Overseas Development
Council, a private organization founded in 1969 to promote effective aid
to underdeveloped countries. His book The Humane Imperative published
in 1974 stresses the interdependence of the earth's peoples as the key to
human survival in a time of shrinking resources.
Two major developments that have occurred during his administration at Notre Dame have been the reorganization of the University's
governance under lay control in 1967 and the introduction of coeducation
at the undergraduate level in 1972.
Father Hesburgh's achievements and the strength of his leadership
have been recognized and cited throughout the nation. The University
of Michigan is pleased to stand in the company of his many grateful
admirers as it salutes this courageous educational statesman and confers
upon him the degree, Doctor of Laws.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1981
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1981


The Regents met at 1:00 P.M. at the Towsley Center to view
a selection of brick and precast cement panels that had been
assembled on the site of the Replacement Hospital Project.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown,
Dunn, Nederlander, Roach, and Varner. Vice-Presidents
Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger, Johnson, and Vice-President and
Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regents Power and Waters,
Chancellors Jenkins and Nelson, and Acting Vice-President
Jacobson were absent.
The Regents returned to the Fleming Administration Building
and reconvened at 1:30 P.M. and were joined by Regent Waters,
Chancellors Jenkins and Nelson, and Acting Vice-President
Jacobson.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff distributed and reviewed the
financial report for the year ending June 30, 1981. There was a
slide presentation showing the impact of inflation upon the
University, the changes in both graduate and undergraduate
enrollment since 1960, and revenues by source during the past
ten years. Vice-President Brinkerhoff explained that although
there has been an increase in revenues, inflation and certain
other characteristics have kept revenue activity nearly at a
constant level.
Vice-President Frye commented that an operating budget
request for 1982-83 had been prepared for approval by the
Regents and for submission to the Governor by November 1.
He listed faculty and staff compensation, staff benefits, adjustment for operating expenses at an anticipated rate of inflation of
8.1%, and an overall cost growth for utilities of about 22% as
the core of the budget. In addition, and considered of secondary
importance, there were the traditional program revision requests
and several important needs for new program development,
equipment purchases, expansion in the fields of engineering and
molecular genetics, and as in the case of the School of Public
Health, replacement of the federal fund losses that are anticipated.

Budget, 1982-83,

Vice-President Frye emphasized that these secondary concerns would not be considered until the fundamental core expenses had been satisfied.
The administration is fully aware of the continuing economic
problems of the State and realizes the difficulty the State will have
when considering this budget request. However, it is of utmost
importance for the University to make clear to the State officials
that the $35.3 million budget request would help prevent further erosion, but would not in any way rectify the backlog of
difficulties that have been generated in recent years. It does not
take into account accumulated deficit in equipment purchases,
maintenance, or erosion in faculty/staff salaries.
Regent Dunn asked that in view of the escalated costs of
health insurance, has the health maintenance organization plan
been deferred as an alternative to the current carrier of health
insurance?
Vice-President Brinkerhoff responded that an up-date would
be available within the next few months detailing a specific proposal by Blue Cross/Blue Shield.
Chancellor Jenkins reviewed the budget request for the Dearborn campus. He indicated that his request was patterned after
that of the Ann Arbor campus. The Dearborn compensation
program comprises about two-thirds of their request. Other
factors taken into consideration were those economic factors
brought about by inflation. Program revision requests and a small
amount to finance two new buildings, laboratory equipment replacement, and book acquisitions are also included. The shortfall of the last several years could not be accommodated in this
budget.
Chancellor Nelson stated that the compensation recommendation for the Flint campus followed the percentage proposal for
the Ann Arbor campus. He indicated that their salary program
needed to be upgraded to be competitive with the current market
in certain areas. A high priority item for the campus is to provide
a full-year funding for the operation of the new Physical Education/Recreation Building which will open shortly. Other program revision requests in need of funds are the computer science
program, program expansion planning at the master's level, and
additional nursing faculty. Plans for beginning construction for a
new science facility on the downtown campus have been indefinitely postponed.
President Shapiro indicated that this was just the initial step
in the budget cycle, and there would be a number of meetings
over the next several months before a more accurate budget is
known.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1981


95


Regent Baker inquired whether the proposed budget anticipated an increase in tuition.
President Shapiro responded that the budget request did not
anticipate any movement in tuition either way. The administration was trying to avoid substantial tuition increases in the future.
It is too early to say whether this would be possible.
I. MINUTES
The minutes of the meeting of September 17 and 18, 1981
were approved.
II. REPORTS
Vice-President Brinkerhoff placed on file his monthly reports
on investment transactions, plant extension, litigation, personnellabor relations and the Replacement Hospital Project. He also
submitted a report on non-competitive purchases over $1,000
from single sources.
Vice-President Overberger filed a monthly report on grants
and contracts.
In reference to this report, President Shapiro commented
that during the next year or so resources for higher education
from the State and Federal level would be curtailed to some degree which would add to the burden placed upon the University's
resources. At the Federal level student financial aid and research
would be the issues most affected.
Acting Vice-President Jacobson filed his monthly report on
the Office of University Relations and Development.
With respect to the Replacement Hospital Project report,
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the status of the bid packages noting that the University is progressing very well in terms
of the design elements and the development of construction
documents. He discussed the general conditions items which had
been removed from the individual bid packs because these items
would be handled as separate contracts or as change orders to
an existing contract. Funds have been set aside to provide for onsite testing, including those for architectural specifications. The
University has worked closely with the City of Ann Arbor and
the State of Michigan regarding plumbing and electrical inspections for code compliance reports which would be sent to the
appropriate local and state agencies. The addition to the $210
million project-the $75 million-would be reported separately.
It may be prudent to handle the design development of the
ambulatory care facility under a general contract separate from
the construction manager.

IX. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Financial   The Regents received the financial report for the year ending
Report June 30, 1981.
Investments,  The Regents received a schedule of investments for the year
Schedule of ending June 30, 1981.
Construction  Vice-President Brinkerhoff commented that an original draft
Management,
RHP of a proposed construction management agreement had been
transmitted to the Regents early in June. Subsequently there were
a number of changes and corrections which were incorporated in
the agreement and sent to the Board again for review. The major
part of the discussions with Barton Malow/CMI concerned the
assignment of individuals, the specific definition of the work to
be performed by them, the responsibilities to be assumed by the
University as the owner and the retained architect as the major
professional service contractor on the project. The negotiations
were satisfactorily concluded with respect to the quality of the
personnel expected to perform various functions, and at a value
less than anticipated for this project.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that Regent Baker had
expressed concern that the contract dealt only with the $210
million project and not the $285 million total project, therefore
it was not complete. Vice-President Brinkerhoff said that issue
was open for future determination by the Board. He stated that
he believed the negotiations were effective and complete.
Indicating that the construction management agreement was
brought to the Regents for their information and comments,
President Shapiro said the document would be executed unless
there were some very substantial exception to it.
Regent Baker indicated that he objected to the agreement.
He thanked Mr. Brinkerhoff for his cooperation in making some
changes in the document, but he was critical of the process. He
said he wanted to establish the history of the contract and the
nature of his objections. There was an item in the agenda reporting non-competitive purchases over a certain amount, so apparently there is a University policy covering non-competitive
issuance of contracts. He then read the following statement.
Regent Baker,   Today the University broke ground for its new hospital. All of us
Statement re: take satisfaction in that event which has been in planning for so many
Construction
Management years.
Unfortunately, today the Regents are called to vote upon award of
the "key contract" in the hospital construction process known as the
construction management contract.
In my judgment, the award of the hospital's construction management contract to Barton-Malow/CM represents a significant compromise
of the University's policy of open, competitive bidding on a project which
in the long run may cost a total of $285,000,000 or more.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1981


109


This contract was negotiated by the University with Barton-Malow/
CM without competitive bids and may bring that joint venture $8,200,000
or more before the hospital is completed.
Please understand I make no judgment as to the professional competence of Barton-Malow/CM, and I have no knowledge that would
indicate their superintendence of the work for the University hospital
will not be done in a professional and competent manner. 
Nevertheless, the public record should carry the history of the award
of this contract as indicated below:
1. Because my lifetime work experience is in the construction industry, early in the hospital planning process I expressed concern that
a fully professional and competitive structure be established to insure the
planning and construction activity on this huge project would be open
to all on competitive basis, including architects, other professionals, contractors, joint ventures, construction workers, suppliers and others.
2. This concern was formally effected by the Regents in the April
1979 Regents Meeting. I quote from the official minutes, page 277:
"Regent Baker then moved to authorize the Hospital Executive
Board to search and retain the most qualified consultant available
to determine among all possible alternatives, the best contract
letting method with the specific condition that the consultant not be
a candidate as the contractor. Regent Roach seconded the motion
and it was adopted."
The intent of the motion was specific. Those who made the recommendation on hospital planning and construction strategy would not be permitted to be the contractor (or construction manager) of the project in
order to insure complete objectivity in the recommendation to the Board
of Regents and thus protect the interests of the people of Michigan.
3. A contract to determine the hospital's planning and contracting
strategy was awarded to Barton-Malow/CM by the administration in the
Spring of 1980 and reported to the Regents at the May Regents meeting
of 1980 as referred on page 642 where Regent Dunn said
"Regent Dunn expressed concern about the construction consultant
appointment. He said that in an area as important as the hospital
is to the University and the State, this item should have been presented to the Regents before a final decision was made."
4. A separate meeting was called at my request of Barton-Malow/CM
and University officials to discuss, among other matters, the importance
of developing a competitive contracting strategy. I noted at that time
to the participants that Barton-Malow/CM was not to be a candidate as
manager and a contractor under the terms of the April 1979 Regents
motion.
5. On June 17, 1980 the Board of Regents charged the construction
consultant, Barton-Malow/CM to develop and recommend a specific
contracting strategy for the Universiy replacement hospital program. That
document was delivered to the Regents in May 1981 by Barton-Malow/
CM.
6. It is obvious that Barton-Malow/CM, in undertaking its charge
from the Regents, became familiar with all planning, with the University
individuals involved and frequently appeared before the Regents to report
progress.
7. Over that entire period of planning on several other occasions
during Regents meetings I emphasized the importance of providing full
access and free competition so that all parties interested in the replacement might have equal access on a competitive basis as contractor or as
construction manager.
8. My concern for freedom and competition in this award process
was overridden by a vote of the Board of Regents earlier in 1981 when
the Regents authorized the administration to enter into negotiations with




110


OCTOBER MEETING, 1981


Barton-Malow/CM for award of the construction management contract
as a single source bidder.
9. It is my opinion that some contractors and joint venturers who
believed in the basic fairness expressed in the April 1979 Regents resolution were thus excluded from the opportunity to bid on the contract
management of the hospital.
In summary, the successful contractor, Barton-Malow/CM, knew
at the time of its acceptance of the planning strategy contract that it was
ineligible for the construction management contract; Barton-Malow/CM
and the Regents were reminded on several occasions of Barton-Malow/
CM's ineligibility for the final contract, yet Barton-Malow/CM prepared
the final criteria for contract strategy and construction method (and indirectly the award of the construction management contract) and now is
to be awarded a $8,200,000 contract without competitive bids. It is
perhaps the most frustrating experience of my tenure on this board to
foresee this event several years ago, then attempt to prevent that event
from occurring by the procedure outlined in April 1979 Regents resolution, and finally have the circumstances described come together in such
a manner as to compromise this important process.
Regent Roach remarked that Regent Baker had mentioned
these concerns before. The apparent confusion over the use of
the terms "construction manager" and "contractor" as if they
were interchangeable, is neither appropriate nor is it fair. Barton
Malow/CMI will provide professional services as advisers, they
will not actually build any part of the project as a contractor.
Regent Roach said that he has had considerable experience with
the legal aspects of construction contracts and he was not aware
of any professional service contract that was bid competitively.
He indicated that the motion mentioned in Regent Baker's statement, which he had seconded, clearly distinguished between construction manager and construction contractor. He felt that there
was a distinct difference in the terminology. As for the $8.2
million contract, one should remember that this is a "not to
exceed" figure. The contract covers direct salary and payroll
expenses plus an overhead multiple. The amount of the multiple
is one of the most competitive in the industry today. He felt that
the contract was entirely appropriate and it would be a great setback for the University if the project did not proceed in its
current path.
Regent Baker commented that the intent of his original
motion was to separate the person who developed the contracting
strategy and planning from the person who actually did the work.
In his view, somehow this process changed from one function
to both functions. The probability of a company entering into
competition because they felt they would be disqualified in the
contract management case was very real. Regent Baker indicated
that somewhere along the line, the persons who originally took
responsibility were able by their competence, ability, or because
they were familiar with the project to become the party of the
final project.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1981


111


In clarification of the selection process, Vice President
Brinkerhoff stated that a nationwide search for a construction
consultant had been conducted and many of the well-known
construction management organizations throughout the United
States had applied. The screening process was judiciously and
carefully conducted ending with the choice of Barton Malow/
CMI. Vice-President Brinkerhoff said that he did not understand
that the construction consultant could not be the construction
manager because in his view, the manager had an entirely different function than that of a contractor.
Regent Roach then said that in view of the dispute, perhaps
it would be advisable to approve the contract by a motion in
order to resolve the issue. He then moved to approve awarding
the Construction Management Contract for the Replacement
Hospital Project to Barton Malow/CMI. Regent Brown
seconded the motion and it was adopted with Regent Baker
voting no and Regent Dunn abstaining from the vote.
The proposed revisions to the bylaws, rules, and regulations
of the medical staff of the University of Michigan which were
deferred in September were now addressed by Dr. David
Dickinson, Chief of Clinical Affairs at University Hospital. Dr.
Dickinson commented that the revisions were all in the nature
of housekeeping amendments designed to bring the bylaws into
conformity with current practice except for the article which
deals with the selection and term of office of the Chief of Clinical
Affairs.
In response to the question Regent Roach raised at the
September meeting, Dr. Dickinson said the medical staff feels
very strongly that their chief ought to be a respected clinician
with strong affinities to the staff in order to serve as advocate for
the staff in administrative circles and other groups. The longer
the incumbent stays in office the greater the possibility that those
relationships will erode. The chief of clinical affairs expects to
reenter academic life, but even one term disrupts academic development and productivity. Therefore, the longer a person is in
office, the more difficult it is to return to his/her basic discipline.
Consequently, the bylaw was changed to stipulate a three-year
term. This would also be an aid in recruiting the very best people
to assume the responsibility because they would be assured that
they would be able to do their job and return to their academic
field at the conclusion of the term.
Dr. Dickinson then reviewed the criteria to become a member
of the courtesy staff.
Discussion followed concerning courtesy staff members'
ability to admit patients. Dr. Dickinson responded that it was


Bylaws, Rules &
Regulations

Medical Staff




112


OCTOBER MEETING, 1981


limited to a certain extent, but there was no intent to restrict
admitting privileges on the part of the courtesy staff when there
were beds available.
Regent Roach then moved to approve the proposed amendments to the Bylaws, Rules and Regulations of the Medical Staff
of the University of Michigan. Regent Brown seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
Renovations  Regent Nederlander moved to approve the revised budget
and to authorize awarding a contract to the low bidder, Walter
L. Couse and Company, of Detroit, for the Otorhinolaryngology
renovations on the Sixth Level of the Outpatient Building.
Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Transfer of  Regent Nederlander moved authorization to transfer two small
Property parcels of University-owned land to the City of Ann Arbor to
provide right-of-way in connection with the widening of Glen
Avenue. Regent Dunn seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Capital Outlay  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the capital outlay reRequest, 1982-83 quests for 1982-83. He indicated that no new projects had been
added to last year's list, but some projects were deleted, particularly those on the medical campus for which funds had been
requested, which were no longer considered appropriate or timely
because of the Replacement Hospital Project. He corrected an
error in the total request for the Flint campus, changing the
figure to $7,460,000.
Chancellor Nelson indicated that because of the indefinite
delay in the construction of a classroom/laboratory building,
priorities had been shifted to repairing the roof of the Mott
Memorial Building which had reached the critical stage.
Responding to Regent Roach's question concerning priority
items, President Shapiro stated that both the Engineering I and
Chemistry Buildings were top priority items.
Regent Roach cautioned about committing funds to renovating the West Engineering Building until it had been determined
that the old building was worth saving.
Regent Brown moved to approve the Capital Outlay requests
for 1982-83 for Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint. Regent Dunn
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Radiation  Vice-President Frye commented upon the recommendation
Departmetpoi to establish a Department of Radiation Therapy within the
Medical School which would separate this field from the Department of Radiology. A modest administrative cost would be expected initially and later would be supported by patient care
revenue.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1981


113


Regent Baker said that there should be a financial analysis
undertaken before adding any new program and asked if this
had been done.
President Shapiro responded that the program currently
exists, therefore, it is not a new program. The reorganization of
this program would be an attempt to generate a flourishing,
worthwhile activity from one that is important, but not distinguished at the present time.
Regent Roach moved to approve the establishment of a
Department of Radiation Therapy within the Medical School.
Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The Public Comments session was omitted because there had  Public Comments
RHP, Groundbeen no requests to appear before the Regents. The Regents then  breaking
departed from the Fleming Administration Building to attend
the groundbreaking ceremonies for the replacement hospital.
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1981
The Regents reconvened at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellors Jenkins
and Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger,
Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson, and Vice-President
and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent Power was
absent.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that Mr. John Roszak, Audit Report
of Price Waterhouse and Company, would review the external
audit report.
Mr. Roszak commented that in addition to the audit services
provided to the University of Michigan through the middle of
fiscal year 1981, they also provided some assistance to the hospital in connection with financial projections for the replacement
hospital. To meet the recent audit requirements of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Price Waterhouse also was auditing the television station at Flint and the radio station at Ann
Arbor. He then referred to the Price Waterhouse management
report and responses and said he would be happy to respond to
any questions the Regents might have.
There was a question concerning the billing practices of the
Medical Service Plan and a query concerning the recommendation of establishing a regental audit committee. Mr. Roszak said
that Price Waterhouse had simply recommended consideration
of an audit committee. Since there had not been further comment, he assumed the Regents felt there was no need for this.

Regents Baker and Nederlander indicated that historically
the Regents met as a committee of the whole on all issues and
did not consider it necessary to establish a separate committee.
Regent Roach agreed with this concept, but felt that certain
aspects of an audit report would be inappropriate to discuss
publicly. Such items as sensitive personnel matters, or audit
scheduling could be discussed on a committee level and still be
in compliance with the Open Meetings Act. He said that it is
only in that context that he thought further consideration should
be given to the matter.
Regent Baker indicated that the Open Meetings Act provided
a closed meeting clause for such issues as sensitive audits or
alleged wrong-doing, therefore, he felt a separate audit committee was not appropriate.
Vice-President Frye stated that he was pleased to recommend
the establishment of a Center for Robotics and Integrated Manufacturing (CRIM) in the College of Engineering.
Dean James Duderstadt, of the College of Engineering,
commented that the focus of the center would be robotics and
the integration of engineering, manufacturing and management
functions in industrial settings. An administrative structure was
in place and funds have been acquired to begin operation of the
center. Dean Duderstadt further described the recruitment of
faculty and the coordinating and integrating efforts of five departments and forty faculty members. He said the College of
Engineering has the will, the desire, and ability to establish a
world class research center.
After further discussion, Regent Dunn moved to approve the
establishment of a Center for Robotics and Integrated Manufacturing (CRIM). Regent Nederlander seconded the motion
and it was adopted.
Vice-President Frye commented briefly on the status of the
review of the Physical Therapy Program. He said there had been
a public hearing in September, all private discussion requested
essentially had been completed, and numerous letters on the
subject had been reviewed. There were two dominate factors to
be resolved; the unquestioned and unmet need for physical therapists in the State and in the nation which would be aggravated
by closing the department, and the question of priorities and
intellectual environment within the Medical School that led to
the recommendation to discontinue the program. The administration is trying to solve the problem of continuing to produce
physical therapists, but at the same time, respond to the situation
at the Medical School. The options seem to be threefold; acceptance of the recommendation to close the department, reject the




OCTOBER MEETING, 1981


115


recommendation and continue as at the present time with whatever budgetary implications there are; or look at possible options
of relocation in an environment in which the program can
flourish at a reasonable cost and above all, to continue to train
physical therapists. The third proposal is being thoroughly explored and hopefully, a report would be presented to the Regents
in November with final action in December.
Regent Baker then commented upon the brick and precast
cement panels that were seen on Thursday. He said the Regents
had not been polled, but he did not believe that any of the three
choices met with regental approval.
President Shapiro commented that the architect's recommendation was to produce as closely as possible the brick used for
the Taubman Medical Library which was different still from the
panels erected on the site. If there were strong objections to this,
he would like to hear of them at this point because selection of
the brick had to be made immediately.
Regent Roach suggested that most decisions as to color of
brick, interior colors, and so forth would be made by the administration. If the Regents were interested in a particular aspect in
the selection process, perhaps a list could be devised so that
construction would not be delayed.
Regent Roach then moved that the salary of the President of
The University of Michigan be increased by 5.5% to $84,347.
Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was unanimously
adopted.
Regent Roach remarked that he wished the President's salary
could be increased more, and that he was 100% confident that
the Regents made the correct choice in selecting Harold Shapiro
as President of the University.
The above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of September totaled $626.97.
The meeting was adjourned to meet on November 19 and 20,
1981.

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1981
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1981
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Dunn, Nederlander,
Power, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellors Jenkins and
Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger,
Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson and Vice-President
and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regents Baker and
Brown were absent.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order.
The Michigan Student Assembly annual report was presented to the Regents by Jonathan Feiger, President, Steve
Hochberg, Treasurer, and Amy Hartman, Vice President.
Mr. Hochberg indicated that during the fiscal year 1980-81
MSA, by implementing a more efficient operating procedure, was
able to eliminate many inefficiencies which substantially reduced
personnel costs. This resulted in a year-end surplus balance.
The organization plans to maintain approximately a 4% security
margin for operating expenses and reallocating all remaining
surplus funds to next year's budget.
Regent Power commended the officers of MSA for their fiscal
responsibility and queried Mr. Hochberg with respect to the
allocation process.
Mr. Hochberg explained how the budget priorities committee reviews applications requesting resources and allocates funds
according to priority and MSA's monthly budget.
Ms. Hartman spoke briefly on the major areas currently being
reviewed. These include student services and student advocacy in
areas such as student legal services, health service, minority
student services, international student services, the security
issue, and student financial aid.
Mr. Feiger then distributed copies of the course evaluation
project which MSA had funded. He indicated that cooperation
by the faculty and support staff had helped to improve the
project. MSA presently was working to make it more reliable
and to bring more colleges into the project.
Vice-President Frye reported briefly on the status of the
review of the recommendation to close the physical therapy pro

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1981


gram. The recommendation followed an internal review by the
Medical School which was in the process of studying ways to
retrench as a means of achieving better support of the core
units of the school. The recommendation was judged by the
Department of Physical Medicine to be a relatively low priority
item in the overall mission of the Medical School. The cost associated with continuing the program and the significant increments required to improve the quality of the program and
eventually to achieve accreditation would increase the burden
on the school.
Keeping in mind the Medical School's priorities and its need
to economize and the undisputed need for physical therapists in
the State of Michigan and the nation, the administration has
been considering principally two possibilities: relocating the
program from the Medical School to the Department of Physical
Education or closing the program on the Ann Arbor campus and
transferring it to the Flint campus. The administration is reviewing each of these proposals carefully with emphasis on such
factors as economics, the need for physical therapists in the
state, sustaining a high quality program if the program should be
retained, and the impact upon the unit which might receive the
program.
Two other options open for consideration are the rejection
of the recommendation to close the program and continuing it
in its present environment or accepting the recommendation and
closing the program.
At the present time, no decision has been reached as to what
course the University will take. Assessment of the options will
continue, and it is hoped that a recommendation will be presented to the Regents in December for discussion and with a
possible recommendation for action, otherwise action will be
deferred.
In response to a question, President Shapiro indicated that
there would be ample opportunity for those wishing to address
the issue to do so.
Referring to the Replacement Hospital Project, Regent
Power commented that the University has embarked upon the
largest health delivery project in which this University will most
likely be involved. Physical therapy and physical medicine are
integral parts of a total medical delivery service and Regent
Power hoped that the physical therapy issue would be considered in that context. She suggested that it might be appropriate
for the Regents themselves to suggest aspects important for a
gradual refocusing of the role and mission of the Medical School.
President Shapiro responded that the administration was
aware of this, but indicated he did not feel this was the proper




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1981


119


occasion for a formal re-examination of the role and mission
of the Medical School.
Speaking of the mail the Regents have received on the
subject, Regent Roach commented that many correspondents
suggested increasing enrollment which, in their view, would
solve the fiscal problems. In reality, however, tuition covers less
than 50% of the costs of the program, therefore, increasing student numbers would only add to the problem. Regent Roach
said that as he understood the problem, if the length of the
program could not be extended perhaps to the master's degree
level, then the program could not adequately perform its mission in its present environment. He asked what would be the
dollar amount required to upgrade the program.
Vice-President Frye responded that to bring the program up
to the minimum quality level and perhaps for accreditation requirements in the future, the resources needed would range from
$75,000 to $150,000. Realistically it would probably require
$150,000.
Regents Dunn and Power were concerned about adequate
responses to public inquiry. Regent Dunn expressed the view
that, with issues as serious as this, there should be communication beyond the initial inquiry to indicate developments as they
occur. Regent Power suggested the administration undertake to
develop adequate means for responding to the increase in the
volume of public inquiry as the process of reshaping the University is continued.
President Shapiro stated that it was normal practice at the
University to respond to all inquiries including those forwarded
by the Board. He indicated that it would be appropriate to
apprise the public of developments as they occur on all large
issues and the University would do so.
Mr. James Lesch, Director of the Division of Research  Research
Development and Administration, presented the research ex-  Report"
penditure report for fiscal 1981. He indicated that the report was
a positive one, but current activities at the federal budget level
make it very difficult to draw logical conclusions as to what
this will mean in terms of research support in general and in
particular at The University of Michigan. This report only covers
sponsored research support. There are also significant numbers
of faculty involved in scholarly activity, including research, who
do not have access to these funds and are supported by their
regular academic salaries and their own initiative. Mr. Lesch
indicated that in all probability there would be reductions in
applied medical science, particularly in training grant support
and in social science support. The University is monitoring
activities at the National Institutes of Health and the National




120


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1981


Science Foundation, the University's two largest sponsors, and
there is uncertainty about NASA support. Another concern has
to do with the University's High Energy Physics Program. The
University has a very large investment in this program by the
Department of Energy and it is a significant one in terms of its
research impact and importance in the Physics Department.
Mr. Lesch then presented and reviewed charts of research
activity over the last ten years.
There were questions relating to the University's position in
the nation with respect to research support, including support
from industry, and how the University ranked in terms of total
available dollars.
Mr. Lesch responded that for expenditures in science and
engineering, The University of Michigan ranked fourth and in
the social sciences the University was first in the nation. A report
will be presented to the Regents in the next few months showing
in more detail data on organized research which is any research
by a unit that is separately budgeted as opposed to departmental
research where a faculty member is fully supported by the
general funds for the academic year and devotes a certain
amount of time for research.
Budget Status,  Vice-President Frye spoke briefly on the status of the budget
1982-83 for 1982-83. The 1982-83 budget request which had been
approved by the Regents in October had been submitted to the
state. Dr. Frye listed the major elements of the budget as: a
compensation program that would make up at least a small bit
of the ground lost to inflation during the past two years; a
substantial rate increase anticipated for utilities; a nonsalary
program increase for operating costs; ongoing commitments that
have been made for various activities of the schools and colleges
plus one or two small items such as the cost of opening new
space. These factors add up to approximately $28 million as a
minimum cost for next year. This would not include provisions
to meet the normal special needs of the schools and colleges
nor would it provide support for the high priority needs that
have been identified, including enhancing the University's research environment and stronger support of graduate students.
Adding these objectives to the above figure would require
approximately a total of $33 million to meet the needs of the
University.
Looking at the situation realistically, and considering such
things as the impact on the University of the state's economic
problems, the likelihood of a significant decrease in enrollment
next year requiring substantial fee increases, and a considerable
reduction in federal financial aid for students, the fiscal prospects
are not encouraging. The gap between the minimum budget




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1981


121


needs and available resources could range from $2 million to
$10 million.
In order to reconcile the difference it would be necessary to
reduce expenditure expectations by not meeting the goal of a
decent salary program, and by increasing tuition rates. He emphasized that the administration continues to work toward
achieving special recognition on the part of the State of Michigan
for the University's problems in order to bring about an increase
in appropriations.
Vice-President Frye indicated that there is only one other
way to help solve the problem and that is by a further program
of internal reallocation or retrenchment, minimally in the range
of $5-6 million. Factors leading to this judgment are: (1) there
is a strong possibility of another executive order of as much as
4%, (2) the continuing uncertainty about the state's economy
which poses problems not only for 1982-83 but also for the
longer term, (3) the possible negative impact of federal fiscal
policies on state resources, University research support and financial aid, and (4) the increasing uncertainties about the level of
enrollment the University would be able to sustain as the financial environment changes and as the demographic picture in the
State of Michigan changes.
Steps have already been initiated to accommodate this
retrenchment which include the further review of administrative
units for major cuts such as those made last year, consideration
of reactivating the priority fund tax, and reviewing some of the
major budgetary units that have not previously been reviewed
including schools and colleges, institutes, etc., to determine the
possibility of major budget reductions or even to consider
closure.
The ensuing discussion involved the means by which funds
would be made available to meet budgetary requirements if the
large-scale reviews of the vice presidential level units have not
been completed to make the base changes by July 1, how the
priority fund tax functions, and the lack of differential treatment between units in the last reductions and reallocations.
Chancellor Jenkins, in reviewing the status of the Dearborn  Budget, UM —
budget, indicated that by the end of the 1981-82 academic year Dearborn
the budget for the Dearborn campus would be in balance. This
was accomplished by a $500,000 base budget reduction and by
other economies. A serious consideration is the uncertainty as
to whether a supplementary 3% could be located as an increment to the extremely inadequate salary program which of
necessity had to be adopted. This would depend on Dearborn's
role and support of the extension program changeover and unforeseen revenue losses. Preliminary projections of revenue




122


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1981


needs for 1982-83 include a 10% salary program and a 12 -15% tuition increase. Chancellor Jenkins indicated that a
smaller salary program would be very unfortunate and unsatisfactory at this time.
Regent Roach mentioned that according to the Dearborn
student newspaper and student government, the students seem
to appreciate the need for the tuition increase. Chancellor
Jenkins commented that the students and faculty have been kept
informed of the fiscal problems and realize the need for a sizeable tuition increase to maintain quality programs and quality
faculty.
Budget,   Chancellor Nelson commented that the prospects for the
Flint campus are similar to Ann Arbor and Dearborn. There is
one major new cost facing the campus besides those expected
for utilities and that is the opening of the new physical education building. With a reasonable state appropriation and a 12 -15% tuition increase, a satisfactory salary program and revenue
to cover the costs of the new building would be possible.
Chancellor Nelson indicated that the administration at Flint
is in the process of contemplating long-range plans for base
budget cuts should that be necessary.
President Shapiro indicated that, although the problems differ from campus to campus, all three campuses are undergoing
serious planning for base budget reductions to compensate for
the declining State support.
Vice-President Frye reviewed the process by which possible
sources of savings are identified and the appointment of special
committees to review this data which then leads to a final
determination.
In response to Regent Power's question concerning the
means by which problems are being adequately shared and
discussed with faculty and staff, President Shapiro commented
that this represents a major concern of the executive officers.
The administration is trying to encourage the schools and colleges to take a significant role in this process as realistic within
their own faculties. The administration continues to develop
ideas about written communictaions as well as other ways to
keep everyone informed. While the administration realizes it
must continue to develop new ways of communicating with
the University community, there is some frustration because it
appears that the written communications that are distributed
are not read. There are several representative committees with
whom the administration meets and shares information such as
SACUA, the Budget Priorities Committee and the Committee
on the Economic Status of the Faculty.

President Shapiro announced that a grant of $2 million had
just been received from Alfred Taubman to initiate a program in
American Institutions. It would be primarily an undergraduate
program dealing with course work in American economic and
social institutions. It is also anticipated that, associated with the
program, would be a fellowship program involving training for
government, industry, and labor representatives. These fellows
would come to the campus for a brief period as part of the
ongoing program. It is expected that the program would start
in the fall of 1982. More details will be brought to the Regents
at a later date.
Regent Power expressed the deep gratitude of the Board of
Regents for this gift and suggested that an appropriate letter be
sent by the President to Mr. Taubman on behalf of the Board
of Regents.

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of two faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted:
MARJORIE M. MURPHY, Professor of Nutrition in the School of   M. M. Murphy
Nursing, retired from active faculty status as of June 1, 1981 after a  Retirement
most productive career as a dietitian and teacher.
Professor Murphy completed her undergraduate studies at the
University of Minnesota in 1942. She completed her Dietetic Internship
at the University of Minnesota in 1943 and received her MPH from
The University of Michigan in 1950 and her certificate in Gerontology
from The University of Michigan in 1978.
From June, 1943 to January, 1945, Professor Murphy served as a
therapeutic and teaching dietitian at People's Hospital in Akron, Ohio
and St. Paul, Minnesota. From 1945 to 1947, she completed a tour of
duty as a United States Army Dietitian in the Pacific Theater. She was
employed by the Veteran's Administration Hospital in New York City
from April, 1947 to August, 1949 and worked for the Kentucky State
Department of Health from 1951 to 1956.
In 1956, Professor Murphy came to The University of Michigan as
an Instructor of Nutrition. She was promoted to Assistant Professor in
1960, Associate Professor in 1962 and Professor in 1968. During her
tenure at The University of Michigan, Professor Murphy provided leadership in developing the nutrition content of our curriculum and assisted
faculty in the application of nutrition knowledge as an important component of total health care. Among her many community contributions,
the most noteworthy has been provision of the nutrition services to the
Turner Geriatric Clinic.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for her
dedicated service by naming her Professor Emeritus of Nursing.
HARVEY WILLIAM      SCHIELD, JR., Professor of Dentistry, has  H. W. Schield
retired from active faculty status as of July 31, 1981, after 29 years of Retirement
service as an outstanding teacher and administrator at the University of
Michigan School of Dentistry.
Born in Detroit in 1925, Dr. Schield served in World War II with the
44th infantry regimental combat team which landed at Normandy on
D-Day. Among the many service awards he received was the Bronze Star
for gallantry in action.
In 1949 he earned the B.A. degree from Albion College and in 1952
the D.D.S. degree from the University of Michigan School of Dentistry.
He received the M.S. degree in operative dentistry at the U-M in 1956.
Dr. Schield began his outstanding teaching career at the School of
Dentistry in 1952 as clinical instructor and by 1969 had been named
professor and co-chairperson of the preclinical area of the dentistry program. He served as head of the area from 1977 until his retirement.
From 1954 until 1969, he maintained a private dental practice in Ann
Arbor in addition to teaching.
In his position as head of the preclinical area, he carried the major
responsibility for introducing the basic technics of restorative dentistry




134


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1981


to freshman and sophomore students. They paid tribute to his personal
influence and outstanding teaching abilities by choosing him Instructor of
the Year on four different occasions.
During his career, he was active in various professional dental
organizations, including the Michigan Dental Association, the Washtenaw
District Dental Society, and Omicron Kappa Upsilon, dental honor

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1981


Replacement
Hospital Project


FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1981
The Regents met at 8:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellor
Jenkins and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger,
Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson, and Vice-President
and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent Brown and
Chancellor Nelson were absent.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order.
The Regents completed discussing the detailed operating
budget for 1981-82.
Dr. Douglas Sarbach commented upon a study which had
been undertaken for the interior design development of the
Replacement Hospital. Miss Janet Risenstein, an environmental
behavior research specialist candidate in the fields of architecture
and social science, has interviewed 670 patients and visitors concerning their preferences for utilization of space with respect to
the hospital rooms, corridors, lounges, etc. Response to the
study has been extremely favorable and it is felt that it has
had a great influence on the interior design. Dr. Sarbach then
presented slides indicating the results of the study.
Regent Baker commented that the study was both innovative
and interesting. He asked if there would be room in the new
hospital to provide alternate care similar to a hotel for patients
who do not need a great deal of medical attention. The response
was negative, but it was acknowledged that there was a need
for that kind of facility. Regent Baker then suggested that it
might be worthwhile to look into this, not only for future needs,
but it also might be a way to lower the cost of health care.
The Regents received the financial report supplemental
schedules for the year ending June 30, 1981.


Financial Report


University Audits  Mr. A. B. Hicks reviewed the six-month report on University Audits. The Regents asked questions concerning certain
hospital items, scheduling of audits of various departments, and
the recording of charges at the Hospital.
Manageng      The Regents received a status report on the Energy ManProgram  agement Program for 1980-81.
IHealth Insurance  Regent Dunn moved to authorize the increase in University
support for Blue Cross-Blue Shield/Major Medical health insurance as recommended. Regent Nederlander seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
HMO      Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the report on the Health
Maintenance Organization and the item concerning the risks

involved with implementation of an HMO. He commented that
the federal government no longer provided funds on a loan basis
to support the development of such an organization.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that he was aware of
only one successful HMO organization in a University setting
and that operation had merged the elements of primary care
medicine of each disciplinary area into one unit. These elements
at The University of Michigan, however, are all integral parts of
the individual disciplinary areas. After long deliberations of the
fiscal risks involved, the medical staff and the hospital staff
indicated that it would be inappropriate for them to become
involved at the present time. The University will continue to
work toward an alternative health care mechanism in the community, but one that would probably not be totally University
based.
In response to questions, Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that Blue Cross-Blue Shield has been successful in establishing HMO's in a few cities throughout Michigan.
The Regents received a schedule which lists outstanding
and anticipated University financing.
The Regents received a report on the financing requirements for the Replacement Hospital Project.
Regent Dunn moved to approve the replacement of the
steam line for the School of Public Health II building, and the
fire protection project for the C. S. Mott Children's Hospital.
Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Baker moved that authority be granted to execute
an easement for the Ann Arbor Township sewer. Regent Roach
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Power moved to authorize the land transfer of the
four parcels of land to the city of Ann Arbor for right-of-way
and approve a construction easement in these areas. Regent
Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Roach moved approval for the University Hospital
to proceed with its application for a Certificate of Need for the
purchase of the Coulter Diff 350 Automated Cell Differential
Counter for the Department of Pathology. Regent Power seconded
the motion and its was adopted.
Regent Power moved approval for the University Hospital
to proceed with its application for a Certificate of Need for the
proposed renovation and expansion project of the Clinical Biochemistry Laboratories in the Department of Pathology. Regent
Dunn seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Chancellor Nelson reviewed the item concerning the Court
Street property at UM-Flint. He indicated that this property

had no significant use by the University at this time. He then
reviewed the results of the JJ&R study that determined an auxiliary parking lot, student housing, or outdoor recreational facilities as the best uses for this land. The administration at UMFlint felt that these uses are not relevant now or in the future
to the development and mission of the Flint campus. At a subsequent meeting, the Regents authorized the Chancellor to seek
other proposals for the disposition of the property. At the
present time, three proposals are under consideration and it
is likely that an action item would be presented to the Regents
in December.
Chancellor Nelson indicated that throughout the process of
developing these proposals, the administration has kept the
neighborhood associations and other constituencies in the community abreast of all actions.
In response to Regent Dunn's question with respect to the
advisability of selling the property when it might be needed in
the future for outdoor recreation, Chancellor Nelson said that
this possibility had been considered. However, it is not the intention of UM-Flint to move into anything but intramural
athletics which could be adequately served by the excellent
park system in Flint. The neighborhood association has protested the development of recreational facilities on that property,
and the use of such an expensive resource for recreational purposes when other facilities are available nearby would not seem
justified.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the deliberations leading to the recommendation of an architect for the Ambulatory
Care Center. After discussion, Regent Baker moved authorization to appoint TMP Associates, Inc./Hansen Lind Meyer, Inc.
as the architect for the Ambulatory Care facility. Regent
Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Roach then moved that the Regents recess to the
President's Conference Room to hold an executive session to
discuss the following items: (1) advice of counsel with respect
to the recent MERC decision and the status of teaching assistants,
(2) property acquisitions, and (3) internal audit items concerning matters of personal privacy. Such discussions in executive
session are consistent with the provisions of the Open Meetings
Act. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The Regents then proceeded to the President's Conference
Room.
At the completion of the recess, President Shapiro reconvened the meeting. He announced that after a thorough discussion with the Regents of the MERC decision concerning teaching
assistants and upon listening to members of the Graduate Em

ployees Organization and others around the University community, it has been decided that in the long-term best interest
of the University, the MERC decision would not be appealed.
The Regents supported that decision although not unanimously.
The President expressed the view that the University now looks
forward to continuing its long and productive relationship with
its graduate employees.
Regent Dunn moved to approve changing the name of the Center for
Wildland Management Studies to the Center for Strategic Wild- Wildland Manland Management Studies in the School of Natural Resources. agement Studies
Regent Baker seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Nederlander moved approval of the Bylaw revisions Bylaw Revisions

DECEMBER MEETING, 1981
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1981
The Regents met at 2:30 P.M. at The University of Michigan-Flint.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach, and Varner. Chancellors Jenkins
and Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger,
Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson, and Vice-President
and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent Waters was
absent.
President Shapiro convened the meeting and asked VicePresident Frye to lead the discussion on the status of the
Physical Therapy program.
Vice-President Frye reviewed the process that was followed Physical Therapy
by the Medical School that resulted in their recommendation to Program
discontinue the Physical Therapy program. The recommendation was concurred in by the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts. That recommendation was based on the conclusion that
there would not be sufficient additional resources to restore the
program to a position of strength and quality.
Dr. Frye then described a subsequent central review of the
program. That review resulted in a set of alternative courses of
action: (1) discontinue the program as recommended, (2) continue the program with additional resources, (3) continue the
program at another institution in the State, (4) relocate the
program in the Department of Physical Education, or (5) relocate the program at the Flint campus. Complete discontinuance
was eliminated because of the severe shortage of physical therapists in the State of Michigan and the nation. Incremental support was simply not possible given the relatively low priority of
the program in the Medical School. Relocation at another
institution was rejected because of the two strong internal proposals for relocation.
The proposal for relocation in the Department of Physical
Education would have required again a substantial commitment
for additional resources.
The proposal for relocation at Flint would ( 1 ) provide for a
continuing supply of physical therapists, (2) provide for a
strong academic program, fully accredited, including the incremental requirements defined by the review committee, (3)
145




146


DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


provide a sound financial base for the program at Flint while
allowing the intended financial savings on the Ann Arbor
campus, and (4) receive the support of the current director and
faculty of the program. It was emphasized that the Flint proposal was still under consideration by the Flint faculty and that
their support would be essential before any final recommendation could be made to the Regents.
Chancellor Nelson indicated his personal support for the
relocation to the Flint campus and expressed his confidence that
the Flint faculty would be similarly supportive. He felt that the
Flint faculty would likely stipulate four conditions in its acceptance of the proposal: (1) that the budget for the program be
clearly and adequately defined, (2) that there be no budgetary
drain on existing programs, (3) that the new program be fully
reviewed at appropriate intervals, and (4) that the program be
satisfactorily incorporated in the Flint governance system. The
Chancellor also commented upon the widespread community
support which this proposal has received.
Vice-President Frye noted that five of the principal figures
in the original review of the program would speak to the Regents
on Friday. He further noted that no action is being sought now.
If the Flint faculty should act favorably, a formal recommendation would be brought in January.
Chancellor Nelson felt that the Flint faculty would act in
time for a recommendation in January to be brought to the
Regents.
Regent Varner asked for clarification of the budgetary responsibility between Flint and Ann Arbor during the transition
period. While complete financial details have yet to be worked
out, it is possible that Flint might manage its current budget base
so that they would be supporting instructional costs in Ann
Arbor as the Ann Arbor students are phased out of the program.
Regent Dunn wondered about the possibilities for housing
students both in the transition period and in the future. Chancellor Nelson noted that physical therapy students, being juniors
and seniors, would traditionally provide for their own housing.
In addition, however, a local hospital has pledged dormitory
space for such students if that were needed and the Flint campus
itself was establishing a housing bureau to assist all students with
housing problems. There are no plans for Flint to initiate a dormitory program of its own.
In response to a question from Regent Brown, Chancellor
Nelson explained the budgetary aspects of the Flint proposal
noting that after an initial bridging the current Ann Arbor base
of $100,000 would become entirely free for reallocation. Indirect
costs might total a figure twice that amount.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


147


There are four faculty currently involved in the physical
therapy curriculum itself.
Regent Baker inquired about the provision for the clinical
training aspects of the program. Clinical training would be provided by Flint area hospitals.
Regent Power queried the apparent contradiction suggested
by the fact that on the one hand the University does not regard
physical rehabilitation as a growth area while, on the other hand
national data suggest otherwise. She also noted the specific
actions being taken by Southeast Michigan hospitals to increase
their physical rehabilitation facilities. These factors seemed to be
at variance with the Medical School's assessments of its own
priorities.
Vice-President Frye responded that he did not mean to imply
that physical rehabilitation was not a growth area. He was simply
suggesting that as an academic training program, physical education, kinesiology, etc., would not surface as high priority areas
for the commitment of additional resources.
Chancellor Nelson concluded by saying that should the Flint
proposal be accepted, it might be necessary to create a special
unit in which to locate physical therapy and similar types of
programs.
Regent Dunn then introduced the following resolution cele- Anniversary
Resolution for
brating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the UM-Flint
Flint campus.
The Board of Regents of The University of Michigan herewith acknowledge and extend their best wishes to The University of Michigan-Flint on the occasion of its twenty-fifth anniversary.
Throughout its history, the Flint campus has provided to
residents of the area the level of educational quality associated
with The University of Michigan, and has made extensive contributions to the cultural growth and enrichment of the community. From its inception in 1956 as a two-year campus to its
present status as a branch campus offering both undergraduate
and graduate programs, The University of Michigan-Flint
has maintained standards of service and excellence in The
University of Michigan tradition.
The Regents extend their congratulations for the significant
contribution which the campus has made to the students and
residents of the Flint community, and to the University as a
whole.
The resolution was seconded by Regent Power and adopted
unanimously.

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of four faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted.




156            DECEMBER MEETING, 1981
E. W. Ardis    EVART W. ARDIS, former Director of Career Planning and
Retirement Placement (CP&P), will retire on January 31, 1982, and by special action
of the Regents is now accorded emeritus status in recognition of his long
and distinguished career with The University of Michigan.
A native of McBain, Michigan, Dr. Ardis received his baccalaureate
degree from Western Michigan University, his master's degree from
Northwestern University and has had honorary doctorates conferred on
him by Eastern Michigan University and Cleary College.
He joined the U-M staff in 1959 as Director of the Bureau of Appointments and Occupational Information, as the CP&P office was then
known.
Prior to his career at the U-M, Dr. Ardis was a school superintendent
for 25 years, serving in Michigan school systems at Freeport, Inkster,
East Detroit, and Ypsilanti. The Ypsilanti School District has named
an elementary school in his honor.
He has held numerous offices in local, state, and national professional organizations including the presidency of the Association of School
and University Staffing and the Michigan Association of School Administrators. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of Washtenaw Community College and is an active member of the Board of Trustees of
Cleary College.
During his twenty-one years as Director, CP&P grew from a small
career-entry employment agency to one of the nation's leading career
services for students and alumni. Under his leadership, CP&P enjoyed
many "firsts." U-M was the first major university to add career counseling
and planning to its placement activities. U-M's CP&P was the first in the
nation to provide the following career services: a special support program
for minority students, a program to address the special career needs of
women students and alumni, a program to assist graduate degree
recipients in careers outside academia, summer internships in government
and industry and the establishment of a preprofessional service which
has assisted hundreds of U-M students in gaining admission to the
country's leading professional schools.
The attractive career service facilities at 3200 Student Activities
Building were constructed under the guidance of Dr. Ardis in 1959-60
and expanded and renovated in 1975. These facilities have become a
model for career planning and placement offices throughout the country.
In recent years, Dr. Ardis has headed superintendent searches for
practically every school system in the state and several systems throughout
the nation. He is regarded by his administrative colleagues as one of the
true leaders in the field of placement. His insights and contributions,
based upon many years of administrative service have been an invaluable asset to the U-M and its graduates.
Dr. Ardis stepped down as Director of CP&P at the end of the
1979-80 academic year. He has remained on the staff as a consultant to
school systems and has continued to be involved with the placement
of school administrators.
For his remarkable and dedicated service in this vital area of
University erdeavor, the Regents now name him Director Emeritus of
Career Planning and Placement.
C. N. Davisson    CHARLES NELSON       DAVISSON, Professor of Marketing, will
Retirement retire from active faculty status as of December 31, 1981, after a most
productive career as a teacher, researcher, and administrator.
A native of Indiana, Professor Davisson earned an A.B. degree at
Earlham College in 1938 before entering the Graduate School of Business
Administration of The University of Michigan. He was awarded the
M.B.A. in 1940 and joined the faculty of the University of Missouri
as an Instructor in Marketing. Returning to Michigan in 1942 to enter
the doctoral program, Davisson was appointed as a Lecturer and later




DECEMBER MEETING, 1981                        157
Instructor in Marketing. He earned the doctorate in 1945 and was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1946. He attained the rank of Associate
Professor in 1950 and Professor in 1954.
During his forty year career at Michigan, Professor Davisson has
contributed strength and vitality to the instruction and research in marketing with special emphasis on industrial marketing. In addition, in his
several terms as Chairman of the Marketing faculty, he managed departmental affairs with great skill. Through his leadership on numerous
School and University committees he has served Michigan well.
During the 1960's, Professor Davisson became interested in the
education of foreign businessmen and in 1960-61 was a member of the
faculty of the Institut pour l'Etude des Methodes de Direction de l'Enterprise (IMEDE), in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1968, he was Visiting Professor of Marketing at the Stichting Bedrijfskunde in Rotterdam, The
Netherlands.
Author or co-author of four books including The Marketing of Automotive Parts which became an industry classic and numerous articles,
Professor Davisson has been a constant source of inspiration to his
colleagues and his students.
The Regents now salute this distinguished marketing educator by
naming him Professor Emeritus of Marketing.
Professor A. NELSON DINGLE received his doctorate from the     A. N. Dingle
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1947. His career at Michigan  Retirement
began in the Civil Engineering Department in 1954; he was promoted to
Professor in 1963, and was one of the charter members of the Department of Meteorology and Oceanography which was formed that same
year.
During his texrure, he taught ten different courses, fifty-six classes,
and spent over 3000 hours in the classroom. His research support was in
excess of one million dollars and included such diverse areas as meteorological education, C02 exchange between the atmosphere and ocean,
pollen studies, raindrop size distribution, and acid rain. He has more
than fifty publications. In 1963 he was awarded the Darton Prize from
the Royal Meteorological Society. He has been chairman of nine doctoral
dissertation committees.
In recognition of this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service the Dean and Executive Committee and the Department
of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science request the Regents to name
A. Nelson Dingle Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric and Oceanic
Science.
RAYMOND      C. SCOTT, Associate    Professor of Engineering   R. C. Scott
Graphics, retires from The University of Michigan December 31, 1981  Retirement
after 35 years of teaching in the field of Engineering Graphics.
Professor Scott was born August 2, 1911 in McBain, Michigan.
He obtained the B.S. degree (Ind. Ed.) from Central Michigan in 1937
and the M.S. (Ind. Ed.) from Colorado State University in 1947.
From 1936-1942 Professor Scott taught high school Industrial Arts.
During WWII he taught at Willow Run for the U.S.A.F. and at Escola
Technica de Aviacav in Brazil. In 1946 he joined the College of Engineering at The University of Michigan teaching Engineering Graphics
and Production Illustration. He worked in Engineering research from
1946 to 1975 on several research projects. He was promoted Assistant
Professor in 1947 and to Associate Professor in 1967.
Professor Scott was sent to Mexico in 1953 by the University and
served as assistant technical advisor and teacher trainer at the Centro
De Adiestraments de Operadores.




158


DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


Professor Scott has worked diligently for the improvement of the
graphics program. He has taught courses for Industry and in the University Extension Course Program. From 1968 to 1980 he was course
leader for the Engineering Graphics program, and responsible for
assigning teaching loads.
He has been an active member of A.S.E.E. and M.I.E.S. and of
Iota Lambda Sigma (Ind. Educ. Honorary Fraternity) serving as Vice
President in 1970 and President in 1971.
During the summer months Professor Scott worked in industry in
graphic and engineering design at Ford, Bendix, Dunn Electric, KaiserFrazer Corp., Amco Engineering, Hines Industrial Associates, Balance
Technology, and Conductron Corp. This work kept Professor Scott abreast
of the changes in the graphic field so he could better instruct the engineering students.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and researcher
for his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Engineering Graphics.
It was noted that the granting of emeritus status for Evart
Ardis, Director of Career Planning and Placement, was exceptional but fully warranted by his long and distinguished service
to the University.

IX. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed his recommendation to
provide long term financing for the Michigan Union renovation,
the Flint Physical Education facility, the Alumni Association
Building, the Dow Building (Chemical Engineering), and the
Power Center addition. He noted that this financing would involve the pledging of student fees. Repayment of the bonds for
gift funded buildings would come from the maturing of gift
pledges. Mr. Brinkerhoff then invited action by the Regents on
the following recommendation: to adopt a bond authorizing
resolution which (a) authorizes and approves the issuance of the
Regents of The University of Michigan Construction Fee Bonds
in the principal amount of $11,200,000 subject to a change to
reflect market conditions and pledge receipts, (b) authorizes the
Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer to proceed to arrange
a public competitively-bid sale of the Bonds and take such other
action as he may determine necessary for the successful sale of
the Bonds, including: (1) changing the manner of sale to a
negotiated sale if he determines that market conditions might
preclude a successful public sale; (2) preparing and circulating
an Official Statement; (3) preparing and publishing a Notice of
Sale; and (4) participating in rating meetings.

Dow and Power
Center Addition

DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


Regent Nederlander noted that it was his understanding that
the funds for the Alumni Building were to come from gift
pledges. He asked when those pledges might be paid.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff explained that a major part of
the pledges was from a bequest which would very probably
mature within the term of the proposed bonds. The Alumni
Association has sufficient reserves to cover that bequest even if
it should not mature.
Regent Nederlander wondered why the Alumni Association
did not use its reserves rather than borrowing funds? President
Shapiro replied that the Alumni Association was earning more
on its invested reserves than it would be paying on the borrowed
funds. It was therefore an advantageous cash flow situation
which prompted this action.
Regent Nederlander expressed his continuing concern about
this action.
In response to a question from Regent Baker, Vice-President
Brinkerhoff said that a specifically authorized student fee would
be used to retire the bonds for the Michigan Union renovations.
President Shapiro suggested that it would be better procedurally for the Regents to act first on the items dealing with
the revised budget for the Alumni Center and the Michigan
Union contract award before acting on the financing authorization.
Regent Dunn then moved to approve the revised budget for
the Alumni Center Building. Regent Power seconded the motion
and it was adopted.
Regent Nederlander then moved the awarding of the contract to the low bidder, Schiller Construction Company of Detroit, for the Michigan Union renovations. It was seconded by
Regent Varner and adopted.
In connection with the Alumni Center Building, Regent
Baker asked for a review of the planned turnaround drop off
at the north end of the Michigan League.
Regent Dunn moved to approve the recommendation for the
financing of the construction projects as described previously. It
was seconded by Regent Nederlander and adopted. The resolution authorizing the construction fee bonds appears as Appendix
A to these minutes.
Replacement  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed his recommendation for
Hospital Project a budget increase for Bid Package #4 of the Replacement HosRe Bid Package
#4 pital Project. He noted that this increase of $600,000 was required because the quality of the fill dirt from the excavation
was so poor that it had to be trucked from the site and new fill




DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


161


dirt had to be brought in. He stated that University personnel
checked the loads of removed fill and new fill at the site.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff also noted that there would be
some programmatic shifts between the original $210 million
project and the $75 million additional project because of advantageous siting arrangements. These changes will be incorporated shortly in the budget projections for the project.
Regent Roach then moved to approve the recommended
budget increase for Bid Package #4. The motion was seconded
by Regent Nederlander and adopted.
The Regents then heard comments from the following individuals on the topics indicated: Fred Paffhausen, an alumnus,
concerning construction of the new Burn Center; Charles
Tomnasulo, UM-Flint student, on student privileges for all
three campuses; Edith Gurley, a Lapeer Street neighbor, Delores
Carlisle, a resident of Rickard Manor, Lloyd Custer, Vice
President of the General Neighborhood Renewal Program, and
Claude Miller, President of the Lapeer Street area Block Club,
speaking on the disposition of the Court Street property in
Flint; and John Broad, representing Acorn-Broad-Peters, on the
structural steel contract for the Replacement Hospital Project.

Dean John Gronvall spoke initially on the process used by
the Medical School in arriving at their recommendation for discontinuance. He acknowledged the fact that this conclusion was
reached even though all the data suggest that the need for
physical therapists is not disputed by the Medical School.
Regent Power commented again on this apparent contradiction, that is, lack of priority for the program in the Medical
School and yet an undisputed need for these professionals in
the State.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


Dean Gronvall noted that it was a question of priorities and
that the Medical School simply lacked the resources to continue everything it is doing. He did comment that the Medical
School will continue its residency programs in Physical Medicine
and Rehabilitation.
Dean Peter Steiner then commented on the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts conclusions which supported the
recommendation for discontinuance. He did note that should
the program be relocated to Flint, the students thus relocated
will be replaced with students in other programs.
Regent Baker expressed his concern about reaching conclusions about discontinuing programs and then being influenced by external constituencies to avoid such program closures.
He cautioned that such pressures must be examined in light of
the University's overall objectives to achieve appropriate reductions in its offerings.
Regent Roach asked how students were presently admitted
to the program in Physical Therapy.
Dean Steiner noted that 100 students are admitted as freshmen to the pre-physical therapy program. At the junior year 30
of these and 6 transfer students are admitted to the Physical
Therapy program. If transferred to Flint, Ann Arbor students
could still transfer into the program although final details have
not been worked out.
No loss of State funds is anticipated in this transfer and Flint
would require considerable external support from Flint hospital
and foundation sources. The other factor which makes the transfer possible is the excess capacity at Flint that can absorb these
new students without incurring significant additional costs. Thus
the tuition revenue could be considered as additional resources.
A detailed description of the fiscal elements involved in the
transfer of the program will be provided as part of the formal
recommendation.
Professor Richard Damell, currently Director of the Physical
Therapy program, read a detailed statement which reflected the
position of the department on the program. This statement is on
file with the Secretary of the University. In short it describes the
reasons for discontinuing the program in its present form and
supports the relocation at Flint.
In response to questions, Professor Darnell described the
program as being a broadly based discipline operating in a
number of environments including sports and recreation and
not strictly a hospital based program.
Professor Morton Brown distributed to the Regents copies
of a prepared statement that reflected SACUA's comments on the




DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


163


Physical Therapy program. In compliance with Senate Assembly's resolution concerning the "smaller but better" redirection of
the University, Professor Brown indicated that SACUA had
observed closely the process by which the physical therapy program was reviewed. In general, faculty have been involved
throughout the process and SACUA believes that the discontinuance guidelines were followed. At the point, however, when the
Vice-President for Academic Affairs received the recommendations from various committees for his deliberation, SACUA
did not participate.
The Regents' Guidelines for the Discontinuance of Academic
Programs explicitly state that "full opportunity will be provided
during the review by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs for public and private consultation." Professor
Brown then recommended that SACUA be involved throughout
the discussions held by the executive officers and that they
participate consistently in deliberations involving discontinuance.
He said it is at this stage that unforeseen issues involving
faculty arise.
Questions of centrality to the mission of the University in
relationship between "basic knowledge" and "acquired skills"
arise during all discontinuance procedures and must be considered in all cases.
Although relocation, not discontinuance, of the physical
therapy program was recommended, the same regard for students and faculty, particularly tenured faculty, must be maintained.
Professor Brown concluded that it is extremely important
that the administration be sensitive to and the faculty be involved in the discussion of these issues.
The President then invited the Regents' consideration of the
recommended bylaw changes which would alter the name of
University Hospital to University Hospitals and the title of
Director of the Hospital to Executive Director.
Regent Baker noted that although these changes appear
routine, they are, in fact, very substantial as they represent the
culmination of a very significant administrative reorganization of
University Hospitals.
Regent Nederlander moved approval of the Bylaw revisions
relating to University Hospital. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted. The Bylaws, as revised, follows:

DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


Replacement
Hospital Project
Re Bid Package
#5


tor of the Institute of Gerontology. Regent Nederlander seconded
the motion and it was adopted.
The Regents next discussed the recommendation to award
construction contracts associated with Bid Pack #5, steel erection, for the Replacement Hospital Project. Vice-President
Brinkerhoff explained that the low bids had exceeded the budget
estimate by approximately $1 million. This was due largely to
specifications calling for a heavier guage steel in the patient
bed tower than was actually necessary. Reviews of those specifications by an outside consultant had been made to determine
more precisely the guage which the bed floor loading would require and negotiations are now going forward with the low bidder to reduce the cost of the steel based on these revised specifications.
Regent Baker expressed his considerable concern that the
designers and construction consultants for the building have
made such a large error in the steel specifications which now
puts the University in a very difficult position.
Regent Power shared the concern expressed by Regent Baker.
Regent Nederlander asked whether the redesign work had
cost any additional money. Vice President Brinkerhoff explained
that there was no actual redesign, only a change in specifications,
thus no additional funds were expended for design. Additional
expenditures would be required, however, for the special steel
erection consultants, who had reviewed the specifications.
Regent Nederlander asked if the new specifications would
significantly alter the bids on the steel. Vice-President Brinkerhoff said that all bids would be reduced by the same amount
because the only change involved would be a reduction in the
total tonnage of steel. He explained in a response to a question
from Regent Roach that this reduction would bring the bid closer
to the original budget estimate.
Regent Power asked whether a different building design
might have affected the bids. Vice-President Brinkerhoff responded that a different design would indeed affect the bids. The
change being discussed, however, was not a different design but
a change in specifications.
Regent Varner wondered what the specific dollar reduction
in the bid would be. It was explained that the specific reduction
would be known after negotiation with the low bidder.
Regent Roach observed that had the bids come in under
budget, the change in specifications might have never occurred.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that the planners had




DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


171


noted the problem of excess steel at the time the construction
documents were provided to the bidders.
Regent Baker said that it was known months ago that the bed
tower would be a lighter building than the diagnostic and treatment facility and the design should have reflected that fact then.
Regent Dunn commented that the Regents had received
several communications about the fact that the low bid for steel
erection came from an out-of-state firm. He had responded to
those inquiries by stating that even though the bid was from outof-state, most of the expenditures would be made through
in-state firms.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that such a response
would be correct except for the cost of the raw steel. That cost
of approximately $6.6 million would be associated with out-ofstate suppliers which would be true of all the bidders. The low
bidder had indicated that the erection (approximately $3 million),
decking (approximately $1-$1.5 million), and truss work (approximately $1.5 million) would be subcontracted to in-state
firms. On the fabrication (approximately $2.5-$3 million) would
be done by the out-of-state bidder.
In response to a further inquiry by Regent Dunn, Mr.
Brinkerhoff stated that all of the construction contracts let so
far on the project had been with Michigan firms. They total $4
million.
Regent Brown asked how much more would be expended in
Michigan if Bid Pack #5 was awarded to an in-state firm. The
response was $2.5 to $3 million.
Regent Baker wondered whether the whole bidding process
ought to be reopened.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff stated that the change in specifications would not be sufficient reason for rebidding the project.
Regent Roach stated that the Board should know that he had
represented two of the bidding firms but that it had occurred
more than five years ago.
He further offered the opinion that rebidding might indeed
trigger a legal challenge. He felt that abandoning the principle
of accepting low bids would be unfortunate and could be to our
disadvantage later on.
Regent Varner wondered whether the University would save
any money by accepting a bid for an in-state firm.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that there would not
be any savings by doing that.
Regent Power expressed her deep concern about apparent
design errors and the unfortunate position in which the Regents




172


DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


were now placed. She explained that the Regents were not assigning blame but wished to be sure that a correct decision had been
reached with respect to the review of the specifications.
A brief recess occurred at Regent Power's request.
After reconvening, Regent Dunn moved that contingent
upon successful negotiations with the low bidder, the following
recommendations to award contracts associated with Bid Pack
#5 be approved: A construction contract to Owen Steel, Columbia, South Carolina, for the structural steel component in an
amount not to exceed $15,090,000; a construction contract to
Kenton Structural and Ornamental Iron Work, Kenton, Ohio,
for the stairs component; and a construction contract to Harlan
Electric Co., Southfield, Michigan, for the temporary electrical
component.
Regent Varner seconded the motion.
Regent Dunn commented that the Regents must keep in mind
several interests in making decisions. There is a taxpayer interest which in this case means a saving of $500,000 by accepting
the low bid. There is a University interest that has been well
served by adherence to the low bid principle. Successor Regents
would be in a difficult position if that principle were now
abandoned.
Regent Brown expressed the contrary view stating that there
are more costs that will be incurred by the State with an out-state
bidder. He believes that awarding bids to Michigan firms is
appropriate in the special economic circumstances in which the
State now finds itself. Thus, he would vote against the motion.
Regent Baker clarified the fact that by accepting the low bid
only $2.5 million would go to out-of-state firms and he expressed
his hope that everyone would clearly understand this.
President Shapiro then expressed his conviction that adherence to the low bid principle would best serve the long-run
interests of the State, University, and health service consumer.
The motion was then adopted with Regent Brown voting
against.
Re Bid   Vice-President Brinkerhoff then explained the details assoPackage #6 ciated with Bid Pack #6 which involved contracts for foundation work. He noted that the foundations were being broadened
to accommodate certain program changes which will incorporate
certain elements of the additional $75 million project. These
changes will be incorporated into future budget projections. He
reviewed briefly the savings being accomplished through the
owner-controlled insurance program associated with the hospital
project.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1981


173


Regent Baker then moved approval to award the following
contracts associated with Bid Pack #6: a construction contract
to Walbridge, Aldinger Co., Livonia, Michigan, for the foundations component; a construction contract to Fel-Kran Plumbing
& Heating, Ann Arbor, Michigan, for the mechanical component;
and a construction contract to Dunn Electric Co., Ann Arbor,
Michigan, for the electrical component. The motion was seconded
by Regent Varner and adopted.
Regent Baker moved to approve the establishment of a col- vWehmeyer
legiate professorship to be known as the Lewis E. Wehmeyer and  Professorship
Elaine Prince Wehmeyer Professorship in Fungal Taxonomy.
Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Brown then moved approval of the amendments to Degrees,
amended,
the degree lists, confirmation of the August 1981 Law School confirmed,
degrees and the recommendations for the Distinguished Alumni recommendations
Service awards. The motion was seconded by Regent Dunn and
adopted.
All of the above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of November totaled $888.31.
The Regents adjourned to meet on January 14 and 15, 1982.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1981                        181

numerical order.
Thirty days notice of call of any Bonds for redemption shall be
given by the University by publication in a newspaper or financial journal
published in the City of New York, New York, which carries as part of
its regular service notices of sale of municipal bonds. The University shall
send a copy of such notice to the registered holder of each Bond registered
as to principal and to each holder of a bearer Bond who has requested
such notice in writing, by certified or registered mail postage prepaid,
addressed to the last known address of such bondholder as it appears upon
the bond register or list maintained by the Paying Agent for such purpose,
not later than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption; but failure
to give any such notice by mailing, or any defect therein, shall not affect
the validity of any proceeding for the redemption of any Bond with
respect to which such failure has occurred. Notice need not be published
if all Bonds to be redeemed are registered as to principal and 30 days
notice is mailed to each registered holder. Bonds so called for redemption

cease to be entitled to any source of payment, security or benefit under the
Resolution other than the right to receive payment from the funds

as the same become due by maturity. Notice of such provision for payment shall be promptly thereafter sent to the registered holder of each

for such purpose. Upon the happening of the above conditions, the Bonds
shall cease to be entitled to any source of payment, security, or benefit
under the Resolution other than the right to receive payment from the
aforesaid cash or direct obligations placed with the Paying Agent.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount
of or interest on this Bond or any claim based thereon against the State
of Michigan, the University, or any member of the University, or any
officer or agent thereof, as individuals, either directly or indirectly; nor
shall these obligations become a lien on or secured by any property, real,
personal, or mixed, of the State of Michigan or the University, other than
the Student Fees, as defined in the Resolution, which are pledged to meet
or provide for the payment of said obligations; and the liability of the
University, as a body corporate, shall be limited to said Student Fees, all
other liability, except as expressed in the Resolution, being by the
acceptance hereof and as a part of the consideration for the issuance
hereof expressly waived.
This Bond is transferable by delivery unless registered as to principal
in the owner's name upon books to be kept by the Paying Agent for
such purpose, such registration to be noted hereon. After such registration
no transfer of this Bond shall be valid unless made on said books at the
request of the registered owner hereof, or his duly authorized agent, and
similarly noted hereon; but this Bond may be discharged from registration
by being in like manner transferred to bearer, whereupon transferability
by delivery shall be restored, and this Bond may again from time to time
be registered or made payable to bearer as before. Such registration,
however, shall not affect the negotiability of the annexed coupons, which
shall always be transferable by delivery and be payable to bearer, and
payment to bearer thereof shall fully discharge the University in respect
to the interest thereon, whether or not this Bond be registered as to principal and whether or not such coupons be overdue.
IT Is HEREBY CERTIFIED AND RECITED that all acts and conditions
required to be done, to happen, or to be performed precedent to and in
the issuance of this Bond, have been done, have happened, and have been
performed in due time, form, and manner, as required by law.

SECTION 503  Funds Legally Available Therefor as Source of Payment for the Bonds. The University reserves the right to use any Funds
Legally Available Therefor for the purpose of paying principal or interest

FLOW AND USE OF FUNDS
SECTION 601  Application of Bond Proceeds. Immediately upon
the receipt thereof, the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds shall be apportioned among and deposited in the Project Fund, the Bond Fund and the
Reserve Fund in the following manner:
1. Any accrued interest and premium received on sale of the Bonds
shall be deposited in the Bond Fund;
2. A sum equal to the average annual principal and interest payable
on the Bonds shall be deposited in the Reserve Fund; and
3. The balance of the proceeds of the Bonds shall be deposited in
the Project Fund.
SECTION 602   Use of and Disbursements from   Project Fund.
Moneys in the Project Fund shall be used pursuant to the following
priorities:
1. Payment of accounting, financial consulting, legal, printing, and
other expenses of the University's in connection with the preparation, issuance, sale, and delivery of the Bonds;




DECEMBER MEETING, 1981                       187
2. Reimbursement to the University for general funds expended in
connection with construction of the Power Center Addition; and
3. Payments necessary to provide interim financing for the costs of
completing the acquisition, construction, furnishing, and equipping
of the other Projects.
Any amount remaining in the Project Fund after satisfaction of the foregoing priorities shall be promptly transferred to the Bond Fund. The
depository for the Project Fund shall make disbursements from the Project
Fund upon the order of the University, and shall have no duty or liability
with respect to the manner or method in which moneys are withdrawn
by the University from the Project Fund or in fact are used or applied
by the University.
SECTION 603 Use of and Disbursements from Bond Fund. The
Paying Agent shall use moneys in the Bond Fund to pay principal and
interest on the Bonds as the same become due and the Bonds or coupons
evidencing the same are presented and surrendered. The Paying Agent
may use moneys in the Bond Fund for the acquisition of Bonds in the
open market at the written direction of the University. Any amount remaining in the Bond Fund after the Bonds have been paid or provision
made therefor under the Resolution shall be returned to the University.
SECTION 604 Size and Use of and Disbursements from Reserve
Fund. As the principal of the Bonds is paid and at such time as the
average annual principal and interest payable on the Bonds begins to
decline the amount of funds required to be deposited in the Reserve
Fund shall be reduced on April 1 of each year to equal the average
annual principal and interest then payable on the Bonds, and the excess
shall be transferred to the Bond Fund, provided, however, that in no
event shall the sum required to be deposited in the Reserve Fund be less
than $600,000. If at any time there are not sufficient funds in the Bond
Fund for the payment of the principal of or interest on the Bonds as the
same become due, the Paying Agent shall withdraw from the Reserve
Fund and deposit in the Bond Fund sufficient moneys which when
added to the moneys in the Bond Fund will be sufficient to meet the
payment of principal of and interest then due on the Bonds. The University covenants and agrees that if at any time moneys are withdrawn from
the Reserve Fund for such purpose, there shall be promptly deposited
from time to time in the Reserve Fund from the first Student Fees received thereafter which are not required to make principal or interest
payments on Parity Obligations, a sum sufficient to replace the amount
so withdrawn to the level then required. To the extent that Student Fees
shall not be sufficient for such replacement and for the replacement of
withdrawals from reserves for other Parity Obligations of the University,
the amount deposited in the Reserve Fund in accordance herewith shall
be in proportion to the total requirements for replacement of withdrawals
from reserves for other Parity Obligations and shall be measured by the
principal amount of Parity Obligations at the time outstanding.
At the written direction of the University the moneys in the Reserve
Fund shall be finally transferred to the Bond Fund by the Paying Agent
and applied in payment of the Bonds and interest thereon at such time as
the balance in the Reserve Fund, together with any amount in the Bond
Fund shall be finally transferred to the Bond Fund by the Paying Agent
including interest thereon through maturity, and payment of all fees and
expenses owing to the Paying Agent. Any balance remaining thereafter
in the Reserve Fund shall be returned to the University by the Paying
Agent.

Fund and the Reserve Fund not required for immediate use or disburse



188            DECEMBER MEETING, 1981

deposit of any bank whose deposits are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Moneys in the Project Fund shall be invested at the direction of the
Regents in any investments legally available for University funds.

dates estimated when the moneys in said Funds shall be needed for the
purposes provided in the Resolution. All investments may be sold at the
prevailing market price. All investments shall be deemed a part of the
Fund with whose moneys they were acquired, and all profits and losses
shall be charged to such Fund; provided, however, that all Investment
Income as received shall be deposited in the Bond Fund.

or accumulate any moneys deemed to be proceeds of the Bonds pursuant
to ~103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and the
applicable regulations thereunder, in such a manner as to cause the
Bonds to be "arbitrage Bonds" within the meaning of said ~103(c) and

the then outstanding Parity Obligations and the proposed additional
Parity Obligations during any future Fiscal Year the Bonds are
scheduled to be outstanding; and
(b) the proposed additional Parity Obligations shall be payable

maturity and notice to the Bondholders as hereinbefore specified, the
Student Fees shall be released from the lien of the Resolution, the
University shall be released from the terms of the Resolution, and except
for payment thereof only from said cash or direct obligations of the
United States of America, the Bonds shall not be deemed to be outstanding.

have the right to consent to the adoption by the University of such other
supplemental or amendatory resolutions as shall be deemed necessary
and desirable by the University; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section shall permit, or be construed as permitting, (i) an

issued hereunder, or (ii) a reduction in the principal amount of any Bond
or the rate of interest thereon, or (iii) a privilege or priority of any Bond
or Bonds over any other Bond or Bonds, or (iv) a reduction in the

AND NOTICE OF SALE
SECTION 1001 Preparation of Official Statement and Notice of Sale.
The Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the University shall
direct and participate with Bond Counsel in the preparation of an Official
Statement and a Notice of Sale to be used in connection with a public
competitively bid sale of the Bonds, including in the case of the
Notice of Sale, provision for any maximum interest rate and other terms

anticipate to be ratified and approved by the Regents at the time of the
sale of the Bonds. The Notice of Sale shall be executed by the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and shall be published at least seven




DECEMBER MEETING, 1981                       191

Chief Financial Officer, in the Daily Bond Buyer of New York, New York.
The Vice President and Chief Financial Officer shall provide for
the circulation of the Official Statement, participate in rating meetings,
and take such other action as he may determine necessary for the successful sale of the Bonds, including providing such changes in the terms of

sale of the Bonds (e.g., increase or reduction of the principal amount of
Bonds Projects or variation in the serial maturities). In the event that the
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer determines that economic
conditions might preclude a successful public competitively bid sale, he
shall have the authority to negotiate the sale of the Bonds under such
procedures as he shall deem prudent and appropriate, subject to ratification and approval by the Regents at the time of sale of the Bonds.
SECTION 1002 Resolution Constitutes Contract. The provisions of

Reserve Fund subject to the approval of the Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer. The designated Paying Agent shall signify its acceptance

JANUARY MEETING, 1982
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, JANUARY 14, 1982
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach, and Varner. Chancellors Jenkins
and Nelson and Vice-Presidents Frye, Overberger, Johnson,
Acting Vice-President Jacobson, and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent Waters and VicePresident Brinkerhoff were absent. Chandler Matthews, Controller of the University, attended the meeting for Vice-President
Brinkerhoff.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order and indicated
that the Physical Therapy Program, scheduled to be the first item
on the agenda, would be postponed until the principal parties
were present. He then invited Vice-President Frye to comment
upon the disastrous fire that destroyed the Economics Building on Christmas eve.
Vice-President Frye spoke of the immediate and extraordi- Economics
nary response to the situation by the faculty and University staff Bulding fire
which helped to alleviate a great deal of distress and anxiety
which otherwise could have grown out of proportion. The major
concern was to find available space to house the economics
department within a period of a few days so that resumption of
classes would not be delayed.
After reviewing several options, the recently completed
renovations in the North Ingalls Building to accommodate the
gerontology program were considered to be adequate to take
care of the immediate needs of the economics department and
the decision was made to move the department into those
facilities on an interim basis.
Unfortunately, this meant that the plans to consolidate the
Institute of Gerontology would have to be deferred. Notification
of this decision to the gerontology faculty was somewhat delayed because the past and current directors were out of town
during this vacation period. The gerontology staff and administration, however, have been extraordinarily considerate in
accepting this decision as the most logical and best solution
for a problem that could not otherwise be handled satisfactorily.


193




194


JANUARY, 1982


Salvage operations to preserve as much of the contents of the
economics building as possible began as soon as practicable and
yielded more than anticipated, though many individuals lost
much that is irreplaceable. With the assistance of President
Shapiro, a commitment was made to the department and the
faculty that a fund would be established to aid restoration and
replacement of some of the losses where possible. Vice-President
Frye commented that, all things considered-the tragedies and
the disappointments-the morale of the department was good.
Mr. Jack Weidenbach, Director of Business Operations,
described the activities upon discovery of the fire and the physical condition of the second oldest building on campus. He
said the faculty were superb in aiding the salvage operations. He
described the freeze drying process and said this would preserve
much of the material damaged by water.
Mr. Weidenbach then stated that the City Fire Chief ruled
out the possibility of accidental fire-the fire is believed to be
arson.
Regent Baker raised questions concerning a sprinkler system and the condition of the remaining walls. Can they be
salvaged? Mr. Weidenbach responded that sprinkler systems
have been installed in high risk areas, such as storage areas and
where there is a great deal of smoking. The priority of the
University's fire protection program has always been for the
safety of its personnel. Resources to install sprinkler systems
compete with those for laboratory renovations, etc.
A structural engineer has been retained to evaluate the condition of the walls.
Regent Baker suggested that if the building is not restored
in its present configuration, consideration be given to locating a
new facility in a different area to protect the openness of the
central campus. When the new Chemistry building is underway
much of the existing open area will be gone.
With respect to sprinkler systems, Regent Roach indicated
water damage can be as great as fire damage to original documents. Therefore, a sprinkler system can be a risk as well as a
benefit and should be carefully considered where personnel are
not involved.
Regent Power commented upon the excellent cooperation
between the University and the City of Ann Arbor. She said that
the devastations to some of the faculty and their families in the
economics department were impossible to calculate at this time
and extended to them the solicitude of the Board of Regents.
Regent Power asked if resources would be available to duplicate
the facilities now being used by the economics department on




JANUARY, 1982


195


another floor in the North Ingalls Building for the Institute of
Gerontology.
Vice-President Frye responded that an exact duplication may
not be possible, but consideration is being given to renovating
the seventh floor with general office space to take care of some
of the Institute's needs until final location of the Economics
Department has been determined.
President Shapiro commented upon the extraordinary efforts
by the people working for Mr. Weidenbach during the ChristmasNew Year's week to relocate the economics department by the
January 4 deadline. Personnel of the utilities and the plant and
purchasing departments worked long hours to ensure the new
semester would open on schedule. He said he was deeply grateful
to all those involved.
I. MINUTES
The minutes of the November 19 and 20, 1981 and December 17 and 18, 1981 meetings were approved as revised.
II. REPORTS
Vice-President Brinkerhoff placed on file his monthly reports on investment transactions, plant extension, litigation,
personnel-labor relations, and a quarterly report on non-competitive purchases over $1,000 from single sources.
Acting Vice-President Jacobson filed his monthly report on
the Office of University Relations and Development.
The Regents asked that the Replacement Hospital report
for January be resubmitted in February since adequate time to
review the report was not provided.

Vice-President Frye indicated that, as anticipated, there is
an action request on the agenda to relocate the program in
physical therapy to the Flint campus. He then reviewed the
considerations that led to this decision beginning with the request from the Dean of the Medical School to close the program
due to the need of overall retrenchment to better support the
highest priority and most central programs in the Medical
School. The guidelines for program discontinuance were then
followed allowing for private and public hearings while the
director and faculty of the program were kept informed and
were consulted concerning the process and their attitudes about
the various possibilities other than closure.
Because of the severe shortage of physical therapists in the
State and the nation, it was determined that every effort should
be made to continue to help meet that need. Therefore, three




JANUARY, 1982


199


specific proposals were considered: a preliminary inquiry from
Eastern Michigan University; a proposal from the Department
of Physical Education; and a proposal from UM-Flint. After
a careful review, it was decided to pursue the Flint proposal
because it would enable the same number of students to be
trained at the entry level as in the current program. The proposal
would also provide for the necessary incremental support for a
high quality program and eventually the master's level program.
In addition it would be financially sound and consistent with the
current mission and development goals of the Flint Campus.
The faculty at Flint have now unanimously voted to approve
the proposal, therefore, relocation of the program to the Flint
Campus is recommended with the full endorsement of the executive officers, the Medical School executive committee, the dean
of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and of Professor Richard Darnell, Chairman of the Physical Therapy
Curriculum.
Professor Darnell indicated that the proposal submitted to
the Regents contains one major alteration. Rather than a separate
unit reporting directly to the Provost at UM-Flint, the physical
therapy program would be housed in a proposed degree granting
unit with other health related programs. Although a separate unit
is preferable to the faculty because of administrative factors, it is
recognized that placement in a newly developed unit with programs of like character would have significant fiscal and curricular advantages and would be acceptable.
Professor Darnell said it is understood that an appropriate
administrative unit would be created as soon as possible on the
Flint Campus because of the overwhelming support for such a
unit, and the Board of Directors of the Physical Therapy Association has endorsed the relocation proposal contingent upon
the development of such a unit. The difficulties encountered by
the physical therapy curriculum seem to emanate from a single
factor-an inadequate and inappropriate administrative structure. The program would not be viable in the College of Arts
and Science. Chancellor Nelson has indicated that it is his belief
that the form and substance of the proposed unit will be
compatible with the best interest of the Flint Campus and the
University as a whole.
The Regents asked questions concerning: (1) the clinical
experience for the students in the program, (2) whether the
transfer to the Flint Campus would be a hardship for those students who had already contemplated admission to the program
at the Ann Arbor Campus, (3) the extent to which the faculty
are prepared to deal with the fairly heavy burden they will have
to bear during the 1982-83 term when students will be trained
both in Ann Arbor and Flint.




200


JANUARY, 1982


Professor Darnell responded to these questions as follows:
(1) the only actual change in the clinical education program
would be in the pre-clinical aspect and it was felt that there
were sufficient places in the Flint community to carry out that
function, (2) it is believed that the students who enter The University of Michigan primarily to pursue physical therapy education would not consider the relocation an overwhelming problem,
but there is no data to support this, at this time, (3) the faculty
are aware of the burden and are prepared to meet it because it is
the only way the transition could occur without the loss of some
students.
Professor Kenneth West, Chairman of the Flint Faculty
Assembly, emphasized the fact that the faculty assembly of
UM-Flint voted unanimously to support the relocation of the
physical therapy program to the Flint Campus. He indicated it
was the result of the close cooperation between the administration and the faculty and also the consequence of extensive deliberations by the faculty committees involved. Initial fears that
the program might not be viable or anticipated enrollment might
not materialize were overcome. Certain considerations were recommended and included in the final document. These included
assurances of support from area hospitals and foundations, provisions for review and evaluation of the program at the end of
the third and sixth years, no existing College of Arts and
Science base budget moneys would be allocated to support the
program, and provisions for the creation of a new unit to include
physical therapy and other current health and health science
related programs. Professor West expressed his hope that the
Regents would approve the proposal.
Chancellor Nelson said he had nothing further to add to
Vice-President Frye's review and listed the three specific requests in the recommendation. He acknowledged Dr. William
Vasse's role in guiding all of the components to the final
recommendation. Chancellor Nelson said he is satisfied that
UM-Flint has adequate facilities for the program.
There was further discussion concerning the commitments by
the foundations and hospitals, the transitional funding, the components in the new academic units, the administrative costs of
the new unit and whether there would be duplications of program offerings on the Ann Arbor and Flint Campuses.
Professor Darnell indicated that the educational and clinical
materials that are currently used for the physical therapy program would be transferred to Flint.
Regent Power then moved approval to relocate total budgetary responsibility for the Curriculum in Physical Therapy from
the Ann Arbor Campus to the Flint Campus, effective July 1,

1982; approval to relocate total academic responsibility for the
Curriculum in Physical Therapy from the Ann Arbor Campus
to the Flint Campus, effective September 1, 1983 with a shared
responsibility maintained by the two campuses from July 1,
1982 to August 31, 1983; and authorization to grant the degree
of Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy from the Flint
Campus of the University, effective September 1, 1983, with
the first class graduating from UM-Flint in August 1984.
Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.

Three off-campus assignments, one administrative leave, Leaves of
seventy-five sabbatical leaves, five scholarly activity leaves, one  Absence
extended sick leave, eighteen leaves of absence without salary,
and nine retirement furloughs were reported to the Regents.
Regent Dunn questioned the scholarly activity leave cate- Scholarly
gory-what was its purpose and what kind of revenues are      Activity Leave
available for this?
Vice-President Frye explained that faculty members often
receive grants to pursue some type of scholarly activity. These
grants are sometimes not sufficient to provide for the faculty
members' full salary for a semester or a year. The specific
department would then supplement the grant.
President Shapiro explained that a Guggenheim fellowship
which is a very prestigious grant, is a good example. This fellowship is available for a variety of scholarly activities. The stipend
provided, however, no longer is sufficient to induce a faculty
member to apply for a grant. If departments can supplement
the grant, however, the University's scholarly reputation is certainly enhanced.
Regent Dunn remarked that it was his understanding that
publishing was part of a person's teaching career and not an
activity for which one is additionally compensated.
Vice-President Frye commented that writing books and
scholarly papers is at the very heart of the University and
should be encouraged at every opportunity. The resources involved would be very modest and would be a good investment.
Upon Regent Dunn's request, a report will be presented to
the Regents at the next meeting for further discussion.
Regent Power indicated that she is very supportive of the
philosophy and intent of the leaves for scholarly activity. It is




204


JANUARY, 1982


a means of encouraging scholarship and scholarly endeavor of
some of the University's distinguished faculty on a highly selective basis. Regent Power agreed that it was a good use of
University funds and results in considerable recognition for
having received some of the highest honors in the nation.
V!. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of two faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted.
I. K. Heller   DR. IRENE K. HELLER, Associate Professor of Education, retired
from active faculty status as of December 31, 1981. She had an active
career as a recognized educator in the fields of elementary school
curriculum, reading instruction and teacher education.
A native of Michigan, Professor Heller completed her B.A. degree
in 1944 and her M.Ed. degree in 1954 from Wayne State University.
She then earned her Ph.D. from The University of Michigan in 1963.
Professor Heller began her teaching in the Detroit Public Schools in
1943, was promoted to Assistant Principal in 1955, and served as Supervisor of the Mathematics Improvement Program in 1959. She came to
The University of Michigan in 1959, served as Teaching Fellow and
Instructor, was promoted to Assistant Professor upon receipt of her
degree in 1963 and then to Associate Professor with tenure in 1967.
During the period January through June, 1975, she served as Associate
Dean in Mr. Bertolaet's absence and was appointed Assistant Dean for
Instruction for the period September, 1976, through June, 1977.
At the University, Professor Heller taught both graduate and undergraduate students, offering courses in reading, general elementary
methods, and elementary school curriculum. Her expertise was never
the "ivory tower" variety since she renewed it periodically in the elementary classroom. In 1969 she took a year's leave to teach again in the
Detroit schools and in 1975 visited elementary schools in Hungary reporting her observations in the Innovator. Professor Heller was frequently
asked to review proposals for the federal government, and manuscripts
for commercial publishers and professional journals.
In the School of Education Professor Heller served on the Executive
Committee, chaired the Undergraduate Committee, and chaired both the
Reading and the Curriculum Programs as well as the Elementary Committee. She responded generously to school systems' requests for inservice
training and often joined the Bureau of School Services' teams for
curriculum evaluation studies.
In recognition of the above accomplishments and her exemplary
record as an educational leader and faculty member, the Regents now
salute Irene K. Heller by naming her Associate Professor Emeritus of
Education.
N. K. Marshall    NORMA K. MARSHALL, Assistant Dean and Professor of Nursing,
Retirement will retire from active faculty status on January 31, 1982.
A native of Michigan, Professor Marshall received her nursing
diploma from the Edward W. Sparrow Hospital School of Nursing in
Lansing, Michigan in 1947. She took undergraduate studies at Michigan
State University and Case Western Reserve University and her graduate
studies at Case Western Reserve University and The University of
Michigan.
From 1947 to 1951, Professor Marshall was employed as an
Instructor at the Edward W. Sparrow Hospital School of Nursing in
Lansing, Michigan. In 1953, she came to The University of Michigan as
an Assistant Professor of Nursing and Chairperson of the Foundations




JANUARY, 1982


205


Area of the School of Nursing. She was promoted to the rank of Associate
Professor in 1960 and to Professor in 1972 and was Acting Dean in
1972-1973. She has served as Assistant Dean of the School of Nursing
since 1971. Professor Marshall was appointed by the Governor of
Michigan to the Michigan Board of Nursing. She served as a member
from 1973 to 1976 and was Vice Chairperson from 1976 to 1977.
During Professor Marshall's tenure at The University of Michigan,
she was instrumental in the development of the Registered Nurse Studies
Program and provided leadership in curriculum development and in
academic services for students in the School of Nursing.
The Regents recognize this distinguished health educator for her
dedicated service by naming her Professor Emeritus of Nursing.
Regent Power moved approval of the resolution commemorating the retirement of Arlene Howe, Staff Associate to the
Executive Director of University Hospitals.

ILIR Relationship with
WSU terminated


In reviewing the resolution to terminate the joint appointment between Wayne State University and the University of
Michigan for the operation of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations, President Shapiro indicated that the interest
of the faculties went in different directions and almost from the
beginning there has been virtually no interaction. The Ann Arbor
faculty were interested in research and labor relations and the
Wayne State faculty were more interested in providing training
in various skills for people in the labor movement. There has
been little, if any, cooperation between the two units, therefore
it is recommended that the joint venture be terminated.
Regent Nederlander then moved to approve the attached
resolution which officially concludes this joint venture between
The University of Michigan and Wayne State University. Regent
Dunn seconded the motion and it was adopted.
WHEREAS, since 1957 The University of Michigan and
Wayne State University have operated the Institute of Labor and
Industrial Relations as a joint venture, and
WHEREAS, both The University of Michigan and Wayne
State University desire to terminate the operation of the Institute as a joint venture. Therefore, it is
RESOLVED, that effective June 30, 1982, The University
of Michigan shall conclude its joint venture for the operation of
the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations with Wayne




JANUARY, 1982


207


State University and shall forthwith take such administrative
steps as may be necessary to accomplish the aforedescribed
termination.
President Shapiro informed the Board of a major grant from
the W. K. Kellogg Foundation for renovations in the Parkview
Building for the teaching, patient care, and research activities
of the Department of Ophthalmology. He said that this grant
makes it virtually certain that the Eye Center will go forward.
Regent Power moved authorization to accept the grant with
the gratitude of the University for this generous support. Regent
Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
President Shapiro also announced another gift to the University. Mr. and Mrs. Norman Freehling have begun to endow
two assistant professorships in humanities. Both Mrs. Freehling's
father and husband are graduates of the University. The gift will
enable the University to create positions for young scholars in
this area. It is the wish of the Freehlings to attract not only
high quality people to the University, but also to meet the
national problem of providing adequate opportunities for young
scholars in the humanities. The professorships will be known
as the Wilhartz Assistant Professorships in Philosophy and
English. It is an innovative way to attract quality people to the
University and to meet a significant problem for young scholars
in the humanities area.
The Regents received information on the reorganization
of the School of Nursing.
Regent Roach then moved that the Board convene in executive session for the purpose of considering material which, on
the advice of counsel, is exempt from disclosure pursuant to
Section 13(1)a, the unwarranted invasion of privacy section of
the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, specifically, a proposed written agreement for a gift in trust by a donor who has
informed the University that the donor insists upon strict
anonymity and is fearful that publicity would result in damage
to donor's property. Regent Roach indicated that the executive session would take place immediately following the public
comments session. Regent Baker seconded the motion and
it was adopted with Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn, Power,
Roach, and Varner voting affirmatively. Regents Nederlander
and Waters were absent.
The Regents then recessed for five minutes to review the
material which had just been distributed concerning the sale of
construction fee bonds for the Flint Physical Education facility,
Michigan Union renovation project, the Herbert H. Dow Building, the Alumni Center Building and the Power Center addition.

APPENDIX A


HONORARY DEGREES
Conferred December 21, 1981
HANNA HOLBORN GRAY, President, The University of Chicago
The University of Michigan takes pleasure in recognizing one of the
outstanding leaders in higher education today, Hanna Holborn Gray. Her
career illustrates the many faceted role of a leader in American education, a role that highlights the increasingly interrelated areas of
education, government, and public affairs.
Starting out as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University, Mrs. Gray next became Provost and then Acting
President of Yale University. In 1978, she was selected as the President
and 10th Chief Executive of the University of Chicago. Mrs. Gray is an
historian, with special interests in the history of humanism, political and
historical thought, and politics of the Renaissance in Italy and northern
Europe.
Mrs. Gray, as the first woman president of a major private research
university, has already gained great respect as an administrator by her
brisk managerial style and her insatiable appetite for facts on the
important issues she must decide. She has succeeded in directing the
University of Chicago through difficult times without impairing the
quality that has come to distinguish that institution.
The University of Michigan is pleased to saluate this outstanding
scholar and university administrator by conferring upon her the degree,
Doctor of Laws.
ISAMU NOGUCHI, artist, sculptor, and humanist
Isamu Noguchi was born in Los Angeles. His father was a poet
and his mother both a writer and teacher. His early youth was spent in
Japan. He returned to the United States in 1919 and became an apprentice
in the studio of Gutzom Borglum. At the same time, Mr. Noguchi studied
at Columbia University and the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in
New York.
A Guggenheim Fellowship took Mr. Noguchi to France where he
continued his study at the Academie Grande Chaumiers and the Collarosi
School. There he became an assistant to the great Constantin Bramcusi
and befriended many of the young painters, sculptors, dancers, and
composers whose subsequent careers have made them the pivotal figures
of our century. There was Picasso and Matisse, Martha Graham, George
Gershwin, Stuart Davis, Buckminster Fuller-the list could include
virtually all the influences which have shaped contemporary culture.
Out of this ferment of ideas emerged Mr. Noguchi's life-long
dedication to his art and its relationship with the total environment. He
has worked with all materials-metal, wood and stone to create works
of art of extraordinary contemplative power in all corners of the world.
Examples include Sculpture Gardens at the Paris UNESCO Building,
the Rare Book Library at Yale, the Chase Manhattan Bank and the


213




214                    JANUARY, 1982
Dodge Fountain and Plaza in Detroit. The greatest museums of the
world must consider their permanent collections incomplete if they do
not include examples of the work of this surpassing sculptor. His
career has been a model for those who value the interrelation of all
the arts. He has worked as an integral force with the finest architects,
painters, dancers, and composers of our time. His work is a lasting testimony to the values which art in a public setting has for all of us.
Mr. Noguchi has given us a quality of experience which ennobles
our lives. The University of Michigan is proud to recognize his achievements on behalf of people everywhere by awarding him the degree,
Doctor of Fine Arts.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1982
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1982
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellors
Jenkins and Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye,
Overberger, Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson and VicePresident and Secretary Kennedy also were present.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order and indicated  Five-Year Plan:
Reduction and
that Vice-President Frye would describe a five year $20 million  Reallocation
reduction/reallocation plan to deal with the problem of declining resources for the University.
Vice-President Frye indicated that the erosion of general
fund resources which began gradually about a decade ago has
accelerated considerably during the last few years. The principal
factor has been the decline in the level of State support coupled
with the rapid rise in the cost of utilities and certain staff benefits. Further, it is believed that the rate of general fund revenue
growth over the next decade will not be sufficient to meet the
resource needs of the University at the current size and scope
of the institution.
The University has barely been able to offset this decline
through a combination of such steps as deferral of expenditures
for equipment and renovation, an intensive energy saving program, rising tuition rates, and enforced retrenchment. It is
likely that these conditions will worsen over the next several
years because of a decline in qualified student applicants, reduced flexibility for internal reallocation because of the low rate
of turnover of tenured faculty, and an accumulation of delayed
maintenance and equipment costs. In addition, federal government support for higher education will likely decline further.
Vice-President Frye said the proposed plan would produce
$20 million in reductions of personnel and programs supported
by the General Fund which could then be reallocated to such
high priority needs as salary improvements for faculty and staff,
improved support for graduate students, an improved research
environment, improved undergraduate teaching, and funds for
selected program growth and development. The rising cost of
utilities and the deferred expenditures for maintenance; equipment and renovations also will have to be addressed.

FEBRUARY, 1982


In addition, efforts must be made to (1) intensify the existing energy savings program through greater efficiency in space
utilization, (2) achieve a more adequate level of State support,
and (3) increase gift support.
Vice-President Frye commented that the general framework
for retrenchment and reallocation of the $20 million of general
funds would consist of two components: selective program reductions or closure, and variable shared reductions. He then
described the procedures to be followed for each component. It
is anticipated that this five-year plan will commence during the
1982-83 fiscal year. It will hopefully avoid haphazard or random
cuts and will encourage long-range programmatic planning. A
tracking system will be developed to assure adherence to the
goals set forth in the plan and clear accountability for decisions.
All budgetary and administrative units will be expected to
participate in the plan and affirmative action policies will continue to be followed. Dr. Frye also mentioned some of the concerns that need addressing during these critical years, including:
preserving academic integrity as relationships between the University, Industry, and Government are explored, protecting the
quality of instruction, preserving interdisciplinary teaching and
scholarship, providing and preserving an environment in which
there is an opportunity for all members of the faculty to develop
and flourish, nurturing liberal arts and the humanities in particular to maintain excellence in these disciplines, and protecting
tenured faculty wherever possible by meticulously following the
regental guidelines for the discontinuance of academic programs.
Vice-President Frye concluded by saying that this "framework for planning" should be considered a process through
which the redistribution of University resources would better
meet the highest priority needs of the faculty and the students.
Regent Nederlander commented that this plan has been
devised assuming certain funding levels. He asked if alternative
plans had been developed if these assumptions did not materialize.
Vice-President Frye indicated that if the worst case scenario
should develop, then the priority items, such as salary improvement, etc., would have to be reconsidered with further budget
cuts as the most likely solution.
Regent Baker commented that, in his view, the proposed
plan is realistic and sensitive to the needs of the institution, the
faculty, staff, and the students. He said that he was supportive
of the concept.
Regent Varner asked if sponsored research would be discouraged. Vice-President Frye responded that this was not his




FEBRUARY, 1982


217


intention. Sponsored research, however, tends to generate its
own costs, therefore, it cannot be used to cover the ongoing costs
of the University. The University should encourage those things
that are important for the institution and not as a way of solely
accommodating to the general fund retrenchment.
Regent Roach commended the administration for taking a
longer planning course in reviewing budget prospects, and he
hoped the University would continue in this vein. He expressed
a concern, however, regarding the regental role of establishing
policy versus the executive officers' role of management and administrative matters. The establishment of new programs or adding to existing programs when cutbacks are recommended could
very well get into the policy area. In certain instances decisions
will be hard to classify. Therefore, he asked, what role the
Regents should play in resolving policy issues?
Vice-President Frye indicated that the Regents would be
kept regularly informed and any issue that the executive officers
think is of a policy nature would be presented to the Regents
even though the issue does not involve program closure or review.
Regent Roach suggested that all budgetary assumptions on
the part of the units should be clearly identified, and if the
assumption is not a certainty, there should be an alternate plan.
Interdisciplinary programs must be looked upon favorably; they
should not be decreased.
President Shapiro commented that commitment to this plan
had not been firmly set at this time and the actual framework
would depend upon circumstances as they arise. Although the
plan might take years to fully develop and mature, it would
be implemented immediately in order to make the initial adjustments by July 1, 1982. As the Regents, executive officers, and
University community develop experience, there would be
ample opportunity to alter the plan. It is important, however, to
begin the process immediately.
Regent Power remarked that she was supportive of the plan
and felt it offered the Regents and the University the opportunity
to reposition the University. Interdisciplinary programs have
progressed very well, and hopefully, will continue. Regent Power
asked several questions: (1) was the reallocation figure of $20
million over the next five years sufficient, (2) does the proposal
include closure of a school or college, if appropriate, (3) what is
the selection procedure for the committees on budget priorities
and budget administration, (4) what are the governance and
decision making procedures to be followed, and (5) how will
the various constituents be involved in the plan when the end
of the academic year is very near.




218


FEBRUARY, 1982


Vice-President Frye commented that the plan, as presented,
has been reviewed by the budget priorities committee and the
budget administration committee, the deans group, the academic
affairs advisory committee of faculty and students and the Senate
Assembly. The plan was supported and accepted by each group.
President Shapiro indicated that reallocating $20 million
would not solve the University's problems, but was an aspect of
a much broader strategy. Efforts must be made to intensify private fund raising, to intensify support from other sources to the
extent possible, and to look for a new and better relationship
with the State of Michigan. To achieve the University's objectives, all of these elements must come into place. He indicated
that if the Board wished to formally approve this planning
framework, of course, it would be helpful.
Regent Varner commented that she would hope that the
positive aspects of the plan would be emphasized as it is discussed
throughout the University community to overcome some of the
insecurity and anxiety that is inevitable.
Regent Roach then moved to endorse in principle the plan as
submitted. Regent Baker seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Housing Rates  Vice-President Johnson indicated that the agenda included a
for 1982-83
for 1982-83 request to approve rate increases for the housing units. The
recommendation suggested a 9.95% increase for the traditional
residence halls, 12.2% increase for family housing, and 12.5%
increase for Oxford, Fletcher, and Baits housing.
Mr. Robert Hughes, Director of Housing, commented that
two student/staff committees were formed to review the finances
of University owned and operated housing and the recommended
rates were unanimously approved by both committees. Utilities
in Oxford, Fletcher, and Baits are a greater proportion of the
budget, therefore, a higher increase was recommended.
The University of Michigan is recognized as having one of
the leading housing energy management programs in the country.
The Housing division continues to work on other cost saving
measures, such as computerized food service programs which
has been successful in some areas. The experimental breakfast
option, and extended meal hours has proved to be very popular.
The proposed rate structure would fund this meal program,
maintain the present levels of service and compensate for the
business office charge backs that were assessed for the first time
this year.
After discussion, Regent Nederlander moved to approve a
rate increase of 9.95% for the traditional residence halls, 12.2%
for family housing, and 12.5% for Oxford, Fletcher, and Baits
Houses. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.

The Regents then heard comments from the following in- Public Comments
dividuals on the topics indicated: David Jackson, student,
change in the grading policy in the Medical School; Bert Hornback, Professor of English, the current direction of the smaller

classes; Tom Blessing, Chairman of the Resource Recovery
Commission, solid waste as it relates to the High Technology
Park; Jon Feiger, President of Michigan Student Assembly, on
the general MSA projects.
FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1982
The Regents met at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellors
Jenkins and Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye,
Overberger, Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson, and VicePresident and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent
Brown was absent.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order and indicated  innual
that the twelve-month investment report would be the first item  Report
on the agenda.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff introduced Norman Herbert,
University Investment Officer, and Mel Rosek and Don Lindow
from the National Bank of Detroit. He then commented that
economic conditions have had a depressing effect on the investment program. Vice-President Brinkerhoff suggested that the
several items, particularly those involving options and real estate,
which request action be deferred until next month so that further questions and discussion can be accommodated.
Mr. Herbert indicated that the report included the status of
the University's endowment funds for the year ending December
31, 1981, reflecting the University's objective to protect the purchasing power of the endowment pools corpus. The recommendations include the addition of stock to the University's list of
common stocks, increasing the use of using the Common Fund
for equities, participation in an options writing program as a
source of incremental income, and participation in a real estate
limited partnership program as both a further diversification of
endowment funds.
Mr. Don Lindow summarized some of the significant changes
which occurred in the endowment funds during 1981. He said
that, with respect to fixed income investments, major emphasis
was placed on the purchase of discount bonds of shorter maturity
placing less emphasis on current income and providing inflation
protection for the endowment funds since it is the bank's expectation that interest rates will decline in 1982.




228


FEBRUARY, 1982


Mr. Mel Rosek commented that the performance of The
University of Michigan's endowment funds over the past several
years reflect the generally unsatisfactory performance of the
financial markets in both absolute terms and relative to inflation.
Mr. Rosek indicated that last year the bank felt that bonds
were a better investment only because they did not decline as
much as stocks. Over the long term, there is no way to achieve
the University's goals with fixed income assets in an inflationary
environment without transferring income to principal. Therefore,
money management at the present time requires imagination
and constructive innovation.
Last year the Regents authorized a securities lending program to add income and, happily, the program did generate some
additional income. Mr. Rosek then proposed the University's
participation in the following programs: investing in an opportunity fund, participating in the Common Fund for Equities,
stock options and a real estate program. The options strategies
he proposed consisted of a Buy-Write program, an Internal
Overwrite for incremental income and risk reduction, and the
Protective Put Purchase program which can be compared to
an insurance policy.
Mr. Herbert indicated that the options writing program
would not allow authorization by the University Officers prior
to purchase as is the present procedure because buying or selling
an option will be done on very short notice. Therefore, it was
suggested that the University provide an opportunity under the
Buy-Write program for the National Bank of Detroit to buy the
necessary securities, to execute or implement the Buy-Write
program without regard for the University's master list of stocks,
and to execute these options, as appropriate, given the market
conditions and report to the University on a regular basis.
Considerable discussion followed concerning the amount of
money to set aside for the Buy-Write program, the necessity to
increase the monitoring of the options, the amount of risk the
University would incur, the handling of the call options if the
price of the stock should decline. Mr. Rosek commented that the
obiective of the options program is to reduce the market risk,
therefore, options were considered a prudent fiduciary activity.
Mr. Rosek then discussed the proposed real estate investment program. He said the program would provide income and
would diversitfy the portfolio. Some of the problems associated
with real estate are that it is difficult to diversify with a moderate
size investment and intensive management is required. By entering a partnership, as proposed, these objections would cause
little difficulty. The National Bank of Detroit projects a modest
recovery in the second half of the year and expects an end to




FEBRUARY, 1982


229


the decline in activity. The partnership would be of a limited
nature and the combined resources of the partnership would
allow diversification of investments.
The Regents requested further information concerning the
advisability of setting limits on option fund strategies, the kind
of liquidity the University would have with respect to the real
estate program, and the advisability of reinvesting some of the
income from the University's fixed income securities.
There will be further discussion and action on this subject
at the March meeting.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the recommendation for w. K. Kellogg
approval of the site, and Mr. Frederick Mayer described the  ye Center
schematic design for the Ophthalmology research and faculty
building. The site recommended is immediately west of the
Parkview Building. The University is in the process of acquiring the property at the present time. The new facility would be
named the W. K. Kellogg Eye Center.
Regent Roach moved to approve the site subject to the
acquisition of the land within sixty days and approved the schematic design which would allow the architect to proceed with
design development and working drawings for the Research and
Faculty wing of the Ophthalmology project. Regent Nederlander
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The proposed addition of a Fine Arts Library to Tappan  Tappan Hall
Hall was then reviewed by Mr. Mayer. He said that after careful
consideration it was determined that the south side of Tappan
Hall would be the better site for the addition. The Regents posed
questions concerning the architectural relationship of the proposed facility to Clements Library and the President's House,
and the source of funds for the project.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff explained that the facade would
blend well with existing buildings and resources would be provided by the plant renovation funds if sufficient funding was not
obtained through fund raising activities.
Regent Baker moved to approve the project, authorize the
fund raising, assign the building site, and approve the appointment of Luckenbach Ziegelman/Associates of Birmingham,
Michigan as the architect for the project, subject to a composite
showing the facade of the proposed addition in relation to the
other buildings on South University. Regent Nederlander
seconded the motion and it was adopted. The composite will be
presented to the Regents in March.
VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of three faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted.




230


FEBRUARY, 1982


W. C. Rhodes     WILLIAM CONLEY RHODES, Professor of Psychology and EducaRetirement tion, and Program Director for Psychology at the Institute for the Study
of Mental Retardation and Related Disabilities, retired from active
faculty status December, 1981. He was well recognized for able teaching,
scholarship concerning mental health concepts and practices, and extensive publications.
A native of Louisiana, he began his academic career at Emory
University, receiving an A.B. in 1948 and an M.A. in Experimental Psychology in 1949; his Ph.D. was from Ohio State in Clinical Psychology
in 1953. His first position was Director, Division of Mental Hygiene in
Georgia. In 1956 he became Director of the Peabody Child Study Center
at Peabody College. During this period he became involved in the
nationally recognized innovative program for rehabilitation of emotionally disturbed children, Project Re-Ed. His specific responsibility was
evaluation of program efficacy. He also assumed responsibility for
Peabody's Community Psychology Program. His next role was an
Assistant Section Chief, Child Mental Health, in the National Institute
of Mental Health, where he served from 1963-1967. He then moved to
The University of Michigan where he held appointments in the School of
Public Health, School of Education, and the Washtenaw County Community Mental Health Center as well as roles as Professor of Psychology
and Program Director for Psychology at ISMRRD.
Dr. Rhodes is nationally recognized for leadership in community
mental health interventions. His contributions range from specific demonstration projects to regional coordinated efforts based upon an ecological
model. While his main focus has been on the mental health of children
and youth, the rang of his innovations cover infancy through old age.
His teaching reflected a blend of direct program commitment and an
objectivity born of intensive scholarship applied to issues underlying
program efforts. Rhodes was a national leader in the movement of mental
health activity from a medical model to a community-ecological model.
His dual concern for the philosophical and psychological nature of
deviance eventually led him to write what is considered a landmark series.
This is a five volume work, A Study of Child Variance, published by the
University of Michigan Press. A child variance series starts with two
volumes: Conceptual Models and Intervention Models. An historical and
conceptual analysis of service delivery follows in the next two publications.
Finally in the culminating volume, Rhodes looks to the future and provides guidelines for national planning as well as specific procedures to
apply his concepts in a wide variety of situations.
The Regents now salute this distinguished Mental Health educator
by naming him Professor Emeritus of Psychology.
A. G. Richards    ALBERT GUSTAV RICHARDS, B.S.E., M.S., Marcus L. Ward ProRetirement fessor of Dentistry, began retirement furlough from the Department of
Oral Diaignosis and Radiology at the School of Dentistry on January 1,
1981 after a career at the University that spanned more than 40 years.
A creative, inventive researcher and outstanding teacher, Professor
Richards is known as one of the world's foremost authorities in the field
of dental radiology. Among his many accomplishments are the invention
of the recessed cone X-ray head (now standard equipment in dental
offices), using electron microscopy to view the internal structure of teeth,
and a liquid mold technique for showing the topography of surfaces that
has had diverse applications in other fields, for example, in determining
fingerprints of burn victims. Other products of his inventive mind are
dynamic tomography, a radiographic procedure that allows physicians
and dentists to examine living tissue layer by layer, and the Buccal Object
Rule, a method for determining the relative location of objects hidden
in the oral region. He holds seven patents on inventions.




FEBRUARY, 1982


231


Born in Chicago in 1917, Professor Richards earned the B.S. degree
in chemical engineering at the U-M in 1940, after which he joined the
staff at the School as instructor. Already an advanced amateur photographer, making his own color prints in the 1930's when they were a rarity,
he focused his interests on X-ray photography and its application to dentistry, teaching himself dental radiology. In 1943 he received the M.S.
degree in physics from the U-M. By 1959 he was made professor and in
1974 was named the Marcus L. Ward Professor of Dentistry, the first
distinguished professorship at the School. He has won many honors for
his teaching and research, including the establishment by the School of
the Albert G. Richards Award for Excellence in Radiography to be
given annually to a student. He is the author of more than 100 publications and an active member of many professional organizations. Professor
Richards is also well known for his beautiful floral radiographs which
have been exhibited in art and photography shows across the country.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his
dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Dentistry.
ALBERT H. WHEELER, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology in the Department of Microbiology and Immuniology, retired from
active faculty status as of December 31, 1981, after a most productive
career in teaching, in research and in service to the University and the
community.
A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Dr. Wheeler took undergraduate
studies at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and obtained an M.S. at
Iowa State College before entering the School of Public Health at The
University of Michigan in 1937. He received his M.S.P.H. in 1938 and his
Dr. P.H. in 1944. After serving as a Research Associate in the Hospital
Serology Laboratory from 1944-1952, he joined the faculty of the Departments of Dermatology and Microbiology. He was promoted to Associate
Professor in these Departments in 1959. Dr. Wheeler published 26 articles
in scientific journals and had 19 abstracts published in the proceedings of
various societal meetings. From 1952-1970 he was Director of the
Treponemal Laboratory at the University of Michigan. This was the
first university-based laboratory of its kind in the nation and maintained
an outstanding reputation throughout its existence. Dr. Wheeler gained
national recognition and served on various committees of the Venereal
Disease Branch of the USPHS and the American Venereal Disease Association. In addition to these endeavors, Dr. Wheeler was responsible for a
major share of teaching to Nursing and Medical Technology students,
including at one point having sole responsibility for teaching immunology
to the Medical Technology students.
In 1970, Dr. Wheeler took a four-year leave of absence to serve as
Director of the Department of Christian Service in the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. During the period of the late 1960's and early 1970's
there was a compelling need for leaders within deprived minority communities to take constructive roles in evolutionary changes which would
have great impact on society. Dr. Wheeler unselfishly took up this charge
and became a prominent figure in efforts to improve the quality of life
for Black Americans. He became very active in a wide variety of committees and groups in the local community, in Metropolitan Detroit, in the
State of Michigan and in the nation. This record was augmented by his
serving as Mayor of Ann Arbor for two terms and by his appointment
by President Carter to the Mayor's Advisory Council to the White House
Office of Drug Abuse Policy.
In 1974, Dr. Wheeler returned to the Department of Microbiology
where he was able to quickly reachieve his high level of performance
in teaching and service. He co-directed the microbiology laboratory course
for Allied Health Science students and assumed the major role in re

structuring and directly the laboratory portion of the course for secondyear medical students. In addition to fulfilling these teaching functions,
Dr. Wheeler provided outstanding service to the University as a mediator
in negotiations between the administration and black students. He was
promoted to Professor of Microbiology and Immunology in 1978.
The Regents now saluate this distinguished health educator for
his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Microbiology
and Immunology.
VII. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported the death of Arnet B. Epple,
Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering. The request to
bestow emeritus status retroactive to October 3, 1973 to Professor Epple was approved unanimously; and the death of Willard
A. Oberdick, Emil Lorch Professor of Architecture. The memorial statements follow.
Arnet B. Epple, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering died
January 15, 1982 in Salem, Oregon. He was 70 years of age.
Professor Epple received the B.S./M.E. from the University of Wisconsin in 1933 and the M.S./M.E. in 1934. From 1934 to 1941 he was a
Sales Engineer for B. F. Sturtevant Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
From 1941 to 1944 he was an Instructor at the Michigan College of
Mining and Technology, and from 1944-45 was Chief Test Engineer at
Norge Division of Borg-Warner Corporation in Detroit, Michigan. He
joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of
Michigan as an Assistant Professor in 1945 and was promoted to Associate
Professor in 1949. He was active in research and teaching in the field of
heating, air-conditioning and industrial ventilation. He was a registered
Professional Engineer in Michigan and active in the American Society of
Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers.
Among students, faculty and staff, Professor Epple is remembered
as an exceptionally dedicated teacher. Early in his career he developed
Multiple Sclerosis and it gradually became more and more difficult for
him to walk; however, he refused to give up and continued his teaching
until forced to go on sick leave and then disability leave in January, 1971.
It is requested that Professor Epple be given Emeritus status retroactive to his retirement from disability leave effective October 3, 1976.
With great sadness, the Regents of the University acknowledge the
loss of Willard A. Oberdick, Emil Lorch Professor of Architecture, who
died suddenly on the eleventh of February at the age of fifty-nine.
Professor Oberdick received a Bachelor of Architecture (Construction) degree at Michigan in 1947 and joined the faculty of the College
of Architecture and Design in 1948. Beginning as an instructor in structural theory, his early research on the behavior of thin-shell concrete
was a pioneering effort in this country. This led to extensive investigations
into the use in buildings of reinforced and cellular plastics and plastic
sealants. Professor Oberdick was among the first to explore computer
simulation of the thermal performance of buildings. This became the
foundation for his continuing development of computer-based building
information systems and life-cost analyses. During the past ten years, his
research has centered on energy conservation and solar energy applications in buildings. The Regents recognize the importance of his input
to the energy conservation program developed and applied with considerable success in recent years in University of Michigan buildings.
A strong proponent of a more rigorous methodology in the technical




FEBRUARY, 1982


233


design of buildings, Professor Oberdick made a significant contribution
to instruction in architecture by his founding and almost singlehanded
development of the Building Technology Laboratory as a teaching tool.
An important adjunct of the Architectural Research Laboratory, the
Building Technology Laboratory is a unique facility, unmatched in any
other school of architecture. Professor Oberdick was a tireless teacher,
at his best in mutual exploration of a knotty problem with the individual
student. He taught at all levels of the program, and supervised doctoral
research in building technology. As a resource for the inquisitive student,
he was available, literally, at any hour of the day or night.
In terms of extraordinary and selfless devotion of time and effort to
the advance of education and research in the College of Architecture and
Urban Planning, Professor Oberdick became a legend. In recognition of
his many contributions to the life of his College, in 1977 the Regents
named him to a distinguished professorship as Emil Lorch Professor of
Architecture.
The students and faculty of the College of Architecture and Urban
Planning are deeply grieved by the loss of their beloved friend, mentor
and colleague of thirty-four years. The Regents of the University now
also mourn the untimely passing of this devoted teacher and convey to his
family their heartfelt sympathies.

1981-82
Donor Pooled
Income Fund
Biological
Station Addition


The Regents unanimously approved the reappointment of
Price, Waterhouse and Company as auditors for 1981-82.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the audit report for the
Donor Pooled Income Fund for the year ending December 31,
1981, and the Regents accepted the report.
Regent Roach moved to approve the construction of a new
lecture hall at the Biological Station, Douglas Lake, and to
authorize the fund raising for the project, and to approve the
appointment of Charles W. Lane as the architect. Regent
Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted. The
project will not be released for bids until sufficient funds have
been identified, and will be brought back to the Regents for final
approval.


Renovations  Regent Nederlander moved approval to repair the ventilating
system in the surgery wing of University Hospital and to make
certain improvements to the hot water system at the Central
Power Plant. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Real Property  The request for authorization to sell the University's forty
acre Smiths Creek property, subject to an appraisal and the
reservation of mineral rights and realtor's commission was
moved by Regent Roach, seconded by Regent Nederlander, and
adopted.
The request for authorization to purchase a parcel of land
on Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan from the Detroit Edison
Company was deferred until March.

Regent Baker moved approval for the University of Michigan Hospitals to proceed with the proposed acquisition of the
Laboratory Computer System upgrade. Regent Power seconded
the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Power moved authorization to grant an option agreement to the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation to buy the University's East Court Street property in Flint. Regent Dunn
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Baker then mentioned the property which was under
consideration as a high technology park. He said he had some
reservations about it and had understood that the subject would
be returned to the Regents for discussion before any decision
was made.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff then described the property and
reviewed the limited partnership agreement which had been
transmitted to the Regents earlier.
Regent Baker asked for more specific information on all
those who would be involved in the project, the financial support
it would have, the control the University would have in the development of the property, and what, if any, guidelines would be
established.
Commenting on the partnership of the project, Regent Roach
said that a limited partner is liable only for the funds he committed to the project, and the University would have a voice in
the development of the property. In his view, the Regents' role in
encouraging the high technology industry to Michigan would be
a contribution to the economy of Michigan.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the Governor's recommendation deferring payment of the July, August, and September
appropriations to the University as a means of balancing the
State's budget by the end of the fiscal year. This would total
approximately $38,500,000 for the three campuses. If the
Governor's plan is implemented, the working capital needs of the
University would be met by borrowing unrestricted funds in the
investment pool. An appropriate interest rate to charge the general fund for the availability of these funds needs to be determined, but it is thought that the cost to the general fund will
approximate $1,800,000 for fiscal 1983.
Vice-President Kennedy indicated that the Governor's
recommendation would require two legislative actions: 1) the
introduction of a supplemental bill that would subtract the
fourth quarter appropriation, and 2) the inclusion in the 1982-83
appropriation bill language that would appropriate the lost
fourth quarter funds into the first quarter of the 1982-83 fiscal
year. He said there has been no action by the legislature to do
this at the present time.

FEBRUARY, 1982


Regent Power commented upon the current budget recommendations from the Executive Office of the Governor which
include the proposal that the State not pay to The University of
Michigan its fourth quarter appropriation of $38 million because
of the State's cash flow shortages. In effect, the University on its
own will have to borrow enough money to operate through the
end of the fiscal year. She seriously questioned the economic
forecast for the State Office of Management and Budget which
claims that the State would have enough tax revenues to pay
the University back next year.
She agreed that the basic question is simple: Will the economy of Michigan come back far enough and fast enough to get
the University out of hock without the terrible damage of delayed repayment or no repayment at all?
Against this, she set the pattern of support for the University
set by the State over the last ten years:
In 1970-71 the State of Michigan allocated $11.91 per
$1,000 in citizen personal income to higher education. At
that time, the State ranked twenty-first among the 50 in
state support to higher education. In 1981-82, the State of
Michigan provides $9.19 per $1,000 personal income to
higher education. That amount ranks thirty-seventh among
the states and is 15% less than the 10.60% national average.
Since 1974-75 state appropriations to The University of
Michigan-Ann Arbor have increased from $95.7 million
to $132.3 million. This represents an annual growth rate of
4.7% per year, far less than the 8.7% plus average rate of
inflation, or a sharp cut in real terms. In 1974-75 dollars, the
current appropriation is $40.3 million less than what it would
have been if inflationary adjustments only had been provided
by the State of Michigan.
Since 1974-75 tuition charges to an entering resident
freshperson have grown from $400 per term to $808 per
term. This represents an annual growth rate of 10.6% per
year. Had tuition increases been held to the rate of inflation,
1981-82 rates would have been $722, or nearly 11% less
than current amounts.
Since fiscal year 1974-75 the University's general salary
program has averaged increases of only 6.4% per year, or
2.4% per year less than the rate of inflation.
Over the past twenty months, four specific actions by
state government have resulted in reduced appropriations to
The University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Three Executive
Orders (1980-3, 1981-8, 1981-9) cut $10.2 million, and




FEBRUARY, 1982


237


the 1980-81 appropriation act provided $7.2 million less
than the reduced 1979-80 amount. Because of unfavorable
timing in reference to the University's fiscal year, the shortfall as a result of these four actions actually totals some
$20.4 million. The 1982 appropriations will total only
$439,000 more than the amount received in 1979-80, a mere
0.3% increase in two years.
Regent Power concluded her statement saying that the conclusion is inescapable: The State has failed to keep up even
with inflation in its support to The University of Michigan, let
alone increase support in real terms. In so doing, it is seriously
threatening the quality base of the University, tragically at
precisely the time that the University constitutes one of the few
state resources that can produce vitally needed jobs and diversification for our economy.
Regent Roach remarked that, in effect, for the state to meet
its constitutional mandate of operating without a deficit, they
are forcing the University to operate at a substantial deficit.
All the above actions were by unanimous vote unless otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of January totaled $1,330.55.
The Regents adjourned to meet on March 18 and 19, 1982.

MARCH MEETING, 1982
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, MARCH 18, 1982


The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Dunn,
Nederlander, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellors Jenkins
and Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger,
Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson and Vice-President
and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regents Brown and
Power were absent.
President Shapiro convened the meeting, calling on VicePresident Frye and his staff to review the minority enrollment
report.
Vice-President Frye commented that the emphasis of the
report differed this year by concentrating less on demographic
data and more on descriptions of unit efforts to enhance enrollment and retention.
Dr. Robert Holmes and Mr. George Goodman reviewed
the report in detail. Dr. Holmes stated each academic unit had
been requested to undertake specific reviews of their efforts to
recruit and retain minority students and to develop specific
plans to enhance those efforts where they were found to be
deficient. Dr. Holms described several of these unit activities
as well as the efforts of external groups aimed at improving
the University's capacity to attract and hold minority students.
In commenting on the data section of the report, Dr. Holmes
noted that minority enrollment increased on the three campuses
by more than 100 students. This increase was due primarily to
additional black students on the Dearborn campus and Asian
students at Ann Arbor. Black enrollment on the Ann Arbor
campus fell from 5.1% to 4.9% although total minority enrollment rose from 9.1% to 9.2%. Much of the decrease in black
enrollment occurred at the undergraduate level.
National data suggests that overall 40% of entering freshmen graduate in four years with an additional 20% graduating
eventually. At The University of Michigan about 45%  of
entering students graduate in four years while only 30% of the
black, hispanic and American indian students do so. 44%
of entering blacks do graduate within five years, however.


Minority Report

240


MARCH MEETING, 1982


Mr. Goodman commented on the University's difficulty in
attracting high quality out-of-state minority students. Much of
this is related to an inability to provide sufficient financial aid.
Overall, the pool of minority students is not growing yet there
is increasing competition for students in that pool. Programmatic efforts to increase that pool need to be enhanced.
While the University continues to provide the best financial
aid package for students in the state, increasing numbers of black
families are unable to commit family resources due to deteriorating economic conditions. Black students in the liberal arts
find job prospects discouraging yet they are concentrated in
those disciplines.
No one factor can be cited as the reason for the University's
inability to achieve its goals for minority enrollment. Efforts
must be continued, therefore, on a broad front to improve our
recruitment/retention performance.
Regent Baker inquired about the data which suggested that
the black student population had a higher proportion of females
than males which was the reverse of other student populations.
Mr. Goodman responded that this is a consistent national
pattern and is probably due to the fact that male students are
less likely to finish high school.
Associate Dean Eric Rabkin from the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, described the efforts of his school to
review the Center for the Utilization of Learning Skills to understand whether that program was aiding in the minority student
retention process. He outlined several recommendations which
were designed to improve the effectiveness of the Center. The
major thrust of the Center will be to build on the academic
strengths of minority students rather than trying to make up
for deficiencies in their academic background. He further described the work of the College's minority task force to improve
other aspects of the educational program for students.
Professor Billy Joe Evans described the Renaissance High
Project. Basically, the program involves a highly selective effort
to identify talented students at Renaissance High School in
Detroit, associating them with individual faculty members working on a specific research project and developing in those
students an appreciation for and a capacity to undertake true
scholarly activity. Subsequent enrollment at the University is
only a happy by-product. The program is continuing and will
involve students in other schools.
Vice-President Johnson observed that it is his hope that there
can be developed a more cohesive and coordinated effort in
making support services available to minority students.




MARCH MEETING, 1982


241


Regent Dunn noted that the University has supported a wide
variety of programs to address the minority student problem.
He wondered whether anything further could be done. Mr.
Goodman reaffirmed the need to coordinate support services and
provide flexibility for individual units to undertake projects like
that of Professor Evans. Further, the University must provide
incentives for individual faculty members to undertake efforts
in this area.
Regent Varner asked if the data collected by Professor
Donald Deskins on the location of minority undergraduates by
discipline had been disseminated. Dr. Holmes explained that
the data is just now being disseminated.
Regent Varner wondered if we have any better an idea
about the reasons why minority students leave the University.
Mr. Goodman responded that academic, financial, personal and
family problems persist as major reasons for leaving.
Regent Roach commented that he too was disappointed with
the data aspects of the report, but did not believe that was due
to any lack of effort. He was encouraged by the new initiatives
reported which give some basis for hope that longer term results
would certainly be forthcoming.
Regent Roach also commented on his concern for the
University's overall attrition rates.
President Shapiro then introduced a discussion on the status Budget and
of the 1982-83 budget. He noted that circumstances were 8Tuiion for
presently so unsettled at the state level that it may not be
possible to indicate tuition levels for the coming year at the
April meeting.
The President then noted several University budget elements,
in addition to the General Fund, which were being impacted by
external circumstances. He cited the Hospital and Medical
Service Plans in particular. Medicare and Medicaid programs
could affect these adversely. Similarly, research budgets may be
negatively impacted by changes in federal government policies.
On the national economic scene two factors bear watching.
The private sector of the economy is poised for a rather significant recovery. The current level of interest rates, however, if
continued, could have a very significant depressing impact on
the level and duration of this private sector recovery. These
interest rates apparently are being driven by current federal
economic policy.
Michigan's economic recovery should be quite substantial
assuming the national recovery gets underway. This will likely
not help the State's fiscal problems in the current year. The
State deficit for this year will likely be in the $500 million range.




242


MARCH MEETING, 1982


This would mean a 10% reduction in all sectors of the State
budget. Some State programs cannot absorb such a reduction.
Higher Education's reduction could therefore increase well above
the 10%  level. For the University this could mean a revenue
loss of $13 million to $20 million dollars. The only hope of
meeting such a loss could be a tax increase.
Vice-President Frye then decribed the kind of budget requirements that are presently being considered. The range of
alternatives have ranged from a best case assumption of 14%
State appropriation increase to a worst case of 0% increase.
On the expenditure side, fixed increases amount to $11.3
million which includes utility cost hikes of $4.1 million, staff
benefit increases of $2.9 million, $500,000 in new space costs,
$1.6-1.7 million for interests costs for fourth quarter borrowings,
$1 million in deferred costs and prior year commitments of
$1.2 million.
In addition, we could lose $3 million in tuition revenue from
enrollment loses. The budget plans all incorporate expected staff
reductions that would make available $5 million for reallocation.
In the worst case example, a 14% increase in tuition would
be necessary just to cover fixed cost increases. In the best case
without a tuition increase only $6 million would be available
for salary and programmatic improvement. Salaries continue to
be a priority because we continue to lose ground both to the
State civil service as well as to academic peers and industrial
competition.
Other high priority needs, including financial aid, bring the
total need for next year to $35 million.
We will need to hold tuition increases as much as possible
especially if federal student aid programs are cut.
The budget, therefore, is very uncertain and will require
resolution of many potential problems which are beyond the
University's control.
State support for higher education has been in steady decline
for more than a decade. Unless recovery can occur, Michigan
stands to lose significant elements of its once proud system of
higher education.
President Shapiro explained that the Governor's original
plan to defer fourth quarter payments for higher education is
now not possible. Instead those fourth quarter payments would
now become actual cuts. Those will not be restored until a
budget for the new year is passed including a provision to
replace those cuts.




MARCH MEETING, 1982


243


Vice-President Brinkerhoff described the potential impacts
on other University budgets if current economic circumstances
do not improve. The Medical Service Plans have been subjected
to reimbursement screens which have not been increased for
five years. If no relief occurs and Medicare and Medicaid cuts
occur, several plans may simply become untenable.
The Hospital could also be severely impacted by the proposed reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and other third party
reimbursers. This could, in turn, create a fiscal situation which
would call into question the hospital's capacity to support the
debt service necessary to cover the hospital's share of the cost
of the Replacement Hospital Project.
The State's fiscal situation could also prevent the State
Building Authority's capacity to sell the $140 million in bonds
which is crucial to the Replacement Project.
Finally, federal research funding, which requires cost sharing
by the University, is going to see some reduction in absolute
terms as well as some potential arbitrary cuts in indirect cost
recovery rates. Federal student aid cuts could seriously impact
enrollments.
President Shapiro noted that the likelihood of all of these
adverse circumstances coming to passis quite remote but they
are presented so that the Regents are aware of the potential
problems ahead.
Regent Roach commented that much of our present difficulty is attributable to the sharp decline in State support. Even
if economic recovery occurs, we will still not fully recover in
higher education. Tuition increases alone cannot solve the
problem. We may have to rethink our whole financial aid
policy to insure that the University continues to be available
to more than just rich students. It will also take enormous
imagination and innovation to maintain the traditional level of
quality that has always characterized the University.
Regent Varner wondered at what level of tuition increase
would the University lose its ability to attract a cross section
of students. It was noted that there was no easy answer to that
question since it depended heavily on other factors such as the
availability of financial aid.
Regent Nederlander commented that students were going to
have to depend on more jobs in order to support the costs of
attending college.
The Regents then heard comments from the following in- Public Comments
dividuals on the topics indicated: Jean Ramsay, Associate Professor of Management, Western Michigan University, Judith
Elkin, Associate Director, Great Lakes Colleges, Jane Schultz,

FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 1982
The Regents met at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Dunn, Nederlander, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellors Jenkins and
Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger,
Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson and Vice-President
and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regents Brown and
Power were absent.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order.
Tappan Hall  Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that Carl Johnson of
Addition Johnson, Johnson and Roy would discuss further with the
members of the Board the Tappan Hall addition and the overall
plans for the development of Ingalls Mall.
Mr. Johnson described the Tappan Hall addition which will
be erected between the President's House and the Museum of
Art. He noted that the facade would fit in architecturally as well
as aesthetically within the proposed space and would not detract
from the focal point on South University, which is the President's
House.
Ingalls Mall  Mr. Johnson then spoke on the development of Ingalls Mall
which will extend from the Graduate Library to the Rackham
Building. In his view, this area would become one of the most
important places on campus, and it was his plan to treat it with
dignity and simplicity.
Mr. Frederick Mayer, University Planner, described the
dvelopment of the area between the Alumni Center and the
Michigan League. He cited visibility, vehicular arrival, pedestrian
circulation, and development of an attractive landscape forecourt for the two buildings as the major concerns which were
taken into consideration.
I. MINUTES
The minutes of the meeting of February 18 and 19, 1982
were incomplete, therefore, were held over until the March
meeting.

and Director of Administration. In 1953 he brought this substantial and
rounded experience to Michigan as Director of the University Library
and Professor of Library Science.
A life member of the American Library Association, Professor
Wagman has served that organization as president and as member of
Council, as well as in many other offices. A member of the Michigan
Library Association from the time of his arrival in the state and later
its president, he was honored as Michigan's "Librarian of the Year" in
1970. He was a pioneer in the development of the monumental National
Union Catalog of the Library of Congress; he was the first president of
the Midwest Region Library Network (MIDLNET); he was appointed
by President Johnson to serve as vice-chairman of the Commission on
Obscenity and Pornography; he has held numerous offices in the Association of Research Libraries; and he has long been a director of the
Council on Library Resources. In the world of librarianship he has been
creative, influential, and honored.
As Director of the University Library he was supportive of the
School, encouraging a cooperative and helpful relationship between
library science students and faculty and staff of the University Library.
During these years Professor Wagman was also an active member of the
School's faculty, serving on its commitees, providing valued counsel and
assistance, and regularly offering a seminar in university library administration which students received with enthusiasm and appreciation.
Following his retirement as Director of the Library, Professor
Wagman has taught a variety of courses with unusual effectiveness, earning the respect and affection of students and colleagues. Both as Director
of the University Library and as a member of the faculty of the School
of Library Science, Professor Wagman has been a mentor and support,
gladly sharing his experience and readily offering his wisdom. He has
been a superior teacher and an invaluable resource.
The Regents now salute this distinguished professor by naming him
Professor Emeritus of Library Science.

1982 Commencement exercises.
IX. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that the twelve-month Investment
review of investment programs had been discussed at the  Report
February meeting. The responses to the questions posed by the
Regents were included in this agenda along with the recommendations.
With respect to the first recommendation-investment in
the Common Fund for Equities, Vice-President Brinkerhoff
remarked that the equities from this fund have outperformed the
University's portfolio in practically each of the last ten years.
Noting that there was some risk involved in this type of
investment, Regent Baker commented that the additional return
anticipated would compensate for this risk.
Regent Dunn moved authorization to invest a portion of the
University's endowment funds in the Common Fund for Equities,
not to exceed 5% of the common stock holdings of the portfolios; for the Consolidated Endowment up to $1,500,000,




260


MARCH MEETING, 1982


Master List of
Common Stocks,
additions to


Rackham Endowment up to $535,000, and Fund Functioning
as Endowment up to $1,335,000 based on December 31, 1981
market values. Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Mr. Norman Herbert briefly discussed the recommended
additions to the University's Master List of Common Stocks, and
assured the Regents that none of the companies were doing
business in South Africa. In response to the question of the
National Bank of Detroit's common stock holdings, Mr. Herbert
said that the policy of the bank was that they may not hold in
total more than 10% of any company's outstanding shares.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve the following additions to the Master List of Common Stocks: Angelica Corporation: Barry Wright; Betz Laboratories; Bowne & Company;
Brown-Forman Distillers; Cessna Aircraft; Commerce Clearing
House; A. T. Cross Company; Cubic Corporation; Fort Howard
Paper; H. B. Fuller Company; Herman Miller; Lifemark Corporation; Mercantile Texas Corporation; NL Industries; Nordstrom, Inc.; Noxell Corporation; Overnite Transportation; Payless Cashways; Quanex Corporation; Rubbermaid, Inc.; Sanders
Associates; Southwest Airlines; Super Valu Stores; Texas Commerce Bancshares; Worthington Industries; and Zero Corporation. The University's purchase of stocks used by the National
Bank of Detroit in its Opportunity Fund would be limited to 5 %
at market value of the portfolio's common stock holdings.
Regent Baker seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The fee for the Options Writing Program, Mr. Herbert
indicated, would recognize the more intensive surveilance and
monitoring that would be required of the National Bank of
Detroit. To make the Regents more at ease with respect to the
South Africa investments issue, the University will review NBD's
list of securities subject to the options writing program to verify
that the issuing companies are in compliance with the Regents'
Resolution on South Africa. This would limit the opportunities
for incremental return, but it would still be a viable program.
Regent Baker moved to authorize (1) an options writing
program (Buy-Write Program, Internal Overwrite Program,
Protective Put Purchase Program) for the University endowment
portfolios (2) for the Buy-Write Program, up to 10% of the
market value of the endowment portfolios with the initial funding
not to exceed $2,500,000 for Consolidated, $750,000 for Rackham, and $2,250,000 for Fund Functioning as Endowment; (3)
NBD to enter into an option transaction without prior approval
of the authorized University officers; and (4) the Buy-Write
Program common stocks not to be limited to the University's
Master List of Common Stocks, subject to compliance, however,




MARCH MEETING, 1982


261


with the Regents' policy on South Africa. Regent Dunn seconded
the motion and it was adopted.
The Regents then discussed the real estate limited partnership program, specifically the Endowment and Foundation
Realty Partnership-JMB I, the recommended percentage of the
total investments at market value of the University's endowment
funds to be committed for this purpose, the lack of liquidity in
real estate investment, and the expected cash flow return from the
income generated by these projects.
Mr. Herbert indicated that the National Bank of Detroit
recommended the program. The University's General Counsel
considered the program a prudent investment, and would not be
subject to any unrelated business income tax.
Regent Dunn expressed the opinion that the 10% limit of
the total endowment funds was too high and suggested 5%
instead. He asked if this would cause any problems.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff stated that a 5 % limit would be
acceptable at this time. Adjustments to the percentage could
be considered annually.
Regent Dunn moved to authorize real estate investments
through partnerships or commingled funds up to a limit of 5%
of the total investments at market value of the University's
endowment funds, and authorization for the University to invest
$1,000,000 in the Endowment and Foundation Realty Partnership-JMB I with funding of $460,000 for Consolidated endowment fund, $140,000 for Rackham endowment fund, and
$400,000 for Fund Functioning as Endowment fund. Regent
Varner seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Mr. Herbert then reviewed the report on investments in Investments in
South Africa. He noted that the Investor Responsibility Research  South Africa
Center (IRRC) and Arthur D. Little, Inc., consulting firm, both
indicated that significant progress in the areas of desegregation
of facilities, equalization of employee benefits and pay for equal
work at American-owned businesses in South Africa has been
made.
There was discussion concerning those companies that did
not meet recently added basic requirements to the Sullivan Principles guidelines. Mr. Herbert said that in most of those instances companies failed to either pay a membership fee to the
National African Federated Chamber of Commerce or didn't
significantly improve activities over the past year due to constraints imposed by the limited size of their South African
operation.
Regent Varner commented that the University was failing to
meet its objectives of promoting political, economic and social




262


MARCH MEETING, 1982


rights in South Africa by continuing to invest in companies who
have not endorsed the Sullivan Principles. Owens-Corning, for
instance, does not have a management role in South Africa,
but does supply technology and production expertise. Therefore,
in Regent Vamer's view, by not endorsing the Sullivan Principles, the company was endorsing that racial regime. She
suggested that the University should discontinue investing in
any company who has not endorsed the Principles.
Regent Waters indicated that he understood Owens-Corning
had no employees in South Africa, but that should not prevent
them from supporting, in writing, the Sullivan Principles. He
suggested that another visit be made to the company to again
determine their position.
President Shapiro said Owens-Corning will be visited again
to ascertain their stand on this issue even though, in their view,
they do not have any influence in South Africa. A report will be
presented to the Regents in May.
The Regents received a semi-annual report of the University
Hospitals accounts receivable.
Regent Nederlander moved approval to proceed with the
parking systems annual maintenance program and the window
replacements at Observatory Lodge. Regent Dunn seconded the
motion and it was adopted.

Construction  Regent Dunn moved authorization to award a contract to the

West Loop Road low bidder, Ajax Paving Industries, Inc., Brighton, Michigan
for the construction of the West Loop Road. Regent Waters
seconded the motion and it was adopted with Regent Roach
abstaining from the discussion and the vote.
Renovation  Regent Nederlander moved authorization to award a contract to the low bidder, Walter L. Couse and Company of
Detroit, for the renovation of the top three floors of the 300 North
Ingalls Building. Regent Dunn seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
RHP, Bid   Regent Dunn moved to approve awarding a construction
ackage #7 contract to the low bidder, Jeffress-Dyer, Inc., Ann Arbor,
Michigan, for the general construction component of Bid Package #7, Thermal Storage Basin/CPH Play Area for the Replacement Hospita Project. Regent Waters seconded the motion
and it was adopted.
RHP, Bid   Regent Nederander moved approval to award a procurement
Package 10 contract to the low bidder, Madison Electric Co., Inc., Ann
Arbor, Michigan, for the supply of luminaries and poles for the
Replacement Hospital Project and related medical campus areas,
Bid Package #10. Regent Dunn seconded the motion and it
was adopted.




MARCH MEETING, 1982

Speaking of the status of the budget for the Flint campus, Budget Sus
Chancellor Nelson said that UM-Flint is in a strong defensive Flint
position. There will be, however, an additional 4% to 5%
unavoidable cost increase to accommodate utilities, fringe benefits and the opening of the new recreation building. Assuming
the appropriation for 1982-83 does not change, a tuition increase of 10% to 15% would take care of those costs.
Chancellor Nelson indicated that it was their expectation
that enrollments would continue to rise as they have over the
last few years because of program growth and low tuition costs.
Through prudent budget practices, a 5% general fund cash reserve has been accumulated for the problems ahead, and a 5%
flexibility fund is being planned in next year's budget.
Chancellor Jenkins commented that the Dearborn campus Budget Status,
1982-83, UMis facing a great number of unknowns. He indicated that they Dearborn
have almost completed another budget reduction of $500,000.
Automatic increases amounting to $775,000 and $150,000 in
discretionary but high priority items in addition to salary increase must be accommodated in this budget. With an increase in
tuition and a reduction in financial aid, predicting enrollment
will be very difficult. The Dearborn campus has been unable to
accept all applicants for lack of facilities and support services
for the students.
Regent Baker read the following Regents' Resolution:
The Regents wish to take this opportunity to extend their D. M. Mangus
grateful thanks and warm appreciation to Dorothy M. Mangus
as she concludes a thirty-nine year career of service to the
University.
For twenty-one of these years Miss Mangus has been
Secretary to the President. In that capacity, she has served and
guided four presidents of the University with unerring skill and
unselfish dedication. Her quiet charm and grace, her enormous
efficiency have been the marks of her entire tenure. The warm
smile and unending patience with which Miss Mangus greeted
each visitor irrespective of the visitors demeanor, was the hallmark of the President's Office which must be emulated.
The Regents now extend to Dorothy M. Mangus their highest
commendations and best wishes on the occasion of her retirement. In so doing they recognize with gratitude that she stands
as a true model for the profession which she has so ably
represented.
Miss Mangus thanked the Regents and said she was overwhelmed and most appreciative for the resolution and the
Regents good wishes.

MARCH MEETING, 1982


Real Property  Vice-President Brinkerhoff remarked that he would like the
Board, if willing, to act upon the property purchase item that was
deferred in February. He referred to the property owned by
Detroit Edison in the Fuller field area, and indicated that the
other potential arrangements to acquire the land were not
successful.
Regent Nederlander then moved to authorize the purchase
of the vacant parcel of land on Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan from The Detroit Edison Company at a price of $44,500.
Regent Waters seconded the motion and it was adopted.
All the above actions were by unanimous vote unless otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of February totaled $421.09.
The Regents adjourned to meet April 15 and 16, 1982.

APRIL MEETING, 1982
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, APRIL 15, 1982
The Regents met at 1: 00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Power, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellors Jenkins and
Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger,
Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson, and Vice-President
and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent Nederlander
was absent.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order and asked for Public Comments
and received approval to extend the public comments session esson exten
one-half hour, commencing at 3:30 p.m., because of the unsually high number of requests for participation.
Professor Ronald Teigen, Chairman of the Committee on  CESF Report
the Econimic Status of the Faculty (CESF), delivered the report by that committee and spoke of the deterioration of the
faculty salary program over the last several years at The University of Michigan. This has resulted in serious consequences
and implications for faculty morale, productivity, teaching effort,
and the future quality of the University. He said there is a widespread perception among the faculty that "merit" has become
"marketability"-if a person has an offer elsewhere, their value
is considered greater here. This strategy leaves little resources
left for the broad range of valuable, productive, and deserving
faculty to obtain a merit increase.
If quality is to be maintained, CESF believes that merit must
be rewarded. To solve this problem perhaps new sources of
funding could be developed, such as a more aggressive approach
to private sources, in order to support an adequate salary program on a continuing basis. Professor Teigen said that whether
the University becomes "smaller, but better" or just "smaller,"
depends upon the willingness and ability of the University to
maintain an appropriate balance between size and quality which
may require augmenting available levels of resources.
It is hoped that the internal review which is presently taking
place will result in a substantial shift of resources within the
University.
Professor Teigen indicated that next year's salary program
should be large enough to allow a small increase in real income.
267




268


APRIL MEETING, 1982


The faculty does not expect the entire salary deficiency to be
rectified in one year, or even in two or three years. It would be
encouraging, however, to see positive progress in this area.
President Shapiro spoke to the issue raised concerning University response to external offers. The central administration
does not suggest, recommend, or encourage any school or unit
to follow such a policy; it would be a disaster to do so. President Shapiro agreed with the key message of the CESF report,
namely, major steps must be taken over the next few years with
respect to the salary program in order to sustain the quality of
the faculty.
In response to Regent Roach's question concerning the
central administration's role in the salary policy, President
Shapiro indicated it was a very modest role. Other than approving special cases, it is the responsibility of the deans and the
chairmen to determine how general fund money is distributed.
Vice-President Frye elaborated further indicating that in
discussions with the deans, the administration emphasizes merit
rather than across-the-board increases. Marketability, as perceived by the faculty, has never been a part of the budget discussions. The mistaken perception most likely arose from: (1)
equity adjustments made in order just to retain faculty in certain fields where the external market outside of academia is
competing very heavily with the University, (2) a few cases
where some individuals did receive some adjustment in response
to an offer and these became widely known and therefore
generalized, and (3) inappropriate remarks about the importance of the market that were distorted in the press and were taken
as reflecting University policy.
President Shapiro indicated that the slippage in the salary
program has been significant over the last decade. The problem
is a very real one and should receive the full attention of the
administration in future years.
Health Service  Vice-President Johnson commented that last year the Regents
Fee approved a student fee of $47.00 per term to establish the Health
Service as a prepaid service. In turn, it was agreed to reduce
major overhead expenses, manpower, and system support for
the billing operation. He said he believes that has been accomplished, and in fact, has exceeded the amount to which they
agreed. Health Service has also realized substantial savings in
other areas of their operations as well.
He then introduced Dr. Caesar Briefer, Director of Health
Service, who showed slides supporting the above statements and
supporting the request for an additional $2.00 per student per
term for the 1982-83 budget.




APRIL MEETING, 1982


269


Dr. Briefer stated that utilization of health service has remained about the same as last year, which responded to the concern that the prepaid service would result in overuse of the
facility. Patient satisfaction has increased substantially. The
reorganization within the framework of the Health Service has
resulted in some financial savings. Since health costs have become very difficult to control, the relatively small budget increases for the last two years have been quite an accomplishment.
This has been done without sacrificing the quality or quantity of
the services offered.
Regent Roach mentioned the study that the Regents had
requested concerning excusing certain students from paying the
fee. Mr. Easthope said a committee has been meeting on this
issue and will have a report within th next few weeks.
Regent Roach commented that the committee recommendation might have a budgetary impact upon the Health Service. He
asked if there was an urgency to approve this budget at this
time, or could it be delayed until the final report is submitted.
President Shapiro recommended that if that was the only
reservation, the budget should be approved at this time. The
issue involved in excusing certain students from paying the fee
is very complex. The University has many areas where services
are not charged directly to the user, but to everybody. The
principle involved cannot be easily or quickly resolved.
There was further discussion concerning the issue of having
to pay for the coverage of two health care policies. It was
explained that there is a certain amount of overlap, but the
fundamental difference is between ambulatory care and inpatient
care.
Regent Power moved to authorize an increase in the prepaid
student fee of $2.00 per student per term for Health Service for
1982-83. The motion was seconded by Regent Dunn and
adopted.
Dr. Jeptha Dalston, Director of University Hospitals, introduced the next issue, the helicopter emergency medical service
program. He indicated that it was a program integral to the
mission of the Hospital and very important to its operation.
Mr. Edward Schwartz, Senior Associate Director, University Hospitals, commented that both the regional and state health
planning groups encouraged University Hospital administration
to become a more tertiary care facility to care for a greater percent of critically ill or injured patients. A number of programs
were studied including a growing enterprise in the country of
hospital based air transport via helicopter. The program would
be staffed by physicians and nurses to provide skilled care while

APRIL MEETING, 1982


transferring critically ill patients from outlying hospitals, or to
arrive at the scene of the trauma to begin first aid and accomplish transport at the same time. The program would also provide access to the specialized services available at University
Hospitals to more people in Michigan.
Mr. Schwartz discussed the cost of the program and the
estimated number of increased inpatient days. The discussion
continued with respect to the justification of this expenditure in
view of the severe problems the University is facing, the point
at which the program might reach the break-even stage, the timing of the program, and the opportunity the program would
provide for the Hospital to participate in training programs for
ambulance company employees in the more remote areas of the
State.
President Shapiro indicated that a program that would meet
the financial needs of the Hospital, provide primary and tertiary
care, put together a profile of the patients which satisfy all of
those criteria, and meet the needs of a very large medical school
is a very complicated process. There would be some risk, but
some new initiatives must be taken to be able to satisfy a
diversified patient profile.
Regent Roach was concerned about the loss of approximately $300,000 that would have to be absorbed somehow in the
first year. He asked if the project could be delayed a year. Mr.
Schwartz responded that there was a great advantage of having
the first opportunity to present the case for this service in the
Certificate of Need process. Regent Roach then asked if a
favorable response was received must the program be implemented immediately. Mr. Schwartz said the license would be
good for one year. He also indicated that the Hospital Board,
the Regents and the executive officers would be kept informed
and if the program proves to be wrong for the Hospital, a
recommendation to abandon the proposal would be made.
Regent Baker remarked that a positive factor would be the
increment to the overall budget by the increase in bed use.
Regent Power indicated that this program could be the
means of increasing the access of the citizens of the entire State
of Michigan to our first-rate tertiary care hospital. She hoped
the program would be developed carefully and documented fully
so that this program could become part of the special story of
University Hospital being communicated to the people of the
State, and which she viewed as an especially important kind of
new outreach during this period when many hospital services
are negatively impacted upon by the replacement hospital
construction.




APRIL MEETING, 1982


271;


Regent Dunn moved to approve the helicopter emergency
medical services program for implementation upon receipt of an
approved Certificate of Need. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted with Regent Roach voting no.
Dr. Dalston, Mr. Schwartz, and Mr. Midyette reviewed the
Hospitals operating budget for 1982-83. They indicated that
the budget was consistent with the mission of the Hospitals, the
Replacement Hospital Project Certificate of Need stipulations,
and the requirements in patient volume forecast. The percent
and dollar amount of rate increases has been pared down and
the proposed salary program is sensitive to the University as a
whole and at the same time will enable the Hospital to be competitive within the State to keep quality staff. The budget also
incorporates cuts relating to the predicted shortfall in medicaid
expenditures for next year.
The Regents discussed the proposed room rate increase.
President Shapiro said the data indicates that University Hospital room charges are higher than other hospitals in the area,
however, many of the charges included in the University Hospitals rate are put into ancillary service charges in other hospitals.
Regent Dunn moved approval of the proposed 1982-83
University of Michigan Hospitals operating budget, including a
daily service rate increase averaging $38.00, effective July 1,
1982. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The Regents then heard comments from the following individuals on the topics indicated: Greg Buzzard, graduate student, on mandatory support of Michigan Student Assembly;
Richard Rice, Daniel Schnee and Wendy O'Neil, students, on
the School of Natural Resources review; Tom Marx, student, on
the importance of School of Natural Resources from an LSA
student's perspective; Raphael Ezekiel, Associate Professor of
Psychology, on the reviews of the Schools of Art and Natural
Resources; Carolyn Matthews, member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, on the Department of
Defense research; Asim Varma, representing PIRGIM, on the
Nestle Boycott resolution; LeRoy Washington, University employee, on affirmative action; Paul Fleuranges and Michael
Sudarkasa, students, on the Black Student Union; Kathy Hartrick,
MSA, on hazing; Heather, student on the School of Art review,
Jon Feiger, student, on student needs in the redirection process;
Joel Epstein, student, on budget cuts and the redirection of the
University; Bret Eynon, student, on research policies at the
University; and Elizabeth Galst, student, on Military research.
The meeting was recessed.

The Regents reconvened at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Power, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellors Jenkins and
Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger,
Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson and Vice-President
and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent Nederlander
was absent.
President Shapiro reconvened the meeting and stated that
immediately following the meeting one-half hour would be devoted to a public comments session which had been requested
by the students the previous day. He then introduced Jonathan
Feiger, the outgoing president of Michigan Student Assembly.
Jonathan Feiger introduced the newly elected officers of
MSA: Amy Moore, President, James Flaum, Treasurer, and
Stephen Johnson, Vice President. The Treasurer spoke briefly
on the financial status of MSA. He indicated that the transition
had gone smoothly. He said that one of MSA's objectives this
year was to develop new procedures which might help to reduce
expenses.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the monthly executive
report on the Replacement Hospital Project, and noted with
concern the architect's delay in certain areas. He said that every
effort was being made to bring this phase back on schedule.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff then reviewed the bids for the
thirteen components of Bid Package #8 Building Enclosure. He
commented upon the narrow margin between the low bidder, a
Canadian firm, and the second low bidder, a Michigan firm, for
the precast concrete panels. The decision to recommend the
Canadian firm was based upon the University's policy to accept
the lowest bid provided all specifications were met. He noted
that there was some concern about whether the Michigan firm's
bid would meet all the specifications, but this question was not
fully evaluated as the Michigan firm was not the low bidder.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff stated that approximately 40% of
the bid cost, however, would be expended by Michigan labor.
Regent Baker asked if there was a legal obligation for the
University to award a contract to the low bidder. He felt that
the State of Michigan should be afforded every possible opportunity to bolster its weakened economy. Surely there were other
Michigan companies that could meet specifications.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff responded that the University
did not specify when the bids were let that the materials should
be provided by an in-country or in-state firm. Assuming speci



APRIL MEETING, 1982


273


fications were met, there was an obligation to accept low bids,
unless the Regents wished to change that policy.
Although the Regents, in a legal sense, are not necessarily
bound by state policy because of their constitutional autonomy,
President Shapiro indicated that it was state policy to accept low
bids. The state is funding the project at a signficant level; therefore, it is to their advantage that the low-bid policy be followed.
Aside from that, the President indicated that he believed it was
extremely important for the success of the entire project to
maintain the integrity of the bidding process and the bidding
environment. The University has an obligation to the consumers
of health care in Michigan to build this facility at the lowest
possible cost consistent with the performance that the Hospital
must achieve. It is a serious and very difficult problem, but
the administration felt that these two issues, low cost and the
integrity of the bidding process, would best serve the long-run
interests of the University.
President Shapiro also mentiond that since Michigan is a
major export state, it would be self-defeating if the state bidding
policy was not open to national and international companies.
Regent Roach agreed that it was very important to preserve
the integrity of the bidding process. These firms have spent a
considerable amount of time and money preparing their bids. It
would be poor policy to disqualify them at this stage because
they were out-of-state. If there is to be any deviation from this
practice, it should be stated in advance.
Regent Power inquired about the two recommendations for
the window components of the bid package. One was awarded
to an out-of-state company. Vice-President Brinkerhoff explained
that the Wisconsin company specialized in curved glass which
was to be used on the corridor wall on the ground level. All
other windows would be provided by Michigan companies.
Regent Brown expressed concern about the second low bid of
the Gerace Construction Company. If the bid was unacceptable in
that it did not meet specifications, why was it presented to the
Board? If the Michigan company did, indeed, qualify then he felt
that because of the marginal difference between the two bids, the
matter should be pursued further.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff responded that since the Michigan firm was not the low bidder and because of the shortness
of the time in which an evaluation had to be made, the technical
point was not pursued. Had the Michigan firm been the low bidder there would have been a more detailed evaluation. VicePresident Brinkerhoff said he understood the point, however, and
would be careful to omit these bids in the future.




274


APRIL MEETING, 1982


Regent Roach moved to award the thirteen construction
contracts, as recommended. Regent Power seconded the motion.
The motion failed with Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn, Varner,
and Waters voting no.
President Shapiro asked if there were any concerns other
than the bid package for the precast cement panels. If not, perhaps the Board would be willing to vote on each component
separately and then return to the panel component for further
discussion.
Regent Dunn indicated that the roofing recommendation
troubled him. The difference between the low bid, by an out-ofstate firm, and the second low bid, by an in-state firm, was considerable. He wondered why the bids of the Michigan firms were
so much higher.
President Shapiro stated that he would take each component
separately. He said that in his judgment, if the low bidder was
not approved the University would lose a sense of discipline on
this project that would be very costly. It would be much more
difficult for the executive officers to manage the project and to
bring it in under budgt, which is their major concern.
In response to Regent Baker's question concerning the
scheduling of the work, Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated
that all of these components are very tightly integrated in order
to maximize the use of the expensive equipment and to provide
the most economical method of construction.
President Shapiro commented that the Regents had made a
very difficult decision with respect to the steel contract. To the
executive officers, this was a strong indication that the Regents
wished to adhere to the low-bid policy. It would be very difficult
to change that policy with respect to these bids. If it is the desire
of the Regents to change that policy for all subsequent bids, the
administration would comply. President Shapiro reiterated the
seriousness of the matter and expressed the hope that the
Regents would not change their policy in the context of the
action item currently on the agenda.
Regent Baker then asked to recess for five minutes for
consultation with his colleagues.
President Shapiro reconvened the meeting. In view of what
he believed to be an extremely important policy issue which will
impact greatly on the long-run interests of the University, the
State, and the taxpayers, President Shapiro said he would like
to take the unusual position of requesting the Board to reflect
upon the previous motion and vote for reconsideration. The
University was granted permission to proceed with the Replacement Hospital only after the administration agreed to deliver a




APRIL MEETING, 1982


275


health care facility for as low a cost as possible. Although the
cement panels would be precast in Canada, almost one-half of
the cost would be used for Michigan labor. President Shapiro
reiterated his belief that it would not be appropriate to deviate
from the policy at this time. He then asked if the Board wished
to vote for reconsideration of the motion. If so, a motion from
a dissenting member would be required.
Regent Waters moved to reconsider the previous motion
with the understanding that the administration would propose
a modification to the bidding policy which would consider
preference for Michigan firms to be presented to the Regents
for their review. Regent Varner seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Regent Baker observed that he respected the President's
judgment concerning the difficult position in which the administration would be placed. There was also the matter of probable
litigation against the University if the low bid was not accepted.
The administration, however, must eliminate unqalified bidders
from the list to prevent such complications.
President Shapiro then called for the vote on the original
motion by Regent Roach to award the thirteen construction contracts, as recommended and seconded by Regent Power. The
motion was adopted with Regent Dunn voting no.
Regents Dunn and Power requested that the architect and
construction manager attend the Regents' meeting in May to
respond to questions concerning the slippage in the schedule and
the inclusion of an unacceptable bid in the agenda.
Regent Roach asked for information regarding the nature
of business practices among several states, and the extent to
which Michigan firms do business out-of-state. He indicated that
other policy considerations must be reviewed before a decision
is made to establish a bidding preference policy.
In response to Regent Varner's remarks with respect to the
lack of minority bidders, Vice President Brinkerhoff said that
several companies had been contacted a number of times. Special meetings were held for minority and small business firms and
these meetings were followed up with telephone calls. In most
cases there was no response, or the firms declined to bid. Some
of the firms, however, did bid as sub to one of the other bidders.
Regent Varner indicated that she could understand the lack
of response if the bond amount to be posted was over a certain
figure, but some of the components of this particular package
were at a reasonable level.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff mentioned that the University
encourages bidding by minority and small business firms either




276


APRIL MEETING, 1982


in terms of participating with a larger contractor or doing it on
their own. There are also minority employment requirements
with respect to contractors that are on the job. He said the
University would appreciate any assistance that Regent Varner
could provide in this matter.
Ambulatorty  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the status of the ambulatory care facility. It was felt that the retention of a construction manager at the design phase, which is currently underway,
would be helpful. The fiscal planning of the facility will determine the method of construction-fast-track or multiple contract. For many reasons, including the effectiveness of combining
the supervision, the tightness of the site and the appropriateness
of having a single construction site versus fenced-off sections,
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated the preference that BartonMalow/CM, Inc. be requested to provide this service.
President Shapiro commented that there would be further
discussion with respect to the contracting strategy and the construction manager issue before any action was requested.
North Ingalls  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the amendment to the
Building and
RHP Bond Series A bond anticipation notes which had been approved
Anticiptitn earlier, for the North Ingalls Building and Replacement Hospital
Project, and the Series B bond anticipation notes for the Replacement Hospital program.
After discussion, Regent Dunn moved to approve: (1) the
resolution amending the resolution authorizing the Series A
notes to conform the security provisions thereof with respect to
the adjusted gross revenues of the Hospital to the security provisions of the resolution authorizing the Series B notes; and (2)
the resolution authorizing and approving the issuance and sale
of the Regents of The University of Michigan, Hospital revenue
and bond anticipation notes (Replacement Hospital Program),
Series B in the principal amount of $45,325,000 approving the
form of the Official Statement, the note purchase agreement
and authorizing certain officers to executive those documents,
and authorizing certain officers to execute the notes and any
other documentation necessary, expedient or proper in connection with the issuance, sale and delivery of the notes. Regent
Waters seconded the motion and it was adopted with Regent
Baker voting no. Regent Baker said that he did not feel it was
appropriate to pledge student fees for this purpose. The resolutions appear as Appendix A and B respectively to these minutes.
Audit Report  Mr. Carl Smith, interim director of University Audits, reviewed the six-months report. He mentioned the continuing
concern about adequate internal controls for on-line data base
systems and the adequacy of control of the various charge sys



APRIL MEETING, 1982


277


tems within the University Hospital. After further discussion
the Regents received the report.
President Shapiro stated that there was no budget report in    Budget Report
this agenda because there have been no new developments. The
biggest uncertainty is still the state's fiscal situation. Because of
this uncertainty, it is impossible to recommend a tuition range
for 1982-83 at this time. The current executive order would
defer $22 million from the University's appropriation (all three
campuses), but notes that it will be paid in the next fiscal
year. Whether repayment will be made or not, the University
must consider the appropriations for the next two years as a
whole in order to effectively build a budget.
Regent Power commented that this is the first time in a
decade that the University has been unable to set a tuition range
before the students left campus for the summer.
I. MINUTES
The minutes of the meeting of February 18 and 19, 1982
and March 18 and 19, 1982 were approved.

Vice-President Brinkerhoff placed on file his monthly reports

filed a report on non-competitive purchases over $1,000 from

Vice-President Overberger filed a monthly report on grants
and contracts for research.
Acting Vice-President Jacobson filed a report on the Office

APRIL MEETING, 1982


287


The Regents express their heartfelt sorrow at the sudden loss of  w. c. Grabb
William C. Grabb, M.D. who died on March 31, 1982 at the age of 53. Memorial
Dr. Grabb earned his A.B. degree at Michigan State University in  Statement
1949, and his medical degree from the University of Michigan School of
Medicine in 1953. Except for an internship year at Ohio State University
Hospital, Dr. Grabb completed all of his general surgical and plastic
surgery training at The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor where he
practiced for his entire career.
Dr. Grabb became a noted author of four textbooks, including
Plastic Surgery-A Concise Guide to Clinical Practice, which has been
generrally regarded as the primary text of the specialty and is now in its
3rd edition.
Dr. Grabb won three national research awards for his scientific
investigations, two from the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, and one from the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.
At the time of his death he was deeply involved in primary research for
the cause and treatment of port-wine hemangiomas, disfiguring red birthmarks currently of unknown etiology.
He was co-editor of the Cleft Palate Journal from 1969-1973, and
Associate Editor of the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Journal. He
held leading positions in every national professional plastic surgery organization at various times in his career, and was Chairman of the Examination Committee of the American Board of Plastic Surgery at the time
of his death.
As a plastic and reconstructive surgeon Dr. Grabb was recognized
for his expert treatment of cleft lip and palate, hand surgery, reconstructive, and aesthetic surgery. His scientific publications exceeded 50.
Dr. Grabb's imaginative and persistent fund raising efforts led to the
establishment of the F. Roland Sargent Plastic Surgery Research Laboratory, which he considered as a primary achievement during his tenure as
Head of the Section (1977-1982). In recognition of this, and to perpetuate
his work, the William C. Grabb Plastic Surgery Research Fund as been
created by the Department of Surgery.
John A. Gronvall, M.D., Dean of the University of Michigan School
of Medicine called Dr. Grabb's death "a tragic loss to the medical profession and the University." "Dr. Grabb was a gentleman, always
concerned for the welfare of others, and a superb surgeon with exceptional
skill and knowledge. He made major contributions to the field of plastic
surgery and will be greatly missed both as a man and a physician."
The Regents, honoring Dr. Grabb's service to his profession,
colleagues, and students, join the entire University community in
mourning his death and extend deep sympathy to his family and friends.

(REPLACEMENT HOSPITAL PROGRAM), SERIES B
$5,000                                            N o.....................
The Regents of the University of Michigan, a body corporate created
by and existing under the Constitution of the State of Michigan (hereinafter sometimes called the "University") for value received, promises to

until maturity, at the rate of  percent (  %) per annum, payable
on October 1, 1982, and semiannually thereafter on the first day of
April and October of each year, upon presentation and surrender of the
proper interest coupons hereto annexed as they severally become due.
Both principal of and interest on this Note are payable in lawful money
of the United States of America at the principal office of National Bank
of Detroit, Detroit, Michigan (the "Trustee") or (except for principal if
this Note be registered as to principal) at the option of the holder, at the
principal office of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, New York,
New York.
In any case where the date of maturity of interest on or principal of
the Notes or the date fixed for prepayment of any Notes shall be a
Sunday or a legal holiday or a day on which banking institutions are
authorized by law to close in the city in which the Trustee is located, the
payment of interest or principal may be made on the next succeeding
business day with the same force and effect as if made on the date of
maturity or the date fixed for prepayment, and no interest shall accrue
for the period after such date of maturity or date fixed for prepayment.
This Note is one of an issue of notes (the "Notes") of even date and
like tenor, aggregating the principal sum of $45,325,000 all issued pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Regents of the University on April
16, 1982 (the "Resolution") for the purpose of providing interim financing
for part of the costs of the Replacement Hospital Program at the University of Michigan Hospitals (the "Hospital"), and paying costs incidental
to the issuance of the Notes, including funding capitalized interest for the
Notes, all in accordance with the authority vested in the University by
law, particularly Article VIII, Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution
of 1963.
The Notes, including this Note, are equally and ratably secured solely
by an irrevocable pledge of Adjusted Gross Revenues of the Hospital
(defined in the Resolution), any moneys in the Note Payment Fund established by the Resolution, and, under certain circumstances proceeds of
borrowings secured by Student Fees of the University all as set forth in
the Resolution. With respect to the lien on Adjusted Gross Revenues of
the Hospital only, the Notes are equally and ratably secured, pari passu,
with the University's $14,675,000 Hospital Revenue and Bond Anticipation Notes (North Ingalls Building and Replacement Hospital Project),
Series A (the "Series A Notes"), dated June 1, 1981 and due April 1,
1984. For a complete statement of the purposes for which the Notes are

Note is issued, the outstanding obligations of the University which have

Notes, the rights of the holders of the Notes and the right of the
University to issue additional obligations of equal standing and priority
of lien with the Notes, as to the Adjusted Gross Revenues of the Hospital, and, under certain circumstances, the proceeds of certain borrowings secured by Student Fees of the University, and the terms and corditions under which this Note and the Notes, or any part thereof, shall
be deemed to be no longer outstanding, reference is made to the
Resolution.
Notes of this issue shall be subject to redemption, at the option of
the University, in whole on any date, or in part on any interest payment
date, on or after April 1, 1983, at the redemption prices set forth in the
table below, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption:
Redemption Price
(expressed as a percentage
Redemption Dates               of principal to be redeemed)
April 1, 1983 through March 31, 1984           101%
April 1, 1984 and thereafter                   100%
If less than all of the outstanding Notes are called for redemption, as
herein provided, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by lot, and
for such purposes, each fully registered Note shall be treated as representing the number of Notes obtained by dividing the principal amount
of said fully registered Note by $5,000. Fully registered Notes shall be
redeemed in portions of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof. In the case
of partial redemption of a fully registered Note, a new fully registered
Note shall be issued in the remaining outstanding principal amount to
the registered holder.
Not less than thirty days notice of the call of any Notes for redemption shall be given by the Trustee by publication in a newspaper or
financial journal circulated in the City of New York, New York, which
carries as part of its regular service notices of sale of municipal bonds.
The Trustee shall send a copy of such notice to the registered holder of
each Note to be redeemed which is registered as to principal or fully
registered and to each holder of a coupon Note to be redeemed who
has requested such notice in writing, by certified or registered mail postage
prepaid, addressed to the last known address of such noteholder as it
appears upon the note register or list maintained by the Trustee for such
purpose, not later than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption;
but failure to give any such notice by mailing, or any defect therein, shall
not affect the validity of any proceeding for the redemption of any Note
with respect to which such failure has occurred. Notice need not be
published if all Notes to be redeemed are registered as to principal or fully
registered and at least 30 days notice is mailed to each registered holder
of Notes to be redeemed.
Notes duly called for redemption shall not bear interest after the
date fixed for redemption provided sufficient funds are on deposit with
the Trustee to redeem the Notes called for redemption on the date fixed
for redemption, and shall cease to be deemed outstanding under the provisions of the Resolution and shall cease to be entitled to any source of
payment, security or benefit under the Resolution other than the right
to receive payment from the funds deposited with the Trustee.
This Note may cease to be deemed outstanding under the Resolution
if the University at any time makes provision for payment of all Notes
by depositing with the Trustee in the Note Payment Fund cash or noncallable direct obligations of United States of America, the principal of




302


APRIL MEETING, 1982


and interest on which when due, will be sufficient to pay the principal
of and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes as the same become
due by maturity or earlier call for redemption; provided, however, that
if the Notes are to be called for redemption, notice of said call shall
have been published or mailed, as provided above. Notice of such provision for payment shall be promptly thereafter sent to the registered
holder of each Note registered as to principal or fully registered and to
each holder of a bearer Note who has requested such notice in writing,
by certified or registered mail postage prepaid, addressed to the last
known address of such noteholder as it appears upon the note register or
list maintained by the Trustee for such purpose. Upon the happening of
the above conditions, the Notes shall cease to be entitled to any source of
payment, security or benefit under the Resolution other than the right to
receive payment from the aforesaid cash or direct obligations placed in
the Note Payment Fund with the Trustee.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount
of or interest on this Note or any claim based thereon against the State
of Michigan, the University or any member of the University, or any
officer or agent thereof, as individuals, either directly or indirectly; nor
shall these obligations become a lien on or secured by any property, real,
personal or mixed, of the State of Michigan or the University, other
than the Adjusted Gross Revenues of the Hospital, the proceeds of certain
borrowings secured by Student Fees, and funds in the Note Payment
Fund, all as provided in and limited by the Resolution, which are
pledged to meet or provide for the payment of said obligations; and
the liability of the University, as a body corporate, shall be limited to said
Adjusted Gross Revenues of the Hospital, proceeds of certain borrowings
secured by Student Fees, and funds in the Note Payment Fund, all as
provided in and limited by the Resolution, all other liability, except as
expressed in the Resolution, being by the acceptance hereof and as a
part of the consideration for the issuance hereof expressly waived.
This Note is transferable by delivery unless registered as to principal
in the owner's name upon books to be kept by the Trustee for such
purpose, such registration to be noted hereon. After such registration
no transfer of this Note shall be valid unless made on said books at the
request of the registered owner hereof, or his attorney duly authorized in
writing, and similarly noted hereon; but this Note may be discharged
from registration by being in like manner transferred to bearer, whereupon transferability by delivery shall be restored, and this Note may again
from time to time be registered or made payable to bearer as before.
Such registration, however, shall not affect the negotiability of the
annexed coupons, which shall remain transferable by delivery and be payable to bearer, and payment to bearer thereof shall fully discharge the
University in respect to the interest thereon, whether or not this Note be
registered as to principal and whether or not such coupons be overdue.
Coupon Notes (including this Note) of the same maturity upon surrender
thereof at the principal office of the Trustee with all unpaid coupons
attached, may, at the option of the holder, or in the case of coupon Notes
registered as to principal, at the option of the registered owner, be exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of fully-registered Notes
of the same maturity, without coupons, in the denomination of $5,000,
or any integral multiple thereof. The Trustee shall make a charge for such
transfer or exchange sufficient to pay for any tax or other governmental
fee or charge required to be paid with respect to such transfer or exchange,
but all other costs of making such transfer or exchange shall be borne by
the University. No such exchange of this Note shall be made within 15 days
prior to an interest payment date on the Notes or after this Note has been
called for redemption.

interest. In addition, the University covenants that immediately upon the
acceleration prior to maturity of the Notes (unless sufficient funds are
otherwise made available to pay all principal and accrued interest on the
Notes) it shall use its best efforts to issue, sell and deliver as soon thereafter as possible, bonds, notes or other obligations secured by and payable from Student Fees, the proceeds of which will be sufficient to pay

Student Fee bonds, notes or other obligations, additional Student Fee
bonds, notes or other obligations in amounts sufficient to meet the
requirements of this paragraph, and the requirements of Section 404 of
the Series A Resolution, without violating the terms or requirements of

ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, MAY 20, 1982
The Regents met at 2:00 P.M. at the Fair Lane Conference
Center at The University of Michigan-Dearborn.

Nederlander, Power, Roach, Varner, and Waters. Chancellors Jenkins
and Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger,
Johnson, Acting Vice-President Jacobson, and Vice-President and

the Medical Service Plan report would be presented later this
afternoon rather than on Friday as originally scheduled to accommodate those persons involved in the discussion.

The minutes of the meeting of April 15 and 16, 1982 were
approved.
II. REPORTS
Vice-President Brinkerhoff placed on file his monthly reports
on investment transactions, plant extension, litigation, personnellabor relations and the Replacement Hospital Project.
In connection with the Replacement Hospital report, Regent
Roach noted that approval to award Bid Package #11B would
occur at the July Regents' meeting. Since that meeting is to be
rescheduled to a week later, will this have a negative impact on the
scheduled progress? Regent Roach also inquired about the rationale
for the inclusion of some of the components of Bid Package 12 and
13 to Bid Package #11.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff responded that he doubted the food
service equipment was on the critical path, and he was not aware of
any particular reason for adding certain items to Bid Package #11
except to get like work out at the same time. He indicated that he
would check on these two questions and respond on Friday.
Vice-President Overberger filed' a monthly report on grants and
contracts for research.

With respect to the annual promotions list, Regent Power noted           Re:Lack of omen
that although there is a significant increase in female undergraduate
and graduate student enrollments in certain areas, there has been
little or no increase in women faculty members other than lecturer
or part-time positions, which excludes them from the tenured track.
This situation suggests that the University is not aggressively seeking
women at the assistant and associate professor level. It is possible




334


MAY MEETING, 1982


that the lack of role models at the University will be a serious
deterrent to female students in the future. To address this situation,
Regent Power suggested that while it would take time to build up a
data pool, some means should be found to bring women who are
prominent in certain areas to the University for limited appointments.
She requested a breakdown by sex and minorities of the 1980-81
annual promotion list, and asked that this accompany the annual
promotion list each year.
President Shapiro noted that the affirmative action report will
deal explicitly with these factors school by school. It is unfortunate
that budgetary problems have not permitted an expansion in faculty
commensurate with the increase in student enrollment in the College
of Engineering.
Leaves of Absence  The Regents approved extension of leaves of absence for Hiroko
Pijanowski, Assistant Professor of Jewelry and Metalsmithing in
the School of Art; Robert M. Warner, Professor of Library Science;

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of nineteen faculty
members. The following retirement memoirs were adopted.
ROBERT WILLIAM ADAMS, Professor of International Business retired from   R.w. Adams
active faculty status as of April 30, 1982, after a productive career as an economist,  Retirement
teacher and administrator.
A native of Indiana, Professor Adams earned a B.S. degree from Northwestern
University in 1940 where he was Pi Beta Kappa. After wartime service in the U.S.
Navy, he entered the doctoral program in economics at MIT. He was awarded his
Ph.D. there in 1951.
Professor Adams was an economist with Exxon's economics department from
1946-1965. He rose to become manager of Exxon's economics department, a
position he held for 10 years. In 1965, he was appointed Professor of International
Business at The University of Michigan.
During his 16 years at Michigan, Professor Adams played a major role in
developing the new Program in International Business to a point where it is recognized as one of the leading such programs in the nation. He served as administrator
of the Program under a grant from the Ford Foundation recruiting a strong faculty,
developing the curriculum, and chairing numerous Ph.D. committees.
Professor Adams' other contributions include service on School, University,




336


MAY MEETING, 1982


State and National Committees relating to international business and Michigan's role
therein. He was also director of the Institute for International Commerce established
by the State of Michigan at the School. In this capacity he directed a program of
research and seminars for Michigan business to aid in their international activities.
He also edited two books on the international business involvement of Michigan
firms.
The Regents now salute this distinguished international business educator by
naming him Professor Emeritus of International Business.
J. A. Bolt   JAY A. BOLT, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, retires at the end of
Retirement  1981-82 academic year. This represents the end of a teaching career that has spanned
forty-four years, thirty-five of which have been with the University of Michigan.
Professor Bolt graduated with a BSME from Michigan State University in 1934.
He has MS, MME and ME degrees from Purdue University, Chrysler Institute and
Michigan State University respectively. Only the Second World War could interrupt
his teaching career, when, from 1941 to 1947, he was Director of Aircraft Carburetor Research at Bendix Corporation. His work for Bendix laid the foundation for
his present reputation as one of the world's leading experts in fuel-air mixture
preparation for both gasoline and diesel engines. His contributions in this area won
him the Horning Memorial Award of the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1972.
Professor Bolt's achievements have earned him international respect. He is a
member of the British Institution of Mechanical Engineers, as well as the American
Society. In 1977 the Society of Automotive Engineering introduced the Fellow grade
of membership. At that time SAE had 31,000 members representing many disciplines. Professor Bolt was unanimously elected a Fellow. Only twenty-two members
received this accolade, for "exceptional individual contributions to the advancement
of automotive technology".
One of Professor Bolt's attributes in teaching in his attention to clarity of
presentation of both the spoken and written word. His abilities in this area won him,
in 1967, the Arch T. Colwell Award for outstanding contribution to literature.
In recognition of this distinguished educator and researcher the Regents now
salute Jay A. Bolt for his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of
Mechanical Engineering.
A.F. Conard    ALFRED F. CONARD, Henry M. Butzel Professor of Law, is retiring from
Retirement  active faculty status as of May 31, 1982, after a dedicated career of teaching and
research.
Professor Conard was born in Grinnell, Iowa, in 1911. He recieved his A.B.
from Grinnell College in 1932, his LL.B. from the University of Pennsylvania in
1936, and his LL.M. and S.J.D. degrees from Columbia University in 1939 and
1942. His career as a practicing lawyer included private practice in Philadelphia
from 1937 to 1938, service with the Office of Price Administration from 1942 to
1943, and service with the Office of the Alien Property Custodian from 1945 to
1946. He also served his country with the OSS from 1943 to 1945.
Professor Conard's teaching career began at the University of Kansas City,
where he taught from 1939 to 1942 and was Acting Dean from 1941 to 1942. He
later taught at the University of Illinois from 1946 to 1954, and has taught at the
University of Michigan since 1954. In 1974 he was named Henry M. Butzel
Professor of Law.
Professor Conard's scholarly career has spanned many diverse fields, in each of
which he has made his mark as a great scholar and seminal thinker. His classic study
of Automobile Accident Costs and Payments (1964), in collaboration with Professor
James Morgan of this University, paved the way for the "no-fault" compensation
movement. In the comparative law sphere, his works have been translated into
several languages, he served as Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Comparative Law from 1968 to 1971, and he has since served as Chief Editor of Volume 13
of the International Encyclopedia of Comparative Law. He has taught in many areas
at the Law School, and has been a mainstay in the field of business organizations.
His casebook in Enterprise Organization is the proud result of several editions in
collaboration with former members of the Law School faculty. His many articles in all
these fields, far too abundant to list, have been widely acclaimed and highly influential.




MAY MEETING, 1982


337


Professor Conard has been honored nationally and internationally. He was
President of the Association of American Law Schools in 1971, and has been a
Visiting Professor at the Salzburg Seminar in American Studies and the holder of a
Guggenheim Fellowship.
Generations of students and faculty colleagues have come to know Professor
Conard as an exemplary teacher in all that he does, in the classroom, in his writing,
and in his daily associations.
The Regents now salute this accomplished scholar and educator for his long
service to the University of Michigan by naming him Henry M. Butzel Professor
Emeritus of Law.

addition to the ordinance was included concerning bicycle registration and control. The increase in bicycle use on campus has increased the theft of these vehicles, and unless properly licensed,
there is no way to return a recovered bicycle to the rightful owner.
Regent Roach asked if a student's bicycle was registered in his
home town, would he need to register in Ann Arbor as well at an
additional expense to the student. Vice-President Brinkerhoff responded affirmatively so that the bicycle could be listed in the Ann
Arbor bicycle registration computer system which would provide
prompt identification. He said the fee was minimal.
Regent Roach commented that the students would not learn of
this requirement until they return to campus in the fall. If this
ordinance is adopted at this meeting and later on there are complaints, he said he would not be opposed to consider an amendment
in September.
Also of concern to Regent Roach was that section of the
ordinance which prohibits students from storing their bicycle when
not in use in their rooms. Vice-President Brinkerhoff replied that it
was the intent of the ordinance to make sure the bicycles were
appropriately parked when they are in public areas and not to
legislate against that particular action. Vice President Brinkerhoff
said he would look into the issue and bring the matter back to the
Regents with some clarification.
Regent Dunn then moved to table the item. Regent Baker
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Medical Service  Dean John Gronvall of the Medical School then addressed the
Plan
Board with respect to the Medical Service Plan. He said the Medical Service Plan has been one of the most significant developments
in the Medical School during the past decade. The practice plan is
now the largest single fund source that supports the Medical School.
He indicated there were problems that needed attention as does any
large, complex structure, but it definitely has been a success.
Dr. Thomas Herrmann, Associate Dean for Medical Administration, reviewed the report and mentioned some of the highlights.
Dr. Herrmann listed the goals of the plan: (1) to assist the Medical
School and the Hospital in meeting their primary goals of teaching,
research, and patient care, (2) to assist in the recruitment and
retention of a medical faculty of high quality, (3) to provide faculty
incomes which are competitive with the incomes of faculty members in the same disciplines at comparable academic medical cen



MAY MEETING, 1982


347


ters in the country, and (4) to assure financial stability for the
faculty by providing appropriate incentives, so that appropriate
charges would be made for all professional services rendered. He
mentioned also the extent to which these goals were achieved; the
key features of the Medical Service Plan; the factors believed to be
primarily responsible for the success of the plan, and the major
challenges and/or opportunities that lie ahead for the Medical Service Plan at Michigan.
The Regents acknowledged the excellence of the report. They
discussed the possibility of implementing an internal cost containment
mechanism, and the means by which a higher percentage of faculty
salaries will be met with internal resources.
Dean Gronvall stated that some measure of cost containment
has been met by shifting more services into the outpatie clinics.
HMO plans and the market place also contribute to cost containment.
He described how the Medical School divides fees for physician
services between salaries and support for development purposes. In
order to meet more of the salary component internally, the percentage
set aside for development purposes would need to be decreased.
President Shapiro commented that, in his judgment, the  w Vasse
implementation of the MSP has been a major accomplishment of
the Medical School. It has been accomplished in a far more effective
and smoother pattern than virtually any other school. He said this
view was confirmed by the recent visit of the Medical School's
accreditation team.
President Shapiro commended Dr. William Vasse, Assistant to
the Chancellor at Flint, who will be leaving the University to
become Vice-President for Academic Affairs at the State University
of New York at New Paltz, for his significant contributions to the
University and the Flint campus. He wished him good luck in his
new assignment.
Chancellor Nelson reviewed the recommendation to establish a  School of Health
School of Health Sciences at The University of Michigan-Flint. He
indicated that the major units to be housed in this academic degree
granting unit would be the nursing, physical therapy and health
sciences programs.
In response to Regent Dunn's question regarding the location of
the new unit, Vice Chancellor Eby said that only the physical
therapy program would require a new location and it was their
intent to move the unit into the surge building.
Regent Dunn then asked about the request to remodel the Mott
Building. Chancellor Nelson explained that certain courses formerly
taught by the Medical School, which now will be offered by the
biology department at Flint in support of the physical therapy
program will require additional laboratory space. The biology
department is already housed in the Mott Building.




348


MAY MEETING, 1982


The Regents discussed the cost of the project and the fact that
the contingency fund, which was budgeted for a six-year period,
would be depleted for all practical purposes by this one project.
Chancellor Nelson explained they have already begun to base-budget
the program and the community support for the program has been a
major element in fund-raising endeavors. He said he was confident
that the original projected budget would not be exceeded.
Regent Power then moved to authorize the establishment of a
School of Health Sciences at The University of Michigan-Flint, and
authorization to bid and award a contract not to exceed $160,000 to
remodel space in the Mott Memorial Building for laboratory and
office facilities in support of the Physical Therapy Program. Regent
Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Power commented that under the leadership of Chancellor
Nelson and Dr. Vasse the physical therapy program has gained a
great deal of support in the Flint community. It is yet another
example where needs and interests will be mutually served. She
commended the Chancellor, Provost Eby, and Dr. Vasse for their
efforts.
Comments    The Regents then heard comments from the following individuals
on the topics indicated: a five-minute video tape was presented
showing the synchronized swim team in some of their routines;
Laura Berne, student, Marcia Federbush, Ann Arbor citizen,
Lawrence Holter, father of one of the swimmers, and Sue Neu,
alumna and former swimmer, on the discontinuance of the
synchronized swimming program; Lawrence Radine and Lars Bjorn,
Associate Professors of Behavioral Sciences at UM-Dearborn, on
the review of the Institute for Labor and Industrial Relations.
FRIDAY MAY 21, 1982
The Regents met at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach, and Waters. Chancellors Jenkins and
Nelson, and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger, Johnson,
Acting Vice-President Jacobson and Vice-President and Secretary
Kennedy also were present. Regent Vamer was absent.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order and read the
following statement:
President's  "For the third time in the State's current fiscal year, and for the
Statement re:
Executive Order fourth time in the last nine months, public higher education is once
again the subject of an executive order reduction.
"Three of these orders have meant outright reductions totaling
$11,134,370 for the three campuses of The University of Michigan.
The other order will defer $22 million from our fourth quarter
allocation into the state's next fiscal year. Even if that total deferred




MAY MEETING, 1982


349


amount is recovered, there will be a substantial interest cost to the
University that will not be recovered.
"We are painfully aware of the circumstances that have led to
these damaging cutbacks. However, while these reductions may be
described as necessary under the circumstances, their cumulative
effect is now undermining the strength of this state's public higher
education system.
"The people of this state deserve better. We cannot allow this
deterioration to continue or we shall see higher education crumble
altogether. As a state, economic recovery is perhaps our first
priority, but such a recovery requires a restoration to a responsible
level of support for our colleges and universities. This issue must
become a critical priority for state government."
Vice-President Brinkerhoff introduced Mr. Norman Herbert, the  University's
Endowment Funds
University's Investment Officer, Mr. Ned Joachimi, and Mr. Thomas
Astley from Investment Management Control Systems, who would
discuss the National Bank of Detroit's performance of the University's
endowment funds.
Mr. Herbert indicated that the primary goal for the endowment
funds was to maintain the purchasing power of the principal of the
funds. A sub-goal would be to perform at least as well as the
appropriate indices.
Mr. Joachimi said that the University must adhere to the simple
formula, spending rate plus inflation rate equals total rate of return,
over the long term to enable the endowment fund to remain whole,
otherwise there will be an erosion of these funds. The University's
investment goal, if one assumed a spending rate of approximately
6%, and an inflation rate of approximately 9%, should be to
achieve a total rate of return of approximately 15%.
In response to the question of whether any institution had
achieved an appropriate total return, Mr. Joachimi said that seldom
during the last five years that had been achieved. Comparisons with
other institutions were difficult because each used different allocations
of assets. He said the University must look at the fixed income and
equity segments of the portfolio separately in order to gain maximum
utilization of funds.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff commented that any time the inflation
rate is greater than the spendable income there is a great deal of
pressure within the University to increase the spendable income. In
an effort to improve the total performance of the endowment funds,
the Board recently approved a series of changes that involves stock
lending, options, real estate, and movement of equity into the
Common Fund. Now, the basic issue is whether or not to recommend
a spending cap on income. Vice President Brinkerhoff indicated
that he would put together a time schedule for discussion at the next
meeting.




350


MAY MEETING, 1982


After further discussion, President Shapiro remarked that the
consideration of the spending rate will help to determine the kind of
management needed and what policy changes, if any, are necessary
to improve the University's situation.
Purchase of  Regent Nederlander moved authorization to purchase 40,000
shares of Property Capital Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
from the Consolidated endowment funds, Rackham endowment
funds, and the Funds functioning as endowment. Regent Dunn
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Study of Lorch Hall  Vice-President Brinkerhoff commented that after the evaluation
for Economics
Department Use committee had recommended not to rebuild on site nor to rebuild
the Economics Building in the same configuration, it was suggested
that Lorch Hall, the former Architecture and Design Building, be
considered as a possible alternative for the Economics Department.
One of the recommendations was to bring the Economics Department
and certain allied activities together. This would require not only
the reuse of Lorch Hall, but an addition to it as well. The
recommendation at this time, however, is to make a determination
as to whether the Economics Department and the related program,
the Center for Research on Economic Development could be
accommodated into that facility without adding to it. The Mathematics
Department which had originally been slated to occupy the building
could not be accommodated successfully without a substantial
additional investment.
Regent Dunn moved to approve the appointment of Eberle M.
Smith and Associates of Detroit as the architectural firm to determine
the feasibility of renovating Lorch Hall for use by the Economics
Department. Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Rackham Memorial  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the management agreement
Building, Detroit
with the Rackham Memorial Building in Detroit.
Regent Nederlander suggested that since no one can predict
what is going to happen in the future, it might be wise to include a
cancellation clause in the agreement.
Regent Dunn moved to authorize the Vice-President and Chief
Financial Officer to execute the agreement with the Engineering
Society of Detroit for the management of the University's portion
of the Horace H. Rackham Educational Memorial Building in
Detroit, subject to the inclusion of a cancellation clause. Regent
Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted. Regent Roach
abstained from the discussion and the vote.
Real Property  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the recommendation to
lease certain lands in Gibson Township, Bay County, Michigan.
The Regents inquired about the length of the lease, additional
options, other interested parties bidding on the property, and whether
Longyear Realty does any work for Consumers Power company.




MAY MEETING, 1982


351


Regent Roach moved that the oil and gas lease with Consumers
Power for certain property from the Helen F. Weber estate be
approved for execution, subject to verification that there is no
conflict of interest on the part of the Longyear Realty Company.
Regent Dunn seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Brown moved authorization to sell the property in Auburn
Heights, Michigan, to the United States Postal Service for $58,700,
as recommended. Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
X. OTHER
Regent Nederlander moved to authorize the Board in Control of         Intercollegiate
Athletics Faculty
Intercollegiate Athletics to appoint an alternate faculty representative  Representative
to the Intercollegiate (Big Ten) Conference for a three-year term.
The appointment must be approved by the Senate Assembly. Regent
Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve the revisions to sections         Bylaw Revisions
5.22 and 5.23 of the Regents' Bylaws concerning supplemental
instructional staff definitions. Regent Roach seconded the motion
and it was adopted. The revisions, as revised follows:
Sec. 5.22. ADJUNCT INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF. Persons whose primary
responsibilities lie outside the University or in another capacity within the University
may be appointed on a part-time basis as adjunct professors, associate professors,
assistant professors, instructors or lecturers in order to supplement the instructional
program.
Appointment and/or promotion criteria shall be consistent with those for regular
instructional ranks to the extent applicable.
Adjunct appointments or reappointments are recommended by the appropriate
instructional department, school or college, and approved by the President.
Appointments as adjunct instructional staff are on an annual or shorter basis and
without tenure.
Sec. 5.23. CLINICAL INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF. Professional practitioners
in the community or within the University may be appointed on a part-time basis as
clinical professors, associate professors, assistant professors, instructors or lecturers
in order to supplement the instructional program.
Appointment and/or promotion criteria shall be consistent with those for regular
instructional ranks to the extent applicable.
Clinical appointments or reappointments are recommended by the appropriate
instructional department, school or college, and approved by the President.
Appointments as clinical instructional staff are on an annual or shorter basis and
without tenure.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve the uses of the income of         Wolfson
the Wolfson Endowment funds for the fiscal year 1982-83, as
recommended. Regent Dunn seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Approval of the recommendation for appointments to Medical            Medical Staff
Staff membership was moved by Regent Dunn, seconded by Regent 
Roach and adopted.
The Regents unanimously       approved to reschedule the July        July Meeting
Regents' meeting to July 22 and 23, 1982.




352


MAY MEETING, 1982


Housing Rates  Regent Roach moved to approve the increased rates of the
Increased,
UM-Dearborn  UM-Dearborn housing rental units, as recommended. Regent Dunn
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Citizens Advisory  Regent Dunn moved approval of the resolutions of appreciation
UM-Flint for three retiring members of UM-Flint's Citizens Advisory
Committee. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
RHP, Bid Package  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed and described Bid Package
#9A, Conveyance I for the Replacement Hospital Project. He
indicated that the elevators were on the critical path. He reviewed
the alternates in the bid package and explained that the acceptance
or rejection of the various alternates was a cost control factor and
not an arbitrary or capricious decision as stated by a company who
did not succeed as the low bidder. If the project should exceed the
budget, the University is prepared to delete thirty-two beds from
the top floor of the hospital, thereby cutting costs. This was indicated
from the very beginning of the bidding process, and all of the
bidders were aware of this. The options were plainly listed as
alternates.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff said that specifications were for a
one-of-a-kind elevator cab in order to have a price comparison
between all four elevator companies. The design of the cab was
done by Albert Kahn in conjunction with the nation's leading
elevator consultant. The speeds, disbursals, stops, frequency and
all mechanisms which concern vertical transportation are very
important to a hospital. All companies bid on the same specifications.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff described the cab design and the reasons
for the design.
Regent Roach stated that the decision to award the bid to Otis
Elevator Company was not arbitrary as stated by the Westinghouse
Company. Unless there is a valid complaint, the University will
continue to award contracts to the lowest qualified bidders subject
to whatever modifications the University may later decide to make.
Construction  Regent Dunn moved to approve awarding a construction contract
Contract Awarded      D            approve
to the low bidder, Montgomery Elevator Company, Southfield,
Michigan, for the escalators component of Bid Package #9A, and
to Otis Elevator Company, Detroit, Michigan for the elevators and
dumbwaiters. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Baker inquired whether these additional bid packages
are adding to the total financial exposure.
President Shapiro indicated that a critical point was identified last
fall when a decision would have to be made as to whether the University could afford to proceed or not. This item was included in those
calculations. He then called for the vote and the motion was adopted.
Bank Account  Regent Baker moved to approve the establishment of a bank
account with the Brighton State Bank for the Brighton Health
Center. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.




MAY MEETING, 1982


353


Regent Roach mentioned the two points which had been raised  RHP
on Thursday concerning the Hospital project: (1) will the delay of
the Regents' meeting one week in July cause any problems with
respect to contract awards, and (2) where is the $14.5 million
which is being shifted to Bid Package #11 coming from and will
this change the risk factor with respect to the decisions which must
be made this fall?
Vice-President Brinkerhoff replied that the food service component
is not on the critical path, therefore, the change in date of the
meeting will not adversely affect any contracts. With respect to the
second question, the $14.5 million is for equipment which is being
disbursed from the equipment budget and added to Bid Package
#11. He said he would check to determine if there would be any
change in the exposure factor and report to the Regents before the
next meeting.
The Regents received a report on affirmative action monitoring  Affirmative Action
of faculty promotions.
Regent Brown commented upon the presentation on Thursday  Synchronized
Swimming Program
concerning the synchronized swimming team. He expressed the view
that the University has not been and is not at the present time a
leader in women's athletics. It would seem to be a particularly bad
time, therefore, to drop a varsity sport for women unless there is a
compelling reason to do so. He would like to have the matter
reviewed.
President Shapiro indicated that, in his view, it would be
appropriate to ask for a clarification of the procedures and the
reasons for dropping the program, and he would do so.
All the above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the month
of April totaled $1,444.38.
The Regents adjourned to meet on June 17 and 18, 1982.

APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREES
Conferred May 1, 1982
HELEN M. MILLIKEN, Champion of the Equality of Rights for All, Patroness of
the Arts, and First Lady of Michigan
It should come as no surprise that the University of Michigan has deferred until
now the addition of yet another member of the Milliken family to the ranks of its
degree-holders. Given its propensity to save the best for last, the University now
happily welcomes Helen Milliken to those lists which already include the names of
her husband and one of their children.
Figurehead status was never one of her strong points, though it is too often
characteristic of one in her position. Active campaigner, spokeswoman, fund-raiser,
and dedicated worker are much more descriptive of her efforts on behalf of the arts,
the equal rights amendment, and conservation issues both at the state and national
levels. She has headed the Michigan Artrain effort since 1971 and has been most
active in many other efforts to strengthen the role of the arts in the lives of Michigan
citizens. As national co-chair of ERAmerica, she has traveled throughout the country
advocating constitutional status for the rights of women.
Concurrent with this torrent of "extracurricular" activity, Helen Milliken was
paying meticulous attention to all of the demands of her unique position in the life of
the state's first family. One can only wonder what is likely to occur now when it
appears she may have some spare time.
It is with pride and great gratitude that the Regents acknowledge the contributions of this singular woman by conferring on her the degree Doctor of Laws.
JOHN REWALD, Art Historian; Distinguished Professor, Graduate Center, The
City University of New York
The University of Michigan is proud to honor John Rewald, an art historian
whose career as a scholar, teacher, organizer of exhibitions, and adviser to public
museums and private collections has greatly enhanced our understanding and enjoyment of 19th and 20th century art.
Dr. Rewald was born in Germany, where he studied medieval architecture at
the universities of Hamburg and Frankfurt am Main. In 1933 he entered the
Sorbonne in Paris where he prepared his doctoral thesis, Cezanne et Zola, which
later was awarded the Prix Charles Blanc by the French Academy
By combining thorough scholarship with an insightful understanding of lives
and activities of the artists he has studied, Professor Rewald has produced books of
primary importance on a variety of major artists and art movements. His best known
books, The History of Impressionism of 1946 and Post-Impressionism of 1956,
continue to be basic sources for the study of late 19th century French art. He has also
produced monographs on Paul Cezanne, Georges Seurat, Paul Gauguin, Aristide
Maillol, Pierre Bonnard, and Giacomo Manzu and has edited the letters of Cezanne,
Gauguin and Camille Pissarro.
Professor Rewald has also organized exhibitions for many of the world's
leading museums, including nine exhibitions on Cezanne plus others devoted to
Bonnard, Maillol, and the Fauves.
In his role as advisory to private collections and museums, he has combined his
scholarship with wide experience and a highly refined sense of connoisseurship.
Through these efforts in developing American collections a great artistic legacy will
eventually enhance public museums in this country, where the works may be seen
and enjoyed by us all.




356                     MAY MEETING, 1982
John Rewald has devoted his great talents and energy to the world of art, and
his scholarly and creative efforts continue to inform and enrich the lives of students
and art lovers everywhere. The University of Michigan is pleased to honor his
achievements by awarding him the degree Doctor of Fine Arts.




JUNE MEETING, 1982
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, JUNE 17, 1982
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach, and Varner. Chancellors Jenkins and
Nelson and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Frye, Overberger, Johnson and Acting Vice-President Jacobson also were present. Regent
Waters and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy were absent.
President Shapiro called the meeting to order. He indicated that
the order of business would be reversed putting the budget review
item first on the agenda.
Vice-President Frye commented that there has been no change  Budget, 1982-83
since the last budget discussion-the state appropriation remains
uncertain. It is doubtful that the governor's recommendation of a
5% increase for higher education will be realized. In fact, a zero
increase over the University's current reduced budget is a more
realistic view at this point.
Anticipated expenses, excluding a salary program, for next year
would increase by approximately $17 million. This includes staff
benefits, utilities, nonsalary improvements, student aid, new space
commitments, certain other commitments and needs, and the interest on the fourth quarter appropriation deferred by the state. VicePresident Frye said that there was a compelling need for a salary
program at least equivalent to the estimated rate of inflation in
order to avoid further slippage in the salaries for the faculty and
staff. This would add approximately $10 million to the anticipated
expenses for next year, bringing the total to $27.5 million. Whether
a salary program of this proportion can be realized depends entirely
on the revenue side of the ledger.
Assuming certain percentage increases in tuition, indirect cost,
other sources of income, and a zero percent state appropriation
increase, the University could generate approximately $18.3 million. To this figure $5 million would be added from internal
reallocation as the first installment of the five-year program previously discussed for a total revenue of approximately $23.3 million. This would leave a shortfall of about $4 million. In order to
bring the budget in balance at the close of the 1982-83 fiscal year,
the salary program would have to be less than hoped for and
perhaps the tuition increase slightly higher.

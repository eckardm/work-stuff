but not yet allocated. The action was taken in order to
retain the services of Professor Goodrich, who has been

July 23, 1929
Present, Regent Sawyer and Regent Beal.
Dean Ruthven transmitted to the committee a copy of
the following communication received by him from the Children's Fund of Michigan, which has recently been established
by Senator Couzens:"As you are probably aware, Dr. R. W. Bunting
of the School of Dentistry has been negotiating with
the Children's Fund of Michigan for a grant of
money to carry on certain research in the diseases
of the teeth of children. The Trustees of the Children's Fund desire to offer the University of Michigan the sum of $22,000 for the Children's Fund's
fiscal year of I929-I930 ending April 30, 1930;
$22,000 for the fiscal year of 1930-1931, and $22,000
for the fiscal year of 1931-1932, in the pursuance of
research on the diseases of the teeth of children,
under the direction of Dr. R. W. Bunting of the
School of Dentistry of the University of Michigan.
"We understand that the University will furnish
a satisfactory laboratory and office space and will
equip them for the particular study to be undertaken.
"We understand that the rules of the University
regarding such funds require that the money shall
be paid in a lump sum sufficient to maintain the
work for a period of one year. From this, the
Treasurer of the University distributes the fund on
the order of the Director of the research in accordance with the purpose indicated in the grant. If,
at the end of the year, any portion of the fund remains unexpended, the balance will be returned to
the donors. The Children's Fund would prefer, if
such an arrangement is possible, to make advance
quarterly payments upon this project. The execution of the total program of the Children's Fund is
contingent upon its securities earning certain interest. To advance the total sum of money at the
beginning of each year, therefore, would interfere
slightly with some other projects.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1929

"The Trustees of the Children's Fund make all
gifts of this character upon certain conditions as
follows:"I. This gift is made by the Children's Fund
of Michigan upon the express understanding and
condition that all discoveries, formulae or advancements made or resulting from this gift will be for
the benefit of mankind, and that no property rights
will inure therefrom to the benefit of any person
employed directly or indirectly in or about this activity, but the same shall become the common property and right of the people of the world.
"2. The Children's Fund of Michigan reserves
to itself the right to make such inspection of the
work, books, and records of the beneficiary hereof
pertaining to this gift as its Board of Trustees may,
in their judgment, deem proper and advisable, and
to publish any information in relation thereto that
the Board of Trustees may desire.
"3. The recipient of this gift shall, from time
to time, make records of its activities and give other
information in relation thereto when and as requested by the Board of Trustees of the Children's
Fund of Michigan.
"4. In any publication or publicity by the recipient of this gift, the same shall be made in the
name of or with an appropriate reference to the
Children's Fund of Michigan as the donor of the
funds which made such activities possible.
"5. No announcement of this gift shall be made
except by written statement issued or approved by
the Children's Fund of Michigan.
"We hope that the University of Michigan will
find these terms of mutual advantage to itself and
the Children's Fund, and will notify us at an early
date of its acceptance.
Very truly yours,
Wm. J. Norton,
July 19, 1929                         Secretary"
The committee accepted the proffer in accordance with
its terms, and with the conditions stated above, and with an
expression of deep gratitude for this benefaction full of
potential benefit to humanity. Further, one of the conditions




IO

work in cancer research shall be retained by the University
of Michigan as a part of its equipment

again next summer, without charge. The School of Forestry and Conservation is using the camps, and any damage
which may occur during the present year will be taken care
of out of the budget of that School. It is estimated that
the expense will not exceed more than $200 or $300.

August 12, 1929
Present, Regent Beal and Regent Sawyer.
The committee appointed Dr. Luther Purdom to be Director of the University Bureau of Appointments and Occupational Information, with the rank of professor, with salary
at the rate of $4,800, twelve-months basis, the appointment
to run from September I, I929 to July I, 1930.
Dr. Purdom will take over the duties of Secretary of
the Bureau of Appointments on a half-time basis and the
duties of Executive Secretary of the Bureau of Vocational
Counsel and Placement on a half-time basis, his salary to
be in each case on the basis of $4,800 for the full calendar
year, and to be paid him one-half on the payroll of the Bureau of Vocational Counsel and Placement and one-half on
the payroll of the Bureau of Appointments. He is not to
be attached to the faculty of any school or college of the
University.
The committee also gave approval to Dr. Purdom's suggestion that he be permitted to offer one or more courses
in the Summer Session, according to arrangements which
might be made between Dr. Purdom and Dean Kraus.
Dr. Purdom's appointment fills the vacancies left through
the resignation of Mrs. Hellen R. Shambaugh as Secretary
of the Bureau of Appointments of the School of Education
and the resignation of Mr. Willard E. Parker as Executive
Secretary of the Senate Committee on Vocational Counsel
and Placement.
August 13, 1929
Present, Regent Beal and Regent Sawyer.
At the December meeting (R.P. I926-I929, pages 842 -843) there was recorded paragraph thirty-two of the will
of the late Mary S. Mandelle making a bequest to the Regents of $60,ooo for the purposes therein stated. "In view of
the fact that the University has no organized department
of mining even though many of the studies pursued by students in the College of Engineering, in Geology, Geography,
and other departments are subjects which a student preparing to be a mining engineer might pursue, and in view in
particular of a list of authorities which the attorneys cited,"
it was the opinion of the attorneys of the Board to whom the
question was referred at the December meeting "that this
bequest to the University of Michigan should and would
be liberally construed and that it should be accepted, and
that the real purpose of the testatrix would be complied
with if the Regents appointed six male students to these

OCTOBER MEETING, 1929


scholarships from the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts or from the Colleges of Engineering and Architecture or from any school or college or department which in
the course of administration might be separated off from
either of the above after the date of the will." To this the
Union Trust Company replied January 9, that at such time
as the executors should be in position to pay the legacy,
"if we feel there is any question we shall be glad to take
the matter up with Messrs. Cavanaugh and Burke. We doubt,
however, whether there will be any difficulty about paying
the entire legacy to the University." A letter from Mr. C.
M. Harmon, dated March 28, stated that he is "quite willing
to endorse the letter of the Union Trust Company on this
matter, etc."  Mr. Harmon is co-executor. The Executive
Committee, under the circumstances, authorized the acceptance of the bequest with profound gratitude, in accordance
with the terms of the bequest as understood and interpreted
in the correspondence above cited of the attorneys and the
executors.
August 14, 1929
Present, Regent Beal and Regent Sawyer.
The committee accepted for the Regents, with deep appreciation, bonds and cash from the late Professor C. H.
Cooley, in a total amount of $353.79, as outlined in the following memorandum of Professor Cooley, and accompanying comment by the Secretary and Business Manager:"There are in my possession in the box at the
First National Bank, two $Ioo Straus bonds and a
little cash in a savings account at the downtown Ann
Arbor Savings Bank which belong to the long
defunct Michigan Political Science Association of
which I was treasurer.
"There is no definite claim whatever upon these
funds and I suggest that they be turned over to the
University with a request that they be credited to
the Department of Economics and Sociology to aid
some research relating to Michigan.
April, I929                       C. H. Cooley"
The comment of the Secretary and Business Manager
is as follows:"Instead of the two bonds which Professor
Cooley specified there were actually three, each for
$IOO and each with a semi-annual coupon of $3.25
past due, attached. These are the S. W. Straus and




OCTOBER MEETING, 1929


I5


Company bonds on the Book-Cadillac Hotel. There
was also in a savings account in the Ann Arbor
Savings Bank a credit of $44.04 making $353.79.
"I have been asked by Professor I. L. Sharfman
to request the Regents to place this sum, or such
proceeds as there shall be if the bonds are sold, in a
trust deposit fund to be expended for the Department of Economics for such purposes as that department may determine and requisition. Mr. James
A. Kennedy, Professor Cooley's son-in-law, and the
family's representative, has assured me that this is
believed by the family to be in accordance with Professor Cooley's intents and purposes and the family
would like to have this done."
Later comment of the Secretary and Business Manager
was as follows:"It now appears that there is need for action
on this matter before the meeting of the Regents
in September. Professor Sharfman and Professor
Angell called on me Saturday morning (August Io)
and stated that the University of Chicago Press was
desirous of publishing Professor Angell's book, A
Study in Undergraduate Adjustiueit, provided that
a guarantee of $650 could be made.     Professor
Angell feels able, if the Regents would authorize the
use of the funds left by Professor Cooley, so far
as they will go, to guarantee the balance of the sum
of $650 himself. Professor Sharfman would like to
have this authority given at once and in general
heartily approves the suggested use. Indeed, it may
never be, in fact, a use, as the sale of the book
may be such as to make use of the guarantee unnecessary.
"It seems to the undersigned a quite desirable
and appropriate use of this fund, as Dr. Angell
made the study as a project of the Department of
Sociology and his study was financed to the extent
of $900 from the Faculty Research Fund. I cannot
see any objection to accepting the deposit, at present
amounting to $353.79, and to allowing its use as a
guarantee fund, and its possible expenditure as such
if necessary.  Professors  Sharfman  and  Angell
desire to reply to the telegram of the Chicago University Press as soon as possible."

OCTOBER MEETING, 1929


The committee approved using this bequest in accordance with the definite suggestion by Professor Sharfman
as outlined in the letter of the Secretary and Business Manager to the. committee under date of August 12, namely,
that this fund be used as a portion of the required guarantee of $650 for publishing a book by Professor Robert
Angell, A Study in Undergroduate Adjustinmelt, Professor
Angell to furnish personally the balance of the amount nececessary to make up the total sum of $550.
August I4, 1929
Present, Regent Beal and Regent Sawyer.
The committee appropriated the sum of $I73.49 from
the general funds of the University, which sum was added
to the budget of the Office of the Food Director to take care
of a deficit appearing at the close of the last fiscal year
in the amount of $28.49 and to insure the budget against deficit at the close of the fiscal year 1929-I930. The appropriation was made with the understanding that at the first meeting of the Regents in the fall a recommendation would be
submitted to the Board that this office be discontinued after
the present year.
August 15, 1929
Present, Regent Beal and Regent Sawyer.
The committee accepted for the Regents, with deep
appreciation, a gift from the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute of a sum not to exceed $3,000
per year for a period of three years for the conduct of
a co-operative investigation between the United States Biological Survey and the University of Michigan, in the general field of the biology of gallinaceous birds (particularly
the ring-necked pheasant and the Hungarian partridge).
This gift was accepted under the conditions embodied in
a statement prepared by Dean Ruthven in consultation with
the representatives of the Biological Survey and the Institute, as follows:"Under the general supervision of the Graduate
School and such departments or other units as may
be concerned with the work, the University will
undertake to provide investigators to be approved
by the United States Biological Survey and to be
given the title of Research Associate, with the rank
of junior instructor and with the privileges of graduate students.
"The University will further provide laboratory
facilities and such technical supervision of the inves

tigations as may be considered necessary to the conduct of the work, and will submit periodical reports
to the United States Biological Survey upon the
progress of the study.
"It is understood that the sum of $3,000 per year
will be provided through the Sporting Arms and
Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute for a period
of three years, provided, however, that renewal of
the contribution for the second and third years will
be dependent upon the satisfactory progress of the
investigation. Publication shall be as mutually agreed
between the University and the United States Biological Survey."
August 15, 1929
Present, Regent Beal and Regent Sawyer.
Upon recommendation of Dean Hugh Cabot the committee conferred the degree of Doctor of Medicine as of
August I upon Eugene Coryell Jacobs (R.P. I926-I929, page

The Committee declined to appropriate the sum of
$5,748.55 to cover the estimated expense of repairing and
altering a University-owned house in the rear of Hill Auditorium, for the use of the School of Music.
August 20, 1929
Present, Regent Beal and Regent Sawyer.
The committee accepted, in accordance with its terms,
and with sincere appreciation, the gift of $20,000 from Miss
Mildred Sheehan of New    York City. The income from
this sum of $20,000 is to be used for scholarships in Aeronautics or Aeronautical Engineering.  Miss Sheehan's letter, stating her desire to make this gift and outlining its
provisions, is as follows:"To the Honorable Board of Regents.
Gentlemen:"It is my desire to establish a scholarship in
memory of my brother, Frank P. Sheehan, to be




8             OCTOBER MEETING, I929
known as the Frank Sheehan Scholarship in Aeronautics.
"I therefore give, devise, and bequeath to the
Regents of the University of Michigan the sum of
$20,000.00, the income of which is to be used as a
scholarship or scholarships, for a student or students
who intend to follow a career in Aeronautics or
Aeronautical Engineering.
"The scholarship is. to be available to students
in the College of Engineering who have completed
at least the work of the first two years with a grade
distinctly above the average, and who are also of
good character and in good standing in the University. In general the scholarship is to be awarded
for one year, but the holder or holders are to be
eligible for re-election, if in the opinion of the committee such action is considered desirable.
"The committee for the award of the scholarship or scholarships shall consist of the Dean of the
College of Engineering and such other members of
the Faculty as he shall appoint, and their decision
shall be final.
"In the event that the sums available hereunder
for the purposes stated shall, in the opinion of the
said Regents, at any time exceed the need therefor,
then such excess income may be used by the Regents
for the advancement of research in Engineering and
for educational purposes generally, in such amount
and in such manner as they may from time to time
deem best.
"Upon notice that my gift is accepted under
the terms of this letter, I will forward a check for
$20,000.*
Yours very truly,
August 17, 1929                Mildred Sheehan"

my said sister Caecilie during her lifetime and that the
balance if any of the said residue be used for the
promotion of scientific work at the University of
Michigan. I therefore make the following provisions
to those ends.
VII. I give, devise, and bequeath all of the said residue of
my estate to the Board of Regents of the University
of Michigan upon the following condition and not
otherwise, viz., that the said Board of Regents shall
enter into a binding obligation to pay to my said sister
Caecilie the sum of $I,ooo dollars per annum as long
as she may live, or until the sum of said payments
shall equal the principal sum of said residue and
interest thereon at the rate of five (5) perC centum on
the portions of said principal remaining after said
payments to her are made, it being my desire that
the said Board of Regents shall be under no obligation
to pay in any event any larger amount than obtained
from the proceeds of the said residue of my estate;
said sum of one thousand ($i,ooo.oo) dollars per annum to be paid to my said sister in two equal semiannual installments of five hundred ($500.00) dollars
each, in cash free and clear of any tax or charge
levied by the United States, or the State of Michigan
or any political subdivision thereof against my said
estate or any interest of my said sister under provisions of this will, the first of said semi-annual installments to be paid to my said sister as soon after
my death as possible.  Subject to the performance
of the said condition and provisions aforesaid, the
said residue of my estate is hereby bequeathed and devised to the said Board of Regents for such university
purposes as they may see fit. It is my desire however
that it shall be used for the promotion of scientific
work.
VIII. The foregoing paragraph VII is to take effect only in
case my said sister Caecilie shall survive me. If she
shall die during my lifetime then said paragraph VII
shall have no force and effect and in such case, I give,
devise, and bequeath all of the said residue of my
estate to the Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan for such university purposes as they may

see fit. It is.my desire however that the said residue
be used for the promotion of scientific work.
IX. In the event that my said sister Caecilie should survive me, and the provisions of paragraph VII cannot or shall not be carried into effect by reason of
the refusal of the said Board of Regents to accept the
condition thereof, or for any other reason, then in
such event and not otherwise, I give, devise, and bequeath all said residue of my estate to the Union
Trust Company, a corporation of the City of Detroit and State of Michigan, upon trust to invest and
re-invest the same for the following purposes.   I
direct that my said trustee shall pay to my said sister
Caecilie the sum of one thousand ($I,ooo.oo) dollars
per annum during her lifetime or until said trust fund
shall become exhausted in two semi-annual installments of five hundred ($500.00) dollars each, in cash
free and clear of any tax or charge levied by the
United States or the State of Michigan or any political
subdivision thereof against my said estate or any interest of my said sister under the provisions of this
will, the first of said semi-annual installments to be
paid to my said sister as soon after my death as possible. Upon the death of my sister, I direct that
said trust shall cease and the entire remaining proceeds of my estate, if any there be, then in the hands
of my trustee shall be paid to the Board of Regents
of the University of Michigan for such university
purposes as they may see fit. It is my desire that the
funds so remaining shall be used for the promotion of
scientific work.
X. In the event that my said sister Caecilie should survive
me, and the provisions of paragraph VII or paragraph IX cannot, or shall not, be carried into effect,
then in such event and not otherwise, I give, devise
and bequeath all the said residue of my estate both
real and personal to my said sister Caecilie.
The Board accepted from the Literary Class of I928,
per letter of Mr. Henry S. Grinnell, Secretary of the Class,
two funds as follows: -
The present amount of the Literary Class of 1928 Expense fund, subject to check by Robert Leland as President

and Henry S. Grinnell as Secretary, to cover alumni expenses
of the class, $600.
The sum of $I,707.54 to be placed in the Burton Memorial

The Board accepted with thanks the gift of $1,200 from
Mr. Lawrence D. Buhl of Detroit for renewal of the Buhl
Classical Fellowship for the year 1929-1930.
A  communication from    Mr. F. L. D. Goodrich, Associate Librarian, formally notified the Regents, for record,
of the receipt of a gift to the Library of fifty-two separate manuscripts, constituting a collection of the autographs
of Napoleon and his Marshals, by Mr. Orla B. Taylor of
Detroit. The following resolution was adopted in acknowledgment of this splendid gift:Resolved, That the Regents accept with great pleasure
the gift to the University from Mr. Orla B. Taylor, of Detroit, a graduate of the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts, in the class of I886, and of the Law School, in
the class of 1887, of a collection of valuable autographs of
Napoleon, his Marshals, and certain Ministers..These autographs have been installed in a case permitting both display
and secure storage in a unique fashion. The Board is deeply
sensible of the value of this gift, and of the very unusual
manner in which the donor has provided for both safeguarding and exhibiting the autographs presented by him to the
University.
The Board accepted with thanks the contribution of
$150 from   Mr. Fred Ingram, Jr., of Detroit, to constitute
for the present year the Fred Ingram, Jr., Research Fund
in the College of Pharmacy. It is understood that the work
is to be done under the direction of Professor F. F. Blicke.

Regent Stone presented the reports of Price, Waterhouse, and Company, upon the books and accounts of the
Adelia Cheever House, the Alumnae House, Betsy Barbour House, Helen Newberry Residence, the Lawyers' Club,
and Martha Cook Building for the past year (R.P. I926 -1929, pages 768-769). The general report is as follows:Honorable Ralph Stone,
Chairman of the Finance Committee,
The Regents of the University of Michigan,
Detroit, Michigan.
Dear Sir:Pursuant to instructions, we have made an examination
of the books and accounts of certain dormitories of the University of Michigan for the period as stated in the following
description of the exhibits which we submit with this report
thereon, viz.:Adelia Cheever House:
Exhibit I-Statement of assets and liabilities as
at June 30, 1929
do. II-Statement of cash receipts and disbursements for the year ended
June 30, 1929

do. II-Statement of operating income and
expenses for the year ended August 31, 1929
do. III —Statement of cash receipts and disbursements for the year ended August 31, I929

Martha Cook Building:
Exhibit I-Balance sheet as at June 30, I929
do. II-Statement of operating income and
expenses for the year ended June
30, I929
SCOPE OF AUDIT
As on previous occasions our examination was directed
primarily to a verification of the cash receipts and disbursements for the period under review but did not otherwise include a verification of the assets and liabilities, and our report and exhibits are therefore submitted subject to this
general qualification. Our examinations of the books and
accounts of the Alumnae House and Betsy Barbour House
covered the period of ten months ended June 30, 1929, for
the reason that the books of the Alumnae House had only
been posted to June 30, 1929 and our examination in the
case of the Betsy Barbour House was for eleven and onehalf months ended August 15, I929 as the business manager
of this house had resigned as of that date.




64


OCTOBER MEETING, 1929


RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS:The following statement shows the excess of operating
income over disbursements by dormitories for the periods
under review, viz.Adelia  Cheever House, for the     year
ended June 30, 1929.................  849.62
Alumnae House, for the period from September I, 1928 to June 30, 1929......  890.25
Betsy Barbour House, for the period from
September I, 1928 to August 15, 1929.. 1I,726.22
Helen Newberry Residence, for the year
ended August 31, 1929............... 1,671.93
Lawyers' Club, for the year ended June
30,  I929...........................  I9,714.54
Martha Cook Building, for the year ended
June  30,  1929.................... I0,419.II
These statements have been prepared in accordance with
the usual practice of the dormitories of giving effect therein only to receipts and payments.  So far as we were able
to determine the accounts payable outstanding at the end of
the period, in respect of expense items, amounted to:Adelia Cheever House.........................$265.00
Alumnae House.............................. 226.06
CASH ON DEPOSIT WVITH THE TREASURER OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN:We have reconciled the balances as shown by the books
of the dormitories as at the end of the respective periods
with the relative balances as shown by the pass books kept
by the University Treasurer's office.  We have traced all
recorded receipts and deposits for the periods under review
to the accounts with the Treasurer and have examined all
cash receipt tickets to ascertain that receipts for board, room
rent, room deposits, and miscellaneous items had been properly accounted for. All disbursement vouchers drawn on the
accounts of the Treasurer were examined and vendor's invoices or other documentary evidence to substantiate these
disbursements were scrutinized by us except in the case of
the Alumnae House where, in many instances, particularly
during the period subsequent to March I, I929, the detail
supporting the disbursements had not been retained.  Although the disbursements as shown by the books of the dormitories appeared to be in order, the distribution of the
charges in respect thereof was not always made to the proper




OCTOBER Ml EETING, p9 9


65


accounts. We, however, have not attempted to make a redistribution of the charges for the reason that the net adjustments would have resulted in relatively unimportant transfers between the several expense accounts.
We have made thorough tests of the accuracy of the
footings of the cash books and purchase records and of the
postings from the accounts in these books to the relative accounts in the general ledgers.
IMPREST CASH REVOLVING FUNDS:We have reconciled or compared the balances in these
funds as at the close of the respective periods with certificates furnished us by the depositary banks. In addition, we
have made thorough tests of the accounting for and propriety
of the disbursements from these funds and have ascertained
that all reimbursing checks drawn upon the account with the
Treasurer have been properly treated.  In the case of the
Alumnae House, however, we have not been able to satisfy
ourselves as to the nature and propriety of the disbursements owing to the lack of evidence.
INVESTMENT'S IN BONDS AND MORTGAGES:The investments of the dormitories in bonds and notes
receivable secured by first mortgages on real estate are kept
under the control of the Treasurer of the University for safekeeping. At the time of our count of the securities held by
the Treasurer as at June 30, 1929 the securities held for
the dormitories were inspected.  In the case of securities
purchased subsequent to the date of our inspection, we have
examined the records in respect thereof and have obtained
certificates to the effect that these securities were actually
on hand as at the date of the close of the period under review.
ACCOUNTS NOT VERIFIED: —
As in our previous examinations, we have not verified
the property and equipment accounts, inventories, room deposit and surplus accounts except with respect to the changes
occurring in the respective periods under review.
We have verified the current additions to the property
and equipment accounts by an examination of the relative
vendor's invoices or other documentary evidence and have
ascertained that they are proper capital charges. The books
of Helen Newberry Residence do not show a liability of $3,291.68 for cost and installation of linoleum; we understand
payment is being withheld for the reason that the work had
not been done satisfactorily.




66


OCTOBER MEETING, 1929


In most cases sufficient data was not available for us
to verify the clerical accuracy of the inventories and we have
used the book figures in respect thereof in the annexed exhibits.
Room deposit accounts were adjusted by us, when required, to show the liability outstanding as at the end of the
respective periods in respect of the amounts subject to refund to applicants for residence, at the expiration of the
terms thereof.
We have submitted reports on our examination of the
accounts of each of the dormitories to the Board of Regents.
Yours very truly,
Price, Waterhouse & Co.
September 27, 1929
A  copy of the report from    each individual dormitory has
been sent to the Board of Governors of that dormitory.
The annual Financial Report of the Secretary and Business Manager and the Treasurer for the year ended June
30, 1929, was filed and was accepted and adopted by the
Regents as the report of the Board to the Governor of the
State. Authority was given to insert into the copy as filed
one or two pages of summary and comments by the Business Manager.    The usual number of copies was ordered
printed.
Regent Stone as Chairman of the Finance Committee
made the following written report which, along with the
audit made by Price, Waterhouse, and Company, was accepted and placed on file     (R.P. 1926-1929, pages 760 -768):
To the Board of Regents,
University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Gentlemen:I present herewith report made by Price, Waterhouse,
and Company of the examination of the books and accounts of.
the University for year ended June 30, I929, and also certified
balance sheet as of the same date.
The examination has been made in the same manner and
scope as previous audits, which shows that the books and
records of the University are in excellent shape and that
there are no important recommendations for changes therein.




OCTOBER MEETING, 129 9Q

The excess of expenditures over revenue of the University Hospital for the year amounted to $25,657.50 after deducting Purchases of Equipment of $42,920.73 and Transfers
for Equipment Replacements of $63,236.78.
The securities held in trust have been verified by an inspection of them and by certificates obtained from the depositaries holding them. Receipts of income from securities
have been properly accounted for.
Respectfully submitted,
Ralph Stone,
Chairman, Finance Committee
October 4, 1929
Honorable Ralph Stone,
Chairman of the Finance Committee,
The Regents of the University of Michigan,
Detroit, Michigan.
Dear Sir:In accordance with instructions and in continuation of
our previous audits, we have made an examination of the
books and accounts of the University of Michigan for the
year ended June 30, I929. Our examination, as on previous
occasions, has been directed to the verification of the balance
sheet of the University at June 30, I929, a copy of which is
annexed hereto as Exhibit I. In addition we have compared
the joint report of the Secretary and the Treasurer with the
relative records and have found that the report has been prepared in accordance therewith.  It will be understood that
our examination did not include a check of the detailed cash
and other transactions of the period under review and this
report is submitted subject to this general reservation. The
books have been kept on a cash basis except in respect of
accounts receivable.
UNIVERSITY ACCOUNTS
With reference to our verification of the balance sheet
of the University at June 30, 1929 we have the following
comments to offer:ASSETS FOR CURRENT AND SPECIAL PURPOSES$2,899,820. 9:The cash in the custody of the University Treasurer for
current and special purposes at June 30, 1929 amounted to
$724,824.08 comprising the amount of $636,455.83 for current




68


OCTOBER IMEETING, 1929


purposes and $88,368.25 for special purposes. The funds on
hand, amounting to $5,355.26 were verified by actual count
as of the close of business on June 30, I929 and the cash
in banks as at that date in the amount of $719,468.82 was
reconciled with certificates furnished us by the depositary
banks.
The cash in the hands of the State Treasurer for current and special purposes amounted to I$,476,942.77 and comprised the amount of $925,I74.80 for current purposes and
$551,767.97 for special purposes. We have received a certificate from the State Administrative Board in confirmation of
these amounts as the balances of unexpended appropriations
at June 30, 1929.
The inventory of materials and supplies amounting to
$422,959.35 represents the total of physical inventories taken
as of June 30, 1929 at the principal storehouses, a comparative summary of which follows:Increase
Storehouse                  June 30            or
1928        I929   *decrease
General storehouse......$I46,685.8I I$56,137.87 $ 9,452.06
University  Hospital..... I27,218.60  II6,664.39  *10,554.2I
Chemistry.............. 82,464.48  108,219.37  25,754.89
Printing and binding dept.  8,765.7I   7,424.4I * I,341.30
Power plant, coal only...  23,637.99  34,513.3I  10,875.32
Totals............ $388,772.59 $422,959.35 $34,186.76
We have tested the clerical accuracy of the inventories
and have satisfied ourselves that the basis of pricing adopted
represented approximate cost.  Furthermore, we have been
furnished with a certificate signed by a responsible official
of the University as to the accuracy of the quantities and
of the inventories in general.
The item   of accounts receivable represents the total
amount of charges to outsiders for materials and supplies
sold and for services rendered, uncollected at June 30, 1929.
The inclusion of these accounts in the balance sheet as at
June 30, 1929 is in continuation of the policy adopted in the
previous year in order to show all the assets of the University. As mentioned in our report as at June 30, 1928,
the credits in respect of the charges to accounts receivable
are not made to income or asset accounts of the University
until the cash has been actually received.  The accounting
system of the University Hospital provides for credits to




OCTOBER MEETING, 1929


69


the proper income accounts at the time the charges accrue, but
these accounts are kept in separate records apart from the
University records kept in the Secretary's office. Consequently the credits to hospital sales and services are made in
the Secretary's office only when the cash is actually received.
We have checked the detail of the accounts receivable of the
Hospital and the University to subsidiary control records
and have found the aggregate of the individual accounts
to be in agreement with the controlling accounts. The collectibility of the hospital accounts was discussed with a responsible hospital official in whose opinion the reserve for bad
debts in the amount of $24,210.7I, should prove adequate for
its purpose.  The following summary shows the changes
which have occurred in the hospital accounts receivable during the year ended June 30, I929, viz.:Balance at June 30, 1928..............$ 337,454.78
Add-Charges during the year......... 2,530,518.76
Together...................... $2,867,973.54
Deduct-Collections for the year....... 2,612,863.I8
$ 255,II0.36
Deduct-Accounts    determined  to  be
worthless, written off.............  27,184.83
Balance at June 30, I929..............$ 227,925.53
INVESTMENTS (OTHER THAN TRUST FUNDS)-$550,384.40:The amounts of the Original Federal Endowment and
Treadwell Free Bed Funds have not changed during the
period under review and were confirmed to us by a certificate from the State Administrative Board. We have verified
the interest received during the period from these funds in
the amounts of $38,403.72 and $50.00 respectively as shown on
Schedule 3 of the Financial Report of the Secretary and the
Treasurer.
EDUCATIONAL PLANT-$35,221,708.25:Schedule 12 of the Financial Report of the Secretary
and the Treasurer shows the amounts of the additions
to the educational plant for the year ended June 30, 1929
and of the sales and other dispositions of property. We have
examined recorded deeds conveying all lands acquired to the
Regents of the University, and receipted vouchers, and vendors' invoices in support of the major expenditures for addi



70


OCTOBER MEETING, 1929


tions during the year to lands, buildings, land improvements,
and equipment. As in prior years, we have not been able to
ascertain definitely that all of the charges to the equipment
account represent actual additions and not replacements. The
determination of which equipment items had been replaced
during the period could only be satisfactorily made by a
physical inventory of the equipment which has not been taken
for several years.

the year in the amount of $465,950.00oo to meet expenditures
in respect of construction work on the new Michigan League
Building.  Further details relative to changes in the trust
fund accounts are shown on Schedule 14 of the Financial
Report of the Secretary and the Treasurer.
The securities held in trust by the Treasurer of the
University at June 30, I929 at a carrying value of $3,154,013.69 have been verified by inspection of securities in the
custody of the Treasurer and by certificates obtained from
the depositaries holding securities.  We have satisfied our

The reduction in the amount of real estate bonds was
caused by the sales of bonds carried in the Michigan League
Building Fund, the proceeds being expended for construction
purposes, as stated elsewhere in this report. The increase in
the other classes of bonds is attributed to gifts.
The item of trust fund real estate amounting to $543,324.07 as shown on the statement of trust fund investments,
Schedule D of the Financial Report of the Secretary and the
Treasurer, has been increased during the period under review
by a net amount of $7,470.39. Additions in the amount of
$7,670.39 represented the cost of construction to June 30, 1929
of the new Herbst residence while the reduction of $200.00




72             OCTOBER      MEETING, PI29
represented the proceeds from the sale of certain land in
Chaves County, New Mexico, forming a part of the Coolidge
Free Bed Fund.
The cash balances in the custody of the University
Treasurer of the various trust funds and deposit accounts
amounted to $164,309.38 and have been verified by, or reconciled with, certificates received from the depositaries.
We have ascertained that the receipts of all income from
securities have been properly accounted for and have satisfied
ourselves generally that income received from specifically
invested funds has been properly allocated and that income
received from consolidated investments has been fairly and
correctly prorated on the basis previously adopted to the funds
entitled to a portion thereof. Furthermore, we have ascertained that the procedure adopted by the Regents at their
meeting held on May 25, 1928 relative to the classification
and segregation of trust funds, the apportionment of trust
fund earnings, and creation of reserves to cover losses from
investments and uncollectible student loans has been followed
and that the accounts have been correctly drawn up in accordance therewith at June 30, 1929.
GENERAL
In considering the annexed balance sheet of the University and the Financial Report of the Secretary and the
Treasurer at June 30, 1929, it should be understood that they
are based on the cash actually received and disbursed by the
University to that date with the exception that accounts receivable uncollected at June 30, I929 have been included in
the balance sheet as assets. The balance sheet is incomplete
to the extent that unaudited vouchers outstanding and items of
accrued liabilities and income have not been included.
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL ACCOUNTS
Our comments relative to the examination of the hospital accounts receivable have been made in a previous section of this report.
We have annexed hereto as Exhibit II a statement of the
revenues and expenditures of the University Hospital for the
year ended June 30, 1929, included in the Financial Report
of the Secretary and the Treasurer as Schedule 20. As shown
on this statement, the excess of expenditures over revenue for
the year ended June 30, 1929 amounted to $25,657.50 after




OCTOBER MEETING, 1929


73


including deductions for a provision for loss from bad debts
in the amount of 1I5,000.00, expenditures for equipment
from general funds in the amount of $42,920.73, and transfers
to the trust fund for equipment replacements in the amount
of $63,236.78. This statement has been prepared to reflect
the results of the financial conduct of the hospital on the
basis outlined and adopted by the Board of'Regents at their
meeting held on June 12, 1925 to the effect that the earnings
of the hospital as determined on an accrual basis should be
sufficient to meet all expenditures concerned with the care
of patients. With this basis in mind it should be understood
that the item designated as fees for board and room, etc.,
amounting to $2,603,974.9I represents the accrued revenue
for the year without regard to cash collections in respect
thereof. It might be of interest in this connection to note
that the sales and services of the hospital for the year as
determined on a cash basis and represented by actual net
receipts amounted to $2,686,319.33 as shown in Schedule 3
of the Financial Report.
Expenditures for salaries and wages, food, supplies and
other expenses, and equipment additions, together with transfers to the trust fund for equipment replacement, represent
actual cash expenditures or appropriations. These items however are practically stated on an accrual basis for the reason
that effort was made to include in the period under review
payments for all vouchers for expense items applicable
thereto. The item of gas, water, and electricity represents
the expense thereof as determined from meter readings by
the University. The item of power house expense comprises
the portion determined to be applicable to the Hospital
through an apportionment of the power house expense for the
year over the several building groups of the University as determined by the average cost on the bases of units of
radiation, cubical content, and floor area. The item of transfers to trust fund for equipment replacement represents the
total amount of funds to be transferred from the general
funds of the University to trust funds less expenditures
therefrom for equipment replacements during the period under
review. This amount had not actually been transferred as at
June 30, 1929.
Yours very truly,

OCTOBER MEETING, I929


We have examined the accounts of the University of
Michigan for the year ended June 30, 1929 which have been
kept on a cash basis with the exception of the inclusion of
accounts receivable and we certify that the foregoing balance sheet has been correctly prepared therefrom and, in our
opinion, is properly drawn up so as to show the financial
position of the University on that date. We further certify
that the relative financial statements annexed hereto and
forming a part of the annual report of the University are
in accordance with the books of account.

Regent Stone made a brief report with respect to the
unexpended amount on hand both from       the continuing income and with respect to balances saved and carried over
from the fiscal year I928-I929.
The Board allocated, similarly to the preceding year
(R.P. 1926-1929, page 789), the sum    of $250,000 as a reserve for the provision of equipment in the budget of I930 -I93I. The sum of $I60,687.26 contributed to the balance
on hand June 30, I929 by the University Hospital through
the more nearly up-to-date condition of the collection of
its current outstanding accounts and by economy        in its
operation, was set aside as a general reserve against a possible inability of the Hospital in a future year to meet its
cash outgo by cash collections.    The purpose of this reserve thus is to protect the University's general funds
against embarrassing demands which a less favorable Hospital experience would surely create.
Regent Gore made special and feeling reference to the
fact of the resignation of Regent Benjamin S. Hanchett
and presented the following statement which was unanimously adopted and ordered transmitted to former Regent
Hanchett:
During the past eighteen years, Honorable Benjamin S.
Hanchett has served the University of Michigan as member
of its Board of Regents. Ill health has suddenly forced his
resignation, and we are deprived of his helpful work and
cordial co-operation in the discharge of our responsibilities.
We, therefore, record our high appreciation of his faithful
and efficient service, as well as our sincere regret that he




OCTOBER MEETING, 1929


75


has found it necessary to terminate his membership on this
Board.
There were placed on file two letters from Mr. Martin
H. Carmody of Grand Rapids, Michigan, dated respectively June 22 and July 22, with acknowledgments thereof by
the Secretary of the Board dated respectively July I and
July 23.  Mr. Carmody expressed his disapproval of portions of the Baccalaureate address and of the Commencement address. The Regents adopted the following resolution:
Resolved, That public pronouncements of their opinions
by officers of the University are not to be taken as made
ex catlhedra, unless formally endorsed by the Board of
Regents.
The University Librarian having reported to the Regents on July 13 and August 23 two gifts to the Medical
Library from   Dr. LeRoy Crummer (B.S. I893, Litt.D.,
1929), one a set of very beautiful copies of all the earlier
editions of the Religio Miedici of Sir Thomas Browne including the rare First Edition of I642, and the second,
certain very scarce books illustrating the history of medicine, the Board adopted the following resolution:Resolved, That the Regents accept with gratitude and
sincere pleasure the books recently presented to the Medical
Library by Dr. LeRoy Crummer and direct that this expression of their appreciation be officially conveyed to Dr.
Crummer.
In view of the fact that owners of land abutting on
Forest Hill Cemetery, and the Cemetery Company, desire
to erect a fence along the line of the cemetery property,
the Board voted that the University would pay 50%       of
the cost of the fence between the cemetery and University
property.  The University's share of approximately 650
feet of fencing thus involved, it is estimated will amount to
about $325.
The Board referred to the School of Forestry and Conservation for report at the November meeting the tentative
offer of a citizen of the State to present to the University
200 acres of reforested land.   This proposal was trans

mitted to the Regents by Regent-elect R. Perry Shorts of
Saginaw.
The Business Manager reported for the committee given
power at the June meeting (R.P. I926-1929, page 999)
that the general contract for the University Elementary
School had been let to Spence Brothers of Saginaw for
$381,120.32, on the basis of revised plans and specifications.
Mechanical trades are being done by the Buildings and
Grounds Department.   An allowance of $6,320 had been
made to Malcomson and Higginbotham for plans for the
Infant School (R.P. I926-I929, page 729) which had to
be abandoned for lack of funds.
The Board authorized the Buildings and Grounds Department, on the request of Mr. W. W. Cook, the architects, York and Sawyer, and the contractor, the James
Baird Company, to perform the mechanical trades in the
construction of the Legal Research Building and of the
John P. Cook Dormitory (R.P. 1926-1929, pages 949-950),
on such terms and conditions as might be agreed upon
between the contractor and the Business Manager of the
University, provided always that the University should be
reimbursed by the contractor for all of its expenditures, with
reasonable overhead.
The Secretary called the attention of the Regents to
such progress as has been made by the City of Ann Arbor
in the solution of its sewage disposal problem to which problem the University is to contribute financial co-operation
(R.P. I926-I929, page 778).
Request having been made by a representative of the
widow of the late Williston S. Hough, who has a life interest in his estate which will ultimately constitute the Hough
Scholarship in Sociology and Ethics   (R.P. 1910-1914,
page 944, and R.P. I926-1929, page 673), that certain securities be sold and the proceeds invested in securities productive of a larger income, the Regents authorized communication of the following statement:The Regents assume that the testator would desire that
a reasonable income for his widow should be obtained and
that the University is concerned only with the safety of
the principal. The Regents, therefore, will oppose no objection to the action of the New York Trust Company as




OCTOBER MEETING, 9p29


77


trustee if they convert the American Telephone and Telegraph stock to other securities which in the opinion of the
Trust Company are proper investments for the trust and
which will produce the increased income needed by Mrs.
Hough.
The responsibility for the selection of these investments
of course rests with the Trust Company as trustee.
It having been discovered that the executors of the
estate of the late Levi L. Barbour apparently overlooked
entirely two lots in the village of Burnaby, a suburb of
Vancouver, British Columbia, which two lots were owned
half-and-half by the late Regent Barbour and his friend
Mr. Walter W. Smith, who is also deceased, the Regents
approved the sale of these two lots for the sum of $I,ooo,
with the understanding that a good title can be given without warranty deed by the University and without probating the estate of Regent Barbour in British Columbia, and
with the further understanding that after meeting legal
expenses estimated at $250, the sale will thus net the Barbour Scholarship fund approximately $250.
The Board appointed Regent Beal and such other Regent as he might select as delegates of the Board of Regents
to the next meeting of the Association of Governing Boards
of State Universities and Allied Institutions, to be held at
Purdue University November 7, 8, and 9.
The committee appointed by the Regents at the March
meeting (R.P. I926-I929, page 947) to make allocations
of such sums as might be necessary for the new     Camp
Davis Construction account, reported total allocations of
$II,887.86 in addition to the original appropriation by the
Regents of $Io,ooo (R.P. I926-1929, page 894).
A communication received from   the Dormitory Committee of the Alumnae Council dated June 24, signed by
Mrs. Arthur Colten as Chairman, was received and placed
on file.
The Board approved nominations by the proper committees to scholarships and stipends for 1929-1930 as follows:

The Secretary reported for record that the great seal
of the University dated I8I7 had been used on all official
documents, including diplomas, issued on and after July i,
I929. The use of the new seal in electrotype form begins
in the Official Publications of Volume 31, with Number I6,
dated August 31 (R.P. I926-I929, pages IOI8 and 993).
The Board formally recorded the following resolution
adopted, as of September 20, the action being taken by letters and by other communications by wire:Resolved, That the Regents hereby delegate to the Dean
of Administration the powers and duties of the President
of the University until further action by the Regents.
Formal record was made of the following deed of gift
by Mr. William     W. Cook and of acceptance thereof by
vote by mail under date of August 17 to August 19. The

free to such libraries as said Regents may direct and other

OCTOBER 3MEETING, 1929


The following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That Dean Emeritus Myra B. Jordan be asked
to take such part in the directing of the affairs of the
Office of Advisers of Women for one year as her time and
strength will permit and be it further moved that for the
year I929-1930 the retiring allowance of Dean Jordan be

New York City, October 25 to 31.
The salary of Assistant Professor Lewis B. Kellum was
increased from  $2,600 to $3,o00 for the year 1929-1930.
This action adds $500 to the budget of the Department of
Geology.
The salary of Instructor Theodore Hornberger, of the
Department of Rhetoric, was increased from $I,8oo to
$2,000 for the University year I929-I930. This action does
not increase the Salary budget of the Department.

The salary of Persis Cope, Teacher of Latin in the University High School, was increased from $i,Ioo to $1,500

In continuation of our previous examination we have
traced the cash receipts for the two months' period, as
evidenced by the duplicate cash receipt tickets, into the
deposit account kept with the University Treasurer and we
have examined canceled checks, vendors' invoices, and other
documentary evidence in support of disbursements made
during the period. We have compared the balance at August
31, I929, as shown by the passbook kept in the Treasurer's
office with the balance as shown by the books of the Alumnae
House and found them to be in agreement. We have verified
the accuracy of the footings of the purchase record and the
cash book.

Imprest cash   fund...........          50.00  $I88.30


The balance of $50.0o at August 3I, 1929, in the imprest cash revolving fund was reconciled with a certificate
obtained from the bank. All deposits in this account of funds
withdrawn from the account with the University Treasurer
were traced into the bank, but we were not able to satisfy ourselves as to the nature of the disbursements owing to the
lack of evidence. 'However, we have examined canceled
checks issued on this fund during the period.
In connection with the account entitled "Sinking Fund"
carried on the books at August 31, 1929, in the amount of
$2,018.I3, we have the following comments to offer:



DECEMBER MEETING, 1929


127


We have ascertained, in so far as possible, that the balance of this account at August 31, I929, comprises the following:Sinking fund investments, represented by bonds in
the custody of the University Treasurer........ $I,Ioo.oo
Sinking fund interest account, represented by interest received from investments, and also in the custody of the University Treasurer............   191.23
Balance of bank account at August 31, 1929, in
the name of the Board of Governors of the
Alumnae House as confirmed by certificate received from the bank........................  2.    4
Together.......................... $,673.27
Balance as shown by the books at August 31, 1929 2,018.13
D iffe rence.....................................  $344.86
We have ascertained that the bank account had been
opened prior to the year 1923 and has been fairly active. The
present Treasurer of the Board of Governors has informed us
that the expenditures represented purchase of equipment and
other items but that it is not possible at this time to classify
'the nature of the disbursements. In view of this condition and
for the reason that an inventory of equipment has been made
at June 30, 1927, and the value thereof placed on the books,
we have adjusted the balance of the "Sinking Fund" at
August 3I, 1929, by charging the difference of $344.86 to
surplus.
It would appear that this account is mis-named and
should bear the title of "Reserve Fund for Equipment Replacement" or some other appropriate title, as we have been
informed that the fund was created for the purpose of
providing for the replacements of present equipment and the
purchase of new equipment.
Yours very truly,
PRICE, WATIRHOUSE AND COMPANY
Detroit, November 21, I929

upon a substantially fenced site of somewhat over two hundred acres, owned by Dr. W. W. Newcombe, on the left
bank of the Huron River between Dexter and Pinckney,
which could be purchased for $30,000. The Regents approved the site recommended, and approved application to
the State Administrative Board for the release of the sum




I30


DECEMBER MEETING, 1929


of $30,000, under Public Act No. 324 of 1929, for the
purchase of the desired land.
The Regents authorized the appointment of Carleton
Barnhart Peirce, M.S., M.D., as Assistant Professor of
Roentgenology in the Medical School, to date from July I,
I930, on the express provision that the budget of the Medical School be not increased thereby.
The Board referred to the President with power a request from the Dean of the Medical School for the appointment of Mr. Herbert J. Seddon, F.R.C.S., to be Instructor
in Surgery at the rate of $2,000 per year, twelve-months
basis, the appointment to date, if made, from early in January, I930.
Nelson P. Case was appointed Assistant Investigator in
the Department of Engineering Research for one year,
twelve-months basis, beginning December I, I929, with
salary at the rate of $3,600 per year. The compensation is
to be paid from funds furnished by the Grigsby-Grunow
Company.
The Board declined to authorize a reorganization of the
Department of Anesthesia, in the Medical School, and to
allow a proposed leave of absence for Mrs. Laura Davis
Dunstone, Instructor in Anesthesia.
The Regents gave general approval, after eliminating
two items and inserting two others, to the so-called Alumni
Ten-Year Program, in accordance with a detailed, written
statement thereof filed by the President with each member
of the Board (page 122).
The Board approved a program for a six-year combined
curriculum  in Engineering and Law as recommended by
Dean Sadler of the Colleges of Engineering and Architecture
and by Dean Bates of the Law School. The curriculum
will lead, in the case of qualifying students, to the degrees
of "Bachelor of Science in Engineering    (Law)" and
"Bachelor of Laws."
Dean Dana communicated to the Regents the fact that
a public-spirited citizen was considering the endowment of
the work of the School of Forestry and Conservation to a
considerable degree, but desired to know whether such a
gift, if tendered, would be acceptable to the Regents and to
what extent it was the purpose of the Regents to develop the




DECEMBER MEETING, 1929


I31


School of Forestry and Conservation. The Regents voted
that the proposed gift would be most gratefully received and
administered in the light of the policy embodied in the two
following resolutions:Resolved, That the Board of Regents approves of the
development of the School of Forestry and Conservation
as rapidly as this can be done without disregarding the interests of other units; and
Resolved, firther, That the Board of Regents approves
of the formation of a standing committee on the Zoological
Curriculum, to be composed of the chairman of the Department of Zoology, the Director of the Museum of Zoology,
the Director of the Laboratory of Mammal Genetics, the
Director of the Biological Station, and the Professor of Zoology in the School of Forestry and Conservation. The chairman is to be selected by the committee. The duties of this
committee shall be to supervise generally all curricula leading
to degrees in zoology and to co-ordinate instruction so as to
avoid duplication.
The Board voted not to publish an edition of the Alumni Catalogue in I930, this action being based on the expense
of such publication, and on the fact that the alphabetical and
geographical lists on file in the Alumni Catalogue Office are
always available for proper consultation.
The sum of $2,000 was voted as a special grant to the
General Library for binding books.
A special grant of $I,ooo was voted for the purchase, by
the General Library, of works in the fields of classical archaeology.
The sum of $500 was added to the Salary account of
the Department of Rhetoric, and Mr. Herbert Rix and Mr.
Harold Ott were each appointed Assistant in Rhetoric for
the present University year with salary of $250 each.
A  sum  not in excess of $600 was voted to meet the
expense of sending one hundred and fifty copies of the
Michiganensian, of the present year, to a list of selected high
schools.

alumni of the College of Architecture, and from other architects, with reference to problems involved in the proposed
organization of the College of Architecture separately from
the College of Engineering. This communication was referred to the committee appointed by the Regents in April
1928, to consider this subject (R.P. I926-I929, page 560).
The laboratory hitherto known as the Laboratory of
Mammalian Genetics was redesignated as the Laboratory of
Vertebrate Genetics.
The President filed a letter from Mr. William W. Cook
declining the invitation to give the Commencement address
of I930 (page I46).
The President notified the Regents that the Carnegie Institute of Washington had presented to the University the
sum of $250 for use in investigations to be conducted at
Tucson, Arizona, by Dr. Lee R. Dice of the Museum of




JANUARY MIEETING, I930


Zoology, provided that the Regents would give leave of
absence with pay to Dr. Dice from and including the last
week in February and through the months of March and
April. In view of the purposes to be served by the investigation, the contribution by the Carnegie Institute was accepted with thanks, and the leave requested was granted to
Dr. Dice.
The following communication was received (pages I30 -I31):
To the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Gentlemen:It is my desire to establish an endowed foundation of
approximately $200,000 or more in the University of Michigan for the promotion of practical forest land management
in the broadest sense of the term, in accordance with the
terms and conditions outlined in this letter.
I. This fund is to be designated as the George Willis
Pack Forestry Foundation. This foundation is established
in the University of Michigan on account of its prestige, its
facilities for teaching the broad principles of all phases of
practical forestry, and its experienced staff; and on the definite assurance from the Board of Regents that the School
of Forestry and Conservation has its hearty support and will
continue to be developed as an outstanding institution as
rapidly as the resources of the University permit.
2. This foundation will constitute a permanent endowment and will be administered by the Board of Regents in
accordance with the procedure governing the administration
of its other permanent funds. The available income will be
placed at the disposal of the School of Forestry and Conservation for the purposes outlined in this letter.
3. The purpose of this foundation is to advance practical forest land management in the broadest sense of the
term. This will involve the application in the woods of
promising silvicultural methods, the harmonizing of silvicultural and utilization requirements, and the development of
working plans with a view to the organization of forest
properties on a sustained yield basis. The marketing at a
profit of wood and wood products, such as may be produced
under silvicultural methods, is recognized as holding an important place in practical forest land management. The silviculture practiced on any given area must, therefore, be such




I62


JANT UARY MEETING, 1930


as to eventuate in the profitable marketing of the products
derived therefrom.
4. In all of the activities carried on under the George
Willis Pack Forestry Foundation complete and accurate records should be kept of all operations performed, costs incurred, and silvicultural and financial results obtained, with
a view to determining the effectiveness of the work from the
standpoint both of its technical efficiency and of its present
or future economic feasibility.
5. The income from the George Willis Pack Foundation fund should be used for the salary and expenses of an
experienced forester, to be known as the George Willis Pack
Professor of Forest Land Management, and for such expenditures as may be necessary in carrying out the purposes
of this foundation. The George Willis Pack Professor of
Forest Land Management should devote his time chiefly to
furthering the practice of forestry in the woods rather than
in the classroom; but may assist in the instruction of graduate or undergraduate students. He should have ample opportunity for travel outside of the State of Michigan, in order
to keep in close touch with forest conditions and practices
elsewhere and in order to make the results of his experience
as widely available as possible.
6. In the work of the George Willis Pack Forestry
Foundation and of the George Willis Pack Professor of
Forest Land Management the relation of wild life and recreation to forest land management will not be emphasized for
the present. Wvhile these aspects of forestry are recognized
as important, the purpose of the donor in creating the George
Willis Pack Forestry Foundation is to lay stress upon the
production and utilization of wood and cellulose in their various forms.
7. For the immediate future, activities under the foundation should probably center around the following projects:a. The development of the University's property of 3,300 acres at the Biological Station on
Douglas Lake in Cheboygan County. This area, formerly covered with a fine stand of white and Norway pine, was badly burned after logging and is
now covered with an inferior stand of aspen, with
scattering jack, white, and Norway pine and miscellaneous hardwoods. It is characteristic of millions
of acres of similar land in the Lower Peninsula and
its restoration to full productivity by planting and
improvement cuttings would serve as an excellent
example of the possibilities in this direction. Situ



JANUARY MEETING, 1930


I63


ated as it is within a few miles of the City of
Cheboygan and in the immediate vicinity of several
summer camps, and serving as it does as headquarters for the Biological Station with a summer attendance of approximately one hundred students
from all parts of the country, it is particularly well
located for demonstration purposes.
b. The management of the University's property of some 3,000 acres on Sugar Island in the St.
Mary's River. This tract was burned perhaps fifty
years ago and is now covered with a well-stocked
second growth consisting of a wide variety of both
hardwoods and softwoods. It is just at the point
where clearings, thinnings, and improvement cuttings
are much needed and would greatly increase the
value of the final crop. The tract is in a well-developed recreation area and will doubtless attract many
visitors as an example of good forest land management.
c. Development as a demonstration and research forest of the Beaver Lake Tract, which the
University hopes to acquire, in Alger County in the
Upper Peninsula. This tract, with some 7,000 acres
of land and i,ooo acres of water, is largely covered
with a forest of virgin hardwoods, and thus offers
an unequalled opportunity to demonstrate the practical application of silviculture and utilization in forest land management from the beginning of logging
operations through the establishment and subsequent
growth of the new stand to its eventual utilization.
In the heart of the big timber belt of the Upper
Peninsula, and immediately adjacent to a proposed
state park, the area is ideally located for this purpose.
d. Co-operation with forest land owners, particularly in the northern part of the state, in handling
demonstrations of forest land management by private owners on a commercial scale. This will involve
a thorough study of present methods of operation and possible modifications, a comparison of the
silvicultural and financial results being obtained
under present methods with the probable results
under improved methods, and finally the actual trying out in commercial practice of those methods
which promise most in the way of forest improve



I64


JANUARY MEETING, 1930


ment and economic returns. Tests of this sort would
constitute one of the best possible demonstrations
of practical forest land management.
e. Co-operation with the state and federal government in the handling of state and federal forest
lands. Opportunities in this direction will doubtless
increase as the results obtained by the George Willis
Pack Professor of Forest Land Management become
better known and create a corresponding demand for
his services.
8. It is also understood that during the lifetime of the
donor, or of his son, Arthur Newton Pack of Princeton,
New Jersey, Individual Trustee of the Charles Lathrop
Pack Forestry Trust, the Dean of the School of Forestry
and Conservation at the University of Michigan will willingly confer and advise from time to time with the donor
or his son, above mentioned, regarding the policies and principles to be followed in carrying out the provisions of this
foundation.
Subject to the formal acceptance by the Board of
Regents of the University of Michigan of the terms and
conditions specified in this letter, then on or before the
fifteenth day of March, nineteen hundred thirty, the endowment of $200,000 or more, above mentioned, will be paid over,
either in the form of cash or in the form of securities of
equivalent market value.
Yours very truly,
Charles Lathrop Pack
Lakewood, N. J.
December 3Ist, I929
The proposal was accepted by the Board by unanimous
vote, in accordance with its terms and with profound thanks
to the donor, Mr. Charles Lathrop Pack, for this farsighted
co-operation with the work of the University in general and
the School of Forestry and Conservation in particular.
The President presented the report of Professor Aubrey
Tealdi upon the International Housing and Town Planning
Congress held in Italy last September, to which Professor
Tealdi was a delegate from this University (R.P. I926 -I929, page 936). The report was accepted for filing.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to February 7, 3:30 P.M.

or deans of colleges, of the University admitting students




I66


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1930


directly from high schools. The scholarship is not ordinarily to be divided but may be in special cases. In choosing
the John Blake Scholar or Scholars the committee shall give
first consideration to students coming from  Grand Rapids
(Michigan) Junior College who may be recommended for
such award by the Principal of said Junior College.  In case
there is no student or graduate of the Grand Rapids Junior
College whom the said Principal shall feel justified in recommending for the current year, then the appointment to the
John Blake Scholarship shall be made by the above-named
committee on the basis of its own best judgment of worthiness and.need of any candidate therefor; and,
Resolved, further, That the President be requested to
communicate to Mrs. Katharine Aldrich Blake, grandmother
of John Blake, and the donor of the John Blake Memorial
Scholarship, the sincere thanks of the Board of Regents
for this gift, which will in years to come be of great use and
benefit to many students struggling for an education.
January 20, 1930

the Museum of Zoology and it is understood that the Department of Conservation will transfer to the University $I6,ooo
for I930 and at least an equal amount in subsequent years to
provide salaries for those employed.
The following resolution was adopted (R.P. I926-1929,
pages 849-85I) -
Resolved,
i. That the Legal Research Institute, which is hereby
created, shall be a part of the Law School
2. That it shall be developed as rapidly as funds may be

FEBRUARY MEETING, I930


I69


a formal report at the meeting of April 4 (R.P. I926-I929,
page 905).
After a comprehensive oral report by the President and
discussion by the Board, the following resolution was
adopted:Resolved, That in the interests of greater harmony in
the Medical School, Dr. Cabot is relieved of the duties of
Dean of the School and Director of the Department of
Surgery, and the President is advised to appoint an executive committee of five to direct the affairs of the School
until such time as some other plan is devised.
The Board directed that the recommendation of the President and the Business Manager with respect to readjustments of certain funds held by the Regents be carried out as
outlined below (R.P. 1926-1929, page 893). All these
actions are believed to be in strict harmony with the purposes
of the donors, and are recommended by the committees administering the several funds.
I. The Albert B. Prescott Scholarship in Organic
Chemistry: $2,000 transferred from the expendable fund to
the endowment fund
2. The Trueblood Fellowship: expendable fund to be
transferred to the endowment fund, together with any additional gifts which may be received, until the endowment shall
amount to $20,000. The expendable fund at present transferred amounts to $1,744.57, and the endowment, including
this transfer, to $5,744.57
3. The Good Government Prize fund: $250 transferred
from the expendable fund to the endowment fund
4. Balance of $16.oi in a fund collected for the purpose
of providing a memorial to Professor Albert B. Prescott was
transferred to the expendable fund of the Albert B. Prescott
Scholarship in Organic Chemistry
5. From the James Burrill Angell Memorial fund to the
James Burrill Angell fund, transfer of $431.08, being the
balance remaining in the former fund
6. The surplus of a fund collected for the purpose of
placing a tablet to the memory of Professor Edward D.
Campbell in the Chemistry Building, $390.25, transferred to
an endowment fund to be known as the Edward D. Campbell Endowment, the income of which is to be used for
paying subscriptions to magazines for the Department of
Chemistry




I70


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1930


7. Balance of $12.99 in the Foreign Research fund:
transferred to the Emergency Loan Fund for Foreign
Students
The Board named Regent Sawyer and Dr. Harley A.
Haynes a committee to consider the advisability of designating one of the children's wards in the University Hospital as
"Palmer Ward."    It was the sense of the Board that the
identity of Mrs. Palmer as a benefactor of the University
Hospital should not be lost by changing the name of the
Mary J. Furnum Palmer Ward fund to the "Mary J. Furnum fund" as recommended by Dr. David M. Cowie.
The Board referred to the President with power the
recommendation of promotion in rank and increase in salary
from  $3,900 per year to $5,000 per year, twelve-months
basis, for Dr. Paul H. Geiger, Assistant Investigator in the
Department of Engineering Research (page 32). Funds for
the payment of Dr. Geiger's salary would be made available
by the Hoover Company and Brown Lipe Gear Company.
The Board gave approval to the request embodied in the
following resolution adopted by the Board of Directors of
the Alumnae Council at a meeting held January 4, 1930
(R.P. I926-I929, page 966):Resolved, That the Regents be requested to allow the
entire net amount of the Michigan League element of the
annual fee paid by the young women students for this year
to be used to reimburse the Alumnae Council for money
advanced for the operation of the Michigan League Building.
This request is made since the Alumnae Council is now paying
6 per cent interest on money borrowed because of this advance.
The Board added the sum of $2,000 to the budget of the
University Bureau of Appointments and Occupational Information to provide for expenses incident to the gathering of
occupational information from the alumni of the last ten
years. Regent Murfin voted no (page I59).
The Board denied the request of the Division of University Inspection of High Schools for an appropriation of
$300 to be used for the study of certain questions which have
come to the attention of the Director.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1930

The Board voted that University funds could not properly be donated toward the purchase of a flag to be presented to the library of Louvain University at Louvain,
Belgium.
The following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That Shirley W. Smith, as Secretary of the
Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, be and is
hereby authorized to execute assignment upon certificate No.
869 for eleven shares of capital stock of the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad Company for and in behalf of the "University of Michigan James B. Angell fund."
A  request was received from    the Board in Control of
Student Publications asking that the Regents assume full responsibility for separate investment and disposal and reinvestment from time to time of trust funds deposited
by this body with the Treasurer of the University. The
Regents accepted this responsibility with the understanding
that while all usual precautions would be taken, the same as
with other trust funds, neither the Regents nor University
officials would be liable for losses except only in cases of willful neglect (R.P. I926-I929, page 625).
The following letter was placed on file by President
Ruthven:
My dear Dr. Ruthven:May we, at this time, express to you and to the members
of the Board of Regents, our sincere appreciation of what
each has meant in the life of our dear brother? Harry always
considered you as valued friends, for whom he had a deep
personal affection. He passed on to Life Eternal with the
knowledge that his co-workers for the great University which
was life itself to him would continue the work for which,
together, you had so long labored.
Sincerely, and affectionately,
Annabel Lee Fleming
Carrie H. Worden
Fandira Crocker
February 7, 1930
The Board accepted with regret the resignation as of
February I, I930, of Beatrice W. Johnson, Adviser of
Women (page 8I). It is understood that her salary is to
cease on the above date.

Andrew A. Roberts
Librarian William W. Bishop reported the receipt of a
gift from Dr. Otto Landman, Toledo, Ohio, of I07 books,
365 bound volumes of periodicals, and 8 boxes of clippings and reprints, for the most part dealing with the subject
of Ophthalmology, in which Dr. Landman, a graduate of the
Medical School in I887, specialized. This gift was accepted
with the thanks of the Regents.
The Board adopted the following resolution, which was
passed by the Faculty of the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts at their meeting February 3:Resolved, That a course in American Government, to be
known as Political Science I and Political Science 2, giving
four hours credit each semester, be made a freshman elective,
the total number of elections for the next academic year to be
limited to seven hundred; and
Resolved, further, That after the first semester of Freshman Composition a student may be excused from the required
course of the second semester if in the judgment of the
department such additional course is deemed unnecessary.
With the understanding that no precedent is created
thereby the Board approved the payment of the expenses of
Professor Ernest F. Barker from the Special Research
Account in the Department of Physics. Professor Barker
attended in London, England, last summer, a meeting of
the Faraday Society and his expenses amounted to approximately $389.
The President formally reported to the Board the death
on Saturday, January 25, of President Emeritus Harry
Burns Hutchins. The following resolution was adopted:On Saturday, January 25, I930, the long and fruitful life
of President Emeritus Harry Burns Hutchins was terminated
by his death at his home in Ann Arbor. For four years he
was a teacher of history and rhetoric at the University of




I74


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1930


Michigan, from 1884 to 1887 Jay Professor of Law, from
I895 to I910 Professor of Law and Dean of the Law School,
for two periods Acting President, from  I910 to 1920 President of the University, and since that time President Emeritus.
For forty-two years, as teacher and administrator, and later
in honored retirement, he dwelt in Ann Arbor. His life
was identified with the University of Michigan and its service. His thoughts were turned toward its interests from
first to last, and his endowments of mind and character made
him one of Michigan's great men.
Dr. Hutchins united with unusual gracious dignity a
keen, judicious mind and sturdy manliness of character. He
was a man of action, but not one to be swept off his feet by
theories or fancies, and not one who would decide without
carefully and clearly reasoning every problem to its conclusion. He was a strong man upon whom his students,
friends, and associates could rely in troubled times, and one
who in his own life taught the most compelling lessons in
uprightness, honesty, and self-respect. The Board of Regents
prize their association with him as a possession forever.
The ten years of President Hutchins's administration
were years of growth and progress. The Graduate School was
established and the faculties strengthened. It was he who
initiated the 'policy of the national organization of the alumni
and their close association with the University, and the fundamental financial policy of reserving the University's current
income and the savings therefrom to meet the expenses of
its educational work, rather than for capital expenditure.
Under President Hutchins the University met the test of
war, adapted itself to contribute its share to the national
defense, and when peace came readjusted itself to meet even
greater demands than ever before.
It is impossible to commit to words the memorial of a
man whose monument is properly to be found in the University which he guided and augmented, and in the respect and
regard which his own high-mindedness inspired in all who
knew him. Nevertheless, the Regents of the University of
Michigan have adopted the above as an expression of their
sentiments, and have ordered it spread upon their minutes.
The President formally reported to the Board the death
on Friday, January 24, of Professor Victor Hugo Lane,
Fletcher Professor of Law in the University from I897 to
July 19, I928 (R.P. I926-I929, page 9I2), and Professor




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1930


I75


Emeritus from    1928 to the time of his death (R.P. I926 -1929, page 914). The following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan have learned with profound sorrow of the death on
January 24, 1930, of Victor H. Lane, for many years Fletcher
Professor of Law. As teacher of law and law librarian he
rendered distinguished service to the University and proved
himself a wise counsellor in all the affairs of the Law
School. He was for more than twenty years president of the
Alumni Association of the University during the period of
its greatest development.  By his upright character, his
patent honesty, his native gentleness Judge Lane endeared
himself to all who knew him. It is not given to many to
live so useful, so honored, so exemplary a life, and in token
of their respect and their affection for him the Regents have
adopted this resolution and placed it on their minutes, and
have directed that a copy thereof be sent to Judge Lane's
family.
The Board appropriated the sum of $800 to be added to
the budget of the Department of Bacteriology to provide
sufficient salary from January I, I930, to June 30, I930, for
Elizabeth McDermott, Teaching Assistant in that department, who is doing work primarily under the direction of
Assistant Professor Reuben L. Kahn (page I59).
The Secretary reported the following contracts made by
the Department of Engineering Research (page 132):With the American Car and Foundry Company, New
York City, for study of effect of rapid electric heating; at
an estimated cost of $I,ooo
Continuation of research work on development of metals
for high temperature service for the Timken Roller Bearing Company, Project No. 628, approved in March I929 by
Regents, page 924; at an estimated cost of $13,000
Addenda to contract between University of Michigan and
the General Motors Research Corporation, covering infrared research, giving said Corporation the privilege of renewing contract for term of one year, and specifying that the
University shall use its best efforts to prevent disclosure
of the work and/or its results prior to one year after termination of present contract or any continuation thereof.
The Secretary placed on file the payroll of the Department of Engineering Research for the months of October,
November, and December, I929 (page I44).

The executor of the estate of the late Avery Hopwood,
having expressed the desire for the passage of a formal
resolution of acceptance of the bequest to the University
under Mir. Hopwood's will, the following resolution was
adopted (R.P. 1926-I929, page 689):WHrREAS, By will of the late Avery Hopwood, a
graduate of the University of Michigan in the Class of
I905, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, there
was bequeathed to the Regents of the University of Michigan
a portion of the estate of the testator, the bequest being embodied in the following clause appearing as paragraph eleven,
sub-division (a) of the will and in paragraph six of the
codicil, which substitutes a new  paragraph eleven, subdivision (a), as follows:"Sixth:-I hereby revoke each and every bequest contained in and cancel and make null and void paragraph
"Eleventh" of my said Last Will and Testament, and substitute in place thereof, the following:
"Eleventh: In the event of the death of my beloved
mother, JULt HOPWOOD, I direct that the corpus of the
trust fund created for her benefit shall be distributed in the
following manner:
"(a)  Six-thirtieths (6/30) thereof to the REG~NTS OS
THE UNIVERSITY o0 MICHIGAN, Ann Arbor, State of Michigan, for the following uses and purposes:"To invest and keep the same invested and to use the
income therefrom in perpetuity, as prizes to be known as
'The Avery Hopwood and Jule Hopwood Prizes,' to be
awarded annually to students in the Department of Rhetoric
of the University of Michigan who'perform the best creative




i8o


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1930


work in the fields of dramatic writing, fiction, poetry, and
the essay.
"The number and value of the prizes shall be in the
discretion of the Faculty or other governing body of the
University, but the income shall be distributed annually or
semi-annually, and shall not be allowed to accumulate from
year to year. In this connection it is especially desired that
the students competing for the prizes shall not be confined
to academic subjects, but shall be allowed the widest possible
latitude, and that the new, the unusual, and the radical shall
be especially encouraged."
Therefore, be it Resolved, That said bequest of the late
Avery Hopwood be accepted by this Board, the Regents of
the University of Michigan, and that this Board agree to
abide by and perform all of the stipulations and directions
contained in the clause making the bequest; and
Resolved, further, That the Board place upon its records
this grateful acknowledgment of the loyalty of the late Avery
Hopwood which impelled him to make this bequest to and for
the benefit of the University of Michigan, his alma mater.
The annual report of the Board in Control of Athletics
was received (R.P. I926-1929, pages 855-859), signed by
Professor Ralph W. Aigler, Chairman. The report covered
the period from   September I, I928, to August 31, I929, and
the following are extracts:The books and accounts have been audited by the Walter
S. Gurd Company, certified public accountants, and a detailed
report thereof filed with the officers of the Board. This report

Virtually all of our earnings are derived from football.
When it is remembered that our football receipts for the
year were over $I50,00oo less than during the year preceding,
there is real cause for satisfaction with this showing. Football income during the 1928 season was probably about as
much below normal expectancy as that of the season of I927
was above. Income from that source for the current year is
about midway between the figures of those two years. Accordingly, even allowing for a considerable increase in operating costs, due to the much larger physical plant devoted to
physical education and athletic purposes, the football profit
of 1929 available for plant extensions, or reduction of indebtedness, or both, should be easily $Ioo,ooo larger than that
available during the year covered by this report.

$2I,000.00 (tennis courts and building equipment); Intramural Sports Building, $82,000.00; golf course construction,
$37,000.00.
Between July I, 1926, and September I, 1929, we have
spent for permanent improvements $2,383,314.80. If we were
to include expenditures for this purpose made during the threeor four-year period prior to July I, I926, the total would run
well over $3,0o0,000.00.
On September I, 1929, our indebtedness was $I,375,000.00
on bonds, $50,000.00o borrowed from bank, $40,000.oo  borrowed from 1929 advance football receipts, $35,000.00 on Intramural Sports Building, and the usual outstanding current
supply bills. Since that time $75,000.00 in bonds have been
retired, the bank loan has been repaid and of course the
football advance has become a mere bookkeeping transaction. One may well hesitate to indulge in prophecy regarding financial matters; but it does seem reasonably probable
if we do not undertake any considerable projects not now
contemplated and football continues its popularity, that it will
be possible to announce in this report a year from now that
our net indebtedness has been reduced to a point close to the
million mark.
The Regents enacted the legislation recommended in the
following resolutions adopted by the University Senate at
its meeting of January 20, 1930:Resolved, (I) That the two organizations which have
been known as the Office of the Committee on Vocational
Counsel and Placement and the Teachers' Appointment Bureau be united under the name University Bureau of Appointments and Occupational Information
(2) That the budgets of the two organizations be
combined and included among the Budgets for Administration
(3) That the organization thus effected, together with
control of its budget, be placed in charge of the Director of
the University Bureau of Appointments and Occupational
Information, who shall be responsible directly to the President and Board of Regents
(4) That a standing committee of five members of the
Senate, to be known as the Advisory Committee for the
Bureau, be appointed by the President for the purpose of
acting in an advisory capacity to the Director and of keeping
the Senate in touch with the activities of the Bureau




I84


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1930


(5 That initial appointments on this Committee be one
for one year, two for two years, and two for three years, and
that subsequent appointments be for a period of three years
(6) That the present Committee on Vocational Counsel
and Placement be discontinued
The sum of $I,ooo was transferred from the unexpended
balance in the Salary budget of the Law School to the
Law Library fund, for the purchase of books.
The sum of $300 was appropriated and added to the
Salary budget of the Department of History to provide
salary for Mrs. Hugh Jameson, hereby appointed as assistant
for the second semester (page o06).
The sum of $200 was added to the budget of the Department of Astronomy as salary for Virgil 0. Hatch, hereby
appointed assistant for the second semester.
On recommendation by the President, the Board voted
that the unused portion of funds deposited in a local bank to
the credit of the University Treasurer, for the Wenley Portrait account, amounting to $I03.90, could properly be used
for a fitting memorial for Professor Wenley. It was not indicated what form this memorial should ultimately take.
The Board accepted with thanks the offer of the Detroit
Edison Company to continue for the second semester of the
present University year the Detroit Edison Fellowship in
Chemical Engineering with stipend of $500 for the period
(page 55).
The Board accepted with thanks the further grant of
$I,000 as an addition to the Timken Fund, under the auspices
of the League of Nations, for Retrospective Investigation
of Certain Aspects of Syphilis (R.P. I926-I929, page 1022),
and Leona Cameron was appointed Assistant in the Department of Dermatology and Syphilology from    January I0,
1930, to June 10, I930, with compensation at the rate of $I50
per month, payable from this fund.
The Hindustan Club of the University of Michigan deposited with the Treasurer of the University $225 to be used
as an emergency loan fund for Hindu students. The Regents
agreed to administer this fund in accordance with the following provisions:No student shall be allowed to be in debt to the Hindustan Club Loan Fund in excess of $25.0o at any one time.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1930


I85


With unanimous consent of the Club, this sum may be increased up to $50.00
No loan shall be made except upon the recommendation
of the president, secretary, and treasurer of the club. Loan
applications which have been so recommended shall be submitted to the University Committee on Student Loans for
final approval, and no loan shall be granted until it has received the written approval of the chairman of the University
committee
To the two vacancies reported as existing on the Psychopathic Hospital Board (R.P. I926-I929, page 354), because
of the resignation of Regent Hanchett (page 74) and the
retirement of Regent Gore (page 148), the Board appointed
Regent Cram and Regent Shorts.
The Board named President Ruthven to fill the vacancy
in the Barbour Scholarship Committee created by the death
of President Emeritus Hutchins, chairman of that committee (R.P. I926-I929, page 552).
Dr. James D. Bruce was appointed to fill the vacancy on
the Advisory Committee of the University Extension Division, for a five-year term beginning September 24, 1928, to
replace Dr. Aldred S. Warthin, whose term expired at the
end of the University year 1928-I929.
The President was authorized to select a well-trained
psychiatrist to be added to the Health Service staff for the
University year I930-193I. Provision will be made at the
time of his appointment for the salary for this position.
The Regents directed, at the request of the family of the
late President Hutchins, that his salary be discontinued as of
February 28, 1930, and that of the amount thus remaining
unexpended in the Administration budget, $,ooo000 might be
used, if necessary, for salary adjustments.
The President submitted the following statement:For several years there have been suggestions on the
Campus and from the alumni that the University of Michigan should establish a press. There has been considerable
misunderstanding as to what was meant by the term and several of its advocates have not been able to distinguish between the three functions of a publishing concern, the managerial, including contracts, distribution, and so forth, the
editorial, and the printing. I am not in favor of having a




I86


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1930


printing plant at the University. The experience of publishing houses goes to show that the work can be done as economically by contract and that there is endless trouble with a
printing establishment.
On the other hand, there is great need for better organization of our publishing activities. New bulletins are started
and old publications are discontinued and brought to life
again with no one to supervise numbering, general style,
and cost.
I suggest that the University immediately organize its
publications under the general name, The University of
Michigan Press, and that Dr. Frank E. Robbins be given the
additional title of Managing Editor, with the understanding
that he will have general supervision of University publications, with duties similar to those of managing editors in the
various publishing houses, and that details of organization will
be worked out later.
I am convinced that a simple organization of this kind,
which will permit us to use the caption The University of
Michigan Press, and which will co-ordinate the large number
of publications now being issued, will very much improve the
conditions now prevailing.
The Regents approved the above recommendations of the
President, established "The University of Michigan Press"
and appointed Dr. Frank E. Robbins its Managing Editor
with general supervision of University publications and with
the responsibility of working out the details of organization
of all University publishing activities (R.P. I926-I929, page
965).
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except
where otherwise expressly stated.
The Board adjourned to March 7, I930, at 3:30 P.M.

The Board met in the Regents' Room at 3:30 P.M.
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, Regent Sawyer,
Regent Cram, and Regent Shorts. Absent, Regent Murfin,
Regent Hubbard, Regent Clements, Regent Stone, and
Superintendent Pearce. There were in attendance also Dr.
F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G. Watkins, and Mr. S. W. Smith.
There were filed the current financial reports by the
Business Manager and the Treasurer, and, by Assistant
Secretary Christensen, Report No. 4 of the new construction
projects.
The minutes of the meeting of February 7 were approved
as submitted to the members in press proof with certain
specified changes.
Regent Sawyer for the committee appointed to investigate
the advisability of designating one of the wards of the University Hospital main structure as "Palmer Ward" (page
I70) reported that as the original Palmer Ward was still
being used for children it was proper that it and not another
portion of the hospital quarters should bear this designation.
Regent Cram presented a written report, signed by President Ruthven and herself, in behalf of the committee to
nominate a candidate for appointment as Dean of Women
(page I). On motion of Regent Cram the following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That Alice Crocker Lloyd be and is hereby
appointed Dean of Women with salary of $5,500 per annum,
twelve-months basis, the appointment to date from July I,
I930.
The Board referred to the President, Secretary, and Dean
Effinger with power a request from Professor Aubrey Tealdi
for an addition of $I,500 to the Current Expense budget of
the Nichols Arboretum.




I88


MARCH MEETING, 1930


The Board referred to the Budget Committee for consideration in the budget of I930-I93I the request of Professor
Kenneth C. McMurry for a special appropriation of $1,200
to provide new equipment for the Department of Geography.
Actions of the Executive Committee were approved as
recorded in the committee's minutes as follows (pages 165 -167) 
January 30, 1930
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
Because of a number of unusual expenditures from the
Current account of the Graduate School, the committee added

February I, 1930
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee appointed Mr. Calvin Goodrich Curator of

Further, the committee appointed Mr. Edwin P. Creaser
Assistant in Carcinology beginning February I, I930, with
compensation at the rate of $i,ooo per year, twelve-months
basis, instead of $700 per University year, the basis on which
he had previously been paid. These increases in salary necessitate no addition to the budget.
February 15, 1930
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee added $300 to the Current account of the
Department of Political Science to permit the purchase of
a complete set of United States Supreme Court Reports, with

for necessary conferences in connection with Project No. 677.
The committee further authorized the payment of Mr. Sellew's expenses from the funds contributed toward that project
by the Utilities Research Commission, provided the commission agrees, together with the expenses of Dr. Walter F.
Colby from Vienna to Berlin and return. Professor Colby
is at present on leave and has been asked to co-operate with
Mr. Sellew on this particular phase of the investigation.
February 24, I930
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
At the request of Dr. John Sundwall, Director of the
Division of Hygiene and Public Health, the committee allocated the sum of $2,500 remaining unused in the budget of
that Division because of the leave of absence granted to Dr.
Nathan Sinai for the second semester of the present University year, as follows:Dr. Hyrum L. Marshall, Part-time Instructor
in Hygiene and Public Health, with compensation for the semester of....................  $400
Dr. Matthew E. Soller, Instructor in Hygiene

The President filed the following notice of the death of
Professor Max Winkler:Professor Winkler died, after a brief illness, March I4,
I930. He had been a member of the Faculty of the University continuously since 1890, with the exception of absences abroad for purposes of study. Professor Winkler
became Instructor in I890. In 1892 he received the degree
of Ph.D. here, and in I895 was promoted to the Assistant
Professorship. In I900 he was made Acting Professor in
charge of the department, and since 1902 he has been full
Professor and up to the beginning of the current year,
head of the department
The following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan have heard with profound sorrow of the death of Pro*Now Equitable & Central Trust Co.




220


APRIL MEETING, 1930


fessor Max Winkler, since 1902 Professor of German and
for many years Head of the Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures. In his many years at Michigan
Professor Winkler rendered most valuable service to the
University and his passing is regretted by friends, both upon
the Campus of the University and scattered throughout the
country. The Regents assure Professor Winkler's family of
their deep sympathy with them in their bereavement.
The President filed the following notice of the death of
Professor Claude Halstead Van Tyne (page I99):Professor Claude Halstead Van Tyne died at his home
in Ann Arbor, March 21, I930o As the members of the
Board know, he has suffered from a long and painful illness.
It is also needless to state that in Professor Van Tyne the
University has lost one of its greatest scholars and most
useful faculty members. Professor Van Tyne was graduated from the University of Michigan in 1896 with the degree of A.B. After studying in Heidelberg and Leipzig and
at the University of Pennsylvania he took the degree of
Ph.D. at the last-named institution in 1900. For three years
thereafter he was Teaching Fellow at the University of
Pennsylvania, and in I903 returned to Michigan as Assistant
Professor of American History. In 1905 he became Professor of American History and head of that department.
In I9II his title was changed to Professor of History and
Head of the Department of History.
The following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan convey to the family of Professor Claude Halstead Van
Tyne their sincere sympathy with them in their great loss.
During his years at Michigan, Professor Van Tyne was one
of those teachers whose courses were eagerly sought by the
students and whose counsel was valued by the Regents and
his colleagues of the faculties. As a historian, his work
brought ever-increasing prestige to himself and to his University. In his personal relations he was a delightful companion and a high-minded friend. His name will always
stand high in that list of distinguished scholars who throughout the years of Michigan's history have added brilliantly to
its reputation and whose memories constitute its most cherished and lasting traditions.

The President filed the following notice of the death of
Dr. Thomas E. Casady:Dr. Thomas E. Casady was a young and most promising
member of the Department of English. His death occurred
early in the morning of March 21, 1930, and was due to a
sudden heart attack. Dr. Casady was graduated from the
University with the degree of A.B. in I925 and received the
degree of A.M.. in 1927 and that of Ph.D. in I929, likewise
from this University. He was Instructor in English at the
State University of Iowa in 1925-1926, and in the fall of
1926 returned to Michigan as an Instructor in the Department of English, which position he had held ever since. Dr.
Casady was only 27 years of age.
The following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby express their deepest sympathy with the surviving family and relatives of Dr. Thomas E. Casady. As a
student Dr. Casady had already attracted the attention of his
instructors and his fellow students by his unusual promise,
and it was felt to be a fortunate thing that the University
of Michigan could invite him back to become a member of
its faculty in English. His untimely death at so early an age
has given great sorrow to all his associates and colleagues.
The committee requested to devise a plan of organization
for the Board of Governors for the Michigan League (pages
201-202) reported agreement upon a body to be known as
the "Board of Governors of the Michigan League Building," to consist of fifteen members as follows:I. One Regent, to be named by the Board of Regents
2. The Dean of Women, ex officio
3. Two members of the University Senate, one to be
appointed by the President and the other to be the
Director of Physical Education for Women, ex

4. The Vice-President and Secretary of the University, ex officio
5. Five alumnae members, to be chosen by the Alumnae
Council, the Chairman and the Executive Secretary
to be ex-officio members
6. Five students from the Board of Directors of the
Women's League, the President of the Women's

League and the Chairman of the Judiciary Council
to be ex-officio members
The Board of Governors is to name its own Chairman,
and rules for the conduct of business are to be formulated by
the Board of Governors.
The President reported that with the approval of the
Regents, consulted individually by telephone, the Board of
Governors of the Michigan League Building had been constituted as follows, all previous appointments to this or a
similar body being automatically terminated by the appointment of the present Board, effective at once. The appointments, other than those ex-officio, are to June I, 1930, or
until their successors are duly appointed:i. Regent Esther M. Cram, as the Regent member

APRIL MEETING, 1930


223


The Regents of the University of Michigan accept with
the profoundest thanks the Michigan League Building, which
was turned over to their custody on April I, I930. As public
officers, charged by the people of Michigan with the control
of the University of this State, the welfare of the women
students is one of the most important responsibilities committed to our care. It has also been one of our most
troublesome problems. Facilities for the social gatherings
of women students and for the housing of their extracurricular activities, which rightfully take a prominent place
in the experience and training of a college student, have
been in late years utterly inadequate, if not wholly nonexistent. The Michigan League Building has already remedied this unfortunate situation, and we can see that it is to
prove of the greatest practical use to the women students of
the University and the alumnae themselves. The beauty and
good taste inherent in the structure, furthermore, are among
those influences which are extremely difficult to obtain but
educationally invaluable.
The importance of these considerations serves to increase our gratitude to the Alumnae Council, which as an
organization has devoted the past nine years to the realization of the Michigan League project, and to those individuals
who have taken the lead in the campaign so successfully concluded. We desire particularly to commend and thank Mrs.
Mary B. Henderson who, as Executive Secretary of the
Alumnae Council since I926, has directed the solicitation of
the funds, the construction, and, except for the first fourmonth period, the initial operation of the building. Mrs.
Henderson has contributed to the project a very unusual
degree of energy, organizing ability, and skill, and it is
difficult to praise too highly the service she has unselfishly
rendered. We feel a deep gratitude also to the long list
of those who as officers and members of the Alumnae Council
and as leaders in various parts of the country have loyally
co-operated in adding so materially to the resources of this
University. The building itself will testify to their spirit
and their determination for many years to come, as it will
likewise bear permanent evidence to the professional skill of
its -architects.
This minute, as a formal record of our appreciation of
a great service to the State and the University of Michigan,
we have adopted by unanimous vote and have ordered incorporated in the Proceedings of the Board of Regents.

membership:Assistant to the President, Chairman, ex officio
Professor of Geodesy and Surveying

First: As a contribution to education, recognizing that
life is largely idealistic and that enlightenment develops character and a better understanding of spiritual values and our
duty towards humanity.
Second: Because of my sincere belief that for the youth
to come in contact with God's great out-of-doors is sure to
bestow a beneficial influence; enabling them to discern Providence in Nature; an appreciation of the truer values of life
as expressed by the truth in Nature; quicken interest in our
wild friends, trees, and flowers, and prompt a desire to conserve them rather than destroy.
The tract of land given shall be designated "The Edwin
George Reserve of the University of Michigan."  It comprises' approximately twelve hundred and fifty (I250) acres

The land and buildings are presented to the Regents of
the University of Michigan by Colonel Edwin S. George for
-the purposes and under the conditions hereinafter set forth.
The Reserve is to further visual education in the natural
sciences and for the purpose of preserving and demonstrating
the native fauna and flora to'the end that students interested
in zoology, ornithology, botany, nature study and nature
sketching, landscape studies, parks in a broad natural sense,
or ecology, may here find material for observation and satisfy
and develop the love for God's out-of-doors,-Nature.
The Reserve is to be available to the University students
under proper supervision. The Regents of the University
agree to make the Reserve available to students of the educational units'of the Cranbrook Foundation of Bloomfield Hills,
also to nature study groups in other organizations such as the
Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, etc., provided always that such
groups have proper supervision and abide by such rules as in
the opinion of the University authorities are necessary for
the protection of the denizens of the Reserve.
The Reserve shall be administered by the Regents of the
University of Michigan.
The Regents of the University agree to provide a curator
and such assistants as shall be needed for the proper protection
and care of the animals and plants, to provide for the upkeep
of the necessary fences, buildings, and equipment, and to
assume the expense of such planting, road building, and other




236


APRIL MEETING, 19.30


developments as may be considered advisable. They further
agree to protect the wild life (animals and birds) to the
extent necessary to further the general purposes of the preserve, they are not estopped from removing surplus stock, obnoxious or diseased forms, or from introducing species to
increase the fauna and flora.
Donor reserves to himself and to his immediate heirs
(widow and surviving children) the exclusive use of the house
and outbuildings in connection therewith erected by him, and
the future right to erect additional buildings, also to develop
the ground immediately surrounding these buildings on property of approximately forty (40) acres in extent, described
as follows:The forty (40) acres immediately surrounding
the house now located in the northwest 4 of the
southeast 4  of Section Nineteen (I9)-said house
being accepted as the geographic center of the said
forty (40) acres hereby reserved,
and including the free and exclusive use of said buildings
and said forty (40) acres of land during their respective
lives, primarily for residence purposes, but not with the
intention to interfere with, or obstruct the general purposes
or objects of the gift by donor.
Donor also reserves to himself and his immediate heirs
the free and unrestricted enjoyment of the whole reserve at
all times, without the right-except as to said forty (40)
acres as stated above-to change or alter conditions on the
reserve without permission of the Regents of the University.
Donor also expressly reserves to himself and his heirs
all oil and mineral rights, and the rights to lease, operate,
or develop the same on the entire property covered by this
conveyance, for his and their accounts, and this reservation
of oil and mineral rights shall continue for a period of fifty
(50) years from the date hereof.
If changing conditions should in the future make it inadvisable to maintain a wild-life preserve on this tract of
land, it is understood and agreed by the donor that the Regents of the University of Michigan may otherwise make use
of the property for a nearly related project bearing the name
of the donor.




APRIL MEETING, 1930


237


The donor is relieved from any further taxes on property deeded herewith, the taxes, if any, accruing from the
date of this deed shall be payable by the Regents of the University of Michigan, except taxes levied upon rents, royalties,
or other revenues received by the donor or his heirs from
the oil and mineral rights reserved.
The recording of this deed by the Board of Regents
shall be deemed an acceptance of said gift by the University
of Michigan, subject to all the terms, conditions, and provisions stated.
The Board adopted the following resolution:Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan with deep realization of its significance to the educational advantages of the State throughout the future accept
with deep gratitude the Edwin George Reserve of the University of Michigan as tendered to this Board by the donor
in his communication herein above appearing under date of
April 4, I930.
The President reported that the Detroit University of
Michigan Club was desirous of establishing a fund, the
amount of which could not yet be determined, to be held by
the Regents under the title "University of Michigan Club
of Detroit Endowment Fund," which fund as and when
turned over to the Regents by the University of Michigan
Club of Detroit should be irrevocable as to principal. The
Regents should hold the fund, invest and reinvest all moneys
therein, and annually make such disposition of the income
as shall be directed from time to time by the Board of
Governors of the University of Michigan Club of Detroit,
always assuming that such use would be for the proper purposes of the University, as for scholarships, or of the University of Michigan Club of Detroit, should emergency in
the Club affairs require the annual aid. It was provided,
however, in the tender by the Club that the income should
not be thus diverted from University to Club purposes in
excess of five years continuously. The Regents authorized
acceptance of such fund when and as tendered in accordance
with the conditions above stated, and expressed the thanks of
the University to the Club for its co-operation.
Leave of absence was granted to Dr. Warren E. Forsythe, Director of the University Health Service, for such




238


APRIL MEETING, 1930

five thousand dollars, to be kept invested by them, the income therefrom to be used as a loan fund for needy and

the borrowers, are to be added to the principal and kept
invested, and only the income from such funds is to be used
thereafter for further loans. The said original fund of five
thousand dollars together with such accumulations as herein
above provided, shall be known as the Winkler Loan
Scholarship Fund, and shall be administered in accordance
with the regulations established by the Board of Regents
of the University of Michigan for such funds."
"My library I give and bequeath to my son Alexander,

upon his earlier decease, he has not chosen the profession
of teaching German Literature and Philology, his title to
said library shall cease and terminate, and the same shall
pass absolutely to the University of Michigan, except such

sufficient evidence of the authority granted to such officer.

school or college concerned.

service to be paid by the Extension Division shall come out
of Extension class fees, the fee collected per student in noncredit courses to be determined upon by the student enrollment and the nature of the service rendered.
(c) All Extension course fees, both for credit and
non-credit courses, shall be turned over to the Treasurer of
the University and credited to the Extension course account,
as is done at present.

MAY MEETING, 1930

The Board received and accepted with regret the resignation of Joseph H. Drake, Sr., as tendered:Gentlemen:As I attain the age of seventy years on May I8, 1930,
I herewith present my resignation as Professor of Law in
the Law School of the University of Michigan, to take effect
at the end of the academic year, on July I, I930.
Very respectfully yours,
April 26, 1930                 Joseph H. Drake, Sr.
Professor Drake's resignation was accompanied by the following statement on the part of Dean Bates:Professor Drake came into the Law School at a strategic
time in the history of the School. His service as a member
of the Faculty of the Department of Literature, Science, and
the Arts, his broad training, and his exceptional ability as a
thorough and sympathetic teacher, were of invaluable help in
the task of making the School, in spirit and in functioning,
an integral and co-operative department of the University.
His study and teaching of Latin literature, as well as of
Roman institutions, gave him an exceptionally broad foundation upon which to do his work as Professor of Roman Law,
of Juristic Philosophy, and of Comparative Law; and many
graduates of the School, now prominent upon the Bench or
at the Bar, gladly attest to the stimulus toward thorough and
precise scholarship which his teaching imparted to them.
He was too good a teacher to be permitted to devote
himself wholly to Roman Law and Jurisprudence, and he has
given courses in the law of Partnership, of Damages, of
Property, and a course in Elementary Law given for many
years in this School.
Professor Drake's scholarship, both in Roman literature
as such and in law, found expression in numerous contributions to law periodicals, the translation and editing of some
of the masterpieces of Roman literature, the translation of
Stammler's Fundamental Tendencies in Modern Jurisprudence, and in introductions to, and translations of, some of
the great German treatises upon juristic philosophy.
During all of his long service to the University, Professor Drake has been unremitting in his industry, tireless
in his quest of accurate knowledge and deep understanding.
His retirement will cause unmitigated regret to all of his
colleagues and to the thousands of students whom he has




268


MAY MEETING, 1930


known. No one could have been more utterly devoted or
self-sacrificing.  During all of these years he has uncomplainingly and unselfishly performed his duty, with never a
suggestion of any desire for special advantage or privilege
to himself. In my administrative work I have sought his
advice, encouragement, and friendly sympathy times without
number, and never in vain. It is the simple truth to say
that no one could have been more loyal than Professor Drake
has been to the interests of the School, the University, and
the legal profession, and no one could have been a more
generous and understanding friend of an administrator than
Professor Drake has been of mine. We all hope that after
a period of rest and study abroad, he will return to a close
association with the School and with his friends and colleagues of the faculty.
Professor Drake was entitled       Professor Emeritus of
Law beginning July I, I930.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That Joseph Horace Drake be recommended
to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching for the normal retiring allowance beginning with July I,
1930.
The Regents accepted with thanks the gift embodied in
the following communication addressed to the President:The Polonia Literary Circle desires to transmit through
you to the University of Michigan the Circle's trust fund of
$840.43,-this sum to be used for the purchase of books relating to representative aspects of Polish life and culture,
especially in the fields of literature, language, science, history,
and art. It is our hope that this library fund may make
available for American students a more comprehensive view
of Poland's past and present.
We also trust that the University will find it possible
in the not distant future to make regular provision from
its own resources for the growth of the Polish section in
the University Library.
Sincerely yours,
Alexander A. Bochnowski
President, the Polonia Literary Circle

The Regents voted that should the State Administrative
Board desire to erect in Ann Arbor a cottage to be operated

give assurances to the State Administrative Board that under
proper conditions to be agreed upon the Regents would
authorize the erection of such building upon property owned
by the Regents.
The following communication was received from         the
University of Michigan Foresters' Association:
It is the desire of the former students and the friends of

of Michigan School of Forestry from its inception in I903
until I923, acting through the University of Michigan Foresters' Association, to establish a student loan fund, in
accordance with the following terms and conditions:



MA/Y MEETING, 1930


27I


Sec. I. This fund is to be known as the Filibert Roth
Memorial Loan Fund.
Sec. 2. The fund is to be created from voluntary subscription, sponsored by the University of Michigan Foresters'
Association, but paid to the Treasurer of the University and
administered by the University Committee on Student Loans
in accordance with its regulations, except as modified herein.
Sec. 3. A minimum payment of five dollars ($5.00)
shall be accepted by the Treasurer for the Fund, and otherwise the amount of individual or group contributions will not
be limited.
Sec. 4. The Fund will be kept open for contributions
for an indefinite period, but may be closed when sufficient
in amount to meet the reasonable needs for which it is
established, upon request of a Committee composed of the
Executive Council of the University of Michigan Foresters'
Association and the Dean of the School of Forestry and
Conservation.
Sec. 5. In allotting funds under the provisions of Section 2, above, preference will be given to seniors and graduate
students in forestry, but in so far as funds are available,
any forestry or pre-forestry student who has been matriculated for at least one semester at the University and who is
otherwise eligible may receive a loan.
Sec. 6. If, in the opinion of the Committee designated
in Section 4, this Fund, in part or in whole, is not needed to
meet the needs for loans of students in forestry, then any and
all portions of the principal and accumulated interest of the
Fund may be directed to such other uses as may be designated
by said Committee, provided that in any such use of the principal the idea of a permanent memorial to Professor Filibert
Roth shall be appropriately carried out.
Upon notice of formal acceptance of the conditions set
forth herein, the Association will initiate contributions to the
Fund and will take such action as is necessary to secure an
appreciable sum in keeping with its purpose.
The Regents formally voted acceptance of the Filibert Roth
Memorial Loan Fund, if tendered, in accordance with the
above terms and conditions, provided however that to Section 4 and to Section 6 there be added a provision that in
case the University of Michigan Foresters' Association
should go out of existence or be no longer functioning the
Regents of the University of Michigan should act in place




272


MAY MEETING, 1930


of the committee provided in Section 4 and Section 6, should

Salary budget of the Department.
Regent Shorts, and the Secretary in behalf of Dean
Dana, reported progress with respect to the tract of land
owned by Mr. Clark L. Ring of Saginaw (page I22).
The Secretary reported for the committee appointed
(page 121) to acquire the Theta Delta Chi Fraternity property at the northeast corner of State and Monroe Streets
as the remainder of the site of the Law School group, that
arrangements had been informally completed, subject to the
approval of the Board, for the purchase of land on the
opposite (southwest) corner and the removal thereto of the
fraternity house, at an expense for land of approximately
$67,000 and for moving of approximately $30,000. Toward
this expense the State Administrative Board had released
the balance, approximately $67,728, remaining in the appropriation made by the Legislature of I929 for the purchase of land. The Regents gave general approval to this
plan, the details of which when consummated will be formally filed for record.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except
where otherwise expressly stated.

JULY MEETING, 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, July 17, 1997
The Regents convened at 1:40 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Interim Executive Vice President Matthews, Vice President Harrison, Vice President
Hartford, Acting Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellor Renick, and Secretary
Palmer. Vice President Kinnear and Chancellor Nelms were absent. Provost
Machen arrived at about 3:10 p.m.; Vice Chancellor Dorothy Russell
attended in Chancellor Nelms' stead.
Appointment of Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic
Affairs
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and announced his
recommendation for the appointment of Nancy Cantor, dean of the Horace
H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, as provost and executive vice president for academic affairs.
President Bollinger noted that after Provost Machen announced his
intention to step down from the position of provost, he had appointed a
committee to search for his replacement, with himself as chair. The committee conducted a national search and interviewed several candidates, and
came to the "clear conclusion" that Dean Cantor was "really the right person
for this position at this particular moment."
He observed that during the search process, a feeling of deep respect for
Dean Cantor had been expressed by all sectors of the University of Michigan
community, including staff, faculty, students, and alumni. He then introduced
Dean Cantor to the assembly.
Regent McGowan moved approval of Dean Nancy Cantor as provost and
executive vice president for academic affairs. Regent Deitch seconded the
motion. Several other Regents expressed their enthusiastic support for the
recommendation. The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved
unanimously. There followed a round of applause, after which Dean Cantor
briefly addressed the Board. She expressed how honored she was by the
appointment, appreciation to Provost Machen for his mentoring of her, and
enthusiasm for the prospect of working with President Bollinger and the
Board of Regents.
1997-98 Department of Athletics Budget
President Bollinger called on Mr. Joe Roberson, Director of Athletics, to
present the 1997-98 budget for the Department of Athletics. Mr. Roberson
distributed a handout and gave a corresponding slide presentation. He noted




July Meeting, 1997


that in 1996-97 there were 16 percent more student athletes than in the
previous year, the NCAA graduation rate was 71 percent, and that the
University had won seven conference champions.
Regarding the issue of gender equity, Mr. Roberson noted that it
involves more than issues of proportionality and scholarship opportunities.
Gender equity also is concerned with the broader range of services that
indicate that the genders are treated equally in all aspects of their athletic
competition. He noted that in a recent review by the NCAA, the University
had rated very highly in all of these areas, as well as in the areas of proportionality and gender equity. There are currently 11 men's sports and 12
women's sports, and the department has met totally the NCAA scholarship
limits for men and women.
Regarding the FY1998 revenue budget, Mr. Roberson noted that football
game admissions account for 39 percent of department's budget, while licensing royalties account for 12 percent, post-season revenues account for 9
percent, and TV/Radio revenue account for 10 percent. These figures are
virtually unchanged from the previous year.
Regent Power requested a breakdown of the TV and radio revenue both by
medium and by sport. Mr. Roberson said he would provide that information.
Mr. Roberson noted that the department's total revenue is $39,878,000.
The Regents asked for a breakdown of the amount of revenue from sports
admissions other than football. There was also a discussion about how
television revenue from football is derived, with Mr. Roberson noting that it
comes in the form of revenue sharing through the Big Ten. Michigan's share
of television revenue last year was about $2.8 million, out of a total Big Ten
television revenue of about $36 million. He pointed out that this discussion
highlights the issue of what conferences are and the effect of television on
conferences and on the individual schools within conferences. Noting that
$2.8 million does not represent a very large share of Michigan's athletic
department budget, Regent Power asked how much money the University of
Notre Dame receives from its television contract. He also asked to have the
Big Ten submit its economic model of the media environment over the
medium term and its strategy with respect to the conference and individual
members of it within that environment.  Mr. Roberson said he would
attempt to obtain that information.
In response to a question from Regent Newman, Mr. Roberson explained
how the Bowl Alliance operates. He noted that under this system, certain
conference champions, as well as two at-large bids based on ranking, are
guaranteed an opportunity to go to one of four bowl games. The bowls take
turns getting first choice of teams to play in their bowls.
Regent Power observed that he was asking these questions because the
intersection of big-time athletics and universities is becoming more and more
problematic, and that very large flows of money going into conferences are
driving the contradictions between universities and big-time sports. He believes


2




July Meeting, 1997


that the point is being reached where the conflicts between academics and
athletics will become ever sharper. Mr. Roberson agreed, noting that another
way of stating the problem is to ask the question of whether the University is
in the entertainment business or education business.
There then followed a discussion of graduation rates among University
of Michigan athletes. Mr. Roberson reported that the most recent NCAA
figure is 71 percent for all scholarship athletes. Within this group, the rate is
higher for women than for men, and lower for football and basketball players
than for other male athletes (38 percent for football and 33 percent for
basketball). However, these figures include 2 students on the basketball
team who transferred, and a third who transferred and graduated from
another institution. NCAA figures are based only on students who start at
Michigan but do not receive degrees from Michigan, and do not take into
account those who transfer to other schools, become professional athletes, or
receive degrees beyond the six-year time frame used by the NCAA.
Regent Deitch asked for the graduation rates of athletes who remain at
Michigan and don't transfer, noting that the University is primarily an
educational institution. Mr. Roberson said that he would provide that data.
Regent Newman asked about the status within the NCAA of proposals
whereby all basketball and football players would be ineligible to play their
freshmen year. Mr. Roberson observed that although he is personally in
favor of this proposal, it has been under discussion for years and is unlikely
to ever pass. If an individual institution such as Michigan were to decide to
implement such a policy, it would not only encounter tremendous pressure
from constituent groups, but would be at a competitive disadvantage against
other institutions who do not follow such a policy. The only way such a
system could work is if a large number of institutions subscribed to it, and
that is unlikely to happen.
Regarding expenditures, Mr. Roberson noted that the salaries/wages/
fringe benefits category decreased slightly, while facilities expenditures
increased somewhat. Regent Deitch asked for a breakdown in the salaries
category between the proportion spent on people directly involved in athletics
programs (e.g., coaches, trainers, etc.) and other staff.
In the Department of Recreational Sports, Mr. Roberson noted that 22
percent of the revenue is derived from the General Fund, 12 percent from
student fees, and 66 percent is generated by the department. He observed
that the University's recreational sports department may be the most used
recreational/intramural sports department in the country, used by about 85
percent of students.
Mr. Roberson concluded the presentation with a display of photographs
of various facilities operated by the athletic department. He pointed out that
about $9 million worth of renovations is needed at Crisler Arena.


3




July Meeting, 1997


In response to a question from Regent McGowan about what he would
like to see happen in terms of gender equity in scholarships, Mr. Roberson
noted that last year, the NCAA added 14 scholarship opportunities to women's
sports. This not only increases the proportion of women's scholarships, but
also the opportunities for women to participate in sports in a meaningful
way. He observed that women's sports do not have as many walk-on participants as do men's sports, but providing increased scholarship activities can
help negate this.
University of Michigan Health System's Clinical Delivery System
Operating Budget
President Bollinger noted that one small portion of the health system's
operating budget involves proposed changes in the University's M-Care HMO
and other HMO health care benefits offered to University employees. He
recommended that the Regents not act on the portion of the budget involving
these benefit changes for several weeks, to allow for further consultation
with members of the University.
It was clarified that the benefits in question would apply to all University
employees, not only those who work at the health system, and that if it was
decided ultimately to recommend the proposed changed to the Board, a
special meeting would be called in August for that purpose.
President Bollinger called on Mr. Larry Warren, interim executive director
of the University of Michigan Health System, to present the proposed
FY1998 Clinical Delivery System (CDS) operating budget.
Mr. Warren observed that with the adoption of this budget, the CDS
would continue to make improvements in cost per case and in its other financial objectives. In addition, the work force will be stabilized, which will allow
the CDS to best address the needs of patients, families, and visitors. He
reported that the CDS had reframed its mission, vision, and values statement
so that all staff would have a clear understanding about the leadership's
priorities for the system. The Faculty Group Practice board has also set
expectations in specific areas such as waiting time in clinics; and they and
the leadership have set standards against which they will measure themselves
over time. He also pointed out that the new executive vice president would be
inheriting a healthy health system.
Mr. Warren reviewed the health system's responses to the changing
health care environment, noting that in 1985 the overhead was 55 percent of
the total workforce, and as of 1997 it had been reduced to 35 percent. In the
eleven-year period from 1985-96, the system had reduced its expenses by
$150 million, and last year it set a goal of reducing another $200 million over
a three-year period. Mr. Warren noted that the health system had set a
standard for productivity comparable to that of the best academic medical
centers in the country.


4




July Meeting, 1997


Mr. Warren said that most FY1997 budget objectives had been achieved,
and that the health system had come in under budget in managing expenses.
This resulted in a gain from operations, even though revenues were less than
had been budgeted because the length of stay had been reduced by a greater
amount than had been anticipated. Due to the gain in operations, the staff
would benefit directly through the health system's gainsharing program.
Mr. Warren noted that the FY1998 budget assumptions include
planning for only one budget year, reduced length of stay and admissions
with corresponding growth in clinic visits, a self-funded competitive salary
program, an increase in managed care market penetration, no room rate
increase, and a $45.8 million cost effectiveness program. He commented that
a reduction of an additional 300 positions is required for the health system to
be in the best competitive position it can be. To help achieve that goal, it has
instituted an early retirement incentive program. The intent is to have no
layoffs.
In addition to the retirement incentive, another component of the cost
effectiveness program is a proposal to offer M-Care HMO health care coverage
at no premium charge to University employees. As noted earlier, University
employees would have an opportunity to comment on this proposal before it
is initiated. For FY1998, this proposal would save $2 million, or $4 million
on an annualized basis.
The FY1998 budget calls for $912,212,000 in total operating revenue
and an equal amount in operating expenses.
Regent Power commented that the past year's health system performance
has been very gratifying. Mr. Warren acknowledged the contributions of Mr.
David Southwell, the health system's chief financial officer, and noted that
he will be leaving to assume a new position in Iowa.
1997-98 Operating Budgets and Student Fee Rates, All Three Campuses
President Bollinger called on Provost Machen, who noted that the
fundamental budget objectives are unchanged from previous years: to
maintain and enhance the quality of instructional and research programs;
increase the quality of the undergraduate educational experience; maintain
and enhance access for Michigan undergraduates; and continue to pursue
racial and gender diversity.
He noted that this is the first year the budget was built utilizing the
concept of value centered management (VCM) and reviewed the basic tenets
of that system. He described cost containment and cost reduction efforts
that have occurred in recent years, including reallocating a portion of the
General Fund budget every year, institution of Total Quality Management
("M-Quality"), and re-examination and re-engineering of business processes.
A major goal this year, he noted, has been to reduce the cost of the central
administrative units, while enhancing the resources available to the
academic units. In the General Fund budget, a specific process has been


5




July Meeting, 1997


developed that should lead to a significant reduction in the University's
overall administrative costs.
Provost Machen reported that three parameters were used in the budget
planning process: low tuition and fee increases for both resident and nonresident undergraduates; no increase in the base budget allocations of central
administrative units; and no across-the-board increase in the provost's
allocations to the academic units. He then displayed a table detailing the
recommended General Fund budget broken down by unit, noting that the
state appropriation increase will be 4.18 percent. The average of proposed
undergraduate and graduate/professional school tuition and fee increases will
be 3.44 percent, while the infrastructure maintenance fee is slated to increase
by 9.56 percent, and indirect cost recovery is budgeted to increase by 3.73
percent. The overall increase in General Fund revenue will be 3.94 percent,
while overall expenditures will increase by an equal amount, as described in
the Regents Communication.
Provost Machen announced that the recommended student fee rate
increase for 1997-98 is 2.9 percent for lower and upper division resident and
nonresident undergraduates, with differential increases for specific graduate
programs that reflect special market or cost factors.
Regent McGowan inquired about the budget category of "new presidential
programs." Provost Machen responded that due to the size of the state
appropriation and the decision to freeze administrative costs, he was able to
identify $4 million for use by the president. President Bollinger said these
funds would be used generally for support of academic programs, faculty
salaries, and retaining and recruiting faculty. He also noted that there are
some subject areas that need attention, and that funds will be needed to
accomplish the kinds of improvements that he and the provost believe are
important. The principle purpose of the fund is to stimulate academic
achievement.
Regent Newman noted that the budget for the office of the executive
vice president and chief financial officer remains the same in this budget,
and she expressed the hope that this figure can be reduced next year.
Regent Power observed that this budget is significant because it is the
first to be brought forward under VCM. He noted that the presentation
clearly outlined how VCM is working, and that he appreciated the distinction
between VCM as a decision-making environment and the General Fund as an
accounting environment. Regent Power also pointed out that this budget is
the first to have as a specific policy objective and as a budget reality to lower
the costs of central administration by shifting resources from administrative
to academic activities.
President Bollinger observed that the costs of higher education are of
great concern to the public, even though he personally believes that public
opinion on this issue is exaggerated. However, it is incumbent upon the
University of Michigan as a public institution to be attentive to the public


6




July Meeting, 1997


concerns. He also said that it is also important to realize that a new budgeting
structure like VCM also requires a lot of close attention to make sure that
what is valued at the University is not lost.
President Bollinger recognized the efforts of Provost Machen in implementing VCM, noting that it was not easy and that it was done as skillfully
as it could possibly have been done. He also noted that a lot of progress has been
made in working with the state legislature, with the help of Associate Vice
President Cynthia Wilbanks and other members of Vice President Harrison's
staff.
Regent Deitch commented that he believes the budget is moving in the
right direction. He said he has always appreciated the University's accessibility, and that college expenses are significant for families, even though in
the larger scheme of things, the cost might be considered a bargain. Therefore,
the modest budget increase and the shifting of resources represent a beginning
step in making a statement about the University's priorities. He noted that
this is an important budget that would be looked at historically as a
watershed.
1997-98 UM-Dearborn General Fund Budget and Student Fee Rates
Chancellor Renick reported that the proposed overall increase in tuition
and fees for the Dearborn campus is 2.9 percent. This represents an increase
in faculty positions, a modest salary program, and financial aid support.
1997-98 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Hartford announced a proposed increase of $2.50 per
student per term (2.38 percent) for the 1997-98 University Health Service
fee. The majority of the increase will be used to fund a merit-based salary
program for health service staff.
There followed a 15-minute break, after which the meeting reconvened
to hear public comments at 4:00 p.m.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following people, on the topics
indicated: Marcia Federbush, citizen, on gender equity in athletics; Mel Larson,
citizen, on an agreement of cooperation between the City of Ann Arbor and
the University of Michigan; and Elaine Sims, co-chair, Commission for Women,
on the UMHS paid time off program.
The business meeting then continued, at 4:17 p.m.
University of Michigan Health System's Clinical Delivery System
Operating Budget
Regent McGowan moved to approve the FY1998 UMHS Clinical Delivery
System's Operating Budget, with the caveat that the portion of the budget


7




July Meeting, 1997


which pertains to M-Care preference, as it has been described today, will be
considered at a subsequent meeting. Regent McFee seconded the motion.
In response to Regent Newman's question about the impact of the
M-Care preference initiative on the overall budget, President Bollinger stated
that it would lead to a revenue increase of $1 million this year and $2 million
in subsequent years, depending on how many people take advantage of the
proposal.
Regent Newman stated that she does not believe this decision should be
delayed, because she feels strongly that the UMHS budget, including the
M-Care preference initiative, should be adopted. There followed a discussion
about the impact of the motion on the rest of the UMHS budget. Regent
Newman emphasized that she did not want to approve a health system
budget that is not balanced, and she believes strongly in the concept of steering University employees toward the University's own health system.
Regent Power observed that the Regents always try to allow people time to
comment on significant items prior to voting on them. He noted that this is
a significant proposal involving fringe benefits that will affect a lot of people,
and until now it has been considered only in the context of the medical center,
rather than the entire University. The motion will provide the community
an opportunity to comment on what is to them a significant issue.
Regent McGowan summarized that the recommendation from the health
system is to provide a certain amount of revenue for its budget. It is now up
to the central administration to determine whether or not to bring to the
Regents that element of the budget. Because this idea has not been discussed
outside of the hospital community, it will come as a surprise to the rest of
the University. The motion is therefore an attempt to adjust the process in
order to allow the University community to comment on the proposal.
President Bollinger concurred, noting that since the health system
budget was put together, it has been brought to his attention that there are
concerns about the process used for this particular proposal because it will
affect staff benefits. It is possible that the administration may decide not to
recommend it at this time.
Regent McFee suggested that there be a time certain when the proposal
will be brought back for a discussion and/or vote. Regent Maynard concurred.
Regent Deitch stated that based on the information they now have,
many of the Regents believe this is a good idea, and that if the vote were to
be taken today, he would vote to approve the M-Care preference initiative.
However, because of the big impact such a decision would have, and because
he values discussion and input, he could possibly be convinced to change his
mind if confronted with a compelling argument. He requested that the
Regents reconvene, and if the administration decides not to recommend it,
he would like the opportunity to weigh that point of view. He observed that
the proposal highlights the fact that this is one institution with limited


8




July Meeting, 1997


resources, and that it represents an opportunity to direct dollars into other
areas and help the hospital, thereby helping the whole institution.
It was noted that in order to have sufficient lead time to prepare materials regarding open enrollment in the benefits program, a decision would have
to be made by August 15.
Regent Power concurred that the administration ought to bring forward
at a special meeting no later than August 15 a recommendation either for or
against the proposal. There followed a discussion about whether the proposal
should be brought forward if the administration ultimately decides not to
recommend it after receiving public comment. Regent Deitch suggested that
if the decision is not to recommend the proposal, then a vote should be taken
on a replacement for the revenue that it would have generated. Therefore, a
decision one way or the other should be made at a meeting in August.
Regent Taylor commented that the president understands the sense of
the Board, that the proposal needs to be brought back in time to be implemented, and that a vote will be taken either for or against at a meeting in
August. Regent McGowan responded that she believes that would be an unfortunate scenario.
Regent Power summarized that the UMHS budget would be voted on
today, minus the portion relating to M-Care preference, with the understanding that by August 15th, the Regents would be asked to vote either to
approve the M-Care preference or to vote on another means of balancing the
budget.
Regent McGowan withdrew her original motion, and Regent Deitch
moved a substitute motion, to adopt the FY1998 UMHS Clinical Delivery
System's Operating Budget with the caveat that by August 15 the Regents
convene by a duly called conference telephone call, for a meeting to act upon
a recommendation from the president with regard to M-Care preference or
an alternative, which in the president's judgment would be an appropriate
revenue substitute for M-Care preference if it is not so recommended.
Regent Power seconded the motion.
There followed a discussion about whether the vote in August would be
on the entire CDS budget, or on only the portion that pertains to M-Care
preference. Regent McFee suggested that the vote be tabled until the following morning. Regent McGowan pointed out that she would be absent then.
Regent McFee stated that she would like to find a way to resolve the
issue of a balanced budget, and deferring the vote until the next day seemed
to be the logical way to do this. Regent McFee moved to table the vote on
Regent Deitch's motion until the following day. Regent Newman seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

July Meeting, 1997


1997-98 University Health Service Fee
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved an increase in the 1997-98 University Health
Service Fee of $2.50 per student per term.
FY 1997-98 Ann Arbor General Fund Operating Budget
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved the Ann Arbor Campus General Fund
Operating Budget for FY 1997-98.
UM Ann Arbor Student Fee Rates for 1997-98
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the recommended student fee rates for 1997-98, as
described in the Regents Communication.
UM-Dearborn 1997-98 General Fund Budget
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the 1997-98 General Fund Budget.
UM-Dearborn 1997-98 Student Fee Rates
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved the 1997-98 student fee rates, as described in the
Regents Communication.
Resolution in Honor of J. Bernard Machen
Regent Horning read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend and express
their deepest appreciation to J. Bernard Machen as he completes his
two-year term as provost and executive vice president for academic
affairs on August 31, 1997.
Provost Machen assumed the University's top academic post at a
crucial time of transition for the University. He quickly mastered the
intricacies of the demanding job of provost, and he provided invaluable guidance and counsel to the Regents during the presidential
search. Accessible, forthright, resolute, and precise in carrying out his
duties, Provost Machen earned the admiration and respect of faculty
and staff, deans, and the Regents. He opened discourse with faculty
on a number of important issues, including the faculty grievance
process, and oversaw implementation of Value Centered Management,
a major change in the University's budgeting system.
Provost Machen came to the University of Michigan as dean of
the School of Dentistry in 1989. Prior to that, he held teaching and
administrative posts at several universities and served as a major in


10




July Meeting, 1997


the U.S. Army Dental Corps. He received his D.D.S. degree from St.
Louis University and earned his M.S. degree in pedodontics and his
Ph.D. degree in educational psychology, both from the University of
Iowa.
Provost Machen's wife, Chris, has been a strong supporter of the
University and of the work of the provost's office. Always gracious, she
has encouraged collegiality by frequently hosting social events to bring
together faculty and spouses from across the University. She also has
been an enthusiastic supporter of University events, regularly attending official functions, athletic contests, and student-sponsored
programs.
With admiration and deep gratitude for their numerous contributions to the University, and particularly for their leadership during a
time of transition, the Regents extend their best wishes and appreciation to Bernie and Chris Machen.
Following a round of applause, Provost Machen thanked the Regents
and said how much he had enjoyed his tenure as provost. There followed a
standing ovation.
President's House Renovation
Regent Power made the following motion:
The President's House was built in 1840 and is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. It is the oldest building on campus and an
important part of the history of the University. Originally built as a professor's house, the President's House symbolizes the long and continuous
academic tradition that is so close to the heart of this institution.
When he became president in February, President Bollinger
announced his intention to make the President's House more visible as a
center of the intellectual life of the University, and indeed, in these first six
months has hosted breakfasts, lunches, and dinners as well as informal
events there. He has expressed his intention to hold even more events there,
and from time to time, to host the most distinguished visitors to the University as guests in his house.
To that end, plans have been developed to refurbish and renovate
substantial parts of the second and third floors of the home. Although refurbishment projects of this size do not normally require Regental approval, the
Regents wish to go on record to applaud President Bollinger for his initiative
in bringing the house more to the center of University life and to authorize
the use of up to $250,000 from undesignated gifts to the University for this
purpose.
Regent McGowan seconded the motion. Regent Maynard expressed
support for the motion, noting that the house is a showcase and the president is using it as it should be used.


11




July Meeting, 1997


Regent Power recalled that the first floor of the President's House was
last renovated when President Duderstadt took office, with approval given at
a public meeting, and that it is now appropriate to repeat this process for
renovations to the second and third floors.
In response to a question from Regent Newman about undesignated
gifts, Executive Vice President Matthews stated that these are bequests that
are made with no strings, and that either the principal or interest can be
used for any purpose at all. Regent Newman expressed the view that principal not be used, as she did not believe that donors necessarily may have
expected their donations to be used for furnishings for a home.
Regent Taylor expressed strong disagreement, noting that he did not
believe that it was proper to speculate on what donors mean when they
direct that their gifts be used for unspecified and unrestricted purposes; he
believes their intentions should be taken at face value.
Regent Deitch noted that in the context of an overall budget that
exceeds $2 billion, amounts of $250,000 or $1 million could be viewed as a
"slip of the pencil;" however, as stewards of these funds, the Regents are
responsible for accounting for them. He believes this is an appropriate use of
University funds, given that the president is the leader of the institution, the
house is in the center of the campus, and the president has pledged to have it
serve as a home and a place that represents the hospitality of the University
and the center of its intellectual life. Therefore, appropriately outfitting it is
an appropriate use of $250,000, and whether the funds used come from interest or principal is irrelevant.
Regent Horning commented that he has talked to several individuals
who have been entertained recently in the house and had reported a "warm
feeling again in Ann Arbor and the University that they hadn't felt recently."
He commended the president for using the house in this way and expressed
support for the motion.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Power made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202 and 1996 PA 464, I move that the Board of Regents meet
in closed session on July 17, 1997, in the Regents' Room, for the
purpose of considering the purchase or lease of real property.
Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then continued in executive session, beginning at 5:05 p.m.


12




July Meeting, 1997


Friday, July 18, 1997
The Regents met at 9:30 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McFee,
Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Provost Machen, Interim
Executive Vice President Matthews, Vice President Harrison, Vice President
Hartford, Acting Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellor Nelms, Chancellor
Renick, and Secretary Palmer. Regent McGowan and Vice President
Kinnear were absent.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and called on Chancellor
Nelms.
UM-Flint 1997-98 General Fund Budget and Tuition and Fee Rates
Chancellor Nelms reviewed the budget proposal, noting that it had
three objectives: to maintain quality and affordability for students; to
provide greater access to technology for students, faculty, and staff; and to
enhance the retention and success of students. The budget represents the
smallest tuition and fee increase on the Flint campus since 1985-86 (about
$47.00 per semester for tuition and $15.70 in fee increases for lower division
undergraduate students). He noted that much of the fee increase would be
used directly to support student activities related to their majors. The technology fee is to be used exclusively for the acquisition of computer hardware and
software to support students.
Regent Maynard moved approval of the 1997-98 UM-Flint General Fund
budget. Regent Horning seconded the motion.
In response to a question from Regent Newman about the percentage
increases, Chancellor Nelms noted that for lower division undergraduate
students, the tuition increase amounts to 2.9 percent and the combined
tuition and fee increase is 3.6 percent. The combined tuition and fee
increase for upper division undergraduate students is slightly greater than
4.0 percent.
There being no further discussion, the vote was then taken on the
General Fund budget, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Regent Maynard moved approval of the proposed UM-Flint tuition and
fee rates for 1997-98, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent
Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan Health System's Clinical Delivery System
Operating Budget
Regent Power moved to approve the FY1998 UMHS Clinical Delivery
System's Operating Budget, with the caveat that the portion of the budget
which pertains to M-Care preference, as it has been described, will be considered at a subsequent meeting. If M-Care preference is eliminated, the


13




July Meeting, 1997


administration will propose to the Regents a plan for balancing the UMHS
budget. Regent Deitch supported the motion.
It was determined that the meeting would have to be held within about
two weeks, and it was confirmed that the meeting could be in the form of a
conference call. Vice President Harrison said that if the meeting were held
by conference call, it would be made accessible to the press and public.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
1997-98 Revenue and Expenditure Budgets
Regent Power moved approval of the revenue and expenditure operating
budgets for 1997-98, with the caveat that the portion of the budget which
pertains to M-Care preference in the UMHS Clinical Delivery System's
Operating budget will be considered at a subsequent meeting. Regent McFee
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted minutes of the June 1997 meeting.
Reports. Executive Vice President Matthews submitted Reports of
Investments, Plant Extension, Litigation, Human Resources and Affirmative
Action, and Non-Competitive Purchases over $5,000 from Single Sources
from April 1 through June 30, 1997.
Vice President Neidhardt submitted Reports of Projects Established and
Summaries of Current Research and Sponsored Projects for June 1997. He
noted that the technology transfer program has been very successful. Based
on current licensing contracts and equity holdings, the University's revenues
from technology transfer during this fiscal year are expected to be nearly
triple that of last year's, exceeding $6 million. Regent Power complimented
Vice President Neidhardt on a very encouraging report, noting that the
Regents had spent a lot of time modifying technology transfer policies.
Vice President Neidhardt reported on the activities of the Year of
Humanities and the Arts ("YoHA"), which will take place during the 1997-98
academic year.
Voluntary Support. The final report of fiscal-year gift receipts,
including the totals for the month of June, will be presented in the September meeting.
Personnel Actions. Provost Machen submitted a number of personnel
actions. President Bollinger noted that Ms. Chacona Johnson would be
joining his office as chief of staff, while also retaining her appointment in the
Office of the Vice President for Development.

Retirement Memoirs. Seven retirement memoirs were presented to
the Regents.
Richard E. Czarnecki, professor of business administration at the
UM-Dearborn School of Management, retired from active faculty status on
April 30, 1997.
Professor Czarnecki received his B.S. (1953) and M.B.A. (1957) degrees
from the University of Detroit, and his Ph.D. degree in 1965 from Michigan
State University. From 1955-68, he was a professor at the University of
Detroit. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan-Dearborn as a
visiting professor of business administration in 1968 and was promoted to
professor in 1969.
A beloved and dedicated educator, Professor Czarnecki has served with
great distinction throughout his career. A well-recognized leader in the
accounting profession, he has won top honors in the field from such organizations as the Michigan Association of Certified Public Accountants, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the National
Association of State Boards of Accountancy. In recognition of teaching and
professional excellence, he has received the UM-Dearborn Distinguished
Teaching Award, the Michigan Association of Governing Boards' Distinguished Faculty Award, the MACPA Distinguished Service Award and
Distinguished Achievement Award, and the AICPA Accounting Educator-ofthe-Year award an unprecedented four times. He has also served as member
and chair of the Michigan State Board of Accountancy and director-at-large
of the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy.
On May 22, 1997, at "A Tribute to Dick Czarnecki," organized by
alumni and colleagues, Professor Czarnecki received a special proclamation
signed by Governor John Engler and the leaders of the state house and
senate. The proclamation recognized Professor Czarnecki as "a highlyrespected educator, administrator, and member of the accounting profession,
who served the academic community, the state of Michigan, and his students
with distinction for over four decades." Known as a devoted educator who
never forgets a name, the three tribute albums that Professor Czarnecki
received at the event, containing over 300 letters from former students and
colleagues, were especially meaningful. He also received the first-ever
Chancellor's Medal from Chancellor James C. Renick, in recognition of his
exceptional contributions to UM-Dearborn.
The Regents now salute this dedicated teacher and senior member of the
Dearborn campus by naming Richard E. Czarnecki professor emeritus of
business administration.

July Meeting, 1997


Mary Lou Kemme, assistant professor of psychology, Department of
Psychiatry, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1997, after a
productive career as a teacher, clinician, and diagnostician.
Professor Kemme received her A.B. degree from Calvin College in 1959
and her A.M.. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1961
and 1971, respectively. Between 1960-71, she was a clinical psychology
intern at Children's Psychiatric Hospital, University Counseling Center, and
the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Michigan. As a teaching
assistant, she provided individual and group supervision of psychodiagnostic
methods. She also was a consultant with Perry Nursery School, Washtenaw
County Community Mental Health and York Woods Center. She joined the
University of Michigan as an instructor in 1971 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1974.
Professor Kemme's primary expertise was in the field of child psychotherapy. She was involved in clinical supervision of psychiatric residents,
psychology interns and fellows, and social work students. From 1983-84, she
served as psychology training director for child psychiatry, and in 1984, she
was associate chief psychologist for the Child Service. She was administrative program director for the Child Inpatient and Day Hospital Service from
1984-85 and served as program director of the Day Hospital for Children and
Adolescents from 1985-89. She has been a member of the American Psychological Association since 1971 and a member of the Michigan Psychological
Association since 1974.
Professor Kemme's devoted loyalty as teacher, clinician, and diagnostician has been recognized over the years. Her insightfulness, expertise, and
contributions to the department have been consistently recognized by
faculty, trainees, and staff.
The Regents now salute this distinguished member of the faculty for her
dedicated service by naming Mary Lou Kemme assistant professor emerita of
psychology in the Department of Psychiatry.
Sylvan Kornblum, professor of psychology, College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, and research scientist in the Mental Health Research
Institute and professor of psychology in the Department of Psychiatry,
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1997, after a
productive career as a research psychologist.
Born in Antwerp, Belgium, Dr. Kornblum emigrated with his family to
New York City and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in
1945. He received his B.A. degree in 1951 from Washington University and
his A.M., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees, in 1953, 1955, and 1960, respectively,
from the University of Michigan. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1959 as an associate research psychologist. He was promoted to
research psychologist in 1970, research scientist in 1974, and professor of
psychology with tenure in the Department of Psychiatry in 1975. He has
held his title in the Department of Psychology, College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, since 1991.
Dr. Kornblum is internationally known for his novel approach to the
study of human performance. Human performance is often determined by
whether the stimuli and the responses in a task match or not: if they match,


29




July Meeting, 1997


performance is usually better and easier than if they do not match. The
theory that Dr. Kornblum has been developing over the past several
years-the Dimensional Overlap Model-postulates that matches may result
from perceptual, conceptual, or structural similarities between the stimulus
and the response sets. Matches may also reflect the strength of association
between stimuli and responses. The results of experiments he has been
conducting extends the theory to other fundamental cognitive processes and
suggests that the family of tasks studied taps basic human cognitive
capacities.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and scientist for his
dedicated service by naming Sylvan Kornblum professor emeritus of psychology, research scientist emeritus, and professor emeritus of psychology in the
Department of Psychiatry.
Paul R. Lehman, senior associate dean and professor of music, School
of Music, and lecturer, School of Education, will retire from active faculty
status on August 31, 1997.
A native of Athens, Ohio, Professor Lehman received his B.S.Ed. degree
from Ohio University in 1953 and his M.Mus. and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of Michigan in 1959 and 1962, respectively. He was a public
school teacher in Ohio from 1953-55 and served in the U.S. Air Force in
Tripoli from 1955-57. Between 1962 and 1975, he taught at the University
of Colorado, the University of Kentucky, and the Eastman School of Music at
the University of Rochester and served for a year as a music specialist with
the U.S. Department of Education. He joined the faculty of the University of
Michigan in 1975 as a professor of music. He was appointed associate dean
in 1977 and senior associate dean for graduate studies in 1989.
Professor Lehman has served the Music Educators National Conference
continuously since 1964 in several dozen roles, including its presidency from
1984-86. Since 1992, he has been regularly involved in a wide variety of
standards-related publications and activities, and he chaired the task force
that developed the voluntary national standards for K-12 instruction in
music. He has served on the board of directors of the International Society
for Music Education, the executive board and council of the College Music
Society, and in leadership posts in several other influential music education
agencies. He was project director for the National Symposium on the Applications of Psychology to the Teaching and Learning of Music. He has served
as a consultant to state departments of education, state assessment
programs, school districts, foundations, corporations, and to the National
Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and the
U.S. Department of Education. He has addressed music educators in almost
every state and in a dozen nations, and he is the author of more than 100
publications concerned with curriculum, teacher education, and measurement and evaluation. He has received citations from the Music Educators
National Conference, National Federation of Music Clubs, Foundation for
the Advancement of Education in Music, the Alumni Society of the University of Michigan School of Music, and other music educators' associations.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Paul R. Lehman professor emeritus of music.

July Meeting, 1997


Philip M. Margolis, M.D., professor of psychiatry, retired from active
faculty status on June 30, 1997, after a most productive career.
Dr. Margolis received his B.A. (1945), B.S. (1947), and M.D. (1948)
degrees from the University of Minnesota. He completed an internship at
Milwaukee County Hospital (1948-49) and a psychiatry residency at the
Veterans Administration Hospital and University of Minnesota Hospitals
(1949-52). He was a fellow with the U.S. Public Health Service at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1952-53, and he also received additional graduate
training in psychoanalysis.
From 1953-55, Dr. Margolis was an instructor at the University of
Minnesota, and from 1955-66, he was an assistant professor, then associate
professor, at the University of Chicago. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1966 as professor of psychiatry. He was director of the
Washtenaw County Community Mental Health Center from 1966-72, and in
1969, he received a joint appointment as professor of community mental
health in the School of Public Health. Dr. Margolis served as associate chief
of clinical affairs from 1981-85. In 1985, he helped establish and served as
the first chair of the University of Michigan Hospitals Ethics Committee. He
has also served on the Medical School Admissions Committee.
Dr. Margolis has been a leader in many state and national organizations.
He is a life fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and has been
active in a number of its affiliated organizations. He has served as president
of the Michigan Psychiatric Society and the Washtenaw County Medical
Society. Dr. Margolis served on the Michigan Board of Medicine and is a
member of the board of directors of the Federation of State Medical Boards.
He is a diplomate of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and
has been an examiner for the board for thirty years. Within the University,
Dr. Margolis founded and organized the annual Raymond W. Waggoner
Lectureship on Ethics and Values in Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry. He is a resolution officer for the Code of Student Conduct and is chair of
the Civil Liberties Board. In recognition of Dr. Margolis' devotion as a
teacher and clinician, he was given an appreciation award by psychiatric
residents in 1991 and a career service award by the Mental Health Association of Michigan in 1992.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his
dedicated service by naming Philip M. Margolis professor emeritus of
psychiatry.
William Martel, M.D., the Fred Jenner Hodges Professor of Radiology,
will retire from active faculty status on August 31, 1997, after a most productive career as a teacher, researcher, and clinician.
Dr. Martel received his B.S. (1950) and M.D. (1953) degrees from New
York University. After serving his internship at Kings County Hospital in
Brooklyn and residency at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City from
1953-57, he joined the University of Michigan Medical School as an instructor in 1957. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1960, associate professor in 1963, and professor in 1966. During his 40 years at the University of
Michigan, Dr. Martel served in numerous capacities, including chief of the
Section of Musculoskeletal Radiology, director of the Radiology Residency


31




July Meeting, 1997


Training Program, director of clinical services, and from 1982-92, as chair of
the Department of Radiology.
Throughout his career, Dr. Martel has been a strong advocate for the
role of radiology in medical student education. When he was not personally
directing the department's efforts, he encouraged and guided others in their
participation. Dr. Martel is an accomplished teacher, both in informal
settings at the viewbox and as a lecturer. He has served as a faculty advisor
to numerous medical students considering a career in radiology and has
frequently taught informally small groups of students interested in
additional exposure prior to beginning their internships. In 1979, he was
awarded the University's Amoco Outstanding Teaching Award. The citation
noted "his sincere dedication to the teaching of medicine, his special talent
for imparting his knowledge and inspiring students to develop their own
latent faculties. His teaching emphasized the common sense approach to
medical diagnosis and his enthusiastic manner, scholarly attitude, and keen
sense of humor left a lasting impression." Dr. Martel's contributions were
further recognized in 1985 when he was named the Fred Jenner Hodges
Professor of Radiology.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his
dedicated service by naming William Martel, the Fred Jenner Hodges Professor Emeritus of Radiology.
James M. Miller, associate professor of industrial and operations
engineering, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1997.
Professor Miller received his B.S. degree in 1963, his M.B.A. degree in
1965, and his Ph.D. degree in 1971, all from The Ohio State University. He
began his career at the University of Michigan as assistant professor of
industrial and operations engineering (IOE) in 1971 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1976.
Professor Miller developed new courses in safety management, occupational and product safety engineering, safety engineering research, and legal
and labor issues in industrial engineering. He co-founded the IOE Occupational Health and Safety graduate program  and traineeship, and with
another faculty member, initiated the University's multi-disciplinary
program in rehabilitation engineering. Within the Dental School, he initiated the application of work measurement and methods engineering to
operative dental practices.
Professor Miller's work on motor carrier safety is well-known, and he
has also contributed greatly to the field of recreational boating safety. His
two volumes that define future directions for the U.S. Coast Guard's
research program in recreational boating safety and human factors are
particularly significant, and he continues to be known as the foremost
authority in this area.
In collaboration with Mark Lehto, Professor Miller also initiated
research that led to publication of the book Warnings: Fundamentals, Design
and Evaluation Methodologies, in 1986. This book has gained international
recognition and continues to be an authoritative source. The approaches he
pioneered are becoming the standard in the design of on-product labeling.


32




July Meeting, 1997


During the Carter administration, Professor Miller was appointed to act
as director of safety standards for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA). He has also assisted the Consumer Product Safety
Commission on numerous occasions. Most recently, he was asked to conduct
user research and develop the safety labeling that will appear on every
all-terrain vehicle sold in the United States after 1997.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming James M. Miller
associate professor emeritus of industrial and operations engineering.
Memorials. No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees. The Regents took the following actions with respect to
degrees: They approved the August 1997 Doctoral Degree List; they
approved final degree lists for the June 1997 Medical School commencement
and the May 1997 commencements of the various schools, colleges, divisions,
and branch campuses; and they approved changes to previously approved
degree lists. Copies of all of the degree lists are on file in the Office of the
Secretary of the University.
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded
by Regent Taylor, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
Commitment of $15.0 million from the Long Term Portfolio to
Vector Later-Stage Equity Fund II, L.P.
The Regents received information about the commitment of $15.0
million from the Long Term Portfolio to Vector Later-Stage Equity Fund II,
L.P. This is a follow-on investment to the initial $5.0 million commitment in
Vector Later-Stage Equity Fund, L.P., approved in 1994.
Real Estate Investment Trust Manager
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved State Street Global Advisors Real Estate
Liquid Equity Fund as a passively managed REIT investment vehicle,
pending favorable legal review of the documents by the Office of the General
Counsel. Regent Newman was away from the table when the vote was taken.
Energy Common Stock Manager
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved Spindrift Partners, L.P., as an energy common stock
manager, subject to completion of due diligence and favorable review of the
documents for their legal acceptability by the general counsel's office.
Alternative Asset Investment
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of up to $15.0 million from the Long
Term Portfolio in AG Long-Term Super Fund, L.P., pending favorable legal
review of the documents by the general counsel's office.


33




July Meeting, 1997


Sale of Tax-Exempt Commercial Paper by the University
Executive Vice President Matthews called on Associate Vice President
Norman Herbert. Associate Vice President Herbert noted that the Regents
had previously authorized the issuance of debt secured by a pledge of general
revenues and the development of a structure for the sale of commercial
paper. The proposed commercial paper program would provide interim
financing to University projects which require the issuance of debt.
Refinancing of the outstanding $3.9 million of Regents of the University of
Michigan Variable Rate Demand Intercollegiate Athletic Revenue Bonds,
Series 1995, will also be included in the commercial paper program, resulting
in additional savings.
Mr. Herbert explained further details about the commercial paper
program, all of which are contained in the Regents Communication. Following his presentation, Regent Power moved, and Regent Newman seconded, a
resolution authorizing the issuance of up to $120 million of commercial
paper supported by a pledge of general revenues.
Mr. Herbert then commented further on the implications of this
program. He noted that in the past, the University had used fixed rate debt,
which has a higher interest rate than variable rate debt or commercial paper.
The lower financing costs achieved by using commercial paper ultimately
lead to a higher return on investments.
Regent Deitch observed that commercial paper is a method of financing
for the largest and most credit-worthy borrowers, and it deals with short-term
needs for cash. Mr. Herbert noted that the only time the amount of the
outstanding commercial paper would be increased would be based on approved
projects; the Board would be informed each time this is contemplated.
Following further discussion, the vote was taken and the motion was
approved unanimously. The following is the text of the approved resolution:
RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE AND DELIVERY
OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, SERIES A,
AND PROVIDING FOR OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO
WHEREAS, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer")
constitutes a constitutional body corporate established pursuant to Article VIII,
Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as amended, with the general
supervision of the University of Michigan (the "University") and the control and
direction of all expenditures from the University's funds; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has determined it is necessary and desirable to
provide for the temporary financing of capital projects of the University currently
under way or to be undertaken within the next succeeding eighteen months,
through the issuance of Regents of the University of Michigan Commercial Paper
Notes, Series A (the "Notes"), in principal amount outstanding from time to time
not to exceed $120,000,000; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has determined it is necessary and appropriate to
refund through the issuance of Notes the outstanding balance of the Issuer's
$5,000,000 Regents of the University of Michigan Variable Rate Demand

respective series of Senior Lien Indebtedness (until each respective series of such
Senior Lien Indebtedness is paid or defeased in accordance with its terms), and
moneys from time to time on deposit in the Note Payment Fund created pursuant
to the Issuance Certificate, as provided therein. The Notes shall also be payable
from Available Investments, as provided in the Issuance Certificate. The Issuer
shall covenant in the Issuance Certificate that so long as any of the Notes remain
outstanding, the Issuer will not issue any new series of Senior Lien Indebtedness.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount of or
interest on the Notes or any claim based thereon against the state of Michigan,
or, except as provided in the Issuance Certificate, the Issuer, or against any
officer or agent of the Issuer or of the University, as individuals, either directly or
indirectly, nor shall the Notes and interest with respect thereto become a lien on
or be secured by any property, real, personal or mixed of the state of Michigan,
the Issuer, or the University, other than the General Revenues and the moneys
from time to time on deposit in the Note Payment Fund created by the Issuance
Certificate.

July Meeting, 1997


Renovation Projects
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved the following projects: Upgrading of the
office HVAC distribution in the Medical Science I Building; and replacement
of domestic hot water piping supply and return lines and low pressure
condensate lines in the tunnel from the Central Power Plant to Stockwell
Hall, Mosher Jordan Hall, and Alice Lloyd Hall.
Engineering Programs Building and Plasma Research Building
Addition and Renovation (Student Design Team Project Center)
Executive Vice President Matthews called on Mr. Doug Hanna, University architect, to present the plans for the Student Design Team Project
Center. He said that the purpose of the project is to establish space for
students to form teams to work on high profile engineering projects, such as
the concrete canoe, hybrid electric vehicles, solar cars and solar boats. He
displayed diagrams illustrating a site plan and interior plan, described details
of the interior space plan, and displayed an architectural model of the
finished project.
Dean Director of the College of Engineering commented that this facility
would provide much needed and versatile space for engineering students.
Regent McFee moved approval of the Engineering Programs Building
and Plasma Research Building addition and renovation project, as described.
Regent Newman seconded the motion. President Bollinger noted that the
physical location of this project also has the potential to highlight this area of
campus, which contains a sculpture by the artist Maya Lin. It was noted
that Ms. Lin was involved in developing the plans for the building in an
effort to enhance her sculpture.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
School of Dentistry Kellogg Building Expansion and Renovation
Executive Vice President Matthews noted that the Kellogg Building
Expansion and Renovation project, including site approval and appointment
of architect, had been approved in November 1996. It has since been determined that additional needs exist for lecture rooms and expansion and
renovation of the Pediatric Dental Clinic, in addition to certain building
renewal work.
Mr. Doug Hanna displayed a site plan, revised design and floor plan, and
a rendering of the exterior. Regent Power moved approval of the revised
scope, budget, and design of the Kellogg Building Expansion and Renovation
Project, and authorization for solicitation of bids and awarding of a construction contract to the successful bidder, providing the project remains within
the approved budget. Regent Maynard seconded the motion.


38




July Meeting, 1997


It was noted that the incremental cost of the revised project is about $6
million. There being no further discussion, the vote was taken, and the
motion was approved unanimously.
Palmer Drive Parking Structure
Executive Vice President Matthews noted that the Regents had previously approved a project for construction of a parking structure on open land
east of the Dental School, and had authorized a site development study to
analyze the long range development potential of the area surrounding the
site. He called on Mr. Fred Mayer to present the results of the site development study.
Mr. Mayer described the physical topography of the site and how this
would affect the plan. Other factors which would impact the plan include
traffic patterns; utilities issues; soils; issues having to do with the operation
of the heating plant; service and access issues; use of the space above the
parking structure; the effect of the various structures in the plan on views of
the campus; phasing of the development; and whether or not to keep North
Hall.
Mr. Mayer revealed a model containing blocks of wood whose purpose is
to estimate gross square footage that would fit on the space. He arranged
the blocks of wood in several configurations to illustrate various schemes for
placement of buildings, and to demonstrate that there are a number of
options available for developing the site, and then responded to comments
from the Regents.
Mr. Hanna noted that planners expect to be able to bring a proposed
design for the parking structure for review by the Regents at a future
meeting.
President Bollinger commented that he has had a number of discussions
with University planners and architects about this project, and that he
intends to propose that a master plan be developed for the entire campus.
He noted that this is a key site for the future of the University of Michigan
because the current thinking is that it is the last remaining building site on
the central campus. Its location also points out the psychological and physical barrier between the Medical School, the residence halls, and the central
campus that is created by Washtenaw Avenue. He believes that eventually
this street could become an underpass.
President Bollinger also said that science education at the University is
very important, but that the various science departments are at scattered
locations on central campus and on the medical campus. Linking these
various science departments is a major issue for the University, and also has
an impact on the development of this space. The construction of a parking
lot seems consistent with all of the options for the future of the space.

July Meeting, 1997


Central Power Plant Fuel Oil Storage System Replacement and
Service Area Reconstruction
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved the Central Power Plant fuel oil storage
system replacement and service area reconstruction project and budget, and
authorized solicitation of bids and awarding of the construction contract to
the successful bidder, providing the contract values are within the approved
budget.
Proposed Agreement between the University of Michigan and
MEDOX Electro-Optics, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved an agreement between the University of Michigan
and MEDOX Electro-Optics, Inc., involving a National Science Foundation
"GOALI" award to a University of Michigan faculty member, with cost
sharing provided by MEDOX Electro-Optics, Inc. Because Gerard Mourou is
both a University of Michigan employee and a member of the board of directors of MEDOX Electro-Optics, Inc., with a 20 percent interest in the firm,
this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.
The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
MEDOX Electro-Optics, Inc.
2.  Terms of the agreement are that the NSF GOALI award is for $50,000 for a
period of one year. MEDOX, Inc. will provide $25,000 in cost-sharing as a condition of the award. A portion of both the NSF award and the MEDOX costsharing will pay the salary of the visiting engineer provided by MEDOX to
collaborate with the University's researchers.
3.  Gerard Mourou's pecuniary interest arises from his 20 percent interest in, and
his position as a member of the board of directors of, MEDOX Electro-Optics,
Inc.
Proposed Agreement between the University of Michigan and
Westat, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved an agreement between the University of
Michigan and Westat, Inc., involving a subcontract with Westat, Inc. as part
of a grant to the University funded by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Because Lois M. Verbrugge is employed both by the University
of Michigan and by Westat, Inc., with a 50 percent appointment at each, this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.
The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Westat, Inc.
2.  Terms of the agreement are a total proposed budget of $616,875, covering a
three-year period beginning August 1, 1997. The subcontract to Westat, Inc.


40




July Meeting, 1997


amounts to $218,904 over the three years. The University's standard subcontract provisions apply.
3.  Lois M. Verbrugge's pecuniary interest arises from her status as an employee of
both the University of Michigan and Westat, Inc.
919 and 925 Wall Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved purchase of the property at 919 Wall Street,
Ann Arbor, Michigan, at a price of $143,500, and the property at 925 Wall
Street at a price to be finalized prior to closing in January 1998, as described
in the Regents Communication.
Refinancing of Industrial Technology Institute's Debt
Executive Vice President Matthews commented that under the terms of
the ground lease between the University and the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI), ITI cannot mortgage its interest in the lease, the leased premises,
or its building without the University's prior written approval. ITI wishes to
refinance its outstanding debt, and based on University's review of its financial condition, the University recommends approval of this request.
Following some discussion, Regent Power moved that the executive vice
president and chief financial officer be authorized to consent in writing to
ITI's request to refinance its outstanding debt, provided the terms and
amount of the financing are satisfactory to the University and permit all of
the material terms and provisions of the lease dated March 1, 1985 to remain
intact.  Regent Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
President Bollinger noted that although Regent McGowan was not
present for the vote, had she been present would have recused herself from
voting on this issue due to a conflict of interest.
Naming of College of Engineering Reflecting Pool and Fountain
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved naming of the reflecting pool between the
Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project and the Robert H. Lurie Engineering
Center the "Class of 1947E Reflecting Pool," and the naming of the pool's
fountain the "Fred Matthaei Fountain."
Arbor Lakes Property
On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously authorized the University to pursue acquisition of the
Arbor Lakes property (4251 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor) at a price not to
exceed the asking price of $13 million, subject to an acceptable environmental survey of the property, an acceptable inspection of the buildings and
mechanical systems, and an acceptable appraisal.


41




July Meeting, 1997


Residency Guidelines
Regent Power moved approval of "Information on Residency Classification for Admission and Tuition Purposes" and "Residency Classification
Guidelines" (both of which shall be referred to as the "Guidelines") as a
replacement for the 1974 Residence Regulations, effective Spring Term,
1998, and a change in the make-up of the Residency Appeals Committee,
effective immediately. Regent Maynard seconded the motion.
Provost Machen noted that the new guidelines do not contain any
significant changes in the practices or policies of the University with respect
to residency determinations. Their purpose is to help students better understand the requirements they must satisfy to be eligible for residency and the
process they must follow to obtain residency.
Regent Newman complimented the staff on the revised guidelines,
noting that a lot of effort had gone into developing them, and said that she
will be interested to see how well they work. Regent McFee observed that in
her years of service on the board she had been approached a number of times
about residency issues, and that these guidelines appear to provide clarification of what is required. She suggested that the guidelines be forwarded to
high schools.
Regent Newman left the meeting at this point, at 11:15 a.m. Provost
Machen noted that this project had had significant input from the secretary
of the University and from the general counsel, and is one of the last projects
that had been undertaken by Associate Vice President Susan Lipschutz
before she died.
There being no further discussion, the vote was taken, and the motion
was approved unanimously. The text of the Guidelines is contained in the
appendix (page 45).
New Degree Program for the UM-Flint School of Health Professions and Studies
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent McFee, the
Regents unanimously approved a new degree program, "Master of Science in
Nursing," to be offered by the UM-Flint School of Health Professions and
Studies, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent Horning was
away from the table for this and the following two votes.
New Degree Program for UM-Dearborn School of Engineering
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved a new degree program, "Bachelor of Science in
Engineering (Manufacturing Engineering)," to be offered by the UM-Dearborn
School of Engineering, as described in the Regents Communication.


42




July Meeting, 1997


Recommendations for Appointment to Medical Staff Membership
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent McFee, and on the
recommendation of the UM Hospitals Executive Board, the Regents unanimously approved certain specified appointments to medical staff membership.
Revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 5.07
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved a revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 5.07.
The revised bylaw follows:
Section 5.07. Administrative Officers of Other University Units
Administrative officers of units other than those covered by Sec. 5.06 shall be
appointed by the Board on recommendation by the president. They shall perform such
administrative duties as are prescribed by the appropriate University authorities.
Appointments to such administrative positions are without tenure and may be
terminated upon the request of the appointee for relief from administrative duties or
by the action of the Board.
Presentation: Research and Undergraduate Education: A Michigan
Tradition
President Bollinger called on Vice President Neidhardt, who gave a
presentation about the University of Michigan's efforts to promote research
experiences for undergraduate students. The presentation highlighted a
number of programs in place at the University, including the Undergraduate
Research Opportunities Program (UROP), the 21st Century Program, the
Women in Science and Engineering residence hall program, and the Faculty
Fellows Program. Vice President Neidhardt described the successes to date
and challenges remaining in reforming undergraduate education.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:45
a.m. Regents' expenses paid in June 1997 totaled $679.80. The date of the
special meeting to be held in August will be announced shortly. The next
regular meeting is scheduled for September 19, 1997.

JULY MEETING, 1997
APPENDIX A
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
INFORMATION ON RESIDENCY CLASSIFICATION
FOR ADMISSION AND TUITION PURPOSES
Authority
The governing board at each university in Michigan has the authority to determine
residency classification guidelines for admission and tuition purposes. Therefore, residency
guidelines may vary from school to school and are independent of guidelines used by other
state authorities to determine residency for purposes such as income and property tax liability,
driving, and voting.
The following guidelines were approved by the University of Michigan's Board of
Regents to take effect spring term 1998 and to apply to students at all campuses of the
University of Michigan. The guidelines are administered by the Residency Classification
Office in the Office of the Registrar at the Ann Arbor campus, 1514 LS&A Building, University
of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1382, (734) 764-1400.
The Student's Responsibilities and the Residency Application Process
It is the student's responsibility to read the University Residency Classification Guidelines
contained in this document and to apply for admission and register under the proper
residency classification. It is also the student's responsibility to file an Application for
Resident Classification for an official determination of status. Students are encouraged to
consult with staff in the Residency Classification Office if they have questions or assistance.
The admissions offices at the various schools and colleges within the University perform the
initial screening for residency classification. If a student indicates Michigan resident status
on the admissions application and the admissions office questions that status, the student
will be classified as a nonresident and notified of the need to file an Application for Resident
Classification with the Residency Classification Office. The fact that a student's claim to
residency for University purposes is questioned does not necessarily mean that he or she will be
ineligible; it simply means that the student's circumstances must be documented and
reviewed by the Residency Classification Office. Failure on the part of admissions staff to
question a student's claim to resident eligibility does not relieve the student of the responsibility to apply and register under the proper residency classification. Furthermore, the University reserves the right to audit enrolled or prospective students at any time with regard to eligibility for resident classification and to reclassify students who are registered under an
improper residency classification.
Until an Application for Resident Classification is filed and approved, a student who
previously attended any campus of the University of Michigan as a nonresident will continue
to be classified as a nonresident at all campuses.
Upon application for admission to any campus of the University, an individual who
claims eligibility for resident classification must file an Application for Resident Classification
for an official determination of status if any of the following circumstances apply:
* the individual is living out of state at the time of application to the University
* either parent is living out of state (applies if the individual is 24 years of age
or younger)


45




July Meeting, 1997 - Appendix A


*    the individual has attended or graduated from an out of state high school
(applies if the individual is 24 years of age or younger)
*    the individual has attended or graduated from an out of state high school
and has been involved in educational pursuits for the majority of time since
graduation from high school
*    the individual has had out of state employment or domicile within the last 3
years
The above list is not exhaustive. An individual is responsible for filing an application for
resident classification in any situation where the individual's eligibility for residency under
these guidelines could be reasonably questioned.
Filing Deadlines
Students may apply for resident classification for any term in which they are enrolled
or intend to enroll. The deadline dates for filing the Application for Resident Classification
are the same for all University of Michigan schools, colleges, and campuses.* The following
dates apply to the term for which residency is sought If the deadline falls on a weekend, it
will be extended to the next business day.
Fall Term.... September 30
Winter Term.... January 31
For all Spring, Spring/Summer, and Summer Terms.... July 31
* For the On Job/On Campus program, filing deadlines are 30 calendar days after the
first scheduled day of classes.
Documentation Which Must Be Included When Filming for Resident Classification
When filing an Application for Resident Classification, the following documentation
must be included with the application form:
*    for all applicants: a copy of the driver's license of the applicant and of the
person or persons upon whom the applicant is basing the claim to resident
eligibility
* for all applicants: copies of the front and signature pages of the most recent
year's federal and state income tax returns and W2s for the applicant and
the person or persons upon whom the applicant is basing the claim to
resident eligibility
*   for applicants born outside the U.S.: verification of U.S. citizenship or visa
status
*   for applicants who are dependents: (see Residence Classification Guideline
B-l) copies of the front and signature pages of the parents' most recent
year's federal and state income tax returns
*   for applicants whose claim to eligibility for resident classification is based on
permanent full-time employment for themselves, a parent, spouse, or domestic partner: a letter from the employer, written on letterhead (including
phone number), stating the position, status and dates of employment. The letter
should be accompanied by a copy of the most recent pay stub showing Michigan
taxes being withheld.
Applicants are also responsible for providing any other documentation necessary to
support their claim to resident eligibility. Additional documentation may be requested by the
Residency Classification Office.


46




July Meeting, 1997 - Appendix A


Appeal Process
If an Application for Resident Classification is denied by the Residency Classification
Office, the student may request that his or her file be reviewed by the University's Residency
Appeal Committee. The appeal request must be made in writing and must be received in the
Residency Classification Office within 30 calendar days of the date on the denial letter. If the
deadline falls on a weekend or University holiday, it will be extended to the next business day.
All contact with the Residency Appeal Committee must be in writing. Personal contact
with a member of the committee prior to the meeting could disqualify the member from
participating in the decision. A student who wishes the committee to consider additional
information must submit the information to the Residency Classification Office, in writing,
with the appeal request The information will then be forwarded to the Residency Appeal
Committee with the student's file.
The student will receive a written decision from the committee when the review is
complete. Once the Residency Appeal Committee issues its decision there are no further
appeals for the term covered by the application.
Misrepresentation and Falsification of Information
Applicants who provide false or misleading information or who intentionally omit relevant
information in an application for admission, an application for resident classification, or any
other document relevant to residency eligibility may be subject to legal or disciplinary
measures. Students improperly classified as residents based on this type of information will
have their residency classification changed and may be retroactively charged nonresident
tuition for the period of time they were improperly classified.
Residency Classification Guidelines
For University purposes. "domicile" is defined as the place where an individual intends
his/her true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment to be, and to which the
individual intends to return whenever he or she is absent. These Guidelines are designed to
explain how a student may demonstrate the required intent and establishment of a domicile in
Michigan. An individual whose activities and circumstances, as documented to the University,
demonstrate that she/he intends to be domiciled in Michigan has, in fact, established a
domicile in Michigan will be eligible for classification as a resident. An individual whose
presence in the state is based on activities or circumstances that are indeterminate or temporary,
such as (but not limited to) educational pursuits, will be presumed not to be domiciled in
Michigan and will be classified as a nonresident. The burden of proof is on the applicant to
demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence that he or she is eligible for resident classification
under these guidelines.
These guidelines describe situations that create presumptions of resident and nonresident
status. The fact that a presumption of resident status may apply to a student does not mean
that the student will automatically be classified as a resident or that the student is relieved
of the responsibility for filing an Application for Resident Classification. (See The Student's
Responsibilities and the Residency Application Process on page 1.) To overcome a presumption
of nonresident status, a student must file a residency application and document with clear
and convincing evidence that a Michigan domicile has been established.
A. GENERAL GUIDELINES
1.   Circumstances which may demonstrate permanent domicile
The following circumstances and activities, though not conclusive or exhaustive
may lend support to a claim to eligibility for resident classification:


47




July Meeting, 1997 - Appendix A


* both parents (in the case of divorce, one parent) permanently
domiciled in Michigan as demonstrated by permanent employment,
establishment of a household, and severance of out of state ties
* applicant employed in the state in a full-time, permanent
position provided that the applicant's employment is the primary
purpose for the applicant's presence in Michigan
* spouse or domestic partner employed in the state in a full-time,
permanent position provided that the spouse or partner's employment is the primary purpose for the student's presence in Michigan
2.   Circumstances which do not demonstrate permanent domicile
The circumstances and activities listed below are temporary or indeterminate
and, in and of themselves, do not demonstrate permanent domicile:
*    enrollment in high school, community college, or university
*    participation in a medical residency program, fellowship or internship
*    employment that is temporary or short-term
*    military assignment
*    employment in a position normally held by a student
*    ownership of property
*    presence of relatives (other than parents)
*    possession of a Michigan driver's license or voter registration
~    payment of Michigan income or property taxes
~    the applicant's statement of intent to be domiciled in Michigan
3.   One year continuous presence
In cases where it is determined that an applicant has not demonstrated establishment of a domicile in Michigan as defined by these guidelines, the University will
require the applicant to document one year of continuous physical presence in the
state as one of the criteria for determining eligibility for resident classification in
any subsequent Application for Resident Classification. The year to be
documented will be the one year immediately preceding the first day of classes of
the term in question. The year of continuous presence is never the only criterion
used for determining resident eligibility, and, in itself, will not qualify a student for
resident status. If substantial and new information arises which changes the circumstances of a student's presence in Michigan and which clearly demonstrates the establishment of a Michigan domicile, the student may be immediately eligible for
resident classification prior to the passage of one year.
In documenting the year of continuous physical presence in Michigan, the applicant will be expected to show actual physical presence by means of enrollment,
employment, in-person financial transactions, health care appointments, etc.
Having a lease or a permanent address in the state does not, in itself, qualify as
physical presence. Short-term absences (summer vacation of 21 days or less,
spring break, and break between fall and winter term), in and of themselves, will
not jeopardize compliance with the one year requirement. In determining the
effect of a short term absence, the nature of the absence will be assessed to determine whether it is contrary to an intent to be domiciled in Michigan. Absences
from the state in excess of the time mentioned above or failure to document
physical presence at the beginning and end of the year will be considered as
noncompliance with the one-year continuous presence requirement.

July Meeitmg, 1997 Appendix A


Bo  IRESIDENCY PRESUIMPTIONS IN PARTICULAR             CIRCU$UMSTANCCES
The fact that a presumption of resident status may apply to a student does not mean
that the student will automatically be classified as a resident or that the student is
relieved of the responsibility for filing an Application for Resident Classification. (See
The Student's Responsibilities and the Residency Application Process on page 1.)
1. Depende Sdent Students
For University residency classification purposes, a student is presumed to be a dependent of his or her parents if the student is 24 years of age or younger and (1) has
been primarily involved in educational pursuits, or (2) has not been entirely financially self-supporting through employment
a    Residents
i.   Dependent Student - Parents in Michigan
A  dependent sdenent whose parents are, according to University
Residency Classification Guidelines, domiciled in Michigan is presumed to
be eligible for resident classification for University purposes as long as the
student has not taken steps to establish a domicile outside of Michigan or
any other action inconsistent with maintaining a domicile in Michigan.
ii.  Dependent Student of Divorced Parents - One Parent in Michigan
A dependent student whose parents are divorced is presumed to be
eligible for resident classification for University purposes if one parent
is, according to University Residency Classification  Guidelines,
domiciled in Michigan. The student mut   not have taken steps to
establish an independent domicile outside of Michigan or any other
action inconsistent with maintaining a domicile in Michigan.
iii.  Dependent Resident Student Whose Parents Leave Michigan
A student who is living in Michigan and who is, by University
Residency Classification Guidelines, permanently domiciled in Michigan does not lose resident status if the parents leave Michigan,
provided (1) that the student has completed at least the junior year of
high school prior to the parents' departure, (2) that the student
remains in Michigan, enrolled as a full-time student in high school or
an institution of higher education, and (3) that the student has not
taken steps to establish a domicile outside Michigan or any other
action inconsistent with maintaining a domicile in Michigan.
b.   Nonresidents
Dependent Student - Parents not in Michigan
A dependent student whose parents are domiciled outside the state of Michigan
is presumed to be a nonresident for University purposes.
2.   Michigan Residents and Absences From the State
Individuals who have been domiciled in Michigan according to University
Residency Classification Guidelines immediately preceding certain types of
absences from the state may retain their eligibility for resident classification
under the conditions listed below:
a    One Year Absence
An individual who has been domiciled in Michigan immediately preceding
an absence from the state of less than one year may return to the University


49




July Meeting, 1997 - Appendix A


as a resident for admission and tuition purposes provided (1) that the
individual has maintained significant ties to the state during his or her
absence, and (2) that the individual severs out of state ties upon returning
to Michigan.
While a student described in this subsection is presumed to have retained
his/her eligibility for resident classification, an individual who has been
absent from the state in excess of one year (and who does not fall within the
circumstances described at (b) - (c) below) may still be able to prove eligibility for resident classification if the student 1) has not established a domicile
outside Michigan; 2) demonstrates the continuous maintenance of a Michigan domicile throughout his/her absence (e.g. payment of Michigan taxes,
maintenance of Michigan driver's license and Michigan voters registration,
active bank/business accounts, and parents still in state); and 3) severs all
out of state ties upon returning to Michigan.
b.   Absence for Active Duty Military Service (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,
Coast Guard), Missionary Work, Peace Corps, or Similar Philanthropic Work
An individual who is domiciled in Michigan at the time of entry into active
military duty, missionary work, Peace Corps, or similar philanthropic work
does not lose eligibility for resident classification as long as he or she is on
continuous active duty and continuously claims Michigan as the state of
legal residence for income tax purposes. Dependent children of such an
individual are also eligible for resident classification, provided (1) that they
are coming to the University directly from high school or they have been
continuously enrolled in college since graduating from high school, and (2) that
they have not claimed residency for tuition purposes elsewhere.
c.   Absence for Education or Training
An individual who is domiciled in Michigan immediately preceding an absence
from the state for full-time enrollment in school or for a medical residency
program, internship, or fellowship does not lose eligibility for resident classification provided (1) that the individual has maintained significant ties to
the state during his or her absence (e.g., parents still in the state, payment
of state taxes, active business accounts), and (2) that the individual has not
claimed residency for tuition purposes elsewhere.
3.   Residence Status of Immigrants and Aliens
Only persons who are entitled to reside permanently in the United States may be
eligible for resident classification at the University. These individuals, like U.S.
citizens, must still prove that they have established a Michigan domicile as
defined in these guidelines. Having the privilege of remaining permanently in the
United States, in itself, does not entitle a person to resident classification for
University purposes. The Residency Classification Office will review the circumstances of the following classes of immigrants:
*    Permanent Resident Aliens (must be fully processed and possess Permanent
Resident Alien card or stamp in passport verifying final approval by filing
deadline for applicable term)
*  Refugees (1-94 card must designate "Refugee")
*    A, E (primarv'), G and I visa holders *
* Based upon current law, these nonimmigrant visa classifications are the only
ones that permit the visa holder to establish a domicile in the United States. The
University Registrar shall update this list as changes occur in applicable law.

SPECIAL MEETING, AUGUST 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Wednesday, August 6, 1997
A special meeting of the Board of Regents was conducted via conference
telephone call on August 6, 1997, at 11:10 a.m. Present in the Regents'
Room were President Bollinger, Regent McGowan, Secretary Palmer, and
Interim Co-General Counsel Barry. Joining the meeting by telephone were
Regents Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McFee, Power, and Taylor, Executive
Vice President Matthews, and Vice President Harrison. Regent Newman
was unable to participate.
FY 1998 University of Michigan's Health System's Clinical Delivery
System (CDS) Operating Budget
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and said that the issue
before the Board was the approval of the hospital budget. He noted that at
the last meeting it had been decided to postpone this decision until the
administration could consider whether to go ahead with the "M-Care
Preference" proposal. He announced that the administration has decided
not to go forward with M-Care Preference at this time. If it is necessary to
find an additional $2 million in revenues to balance the budget at the end of
the year, these funds would be drawn from the Hospitals' reserves.
M-Care Preference. President Bollinger commented that the original
plan had been to propose the M-Care Preference plan as part of the revenues
in the CDS budget presented at the July Regents' meeting. This proposal
was one of several changes in the compensation program that had been
developed by the health system over the past several years in an attempt to
reduce costs, increase revenues, and generally reorganize the medical center.
He applauded the efforts of Larry Warren, interim executive director of the
Hospitals, in trying to bring the Medical Center into budgetary balance and
said that the University is grateful to him and the health system staff for all
of their efforts.
President Bollinger noted that while most of the proposals regarding
changes in the form of compensation offered to employees applied only to
Hospitals' employees, M-Care preference would have applied to the whole
University. After considering all of the proposals, it was decided to table all
of them except M-Care preference. In May, after meeting with several
campus groups for advice on whether to proceed with the M-Care preference
initiative, administrators believed it was the appropriate thing to do.
However, by the time of the July Regents' Meeting, it became increasingly
evident that perhaps there had been insufficient discussion of the issue.
Therefore, at the July meeting, he suggested that the Regents approve
the budget without M-Care preference included, opening the way for an


51




Special Meeting, August 1997


opportunity to have further discussion about the issue. The Board decided
instead to withhold action on the entire budget until discussions had been
held about M-Care preference, and that is the purpose of the current
meeting. President Bollinger noted that based on the feedback received since
the July meeting, he had concluded that further discussion was needed about
this and the other compensation items mentioned earlier.
President Bollinger cautioned that it should not be concluded that the
University is ungrateful for the efforts that have been made at the Hospitals,
nor does the administration want to convey that it will back down from
economic decisions that it believes are important for the University simply
because there is opposition. He also emphasized that it should not be
concluded that M-Care preference is being eliminated from consideration in
the future. Rather, he is proposing that this issue, along with the other
items, needs to be subjected to further campus discussion. The risks of not
doing so are not only that no new ideas will be elicited, but that there will be
an antagonism towards the Medical Center that, however unjustified, could
arise simply because people felt that there had not been an adequate
presentation of the need for the proposal.
In conclusion, he said he was recommending tabling of the M-Care
preference initiative, and asking for consideration of a Health System budget
that does not include M-Care preference.
Executive Vice President Matthews stated that he concurs with the
president's judgment. He observed that the Health System budget proposal
had gone through a number of iterations. The understanding had been that
there would be an attempt to build M-Care preference into the budget, but
obviously it would not be prudent to do that at this time. He observed that
the system had a "below the line" reserve and was not in dire straits, and
that although it would be appropriate to use the reserve under these
circumstances, in general, using the reserves is not a wise way to run an
enterprise over the long term. He noted that the reserves were built up
because the Hospitals had been prudent and successful in the past, and it
makes sense to take advantage of that. With that understanding, and with
the idea of working closely with the Hospitals in the coming year to go over
some of the broader issues affecting employees, the Hospitals would be able
to continue with its cost containment program.
Regent Maynard stated that she was comfortable with the decision. She
noted the excellent feedback that had been received from members of the
University community and wanted to be sure there would continue to be an
open discussion about these issues facing the Regents.
Regent McFee commented that she appreciated the efforts of the
Medical Center community in trying to address the economic issues facing
the health system. She cautioned that in tabling the issue to allow for
further discussion, it was important that the entire University recognize that
for a number of years the Medical Center had been a very profitable
enterprise, with much of it spilling over to the entire University. Now that
the reverse is the case, she believes the University as a whole should come
together to overcome the challenge facing the Medical Center and recognize
52




Special Meeting, August 1997


that we all have a responsibility to meet it. If, after further discussion, it
appears that the M-Care proposal will be a means to help balance the
Medical Center's budget, she thinks "we all should recognize that we need to
be part of that solution."
Regent Horning expressed agreement with Regent McFee's comments
and moved approval of the FY1998 University of Michigan Health System's
Clinical Delivery System Operating Budget. Regent Power seconded the
motion. Regents Deitch and Taylor also associated themselves with Regent
McFee's comments. The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved
unanimously.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:25 a.m.
Roberta R. Palmer
Secretary of the University

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, September 18, 1997
The Regents convened at 1:45 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Interim Executive Vice
President Matthews, Provost Cantor, Vice President Harrison, Vice President
Hartford, Vice President Kinnear, Acting Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellors
Nelms and Renick, Interim Co-General Counsel Barry, and Secretary Palmer.
Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs
President Bollinger announced that after having conducted an exhaustive
search, the clear choice that emerged to fill the position of executive vice
president for medical affairs was Gilbert S. Omenn, of the University of
Washington, and he reviewed Dr. Omenn's background and qualifications.
Regent McGowan moved approval of the appointment of Gilbert S. Omenn as
executive vice president for medical affairs. Regent Newman seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously. There followed a round of
applause, after which Dr. Omenn joined the Regents and officers at the table
and expressed how pleased he was to accept the appointment.  Regent
McGowan welcomed him and said that the Regents looked forward to
working with him.
Donald R. Shepherd Director of Intercollegiate Athletics
President Bollinger announced his recommendation for the appointment
of Thomas A. Goss as the Donald R. Shepherd Director of Intercollegiate
Athletics, noting that it was Mr. Goss's character and values that were most
important in his selection for this post. On a motion by Regent Newman,
seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents unanimously approved the appointment
of Thomas A. Goss as the Donald R. Shepherd Director of Intercollegiate
Athletics.
Mr. Goss, who was present at the meeting, said that he was very excited
to be at Michigan, and that he shared the same values as President Bollinger
and the Regents. Regent Deitch commented on how lucky the University
was to have been able to attract two such accomplished individuals to fill key
appointments.
University of Michigan Financial Statements for Year-Ended
June 30, 1997
Referring to the separately bound consolidated financial statements,
Executive Vice President Matthews noted that the University had received a
clean opinion from its independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.


55




September Meeting, 1997


University of Michigan Year-End Financial Information for 1996-97
Executive Vice President Matthews called on Mr. Robert Moenart,
controller and director of financial operations, to review the year-end financial
information. Mr. Moenart compared how the various categories of funds,
revenues, expenditures, and endowments have changed over the past ten
years since 1987-88. Since that time, current funds educational and general
revenues have increased from $801 million to $1.472 million. The proportion
derived from state appropriations has decreased from 33 percent to 23
percent, while the portion derived from student fees has risen from 27
percent to 32 percent.
Auxiliary activities revenues have risen from $576 million in 1987-88 to
$1,174 in 1996-97, with the proportion attributed to hospital, medical, and
dental activities rising from about 84 percent to 87 percent. During that
time, total compensation expenditures have decreased from about 60 percent
of the Current Funds expenditures to 56 percent, and the proportion of that
expense attributed to staff benefits has increased. Expenditures for scholarships and fellowships have risen from 7 percent of the total to 10 percent of
the total. Provost Cantor observed that this figure reflects a change in institutional priorities, rather than an increase in demand.
Mr. Moenart noted that total auxiliary activities expenditures have been
generally flat over the past few years, and have been declining in the hospital
and medical area. The endowment and other invested funds have achieved a
10-year compound growth rate of 22.8 percent, after distributions of 5
percent. Investment in plant (including land, land improvements, buildings,
and equipment) has increased from $1.787 billion to $3.606 billion in the
past ten years.
Regent Power observed that corporate entities typically have a capital
budget separate from the operating budget, and he raised the question as to
whether this would be beneficial for the University to do as well. Executive
Vice President Matthews replied that the University does have a campus
plan, but that because of funding uncertainties, implementation of the plan
cannot always be done as intended. Regent Power reiterated that it may be
beneficial for the University to have a separate capital budget and requested
that some thought be given to this idea.
In response to a question from Regent Maynard about whether athletic
department revenues are ever funneled into the academic side of the institution, it was noted that all athletic department revenues stay within the
department and are used to fund it, although some of these funds are used to
support academic programs within the department. Vice President Harrison
pointed out that there is a "fire wall" between the athletic department and
the rest of the University such that funds are not exchanged between the two.
In conclusion, Mr. Moenart stated that the University's debt service as a
percentage of the operating expenditures has decreased, it is solvent, and is
in excellent shape financially.


56




September Meeting, 1997


On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved adoption of the financial report.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted minutes of the July 17-18, 1997,
meeting and of the August 6, 1997, special meeting.
Reports. Executive Vice President Matthews submitted reports of
Investments, Plant Extension, Litigation, and Human Resources and
Affirmative Action. He called the Regents' attention to a change involving
the investment manager Qualivest, as described in the monthly investment
report.
Vice President Neidhardt submitted a Report of Projects Established for
the months of July and August 1997. He announced the resignation of Mr.
Robert Robb as director of the Technology Management Office, effective in
mid-October. He also requested feedback from the Regents as to possible
topics for special reports during the coming year. Regent Power expressed a
desire to hear a report on the campus environment for technology transfer.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear submitted three reports:
a year-end report for fiscal year 1996-97 and reports of gifts received for the
months of July and August, 1997. He noted that the 1996-97 total of almost
$154 million exceeded the previous year's gift total by $35 million.

Retirement Memoirs. Provost Cantor submitted retirement memoirs
for 10 faculty members.
Joseph B. Adelson, professor of psychology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active status on May 31, 1997, following
more than 40 years of service.
Professor Adelson received his B.S. degree (1945) from the City College
of New York and his M.A. (1947) and Ph.D. (1950) degrees from the University
of California at Berkeley. He taught at Michigan State University (1950-51)
and Bennington College (1951-56) before joining the University of Michigan
faculty in 1956 as a visiting assistant professor of psychology. He was
promoted to assistant professor in 1957, associate professor in 1959, and
professor in 1963. He also held an appointment as senior psychologist at the
Psychological Clinic from 1956-87 and served as the director of this internship
training agency.
Throughout his career, Professor Adelson has focused on two areas:
adolescence and the psychological aspects of social and political issues. His
work has had a lasting influence, both within the social sciences and the
intellectual community as a whole. Many of his papers are classics: reframings
of key issues that have been supported and sustained by subsequent
research. Literally dozens of his papers have been reprinted in readers, in
some instances more than a dozen times. His book, Inventing Adolescence,
was named among the "Best Books of 1986" by the Chronicles of American
Culture, and it continues to be widely cited and respected, as does his earlier
book (with Elizabeth Douvan), The Adolescent Experience. Another of
Professor Adelson's notable and ongoing contributions has been as a book
reviewer of books for both professional and general audiences. His reviews
are a delight to read, not only informing readers but also teaching them.
Professor Adelson has held numerous research fellowships, has been the
recipient of many research and teaching awards, and has been a frequent
consultant to government organizations and foundations. He was the founding
editor of the journal Political Psychology and has been a consulting editor for
a number of major psychology journals, including the Merrill-Palmer
Quarterly, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Youth
and Adolescence, and Contemporary Psychology. He will long be remembered
by his colleagues and students for his broad intellect, his rich interest in the
arts and humanities, his tough-mindedness, his sense of humor, and his
graceful and elegant prose style.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Joseph B.
Adelson professor emeritus of psychology.
Robert T. Blackburn, professor of higher education, School of Education,
retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1997, following 31 years of
service.
Professor Blackburn received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees, in 1947,
1948, and 1953, respectively, from the University of Chicago. Following military

September Meeting, 1997


service (1943-46), he was an assistant professor at Chico State College (1948-49);
director and assistant professor at George Williams College (1949-51);
research associate and instructor at the University of Chicago (1951-54);
assistant and associate professor at San Francisco State College (1954-58);
and member of the faculty, college examiner, and dean of faculty at Shimer
College (1958-66). He joined the University of Michigan School of Education
in 1966 as professor of higher education.
During his years in the School of Education and the Center for the
Study of Higher and Postsecondary Education, Professor Blackburn taught a
wide array of graduate courses and collaborated extensively with students,

the course work for her Ph.D. degree in information transfer at Syracuse
University.
Ms. Wulff joined the University of Michigan in January 1978 as head of
the Medical Center Library. She had a comprehensive understanding of how
excellent medical libraries should be run and a strong devotion to providing

of the services and collections of the Medical Library, but also eventually
assumed responsibility for the other health sciences libraries, in public health
and dentistry.
In August 1987, Ms. Wulff was named assistant director for collection
management for the University Library. For six years, she led the transition
from collection development responsibility resting in a single individual to
the responsibility resting broadly with those who serve on the Collection
Management and Development Council (CMDC). Under her leadership,
CMDC became a vital advisory group for the Library's administration. In
1993, Ms. Wulff became the library's first program director for international
initiatives. Her work focused on building connections with the International
Institute and other international efforts on campus and on bringing more
Fulbright scholars to the library than at any time in the past.
Ms. Wulff is a critical thinker whose thoughtful comments and questions
often changed the course of discussion. She was committed to the well-being
of the library and made important contributions as the library moved into

Room, for the purposes of consulting with our attorney regarding trial
or settlement strategy in connection with specific pending litigation
(section 8e) and of considering material exempt from discussion or
disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (section 8h).
Such exempt material consists of a written opinion from the Board's
legal counsel.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Friday, October 17, 1997
The Regents convened at 9:45 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Interim Executive Vice
President Matthews, Provost Cantor, Vice President Harrison, Vice President
Hartford, Vice President Kinnear, Interim Vice President Neidhardt,
Chancellor Nelms, Chancellor Renick, Interim Co-General Counsel Barry,
and Secretary Palmer. Executive Vice President Omenn was absent.
External Audit Report
Executive Vice President Matthews noted that Ernst & Young LLP had
conducted the annual University audits for the year ended June 30, 1997,
and had issued a management letter. He called on Mr. Carl Smith, director
of University Audits, who introduced Mr. Robert Emde, of Ernst & Young.
Mr. Emde introduced his colleagues who helped conduct the audit: Mr.
George Johnson, Mr. Harold Miller, and Mr. Steve Staelin. He noted that
Mr. Staelin would succeed him in the role of coordinating partner responsible
for the firm's audit of the University's financial statements, beginning with
the 1997-98 audit.
Mr. Emde stated that the audit completed on August 8, 1997, expresses an
unqualified opinion on the University's financial statements. The accounting
principles and the magnitude and extent of year-end closing entries were
consistent with prior years, and there were no unadjusted differences that
would have had a material effect on the respective funds comprising the
financial statements for 1997. Audits were also conducted and reported on
the separate financial statements for the Clinical Delivery System, Dental
Faculty Associates, the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, the
Executive Education Center of the School of Business Administration,
M-Care, Veritas, the Alumni Association, the William Davidson Institute, and
the University Musical Society. Reports on each of these financial statements
are also unqualified.
Mr. Emde noted that the management letter states that a review of the
internal control structure disclosed no material weaknesses in procedures
and controls. He pointed out that the recommendations set forth in the
management letter are intended as constructive suggestions to further
strengthen the University's procedures and controls. In each instance, the
University has concurred with the recommendation, and Ernst & Young
believes the University's responses are appropriate. He also noted that
appropriate actions have been taken with respect to each recommendation in
the 1996 management letter.


107




October Meeting, 1997


Regent McFee commented that she was particularly pleased to note that
the University is especially careful in its oversight of reports from its custodian
bank in connection with its alternative investments.
Regent Power said that he hopes that the question of whether the
University should generate a capital budget will be addressed in the near
future, both in terms of internal practice and in terms of recommendations
from independent auditors. He noted that although capital budgets had not
been drawn up in the past, the University's cash flow and capacity to issue
paper have reached the point at which it can internally control capital activities
to a far greater extent than was possible previously. He expressed the hope
that Ernst & Young would be helpful to the new executive vice president and
chief financial officer and other staff in addressing this issue.
Regent Taylor requested that the Regents receive regular progress
reports and a schedule describing how the University is addressing the "Year
2000 Problem." Mr. Matthews responded that this can certainly be done.
He noted that this is not only a problem for the University's own internal
systems, but also for its vendors and others who deal with the University.
Regent Taylor also requested to see the letter that had been sent to the
University's vendors and suppliers requesting information about how they
were dealing with this problem, as well as the list of the letter's recipients.
Regent Power indicated that the Board does not have an audit committee,
and therefore he would encourage the auditors to discuss any matters of
concern with any member of the Board. Mr. Emde responded that there was
nothing at this time that needed to be discussed with the Board, other than
in public session.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted the minutes of the September
1997 meeting.
Reports. Executive Vice President Matthews submitted Reports of
Investment, Plant Extension, Litigation, Human Resources and Affirmative
Action, and Non-Competitive Purchases over $5,000 from Single Sources from
July 1 through September 30, 1997. He noted that the August investment
performance highlights how a diversified portfolio benefits the institution.
He called on Associate Vice President Herbert, who gave a report highlighting
the August performance of investments. Mr. Herbert pointed out that
despite the world-wide weakness in financial markets, the University's Long
Term Portfolio had performed well, with all of its stock and bond managers
outperforming their respective benchmarks and adding value to their
portfolios.
Regarding the Plant Extension Report, Regent Newman asked that
future reports also include the names of the architect under the "architect
appointed" section of the report.


108




October Meeting, 1997


Vice President Neidhardt submitted a report on projects established for
September 1997.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear submitted a report of
voluntary support. Regent Newman asked whether the University would be
responding to a challenge made by Ira Harris at the recent Campaign for
Michigan celebration to increase the campaign goal to $2 billion by the year
2000. Mr. Harris had offered to make an additional gift of $2 million to
begin a new drive. Vice President Kinnear noted that the $2 billion figure
will probably be approached in the general course of donor solicitation, but
whether or not the University is still involved in an official fundraising
campaign is a different issue.
President Bollinger noted that while the University is very appreciative
of Mr. Harris' support of the institution, the general issue of whether to
pursue a capital campaign raises complex institutional issues that need to be
carefully considered. It is best to consider the recent Campaign for Michigan
as completed. However, Mr. Harris' generosity is greatly appreciated.

October Meeting, 1997


Richard F. de Leon, associate dean for clinical sciences and associate
professor of pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, and director of pharmacy
services, University of Michigan Health Systems, retired from active faculty
status on September 30, 1997.
Professor de Leon received an A.A. degree from the City College of San
Francisco in 1961 and a Pharm.D. degree from the University of California
at San Francisco in 1965. He holds pharmacy licenses in both California and
Michigan. He began his career as an intern pharmacist at the University of
California-San Francisco Department of Pharmaceutical Services in 1961.
By 1978, he had risen through the ranks to positions as director of central
services and assistant dean for pharmaceutical services.
In 1979, Professor de Leon came to the University of Michigan as associate
dean for clinical sciences and associate professor, College of Pharmacy, and
as director of pharmacy services, University of Michigan Hospitals. His
responsibilities included managing the operations of the Department of
Pharmacy Services and overseeing the clinical sciences program, including
the experiential training program at the college. He also assumed responsibility
for directing the college's continuing education program in 1993.
He has served on numerous local and national committees and has
presented a number of invited seminars at national and international
meetings. He has provided consultative services to many outside organizations
and has served as an accreditation reviewer for the American Society of
Health System Pharmacists and for the American Council on Pharmaceutical
Education.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator and administrator for his dedicated service by naming Richard F. de Leon associate professor
emeritus of pharmacy.
Donald F. Huelke, professor of anatomy in the Medical School and
research scientist at the University of Michigan Transportation Research
Institute, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1997.
Professor Huelke received his B.S. (1952) and M.S. (1954) degrees from
the University of Illinois and his Ph.D. (1957) degree in anatomy from the
University of Michigan. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1957
as an instructor in the Department of Anatomy. He was promoted to assistant
professor in 1960, associate professor in 1963, and professor in 1968. In
1983, he was appointed research scientist at the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI).
Professor Huelke's discipline is human gross anatomy. Very early in his
career, he became interested in applied biomechanics as it relates to motor
vehicle design and injuries from automobile accidents. His research resulted
in his being appointed to the Ad Hoc Faculty Program Advisory Committee
for the Highway Safety Research Institute in 1965. He served on the institute's
executive committee from 1967-86 and as interim director of the UMTRI
Biosciences Division in 1985 and 1986. During the 1960s, he conducted some
very influential studies on the causes of fatal injuries in automobile accidents
which had a significant impact on seat belt design and legislation. His
research on automobile safety has since expanded to include airbags.


127




October Meeting, 1997


In addition to his laboratory and field research, Professor Huelke taught
gross anatomy to medical and dental students. He also completed a three-part
history of the Department of Anatomy, which has proven to be a very valuable
piece of scholarly research and a major historical resource.
In 1980, Professor Huelke received the Ralph H. Isbrandt Automotive
Safety Engineering Award from the Society of Automotive Engineers. He
has also been honored as a fellow of the SAE and of the American Academy
of Forensic Sciences. He is a past president of the Association for the
Advancement of Automotive Medicine and has served for 20 years on the
Stapp Car Crash Conference Advisory Committee.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his
dedicated service by naming Donald F. Huelke professor emeritus of
anatomy and research scientist emeritus.

Born in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dr. Row received his B.S. and D.D.S.
degrees in 1955 and his M.S.D. degree in 1958 from the University of Minnesota.
He joined the University of Michigan faculty as professor of dentistry in 1968
and was appointed associate professor of pathology in the Medical School in
1969. He also served as associate director of the Dental Research Institute in
the School of Dentistry from 1970-89. He was named a fellow of the American
Academy of Oral Pathology in 1959 and diplomate of the American Board of
Oral Pathology in 1964.
Dr. Rowe has distinguished himself nationally and internationally as a
dental scholar, researcher, and teacher. He has served as a consultant to
many governmental and professional organizations and has published more
than 60 journal articles and 10 textbook chapters.
Dr. Rowe served on the University's Senate Assembly from 1975-78 and
from 1978-81 and on the School of Dentistry Executive Committee from

naming Nathaniel H. Rowe, Jr., professor emeritus of dentistry, William R.
Mann Professor Emeritus of Dentistry and professor emeritus of oral
pathology.

October Meeting, 1997


Gilbert R. Whitaker, Jr., provost and executive vice president emeritus
for academic affairs, dean emeritus, and professor of business economics in
the School of Business Administration, retired from active faculty status on
August 31, 1997.
Professor Whitaker received his B.A. degree from Rice University in
1953 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Wisconsin in
1958 and 1961, respectively. He served on the faculty at Northwestern
University (1960-66), Washington University (1967-76, including service as
associate dean from 1969-76), and Texas Christian University (professor and
dean from 1976-78) before joining the University of Michigan School of
Business Administration as dean and professor of business economics in
1979. He served with distinction as professor and dean until 1990, when he
was appointed provost and vice president for academic affairs.
Professor Whitaker's dedication to the excellence of students and
programs at the business school was the foundation for the growth and
success the school now enjoys. He laid the groundwork for the school's
prominence and readiness to maintain a leadership position into the twentyfirst century.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Gilbert R.
Whitaker, Jr., professor emeritus of business economics.

October Meeting, 1997


3.   Professor Mourou's pecuniary interest arises from his position as partial
owner of Medox Electro Optics, Inc.
Proposed Subcontracts between the University of Michigan and
Michigan Critical Care Consultants, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Power, the
Regents unanimously approved two subcontracts funded through Small
Business Innovative Research Program (SBIR) Phase II and Phase I grants
to Michigan Critical Care Consultants, Inc. Because Robert H. Battel is both
an owner of Michigan Critical Care Consultants, Inc. and a University of
Michigan employee, these subcontracts fall under the State of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance
with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreements will be Michigan Critical Care Consultants, Inc.
("Company") and the Regents of the University of Michigan.
2.   The proposed agreements are standard University research contracts. There

The SBIR Phase I subcontracts are for $15,000 each to cover related costs in
Dr. Bartlett's and Dr. Meyerhoffs laboratories.
3.   Dr. Bartlett's pecuniary interest in the agreement arises from the fact that
he is a co-owner, consultant, and member of the board of directors of the
Company, all without compensation, and owns 33 percent of the Company.
Research    Agreement between        the   University   of Michigan      and
Thromgen, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved a research agreement between the University
of Michigan and Thromgen, Inc. ("Thromgen"), involving an SBIR Phase II
grant to Thromgen. Because Alvin H. Schmaier, M.D., is both a University
employee and an officer and stockholder in Thromgen, and Ahmed A.K.
Hasan is an employee of Thromgen with an unfunded appointment at the
University, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Thromgen, Inc.
2.   The terms of the agreement conform to University policy. The period of
performance is eight months, at a total cost of $136,048, which amount
includes full recovery of indirect costs at the appropriate rate.

pecuniary interest arises out of his ownership of 20% of Thromgen's stock.
Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and PORT
Systems, LLC
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved a research agreement between the University


131




October Meeting, 1997


of Michigan and PORT Systems, LLC ("PORT"). PORT is partially owned
by TSRL, Inc. ("TSRL"). Because certain University of Michigan employees
are also employees of TSRL or PORT or have an interest in or serve in other
capacities in TSRL or PORT, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. Specifically, Gordon Amidon is a University
employee who is also president of TSRL, chair of the boards of directors of
TSRL and PORT, and a stockholder in both TSRL and PORT; John Crison,
Elke Lipka, and Jae Seung Kim are TSRL and PORT employees with unpaid
appointments at the University of Michigan. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the Agreements are the University of Michigan and PORT
Systems, LLC.
2.  The terms of the research contract conform to University policy. The period
of performance is eight months at a total cost of $167,323, which amount
includes full recovery of indirect costs at the appropriate rate.
3.  Gordon Amidon's pecuniary interest arises out of his status as a stockholder
in TSRL and PORT. Neither John Crison, Elke Lipka, nor Jae Seung Kim
has any connection with the project on behalf of the University.
Nichols Arboretum Urban Environmental Education Center
Executive Vice President Matthews announced that a naming gift from
James D. and Helene C. Reader has made it possible for the University to
move and renovate the Burnham House, currently located at 940 Maiden
Lane, to its new location at the Washington Heights entrance of Nichols
Arboretum. The James D. Reader Urban Environmental Education Center
will be housed within the Burnham House at its new location.
Regent Power moved approval of the naming of the James D. Reader, Jr.
Urban Environmental Education Center, to be located in the Burnham
House. Regent Newman seconded the motion.
Regent McGowan observed that the purchase and purpose for the
Burnham House have been long-standing issues, and she was pleased that
the use of the house as an environmental education center has now been
made possible by the generous gift from the Readers. She observed that the
Burnham House is historically significant for the City of Ann Arbor, and
expressed appreciation on the part of the Board to the Readers.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Nichols Arboretum Burnham House Project
Executive Vice President Matthews commented that since the original
approval of the project to create an urban environmental education center at
the entrance to the Arboretum by relocating the existing Burnham House,
construction bids had been solicited and the original project budget will have
to be revised.


132




October Meeting, 1997


Regent Newman moved approval of the revised budget of $537,000, as
outlined in the Regents Communication, and authorization to proceed with
additional interior work as funds are identified. Regent Maynard seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Affirmative Action Lawsuit
President Bollinger announced that a lawsuit has been filed against the
University of Michigan Ann Arbor Campus claiming that its admissions
policy is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. He observed that "what is being attacked here is a long-standing policy
of the University of Michigan, which is deeply rooted in the history, traditions,
and identity of the University."
He noted that the University's diversity policy is similar to that of every
major institution of higher education in the country, and that this lawsuit is
part of a nation-wide effort by some groups to try to change those policies.
President Bollinger commented that "we view this with the gravest possible
concern." He noted the recent success of this movement in the Fifth Circuit
with respect to the Hopwood litigation involving the University of Texas, and
the success of the movement within the state of California in the form of a
referendum. He said the resulting situations represent clear proof of what
the University will face if the suit against it is successful.
President Bollinger said that the University has hired the law firm of
Wilmer, Cutler, & Pickering from Washington, D.C. as its counsel, and that
it is in the process of creating an answer to the complaint. He said that he
and Provost Cantor have been talking about how to facilitate the campus
discussion about these issues during the coming months. Announcements will
be forthcoming in the next few weeks about beginning efforts to address
these issues in various formats and platforms. The intent is to approach it
not only as a litigation issue, but also from the perspective of an educational
institution that must come to terms with these issues as an educational issue
as well.
President Bollinger concluded that "this will be a very difficult time for the
University of Michigan" and "it will be a test of our character as an institution
as to how we deal with it." He said "we must be open to discussion about this,"
while at the same time recognizing that historically, the institution has made
sure it has been open to all parts of American society, offering an experience
to students that is "as rich and diverse as we possibly can make it."
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Tom Stroup, alumnus, about the
termination of Michigan men's basketball coach, Steve Fisher.
There followed a five-minute break, at 10:55 a.m., after which the
Regents reconvened.


133




October Meeting, 1997


Executive Session Motion
Regent Power made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended
by 1984 PA 202 and 1996 PA 464, I move that the Board of Regents
meet in closed session on October 17, 1997, for the purpose of
considering material exempt from discussion or disclosure by the
Michigan Freedom of Information Act. Such exempt material
consists of a written opinion from the Board's legal counsel.
Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the public meeting was adjourned, and the
meeting continued in executive session until 11:45 a.m. Regents' expenses for
the month of September 1997 totaled $193.91. The next meeting is scheduled for
November 20-21, 1997.
Roberta R. Palmer
Secretary of the University

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, November 20, 1997
The Regents convened at 1:40 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Homing, Maynard, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Interim Executive Vice President Matthews, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Executive Vice President
Omenn, Provost and Executive Vice President Cantor, Vice President Harrison,
Vice President Hartford, Interim Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellor Renick,
Interim Co-General Counsel Barry, and Secretary Palmer. Regent Deitch and
Chancellor Nelms were absent; Vice Chancellor Dorothy Russell attended in the
stead of Chancellor Nelms. Vice President Kinnear arrived at 2:15 p.m.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and welcomed Robert
Kasdin to the table as executive vice president and chief financial officer.
President Bollinger thanked Chandler Matthews for his service as interim
executive vice president and chief financial officer and presented him a gift
on behalf of the Regents and executive officers.
Mr. Matthews thanked everyone for the gift and said that it had been a
pleasure to return and serve the University. He expressed thanks to his staff
and wished Mr. Kasdin well in his new position.
Resolution in Honor of Chandler W. Matthews
Regent Power observed that Mr. Matthews has been "the most responsive
and reliable person imaginable in the financial side of the University." He noted
that Chandler also served the community through his position as senior warden
of St. Andrews Episcopal Church. Regent Power offered the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
In recognition of his more than twenty-five years of distinguished
service to the University of Michigan, most recently as interim executive
vice president and chief financial officer, the Regents commend and
express deep gratitude to a trusted adviser and friend, Chandler W.
Matthews.
Mr. Matthews, who retired from the University in 1995, graciously
agreed to return in January 1997 to serve as interim executive vice
president and chief financial officer. Drawing on his great love of the
University, understanding of people, and breadth of experience as
associate vice president for finance from 1989-95 and as controller from
1970-89, Mr. Matthews has brought a quiet strength and continuity of
leadership to the University during a time of transition. He has wisely
and skillfully overseen the University's financial affairs, as well as its
business operations, physical plant, human resources, and safety and


135




November Meeting, 1997


security organizations. His strong sense of integrity and commitment to
ethical business practices have set the tone for those units under his
direction. Under his interim leadership, the University's endowment
grew to $2 billion and, for the first time, the University issued commercial paper, an inexpensive and advantageous way for it to borrow
money for the short term.
With heartfelt appreciation for his loyalty, his numerous contributions to the University, and particularly, for his willingness to temporarily postpone his personal plans, the Regents express their gratitude
and offer best wishes to Chandler W. Matthews for a long, healthy, and
fulfilling retirement.
There followed a standing ovation.
General Remarks: President Bollinger
President Bollinger recognized the achievements of a number of faculty
members who had won national early career awards in science, engineering, and
medicine. He also noted that Dean Edward Gramlich had been appointed to the
Federal Reserve Board and former Provost J. Bernard Machen had been named
president of the University of Utah. Finally, he noted that Brian Griese, a
student athlete, had been selected as a National Football Foundation ScholarAthlete.
President Bollinger noted that the reason for Chancellor Nelms absence
was that he had been in an automobile accident on the way to the meeting.
Provost Cantor: Budget Strategies
Provost Cantor observed that the purpose of budgets is to support the
academic commitments of faculty and students. She noted that budgets affect
three domains: the local academic neighborhood; the collaborative academic
neighborhood; and the University as a whole, and discussed how the current
budgeting system, Value Centered Management (VCM), impacts each of these
domains.
She noted that VCM works well at the local level, providing incentives to
reduce costs and enhance revenue.    However, in the collaborative and
University-as-a-whole domains, VCM is more problematic, and it is in these
areas that she is proposing changes in the budgeting system. These changes
include first, changing the name from "Value Centered Management" to simply
our "budget model," to denote the University's system of resource allocation.
Provost Cantor noted that the University has to ensure that activities and
units that are not easily self-supporting are attended to, and it also has to be
attentive to the question of collaborative teaching and research activities. With
VCM, she pointed out, the incentives are at the local level, making it more difficult to accomplish collaborative activities. Likewise, because tuition follows
student enrollment, there are no incentives to teach students in a school other
than the one they are enrolled in. There also needs to be a means of support for
"public goods," such as museums, libraries, auditoriums, recreational sports,


136




November Meeting, 1997


etc., that help to support the University's overall reputation. The support of
public goods can be addressed by using resources at the provost's disposal to
ensure that public goods are supported, and by rewarding local units that
contribute to the public goods of the University as a whole and penalizing units
that are excessively inward looking with respect to the resources that they
control. Lastly, moving to a multi-year budgeting system for the provost's
allocation will allow both the administration and the units to determine what is
and is not self-supporting and to target activities that are priorities for support.
Provost Cantor observed that a current focus of discussion is cost attributions for central service resources and units. In the current model, cost attributions for central services are allocated according to 24 complicated formulas.
Thus the attention is being paid not to the missions of these central units and
how they should be tailored, but rather attention is being paid to whether the
other units are getting their own money's worth from the central units. The
issue of cost attributions for central services should be tackled not by focusing on
individual levels of subsidization, but rather by analyzing the unit as a whole to
see whether the University is getting what it needs from that unit (whether it is
rightly budgeted).  Therefore, Provost Cantor said she will take back the
revenues and cost attributions for these central service units to create the right
budgets for them and to evaluate their missions. She noted that these reviews
will be conducted in conjunction with the Advisory Committee on University
Budgets and described the process that will be used. Following these reviews, it
is expected that significant savings will be realized. These savings will be reallocated to the kinds of collaborative, public goods, non-self-supporting but valued
activities that are critical to the institution. She pointed out that the incentives
rest clearly with the administration to realize savings, as the only alternative, to
raise taxes on the schools and colleges, would be unacceptable.
FY99 State Budget Request - Ann Arbor Campus
Provost Cantor noted that the final aspect to the University's budgeting
process is the critical contribution of state support. She said that the University
is very grateful for the recent increases in state support that have exceeded inflation, as these have been important in limiting tuition increases. She also
expressed appreciation for recent actions on the capital outlay bill, which will
lead to renovations of some of the older central campus buildings.
The Ann Arbor campus is requesting an increase of 4 percent ($12.6
million) in its base appropriations from the state. In addition to this basic
increase, the state is being asked to join in a partnership with the University
to fund two specific initiatives: $1.5 million for expansion of Undergraduate
Learning Communities, and $3 million for a Life Sciences Initiative. The former
will create opportunities for smaller community experiences within the larger
university, and the latter will promote more activity in emerging interdisciplinary areas of life sciences education and research.
In response to a question from Regent Newman, Provost Cantor noted
that the main change proposed for the budget model is to centralize the
budget for central service units. Currently, cost attributions for these units


137




November Meeting, 1997


are distributed among the schools and colleges. In the proposed budget
model, an amount equivalent to the funds that schools would have used to
pay for the cost attributions will come back to the provost for review and
reallocation of these expenditures. This would presumably result in savings
that can be used to support collaborative and public goods activities and to
continue to keep tuition increases to a minimum.
Regent Power observed that any budgeting system that places what
appears to be arbitrary power in the hands of a provost offers risk. Provost
Cantor responded that she believes the proposed budgeting system places less
arbitrary power in the hands of the provost because of the incentives it provides
for holding down costs. It also provides incentives for interdisciplinary collaboration. Regent Power expressed the desire to revisit this topic periodically.
Regent Maynard commented that she was pleased that the administration
is paying particular attention to the effect of the budgeting system on interdisciplinary collaboration. Regent McFee agreed and also commended the
provost and her team for recognizing that no budget system is perfect and
for being willing to make changes in the system as experience dictates.
1998-99 State Budget Request - University of Michigan-Flint
Vice Chancellor Russell reported that UM-Flint is requesting an
increase of $2.5 million. This includes $800,000 as an inflationary increase
for basic operation of the campus and $1.0 million to support three initiatives
designed to enhance the economic revitalization of the Flint area. These
initiatives include Urban Education Initiatives, the Center for Applied
Environmental Research and Outreach, and the development of the former
AutoWorld site. The remainder of the requested appropriations increase
includes $300,000 to support new graduate program development and $400,000
for ongoing information technology needs.
1998-99 State Budget Request - University of Michigan-Dearborn
Chancellor Renick reported that the requested state budget increase for
the Dearborn campus of $3,576,000 includes an inflationary increase of
$1,627,000 to maintain quality educational programming; $1,250,000 for
technology enhancement; and $699,000 for faculty to support program growth.
Report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs
(SACUA)
President Bollinger called on Professor Louis G. D'Alecy, chair of
SACUA. Professor D'Alecy noted that there is a spirit of cooperation and
collaboration amongst the faculty, staff, and administration. He reported on
three collaborative faculty/administration efforts: the "Principles of Governance" document outlining the principles of faculty participation in governance;
the "Model Grievance" document, which is a revision of internal University
procedures for hearing faculty grievances; and the Faculty Handbook
Project, whose goal is to revise the current faculty handbook.


138




November Meeting, 1997


Regent McGowan inquired whether the issue of divestment from tobacco
stocks has been under consideration by the administration. President Bollinger
said that this issue is being addressed. Executive Vice President Kasdin
observed that the issue is more than a financial one; it raises the more basic
question of which activities are so inherently abhorrent that the University
should disassociate from them. He stated that in the coming months, he
intends to consult more broadly within the University community to develop
coherent and principled ways to draw these distinctions.
Regent Newman said that she is unclear what is involved in the review
of the Regents' Bylaws. General Counsel Barry responded that the intent of
the current process is to bring the Bylaws up to date and clarify them.
Regent Newman noted that any proposed changes in the Bylaws need to be
subjected to public discussion prior to voting on them. Regent McGowan
agreed, noting that the purpose of the Bylaws review needs to be clarified.
Regent Power reiterated that the purpose of the review is to clean up inconsistencies in the Bylaws, not to add new ones or to change the way the
University operates. He also noted that it might be advisable to consider
making the Bylaws conform to the modern understanding of the purpose and
structure of bylaws. Regent McFee suggested the Bylaws revision as a topic
of discussion for the January meeting.
Regent Taylor noted that it might be useful to first clean up the current
Bylaws and then address the larger issues raised by Regent Power. General
Counsel Barry agreed that this would be a good approach.
Michigan Student Assembly Report
Mr. Michael Nagrant, president of the Michigan Student Assembly
(MSA), began by stating that contrary to media reports, MSA had not
endorsed rushing of the field by students following the upcoming football
game against Ohio State University.
Mr. Nagrant reviewed the goals he had set out at his first meeting with
the Regents. These included a request that tuition increases be limited to
the rate of inflation, consideration of the need for a student Regent, and an
MSA fee increase. He thanked the Board for limiting the tuition increase for
1997-98 and for approving the MSA fee increase. He noted that since he had
assumed the MSA presidency, MSA had returned almost $13,000 to student
groups through internal cost savings, had organized a campus-wide affirmative
action issues forum, had helped to organize the environmental theme semester,
had funded over $60,000 in community service initiatives for the first time,
and was set to begin operating a nonprofit course-pack store.
Mr. Nagrant said that MSA is proposing three new initiatives: extending
hours in the graduate and law libraries; establishing a break in the fall
semester; and establishing an endowed speaker series.
Following Mr. Nagrant's presentation, President Bollinger and the Regents
expressed support for the notion of extending the library hours and for
establishing better access for students to the rich array of speakers that is


139




November Meeting, 1997


already available on campus. Regent Newman observed that one of the
founders of C-SPAN, John Evans, is a major donor and suggested that he be
approached with the idea of establishing a television network that would
broadcast lectures and speeches made on campus.
Student Housing Issues
Regent Newman said that for some time, she had been requesting a
thorough review of the housing situation on campus and all of the issues that
encompasses, such as the size of the freshman class, privatization of
residence halls and services, and possible new residence hall construction.
She noted that it had been announced recently that there would be a lottery
next year for residence hall slots for junior and senior students.  She
observed that it is important for students to live in environments conducive
to academics, and that with the current overcrowded situation in the
residence halls, there is no room to accommodate proposed living-learning
communities.
There followed a discussion about the current utilization of the
residence halls. It was noted that for next year, there is a proposal to have
juniors and senior who want to live in residence halls be assigned to the
"nontraditional" halls, leaving the "traditional" residence halls for first and
second year students.
Regent Taylor observed that it would be helpful to survey students to
determine what percentage would like to live in residence halls if they had
the option. Regent Maynard pointed out that the desire to live in residence
halls is cyclical. There have been times in the past when residence halls were
not filled to capacity because students did not want to live there. Vice President Hartford stated that she would be prepared at the next meeting to
report on the residence hall situation for next year.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Power made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202 and 1996 PA 464, I move that the Board of Regents meet
in closed session on November 20, 1997, in the Regents' Room, for the
purpose of consulting with our attorney regarding trial or settlement
strategy in connection with specific pending litigation.
Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then recessed at 3:30 p.m. and resumed shortly thereafter in
executive session.
Friday, November 21, 1997
The Regents convened at 9:45 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Deitch, Homing, Maynard, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Interim Executive


140




November Meeting, 1997


Vice President Matthews, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Provost and
Executive Vice President Cantor, Vice President Harrison, Vice President
Hartford, Vice President Kinnear, Interim Vice President Neidhardt,
Chancellor Renick, Interim Co-General Counsel Barry, and Secretary Palmer.
Chancellor Nelms was absent; Vice Chancellor Dorothy Russell attended in
his stead. Executive Vice President Omenn arrived shortly after the start of
the meeting.
Michigan Stadium Expansion
President Bollinger called on Mr. Tom Goss, director of intercollegiate
athletics, to present a proposal for expansion of the Michigan Stadium. Mr.
Goss noted that due to the fact that nearly 3,000 freshmen students were
unable to obtain season football tickets, and that there is a 98.5 percent
renewal rate for season ticket holders with a long waiting list of potential
season ticket buyers, it is important that the stadium capacity situation be
addressed before the 1998 season. He also pointed out that the University's
schedule of prominent opponents nearly guarantees that each season will
continue to be a sellout, even with the proposed addition of approximately
5,000 seats.
Mr. Goss noted that pending approval by the Regents, plans are to have
the addition completed by the start of the 1998 season. During construction,
commencement will still be able to occur in the stadium in the spring.
Regent McGowan noted that she had expressed concerns about the issue
of holding commencement in the stadium during construction, and about
how the project would be paid for if attendance projections did not
materialize. Executive Vice President Matthews had responded to her concerns
in a letter, and Regent McGowan requested that this response be incorporated
in the minutes of this meeting. The text of that letter can be found in the
Appendix.
Regent Horning stated that although he supports the expansion
proposal, at some point the season ticket situation should be addressed. He
noted that there are corporate entities and individuals who hold large blocks
of season tickets, and this raises the more general question of access to
season tickets. Mr. Goss responded that a task force has been formed to
examine the question of season ticket distribution. His goal is to have this
project completed before season ticket applications for the 1998 season are
mailed in May 1998.
Regent Newman asked whether there are plans to address the press box
situation. Mr. Goss responded that this would be addressed at some point,
but that the timing will be a matter of priorities and financing. Regent
Power requested that in the event that sky boxes ever become a consideration,
the issue should be brought to the Board for discussion.
Regent Horning moved approval of proceeding with the design and
construction of a project to increase the seating capacity of the stadium, as


141




November Meeting, 1997


described in the Regents Communication. Regent Newman seconded the
motion.
President Bollinger called on Mr. Fred Mayer, who presented the
proposed design. Mr. Mayer displayed historical photographs and reviewed
the history of the stadium, noting that seating capacity had been increased
three times since the structure's initial completion in 1927. Using diagrams
of the current stadium configuration, he indicated where the proposed
additional rows of seating, which would increase the capacity by about 5,000
seats, would be located.
Mr. Mayer noted that the firm of Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates,
Inc., had been retained to advise the University on planning and design
issues, and that the firm had been consulted on the design of the proposed
stadium addition. He displayed sketches of the firm's concept for the
addition. The firm's approach is to enliven the stadium and provide an
atmosphere that expresses the vitality and excitement that occurs during
athletic events, which it believes is particularly appropriate for an entertainment venue such as the stadium.
Following the presentation, the Regents expressed enthusiasm for the
design. President Bollinger distributed a memorandum from Venturi, Scott
Brown and Associates describing their design concept. Mr. Goss stated that
if the design is approved, plans are to have a groundbreaking ceremony at
the stadium before the football game the next day. The vote was then taken,
and the motion was approved unanimously.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted minutes of the October 17, 1997,
meeting.
Reports. Interim Executive Vice President Matthews submitted the
following reports: Investment, Plant Extension, Litigation, and Human
Resources and Affirmative Action. He called on Associate Vice President
Norman Herbert to comment about the investment report. Mr. Herbert
updated the Board about how the Long Term Portfolio had fared following
events on October 27, 1997, when the stock market experienced the largest
one-day drop since 1987. He said he believes that although the portfolio will
have decreased by slightly less than 3.0 percent, this performance is positive
compared to the performance of the major comparative indices and unofficial
estimates of the performance of the top 25 institutions. He described how
each aspect of the portfolio contributed to this performance.
Executive Vice President Matthews noted that the names of the project
architects have been added to the Plant Extension report.
Vice President Neidhardt submitted a report of projects established during
October 1997. He also noted that due to the University's reputation with respect
to dealing with research integrity issues, the U.S. Public Health Service Office of


142




November Meeting, 1997


Research Integrity has invited the University to cosponsor a program on managing integrity in research. This will take place February 10 and 11, 1998.
Medical Affairs Report. Executive Vice President Omenn reported
that a patent had recently been issued to the University of Michigan for
pioneering gene transfer technology developed in the 1980s at the Medical
School, and the University plans to develop a non-exclusive licensing strategy
to make patent claims available to all for-profit corporations currently using
the technology. He announced that a Center for Gene Therapy has recently
been established by the UM Health System. This program will enhance the
basic sciences and the technological infrastructure for doing gene therapy
research and exploring potential applications.
Executive Vice President Omenn also announced that efforts are underway to increase the University's activity in the area of intellectual property,
licensing, royalties, etc. He noted that developing the gene transfer technology represents a significant challenge for all involved.
Executive Vice President Omenn listed the following major medical
school research initiatives undertaken within the health system in recent
months: 1) Biomedical Sciences Scholars, which is an effort to recruit
leaders in biomedical research; 2) Center for Gene Therapy, meant to
enhance genetic research; 3) Center for Organogenesis, for research on
embryo development and birth defects; 4) Health Services Research Initiative, to study the outcomes of medical care and all aspects of system performance; 5) Basic Sciences Integration, an effort by the six science departments
in the Medical School to consolidate some aspects of these departments,
aimed at attracting top students.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear submitted the report of
voluntary support for October 1997 and noted that voluntary support is
currently ahead of last year's record. He distributed a handout documenting
the total of $1,415,162,693 received in the Campaign for Michigan. The
beneficiaries of the campaign are students (through scholarships and
programs) and faculty (through more endowed chairs). He noted that more
than 250,000 individuals had contributed to the campaign.
Vice President Kinnear thanked the Regents, presidents, provosts, vice
presidents, and deans who had been involved in the campaign, as well as the
Office of Development staff, for contributing to its success. He also noted
that as a matter of course, the totals should reach $2.0 billion by 2000, but
this would not occur in the context of a campaign.

Retirement Memoirs. Provost Cantor submitted one retirement memoir.
Jack W. Meiland, professor of philosophy in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1997,
following 35 years of service.
Professor Meiland received his B.A. (1956), M.A. (1957), and Ph.D
(1962) degrees from the University of Chicago. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty in 1962 as an instructor of philosophy. He was promoted to
assistant professor in 1964, associate professor in 1968, and professor in
1974.   Professor Meiland also served as director of the LS&A           Honors
Program   from  1979-83, as LS&A's associate dean for long-range planning
and curriculum from 1983-90, and as associate dean for undergraduate
education from 1990-92.


158




November Meeting, 1997


Professor Meiland's philosophical interests have been unusually wideranging, including metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, philosophy
of logic, philosophy of the social sciences and of history, phenomenology,
hermeneutics, contemporary continental philosophy, and American philosophy
and pragmatism. He has published three influential books in these areas:
Scepticism and Historical Knowledge (1965), The Nature of Intention (1970),
and Talking About Particulars (1970). He has also published thirty articles,
and is co-editor, with Michael Krauss, of Relativism: Cognitive and Moral
(1982).
In recognition of his outstanding contributions to undergraduate education,
Professor Meiland was appointed Arthur F. Thurnau Professor in 1988, and
twice received the LS&A Excellence in Education Award. A superb classroom
teacher, he is known for his caring approach to students; he teaches without
pretense, conveying to students that he is a partner in learning. He taught
classes in the Residential College and in the Inteflex Program, and had a
special talent for making philosophy come alive for students whose chief
interests lie elsewhere. In the last few years, Professor Meiland reintroduced
American philosophy into the curriculum, and developed two new courses:
"Great Books in Philosophy," and "Science, Culture, and Values." For many
years, Professor Meiland taught a University Division course of his own
design for first-year students, "Methods of Thinking."  His book, College
Thinking (1981), is one of the few college guides that discusses how to
benefit intellectually from college.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Jack W. Meiland professor emeritus of philosophy.
Memorial.    Provost Cantor noted the death of Professor Roy
Rappaport. She observed that Professor Rappaport was a world-renowned
anthropologist who had also been an extraordinary citizen of the University.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death on October 9, 1997, of Roy A. ("Skip") Rappaport, the
Leslie A. White Professor of Anthropology. Professor Rappaport died at
home at the age of 71 after a period of prolonged illness, under the loving
care of his wife, Ann Hart Rappaport, and his daughters, Amelia and Gina.
Honored this year with the University's Distinguished Faculty Achievement
Award, Professor Rappaport was recognized internationally as a major figure
in anthropology. Skip Rappaport was broadly trained at Columbia, receiving
his Ph.D. in 1966. (Anthropology was his second career; his first had been as
an innkeeper.) His main contributions have been in the areas of ecological
anthropology, the anthropology of religion, the anthropology of the Pacific,
specifically Papua-New Guinea, and, most recently, applied or "engaged"
anthropology.
Rappaport has written three books, and a fourth, Holiness and Humanity,
will be published posthumously. His Pigs for the Ancestors: Ritual in the
Ecology of a New Guinea People (1967) is the most important and widelycited book ever published in the field of ecological anthropology. It is considered
a major work of theory, yet it is also empirically grounded in his meticulous
collection of quantitative and qualitative data on such "material" matters as


159




November Meeting, 1997


diet and energy expenditure, as well as such mental-cognitive-ideational
domains as myth and folk taxonomies. The analysis of ritual that emerged
from this field research among the Tsembaga Maring of Papua-New Guinea
was developed and elaborated in several essays on ritual and religion, many
of them collected in his Ecology, Meaning, and Religion (1979).
Professor Rappaport was a man of huge erudition, relentlessly intellectual,
concerned with knowledge, theory, facts, ideas, and also social policy. His
recent work links with what is usually called "applied" or "practical" anthropology, but which Rappaport preferred to call "engaged anthropology." As president of the American Anthropological Association, he directed anthropology
toward policy issues and engagement with social problems. He also contributed
directly to policy through his consulting work on the social impact of outer
continental oil drilling and nuclear waste disposal.
For his former students, Skip Rappaport was generous, supportive, and
encouraging, serving as an ideal scholarly mentor. His teaching activity and
initiatives spanned the University curriculum from Anthropology 101 to upperlevel theory courses and two theme semesters. Generations of graduate and
undergraduate students at Michigan have learned about the anthropology of
religion from Professor Rappaport. His recently completed book manuscript,
Holiness and Humanity, a contribution to anthropological theory and to
religious studies, evolved as he has taught, developed, and revised this course
over the years.
Professor Rappaport served the University as two-term chair of the
anthropology department, and, much more recently, as head of the Program
on Studies in Religion. He has been a member of the LSA executive committee
and the University Senate Assembly. Nationally he served four years as
president-elect and then president of the American Anthropological Association.
Professor Rappaport served on committees, panels, and boards too numerous
to name. In recognition of his teaching, research, and service, Skip was
named to a Walgreen Chair and elected to the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences. As we mourn the loss of this great scholar and public servant,
our condolences go to his wife, Ann, and his daughters, Amelia and Gina.
Honorary Degrees. President Bollinger submitted the names of three
individuals as recipients of honorary degrees at the December 1997
commencement: Gwendolyn Calvert Baker, former president and CEO, U.S.
Committee for UNICEF (Doctor of Laws); Ken Burns, Filmmaker and historian (Doctor of Laws); and Richard E. Smalley, Nobel-Prize-winning chemist
(Doctor of Science).
Regent McGowan stated that she was delighted to learn of the recommendation regarding Ken Burns, noting that it is significant that the University is recognizing through its honorary degree process the distinguished
career of a person at a younger age than has been customary in the past.
Degrees. Provost Cantor submitted final degree lists for May 1997 and
August 1997 commencements, December 1997 Doctoral Degree Lists, and
changes to previously approved degree lists.


160




November Meeting, 1997


Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Newman,
seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the
Consent Agenda.
Six Month Report on University Audits
Mr. Carl Smith, director of University audits, submitted the regular
six months report on Office of University Audits activities for the period
April 1, 1997, through September 30, 1997. He noted that issues associated
with the Year 2000 are being attended to.
University of Michigan 1997 Financial Report Supplemental Schedules
for the Year Ended June 30, 1997
Executive Vice President Matthews submitted the University of Michigan 1997 Financial Report Supplemental Schedules for the Year Ended
June 30, 1997.
Alternative Asset Investment
Executive Vice President Matthews described this proposed alternative
asset investment opportunity, noting that it would involve a currency risk, with
a conscious decision not to hedge. On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded
by Regent Power, the Regents unanimously approved commitment of up to
~10 million of the Long Term Portfolio to Candover 1997 Fund, pending
favorable legal review of the documents by the general counsel's office.
Douglas Emmett Realty Fund 1997
Executive Vice President Matthews informed the Regents that a
follow-on investment of $15.0 million had been made in Douglas Emmett
Realty Fund 1997.
Central Power Plant Boiler #6 Replacement
Regent McFee moved approval of proceeding with a project to replace boiler
#6 in the Central Power Plant, as described in the Regents Communication.
Regent Newman seconded the motion.
Regent Newman inquired whether the University had ever investigated
either replacing the power plant or adding an additional power plant to
increase capacity. Executive Vice President Matthews responded that this is
always an issue as facilities are expanded on the Medical Campus and North
Campus. Regent Newman observed that there is competition in the power
plant industry and raised the notion of having outside construction and
management of the power plant for negotiated fees, rather than having the
University operating the plant. Executive Vice President Matthews said that
his staff would review this matter.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.


161




November Meeting, 1997


UM Hospitals Radiology Angiographic Equipment Replacement and
Renovations
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved submission of an application for a certificate
of need for the purchase of equipment and renovation of imaging rooms for
the Radiology Angiographic Equipment and Renovations Project.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Field House Addition
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved the UM-Dearborn Field House Addition Project,
including the site and architect, as described in the Regents Communication.
Renovation Projects
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects: 1) fourth floor
renovation and improvements to the C.C. Little Building; 2) an addition to
the North Campus Plant Service Building; and 3) renovation of the Women's
Hospital Birth Center within University of Michigan Hospitals.
Purchasing Contract with AccuPhotonics, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved a purchasing contract with AccuPhotonics,
Inc. Because Mohammed N. Islam is both partial owner of AccuPhotonics
and a University of Michigan employee, this contract falls under the state of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided
in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the purchase contract will be the Regents of the University of
Michigan and AccuPhotonics, Inc.
2.  Terms of the contract to support University of Michigan research include
the purchase of one (1) each, used laser air table, plus shipping costs, for a
total of $3,394.
3.  Mohammed N. Islam's pecuniary interest arises from his position as partial
owner of Accutonics, Inc.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan
and IntraLase Corporation
Vice President Neidhardt pointed out that this action request concerns
IntraLase Corporation, not IntraLase, Inc., as stated in the Regents
Communication.
Regent Power moved approval of a license agreement between the
University of Michigan and IntraLase Corporation. Because Ron Kurtz and
Tibor Juhasz are both University employees and holders of equity interest in
IntraLase, this license agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict
of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance
with statutory requirements:


162




November Meeting, 1997


1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and IntraLase
Corporation ("IntraLase").
2.   The terms of the contract are that the contracts to be completed between
the University and IntraLase include the license to be executed as well as
documents covering stock transfers and related matters. A sponsored
research contract between the University and IntraLase will be the subject
of a separate Regental Action Request.
The license will provide IntraLase with exclusive rights to the technology
for the field of laser medical instruments. The University will retain ownership of the technology, internal research use rights, the right to convey the
standard governmental license, and commercialization rights in fields
outside of the field granted exclusively to IntraLase.
The University will receive a royalty of 1.5% to 2.5% (depending upon the
patentability of the incorporated technology) of all net sales of products of
IntraLase and its sublicensees. The University will also receive modest
minimum annual royalties beginning in 1999, starting at $5,000 per year
and increasing to $15,000 per year.
The license will require that IntraLase secure at least $1,000,000 in outside
funding for the company's development activities by February 28, 1999.
Once that funding has been obtained, the University will receive equity in
the company under a separate agreement. The equity position will be a
minority position (giving the University 25% of the pool of company stock
which remains after subtracting all shares issued to new cash investors and
issued under corporate management plans to officers from the total of all
shares of company stock).
IntraLase will be obligated to use reasonable efforts to develop products
based upon the technology, and to give primary consideration to the maintenance of business offices in the state of Michigan.
No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University
employees, will be obligated under the license and related agreements.
3.   The pecuniary interests of Drs. Kurtz and Juhasz arise from their equity
ownership interest in IntraLase, Inc. In accordance with the University
policy on intellectual property, they will waive any personal participation in
the sharing of revenues received by the University from IntraLase. (The
other inventors of the technology will share in such revenues in accordance
with University policy, on a pro rata basis under a sharing agreement
ratified by all inventors.)
Agreement between the University of Michigan and IntraLase
Corporation
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved an agreement between the University of Michigan
and IntraLase Corporation ("IntraLase") under which IntraLase will fund
research at the University to evaluate and improve technology owned and
licensed by the University. Because two individuals who will be working on
the research project, Ron M. Kurtz and Tibor Juhasz, are both University
employees and directors and shareholders of IntraLase, this agreement falls
under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:


163




November Meeting, 1997


1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and IntraLase
Corporation.
2.  The terms of the proposed agreement are acceptable and conform to University policy. Both Dr. Kurtz and Dr. Juhasz will perform work on behalf of
the University under this agreement. Neither of them will receive any
compensation from IntraLase and will not play any role on behalf of IntraLase
relative to this project. The amount of the subcontract to the University if
$10,000. Equipment valued at approximately two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000) will also be provided to the University by IntraLase under this
agreement. The period of performance is three years.
3.  The pecuniary interests of Drs. Kurtz and Juhasz arise from their equity
ownership interest in IntraLase, Inc. Neither Dr. Kurtz nor Dr. Juhasz will
receive any compensation from nor devote any effort on behalf of IntraLase
in this project. Further, neither has played any role in the negotiation of
this agreement with the University.
Regent Power observed that the University typically focuses first on
royalties in this type of arrangement, and secondly on equity. He suggested
that this policy be reviewed by the offices of the executive vice president and
chief financial officer, vice president for research, and executive vice president for medical affairs, in an attempt to bring some clarity to the matter as
a policy issue. He requested that this be brought to the Board for discussion
at some point in the near future.
Vice President Neidhardt acknowledged that this is a concern and stated
that these discussions are ongoing. He said that plans are underway to hold
such a discussion with the Board in midwinter or early spring, 1998. Executive Vice President Omenn noted that he had attended a meeting that
morning on this topic and was looking forward to participating in the discussion
with the Regents.
University of Michigan Health System Definition
Executive Vice President Omenn noted that although the term "University
of Michigan Health System" already is in use, there has been confusion
about its meaning. The purpose of this request is to clarify the definition of
the University of Michigan Health System to include the University of Michigan
Medical School, University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers,
M-Care, and the Michigan Health Corporation. He noted that this term will
be registered as a trademark.
Regent Power moved approval of the definition of the University of
Michigan Health System to include the University of Michigan Medical
School, University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers, M-Care, and
the Michigan Health Corporation. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and
it was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan Health System Chief Executive Officer
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved the designation of Dr. Gilbert S. Omenn,


164




November Meeting, 1997


executive vice president for medical affairs, as chief executive officer of the
University of Michigan Health System.
Michigan Health Corporation (MHC)/Amendment of Bylaws
Executive Vice President Matthews introduced this request to amend
the bylaws of the Michigan Health Corporation to add a fifth director to the
board, to change the titles of the officers of the corporation, to designate the
officers of the corporation, and to change the sole member representative.
Regent McFee moved amendment of the bylaws of the Michigan Health
Corporation to add the University of Michigan's executive vice president for
medical affairs as a director of the MHC board; to change the title of chair to
chair and chief executive officer and to change the title of president to vice
chair and chief operating officer; to appoint the officers of MHC as follows:
the executive vice president for medical affairs of the University of Michigan
would be chair and chief executive officer of MHC; the executive director of
University of Michigan Hospitals would be vice chair and chief operating
officer of MHC; the executive vice president and chief financial officer of the
University of Michigan would be treasurer of MHC; and the dean of the
University of Michigan Medical School would be secretary of MHC; and to
change the designation of the sole member representative from the executive
vice president and chief financial officer to the executive vice president for
medical affairs. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Regent McFee noted that the board of directors was to be increased
from four to five members. She suggested retaining the designation of the
executive vice president for medical affairs as chair and chief executive
officer, but that instead of designating in the bylaws which of the other directors
is going to hold the vice chair, treasurer, and secretary positions, the offices
be created and the board of directors be empowered to decide who among
them will hold which of these offices. This will provide more flexibility to the
board and the chair. She amended her motion to so state. The vote was
then taken, and the amended motion was approved unanimously.
Membership of M-Care Board of Directors
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved the appointment of Thomas D. Biggs, interim
chief financial officer of the University of Michigan Hospitals, as a member of
the M-Care board of directors, replacing David N. Southwell, who resigned
his position.
Recommendation for Appointments to Medical Staff Membership
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Newman, and on
the recommendation of University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board,
the Regents unanimously approved certain specified appointments to medical
staff membership.


165




November Meeting, 1997


1998 Henry Russel Lecturer
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Taylor, the
Regents unanimously approved the appointment of David E. Kuhl as Henry
Russel Lecturer for 1998.
Establishment of Institute for Advanced Vehicle Systems at
UM-Dearborn
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved establishment of the Institute for Advanced
Vehicle Systems at UM-Dearborn. Regent Newman commended Chancellor
Renick for working with donor Heinz C. Prechter in establishing this institute.
FY99 State Budget Request - Ann Arbor Campus
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the FY99 state budget request for the Ann Arbor
Campus.
1998-99 State Budget Request - Dearborn Campus
On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved the 1998-99 state budget request for the Dearborn
campus.
1998-99 State Budget Request - Flint Campus
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent McGowan, the
Regents unanimously approved the 1998-99 state budget request for the Flint
campus.

There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. Regents'
expenses for October 1997 totaled $1,741.15. The next meeting is scheduled
for December 18-19, 1997.

Dear Regent McGowan:
President Bollinger asked that I respond to your letter of November 12, 1997, concerning the proposed expansion of Michigan Stadium.
The expansion of the Stadium will involve adding rows of seats at the perimeter of the
Stadium. Thus, the work itself will not impact the area devoted to Commencement seating.
However, we e   be working closely with the Office of Major Events in the University s
Development Office to be certain that the project does not intrude on the ceremony.
Although contracts have not yet been issued, they will include provisions that all work
will be stopped and the construction site cleaned prior to Commencement. Furthermore,
equipment and material marshaling areas will be located so as to not affect access to the
Stadium by Commencement participants and guests. These provisions will be reviewed by
Executive Vice President Kasdin.
With respect to your question concerning funding provisions, a number of facts make
us quite conifortable that ticket sales will indeed cover the cost of the expansion:
*    For some time, we have been experiencing a 98% season ticket renewal rate.
*    Based on unfilled requests, we estimate that there is a current unmet need for
1,500 to 2,000 additional non-student season tickets.
*    This year the demand for students tickets exceeded supply by 3,000 season
tickets, making necessary the use of a lottery to allocate partlal season tickets.
*    The recent addition of Penn State to the league has generated a rivalry which we
believe will equal that between the University and Michigan State, Ohio State,
and Notre Dame. These rivalries serve to maintain interest in season tickets over
very long periods of time.
Nevertheless, should all of these factors prove inadequate the Athletic Director has
provided us with a letter pledging the use of Athretic Department Reserves as necessary.
Should you have any questions or require additional information, please let me know.
Sincerely,
C. W. Matthews

DECEMBER MEETING, 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, December 18, 1997
The Regents convened at 1:55 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Deitch, Maynard, McFee, McGowan, Newman,
Power, and Taylor. Also present were Executive Vice President Kasdin, Provost
Cantor, Vice President Harrison, Vice President Hartford, Vice President
Kinnear, Acting Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellors Nelms and Renick,
and Interim Co-General Counsel Barry. Executive Vice President Omenn
and Secretary Palmer were absent. Regent Horning arrived at about 2:50 p.m.
General Remarks: President Bollinger
President Bollinger pointed out some of the accomplishments of faculty
and students since the last Regents' Meeting. He noted that Garry Brewer,
former dean of the School of Natural Resources and Environment, has been
named to a chair at a Swedish university that was established in honor of the
king. Also, among other honors received by the University of Michigan
football program, player Charles Woodson had received the Heisman Trophy
and Coach Lloyd Carr had been named coach of the year. Finally, he pointed
out that Fiona Rose, former president of Michigan Student Assembly, had
received a Rhodes Scholarship, the 24th University of Michigan student and
the first since 1993 to have been so honored.
Regents' Resolution in Honor of Fiona Anne Rose
President Bollinger called on Regent Rebecca McGowan, who called Ms.
Rose to the podium. Regent McGowan observed that Michigan had nominated
four outstanding students for Marshall and Rhodes Scholarships and noted
that the relationship between all four of them had been extremely strong and
supportive throughout the process. She then read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate and
commend Fiona Anne Rose on her selection as a 1998 Rhodes
Scholar. She exemplifies the high standards which the scholarship
celebrates: intellectual and scholastic attainments, integrity, interest
in and respect for other human beings, leadership, energy to use
talents to the fullest, and a fondness for and success in sports. It is a
great honor for her and for the University of Michigan.
One of thirty-two students selected nationwide to receive the
prestigious Rhodes Scholarship, Ms. Rose has distinguished herself as a
strong and effective leader at the University of Michigan and
nationally. As the 1996-97president of the Michigan Student Assembly,


169




December Meeting, 1997


Ms. Rose ably represented the interests and concerns of students to the
Regents and to the administration and did so with utmost tact,
integrity, and graciousness. She has served on many University committees
and task forces, including the Task Force on Child Care. In February
1996, Ms. Rose spoke eloquently on behalf of students at Michigan and
across the country to President Bill Clinton and Congressional leaders
about the importance of student financial aid.
In addition to student government, Ms. Rose works many hours
each week assisting a deaf student and is a former member of the women's
crew team and of the University Philharmonic Orchestra. This past
summer she participated in an archeological dig in Pompeii. An honors
student, Ms. Rose plans to continue to study classical archeology at
Oxford University and to pursue a career in public service, possibly in
education or public policy.
It is with pride that the Regents congratulate Fiona Anne Rose on
her selection as a 1998 Rhodes Scholar and wish her great success as
she continues her formal education at Oxford.
There followed a round of applause. Ms. Rose thanked the Regents for
the resolution and for the support she had received from the Regents and
administration during and after her tenure in student government.
Report: Research and Scholarly Activities, 1997-Measure by Measure
Vice President Neidhardt distributed a report titled "Research and
Scholarship: Expenditures, Proposals, and Awards, FY1997," noting that the
report provides an assessment of the University's research efforts during the
past fiscal year. He also distributed an outline of his presentation, titled
"Research and Scholarly Activities FY 1997: Measure by Measure."
Vice President Neidhardt noted that the University is currently the
nation's number one research university, measured by the volume of its
annual expenditures in support of research and scholarly activity, which
amounted to $458,478,301 in 1996-97. He noted that whereas two years ago a
drop of 33 percent in federal nondefense R&D expenditures had been predicted
by the year 2002, in 1997 this amount had been reduced to 23 percent. More
recently, the decline in expenditures has been projected to amount to 14
percent by 2002.
Vice President Neidhardt reviewed the reasons for this, noting that
leaders of both political parties in Congress have recently voiced strong
support for research funding by federal agencies. He noted that budgets for
the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have
risen substantially for FY 1998. These changes can be attributed to intensive
educational efforts on the part of the research community and to the strong
state of the nation's economy.
Vice President Neidhart displayed charts illustrating the percentage of
the University's research expenditures by sponsor group and by university
unit for FY 1997, comparisons of the research portfolio by fields of study
since 1987, and the ten-year trend in research expenditures by federal and


170




December Meeting, 1997


nonfederal sources. He noted that while several of the University of
Michigan's peer institutions have seen significant declines in recent years in
the percentage of total federal research funding they receive, the percentage
received by the University of Michigan has risen to just over two percent of the
national research expenditure over the past decade.
He concluded that University of Michigan faculty have been successfully
competing for their share of the federal investment in research, and that every
effort should be made to nurture new avenues of inquiry by the faculty. This
includes providing seed funds for new explorations, establishment of incubator
units, and cost sharing and infrastructure support of research. The University
should continue its efforts to inform Congress and the public of the continued
need for university-based research. It should also adopt a budget model that will
protect the tradition of cross-disciplinary and cross-unit collaboration in
research. Finally, it should retain the core value that research and educational
objectives are interwoven and essential for the preservation of the University's
uniqueness.
In response to a question from President Bollinger about research
facilities, Vice President Neidhardt noted that the University has excellent
new buildings in the College of Engineering and in the Medical Center, but it
is always difficult to find funding for obtaining the latest technology to keep
faculty at the cutting edge of research. Provost Cantor pointed out the
important role of seed funding provided by the Office of the Vice President
for Research for "incubator units" on campus. But she noted that funding
for the arts and humanities has lagged behind that for the hard sciences.
In response to a question from Regent Power, it was noted that
discussions are underway within the University about the indirect cost
recovery rate.
Enrollment Planning
Provost Cantor observed that enrollment planning involves balancing
accessibility with maintaining a high quality of life and education for
students. That is, the University wants to provide extraordinary quality for
as many students as possible. There are a number of policies and procedures
in place both for housing and enrollment management, but given the large
pool of qualified applicants, this is a very difficult task and is a delicate
balancing act involving the schools and colleges, offices of the provost and
vice president for student affairs, and many other areas of the University.
Housing Occupancy Report
Vice President Hartford distributed documents explaining the housing
situation and options for 1998-99. She noted that a lot of misinformation
had been spread in recent weeks and gave a report describing the actual
situation.
Vice President Hartford noted that first-year students have historically
been guaranteed space in traditional residence halls. However, for the past
four years, University Housing has had a supply/demand problem, due to an
increase of 500 freshman students during this time and a concurrent increase


171




December Meeting, 1997


in the number of upper division students interested in living on campus.
This has led to overcrowding in the traditional residence halls, in which
there are 7600 spaces.
She reported that about 25 percent of all students live in "traditional"
and "nontraditional" residence halls, 4.5 percent live in family housing, 6.5
percent live in fraternities and sororities, 1.6 percent live in cooperatives,
almost 44 percent live in private-sector rentals, and about 18 percent
commute. She clarified that there is space on campus for any students
currently in the University housing system who want to remain in the
system, which includes traditional and nontraditional residence halls.
Vice President Hartford stated that the guiding principles of University
Housing are to guarantee traditional hall space for first year students; to
serve the priorities of the living-learning programs, which include a
sophomore year component; and to assist junior and senior students, who are
more ready for and interested in independent living, either in living in
nontraditional halls or in finding off campus housing.
Current issues are the increased size of the first-year class, a higher
residence hall re-application rate among returning residents, and the need to
reduce overcrowding in the residence halls. However, she reiterated that
space is guaranteed in the system for any student who wants to live there,
and that meal programs are available for any student, whether or not they
live in residence halls.
Vice President Hartford reported that 96 percent of first-year students
live in traditional halls, as well as 36 percent of sophomores, 5 percent of
juniors and seniors, and less than one percent of graduate students. Regent
Taylor suggested that a survey be conducted to determine how many juniors
and seniors would choose to live in traditional halls if that option were
available. That information could be used to establish a vision of what the
ideal situation would be given sufficient resources.
Vice President Hartford noted that including overflow triple spaces and
additional spaces in Baits Hall, the total available traditional housing spaces
equal 7,980 for 1998-99. However, the estimated demand will equal 8,350,
leaving 370 students who would have to be housed in nontraditional halls.
Nontraditional halls have fewer staff and no formal programming, and their
leases do not include a meal plan, although plans can be purchased. She
pointed out that this past year, eight Big Ten schools opened with some
students in temporary housing; the 34 students at the University of
Michigan who had to be housed in lounges at the start of school had been
moved out of the lounges within 11 days.
Regent Taylor noted that he assumes that staff is working as hard as
possible to deal with the current situation; however, the other issue, which is
not being addressed, is the longer-range issue of the vision for housing and
what is and should be offered. Regent Power pointed out that historically,
there have been Regents who did not want to conduct a survey of housing
needs because they felt they represented the Ann Arbor landlord community,
and this precluded there being any long-term policy setting about housing.


172




December Meeting, 1997


He believes the Board is now in a position to set a forward-looking, long-term
policy to deal with the interests of the University in the area of housing.
Regent Deitch pointed out that the Board had been receiving a lot of
complaints about the housing situation, but that these should be viewed in
the context of allocating resources and cost/benefit analysis for all 23,500
undergraduate students. He believes the primary emphasis should be on
exposing the largest possible number of students to the benefits of a
Michigan education. At the current time, he noted, there appears to be a
shortage of rooms, and he believes that a rational solution has been arrived
at. He expressed concern about conducting a broad survey, as it could raise
unrealistic expectations about potential solutions.
Regent Taylor agreed that the current situation is being resolved in a
reasonable manner. However, it only emphasizes the need to look forward to
the future and collect data. Regent Newman agreed that a cohesive housing
policy is needed. Vice President Hartford agreed that there has not been a
broad discussion of what the University should be doing in this area in the
best of all possible worlds.
Regent McFee observed that most of the concerns raised by the current
situation have been answered by today's presentation. She expressed regret
that rumors had escalated to the point that so many unnecessary worries had
been caused.
Regent Maynard suggested that administrators look back and see what
in the system had created the misunderstandings in order to prevent this
unfortunate situation from recurring. Vice President Hartford observed that
sometimes when proposals are raised in order to receive open discussion and
input, people assume that the decision has already been made.
Regent Deitch disagreed that the University does not have a cohesive
housing policy. He believes the housing division is well-run, that decisions
are made based upon historic usage, and that the plant has been suitably
updated. Any review of the assumptions underlying the way the Housing
Division operates should be conducted in the context of all other demands on
the University's resources.
Regents Newman and Taylor reiterated that they are not suggesting
that the Housing Division is not well-run; they are only suggesting that the
issue needs to be reviewed in order that a cohesive plan be developed. Vice
President Hartford emphasized that what should drive the housing policy is
the academic mission of the institution.
Operating Principles of Enrollment Management
Provost Cantor then gave a presentation about enrollment management.
She noted that enrollments have been relatively steady over the past ten
years. She said there is a good deal of coordination among all of the offices
concerned with enrollment, including the schools and colleges, admissions
office, provost's office, office of financial aid, and office of budget and
planning. She noted that enrollment targeting has as much to do with
classroom space as it does with housing. She displayed a chart showing the


173




December Meeting, 1997


enrollment planning timeline and noted that the need for determining
housing needs for upper division students comes much earlier than when the
size of the freshman class is known and before the number of returning
students is known.
For Fall 1997, there was a much higher yield rate than expected for
resident students (residents of the state of Michigan who decide to attend the
University). She pointed out that many of the factors that affect yield rate
are not easy to incorporate into enrollment projection models.
Regent Newman suggested that information sent to prospective
students include a statement that housing is not guaranteed after the
freshman year, as a number of parents had indicated that they were unaware
of this policy.
Provost Cantor noted that although the number of incoming students
was higher than had been projected, the increased numbers of students this
year represent only one-half of one percent of the total enrollment. This is
within the desired enrollment target projection range.  However, she
reiterated that academic initiatives, such as classroom and living/learning
experiences, are also important in determining enrollment targets. To this
end, she noted that the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts is
considering reducing the target for the next freshman class by 100 students
in order to increase the availability of small first-year seminar classes. This
number would be offset by increasing the number of upper-division transfer
students.
Regent Newman pointed out that it would be better to have admissions
policy decisions impact the housing situation than for housing availability to
impact enrollment.  That is, academic decisions, rather than housing
availability, should be the driving factors for decisions on enrollment
decreases. General agreement was expressed on this point.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Power made the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(e) and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202 and 1996 PA 464, I move that the Board of
Regents meet in closed session on December 18, 1997, in the Regents'
Room, for the purposes of consulting with our attorney regarding trial
or settlement strategy in connection with specific pending litigation
(Section 8e) and of considering material exempt from discussion or
disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (Section 8h).
Such exempt material consists of a written opinion from the Board's
legal counsel.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regent Power added, "In addition, during this session we will consider a
periodic personnel evaluation of an employee who has requested a closed
hearing (Section 8a)."

Retirement Memoirs. Provost Cantor submitted thirteen retirement
memoirs.
John Russell Brown, professor of theatre and drama in the School of
Music and professor of English language and literature in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 1997.
Professor Brown received his B.A. (1949) and M.A. (1952) degrees from
Oxford University and his Ph.D. degree in 1960 from the University of
Birmingham. From 1951-57, he was a fellow, then dean at the Shakespeare
Institute, Stratford-upon-Avon. He then served as lecturer and senior lecturer
(1957-63) in the Department of English, then head of the Department of Drama
and Theatre Arts (1963-71) at the University of Birmingham (England). He
was a professor of English at the University of Sussex from 1971-82 and
professor of theatre arts at the State University of New York at Stony Brook
from 1982-85. He came to the University of Michigan in 1985 as professor
and chair of the Department of Theatre and Drama and professor of English
language and literature.
Professor Brown is a scholar who loves the stage. His scholarly work has
always been informed by a special awareness of the practical realities of
theater, and this orientation has defined his prominence among Shakespeare
scholars for 40 years. His earliest successes stemmed from a fresh insistence
that Shakespeare's plays be treated as stage pieces rather than as texts simply
to be read. Shakespeare's Plays in Performance (1966) and Free Shakespeare
(1974) have remained influential in this crusade to this day. Somewhat later,
he served for 15 years as associate director of the National Theatre in
London, searching for important modem works for the stage while at the
same time breathing fresh new life into old ones. Later still, he began to
direct performances of Elizabethan and modern works. He has directed
professional productions at theaters in England and in the United States, as
well as numerous student productions at the University of Michigan and
elsewhere. He recently edited and contributed to The Oxford Illustrated
History of Theatre (1995) and currently has several books in press.
A vibrant, challenging teacher, Professor Brown addressed large issues,
asked big questions, and wanted expansive responses from students. His
excitement and authority could sometimes intimidate at first, but students
invariably became Brown enthusiasts.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
John Russell Brown professor emeritus of theatre and drama and professor
emeritus of English language and literature.
Thomas N. Filson, associate professor of education at the University of
Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1997.


185




December Meeting, 1997


Professor Filson received his A.B. degree at Chico State College (California)
in 1954 and his Ph.D. degree at the University of Minnesota in 1957. From
1957-60, he taught at Hastings College (Nebraska) and then Hastings Public
Schools. He was an assistant, then associate, professor at Western Illinois
University from 1960-67. He joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty in
1967 as an associate professor of education.
During his thirty years on the faculty, Professor Filson has taught courses
in educational foundations, educational psychology, and principles of psychology
and has supervised student teachers and students in fieldwork placements. A
specialist in instructional psychology and human learning, he is the author of
Instructional Decision Making (William Brown Book Company, 1969).
Professor Filson has played a leadership role in establishing the undergraduate
foundations block program. The foundations block is an innovative approach
to initiating students into teacher education through a coordinated experience
involving a fieldwork placement in schools, a reflective seminar, and coursework
in social foundations of education and educational psychology. Working with
other members of the department, Professor Filson helped establish the
foundations block and served for many years as the coordinator of the block
experience.
During the 1993-94 academic year, Professor Filson was interim chair of
the education department. Throughout his career, he has played an active
role in faculty governance. He has served on a number of key departmental
committees, and most recently, as chair of the College of Arts and Sciences
Curriculum Committee. A dedicated teacher and mentor, Professor Filson
has devoted his career to helping undergraduates become distinguished
teachers.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his
dedicated service by naming Thomas N. Filson associate professor emeritus
of education.
Ilene H. Forsyth, Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of History of Art and
professor of history of art in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts,
will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1997.
Professor Forsyth received her A.B. degree from the University of
Michigan in 1950 and her A.M. and Ph.D. degrees in 1955 and 1960,
respectively, from  Columbia University.  She joined the University of
Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1961. She was promoted to assistant
professor in 1963, associate professor in 1968, and professor in 1974. She was
named Arthur F. Thurnau Professor in 1984.
Professor Forsyth's first book, The Throne of Wisdom: Wood Sculptures
of the Madonna in Romanesque France (Princeton University Press, 1972)
received the prestigious Charles Rufus Morey Book Award of the College Art
Association of America in 1974. It is a classic in the field, posing a series of
questions about tradition, style, liturgical function, and social context that are
still the foci of fruitful debate. In addition to a long list of important edited
volumes, articles, and reviews, she has also published The Uses of Art:
Medieval Metaphor in the Michigan Law Quadrangle (University of Michigan
Press, 1993), for which she received the Annie Award for Excellence in the Arts
from the Washtenaw Council for the Arts. A monograph, The Romanesque


186




December Meeting, 1997


Sculpture of Saint-Andoche, Saulieu, is among major scholarly works
forthcoming.
Students in a wide range of specializations have benefited from the
rigorous training provided by Professor Forsyth. Her status as a board
member of many national and international organizations has helped shape
the field of art history and has lent special prestige to the University of
Michigan. Her energy and commitment have made her a mainstay of the
department and of the broader University; she has served on numerous
departmental, college, and University-wide committees.
Professor Forsyth has been honored by appointments as visiting
professor at Harvard University (1980), Andrew Mellon Professor at the
University of Pittsburgh (1981), and distinguished professor of medieval
studies at the University of California at Berkeley (1996). She has been
appointed Kress Professor at the National Gallery of Art for 1998-99.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Ilene
H. Forsyth Arthur F. Thurnau Professor Emerita of History of Art and professor
emerita of history of art.
Richard W. Fortner, professor of management and former dean of the
School of Management at the University of Michigan-Flint, will retire from
active faculty status on December 31, 1997.
A native of Indiana, Professor Fortner received his B.S. (1953), M.B.A.
(1954), and D.B.A. (1964) degrees from Indiana University. From 1954-80, he
taught at the U.S.A.F. Institute of Technology, Wittenberg University,
Indiana University, and the University of Rochester. He joined the University of
Michigan-Flint in 1980 as dean of the School of Management. During his
tenure as dean, he was instrumental in attaining accreditation from the
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business for the undergraduate
program in 1982 and graduate business programs in 1986, and re-accreditation
in 1992.
Professor Fortner's honors include the United States Steel Foundation
Fellowship, the Indiana CPA's Gold Watch Award, and Indiana University
Business School's Senior Rawles Prize. He was awarded the Legion of Merit
by the U.S. Air Force for his performance as senior reservist in the U.S.A.F.
Systems Command Directorate of Contracting and Manufacturing. He is a
member of Phi Eta Sigma, Beta Gamma Sigma, and Beta Alpha Psi.
Professor Fortner has been a member of the Michigan Society of CPAs; the
Rochester, New York, Chamber of Commerce (member, Finance Committee,
1963-80); American Accounting Association; the Institute of Management
Accountants (director of the Rochester Chapter from 1966-73); the Consortium

Chapter, 1975-78); Graduate Management Admission Council (Rochester
representative, 1974-80; member of the board of trustees, 1976-80; chair,
1978-79); and the Reserve Officers Association. On the Flint campus, Professor
Fortner has served on numerous departmental and campus-wide committees.
His community activities include membership in the Rotary Club of Flint, the
Greater Flint Arts Council, the New Vic Dinner Theatre, and the Friends of
WFBE-FM Radio.


187




December Meeting, 1997


The Regents now salute this distinguished business educator for his
dedicated service by naming Richard W. Fortner professor emeritus of
management and dean emeritus.
Albert I. Hermalin, professor of sociology and research scientist at the
Population Studies Center, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will
retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1997.
Professor Hermalin received his B.S. degree in 1949 from City College of
New York and his M.A. (1966) and Ph.D. (1969) degrees from Princeton
University. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1967 as a lecturer
in sociology and research associate in the Population Studies Center. He was
promoted to assistant professor in 1969, associate professor in 1972, and
professor in 1978. Within the Population Studies Center, Professor Hermalin
served as associate director from 1972-76, director from 1977-87, and interim
director in 1990-91. He was promoted to research scientist in 1987.
Early in his career, Professor Hermalin and his collaborators carried out
pioneering investigations of the transition from very high to very low birth
rates in Taiwan. Due to these efforts, this demographic change, which has
occurred in many nations, is more completely understood and better
documented in Taiwan than in any other nation. After birth rates fall
rapidly, the age structure of the population shifts and the challenges of an
aging population begin to appear. By the 1980s, Professor Hermalin had
become a leader in the demography of aging, especially within East and
Southeast Asia. Due to his efforts, major funding was obtained from the
National Institute on Aging to create the Michigan Exploratory Center on the
Demography of Aging-a now thriving program that is promoting excellent
demographic research.
Professor Hermalin has also been an effective mentor for dozens of
doctoral students. During his tenure as director of the Population Studies
Center, he was responsible for obtaining major funding from the National
Institutes of Child Health and Human Development. Due to his fundraising
efforts and his exceptionally skillful management, the Population Studies Center
should continue for many years to be one of the nation's outstanding centers for
population research and doctoral training.
In 1989, Professor Hermalin was awarded the Robert J. Lapham Prize by
the Population Association of America for his contributions to the discipline.
He served as president of that organization in 1993.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Albert I.
Hermalin professor emeritus of sociology and research scientist emeritus.
Peter B. Kaufman, professor of biology, College of Literature, Science
and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1997,
following 41 years of service.
Professor Kaufman received his B.Sc. degree in 1949 from Cornell
University and his Ph.D. degree in 1954 from the University of California at
Davis. After a year of postdoctoral study at The Ohio State University, Dr.
Kaufman joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1956 as an instructor.
He was promoted to assistant professor in 1957, associate professor in 1962,
and professor in 1972.


188




December Meeting, 1997


Professor Kaufman's early interest in the action of herbicides on weeds
expanded into a research program that explored various aspects of plant growth
and development, including the roles of hormones and of environmental factors,
such as gravity, on plants.  These activities resulted in a number of
publications. In his studies of plant development, Professor Kaufman has
conducted research on the actions of hormones such as the gibberillins on
stem growth. Additional work has addressed the influence of gravity on this
process, a phenomenon known as gravitropism. A third area of investigation
by Professor Kaufman's group has been the elucidation of structural details of
the plant cell wall, a cellular structure that is intimately involved in stem
growth and development.
Professor Kaufman's classroom activities included teaching popular
courses on the topic of organismal plant biology. Several generations of
students have profited from their exposure to "Plants and Man" and to the
course he taught on plant biotechnology for a number of years. His teaching
activities led to the production of textbooks used in introductory plant
courses, and he was featured in "The House Botanist," a series of educational
television programs produced by the University of Michigan Television
Center.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Peter B. Kaufman professor emeritus of biology.
John H. Lillie, D.D.S., professor of anatomy and cell biology in the
Medical School and professor of dentistry in the School of Dentistry, will
retire from active faculty status on January 5, 1998.
After attending Kalamazoo College from 1959-62, Dr. Lillie received
D.D.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1966,
1969, and 1972, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in
1972 as an assistant professor in the Medical School and in the School of
Dentistry. He was promoted to associate professor of dentistry in 1978,
associate professor of anatomy in 1979, professor of anatomy in 1985, and
professor of dentistry in 1991. From 1989-91 he also served as interim
assistant dean for pre doctoral education in the School of Dentistry.
Dr. Lillie has had a distinguished career as a gross anatomist, having
applied his clinical knowledge of dentistry to undergraduate and graduate
dental teaching in a number of anatomy courses. He is an acknowledged
expert in this field, and his recent book, Sectional Anatomy of the Head and
Neck, is a real testimony to his skills and impact in that area. Also extremely
effective in the classroom, Dr. Lillie has received eight awards for his dental
teaching.
For many years, Dr. Lillie directed an important research program on
basement membrane biology. Most recently, he coordinated the electron
microscopy component of a groundbreaking study involving the digital
electron microscopic imaging and montaging of human nerve biopsies.
During his tenure as interim assistant dean, Dr. Lillie played a very
influential role in the administration of the School of Dentistry. He has also
served the University well in the sphere of administration at other levels.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his
dedicated service by naming John H. Lillie, professor emeritus of anatomy
and cell biology and professor emeritus of dentistry.

until 1989, and as a lecturer in the University of Michigan Department of
Psychology. He was promoted to associate professor in 1961, received tenure
in 1963, and was promoted to professor in 1966. He has also held visiting
appointments at universities around the globe.
Professor Manis is one of the leading scholars in the area of attitudes and
social judgment. He has made outstanding contributions to our understanding
of human judgmental processes in 2 books, numerous chapters, and more than
60 peer-reviewed research articles. His work covers a wide range of judgmental
phenomena, including the operation of standards, the emergence of assimilation
and contrast effects, the role of stereotypes and prejudice in person perception,
and the cognitive processes involved in assessing psychopathology. Several of
his papers have become classic citations in cognitive social psychology. His
outstanding reputation in the field is also reflected in his appointment as editor
of the Attitudes and Social Cognition Section of the Journal of Personality and
Social Psychology (1979-84), the most prestigious journal in personality and
social psychology.
Professor Manis has served on numerous committees for national
professional and governmental organizations. Within the University, he has

December Meeting, 1997


George W. Morley, M.D., Norman F. Miller Professor of Gynecology
and professor of obstetrics and gynecology, will retire from active faculty
status on December 31, 1997.
Dr. Morley earned his B.S. (1944), M.D. (1949), and M.S. (1955) degrees and
completed his internship and residency training (1949-54), at the University of
Michigan. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1956 as an instructor
in obstetrics and gynecology. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1958,
associate professor in 1961, and professor in 1970. He became chief of the
Gynecologic Oncology Service in 1964 and director of the Gynecologic Oncology
Fellowship, which he initiated, in 1971. In 1987, he was named the first Norman
F. Miller Professor of Gynecology.
Dr. Morley is one of America's most distinguished gynecologic surgeons.
Board certified in obstetrics and gynecology in 1958 and in gynecologic oncology
in 1974, his academic pursuits have spanned the full breadth of obstetrics and
gynecology. He is best known for his work as a surgeon for benign and
malignant gynecologic disease. Dr. Morley's bibliography lists over 110 articles
and 15 book chapters, including major contributions on radical hysterectomy
and radical vulvectomy. He is best known for his work establishing the role of
pelvic exenteration in the treatment of recurrent cancer of the cervix. This
series has the highest five-year survival rate reported in the literature and
remains a landmark of success in treating recurrent pelvic neoplasm.
Dr. Morley has been elected president of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Pelvic Surgeons, the Society of
Gynecologic Oncologists, the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons, and the Norman
F. Miller Gynecologic Society. He has also served as a member of the board of
governors of the American College of Surgeons. He has three times been listed
as among America's ten best obstetricians and gynecologists.
In the operating room, Dr. Morley was not only a firm master, but also a
patient teacher, assuring that all members of the surgical team learned both
the fundamental principles and the final nuances of operative gynecology. He
is also an excellent lecturer and discussant. In recognition of Dr. Morley's
contributions, in 1993 the Gynecologic Oncology Service at the University of
Michigan Medical Center was named the George W. Morley Service. After an
extraordinarily short campaign, the George W. Morley Collegiate
Professorship was established.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physician and teacher by
naming George W. Morley the Norman F. Miller Professor Emeritus of
Gynecology and professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology.
Elizabeth Mutschler, associate professor of social work, will retire
from active faculty status on December 31, 1997.
Professor Mutschler received her Diploma in Social Work from the
School of Social Work in Ludwigsburg, Germany, in 1968, and received her
M.S.W. and Ph.D. degrees in 1972 and 1975, respectively, from Washington
University. From 1975-78, she served on the faculty of the University of
Maryland at Baltimore. She joined the University of Michigan School of
Social Work as an assistant professor in 1979 and was promoted to associate
professor in 1984.
Professor Mutschler's scholarly contributions have centered on three
areas: analysis of treatment procedures and therapists' behaviors that facilitate


192




December Meeting, 1997


client change; evaluation of factors related to therapists' use of empirical
procedures in clinical practice; and technology-based decision support and
information processing to help therapists identify treatment objectives and
monitor outcomes. Her work is highly-regarded, particularly her important
contributions on clinical evaluation and her activities in computer-assisted
decision-making. She conducted a landmark study of factors associated with
therapists' use of empirical procedures in clinical agency settings, and has
made groundbreaking advances in adapting computer technology to enhance
clinical decision-making. She continues to be an international leader in
computer technology for social work.
Within the School of Social Work, Professor Mutschler is known for
setting high standards in the classroom and for promoting the use of
computers in social work courses and practice. Her considerable service
contributions include her work on the University Research Priorities
Committee and on the Senate Assembly. She has assisted with management
information systems development at area hospitals and has conducted
workshops on technology for faculty and students. Professor Mutschler is
truly a pioneer, having forged significant new paths of learning and having
worked tirelessly to assist social workers around the world in achieving the
best possible modes of practice.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Elizabeth Mutschler associate professor emerita of social work.
Catherine A. Nadon-Gabrion, professor of music (music education) in
the School of Music and lecturer in education in the School of Education, will
retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1997.
Professor Nadon-Gabrion earned her B.Mus. (1962) and M.Mus (1966)
degrees at the New England Conservatory of Music and her Ed.D. degree in
1979 at the University of Massachusetts. From 1962-68 she was a public
school music teacher in Massachusetts. She served as assistant professor of
music at Westfield State College from 1968-72 and as coordinator of general
and choral music in the Montgomery County (Maryland) Public Schools from
1972-77. She joined the faculty of the University of Michigan as associate
professor of music in 1977 and was promoted to professor in 1994.
Professor Nadon-Gabrion was a dedicated teacher of teaching-herself
manifesting all of that profession's generous impulses and controversial
history in research universities. She well understands the challenges of
teaching in the public schools and is committed to providing realism,
relevance, and idealism in courses designed for prospective teachers. She
practiced "hands on" education and was immensely concerned for the
progress of students under her tutelage. She maintained that elusive balance
between a nurturing, supportive rapport versus requisite honesty in
evaluation of students' work. She was an energetic motivator.
Professor Nadon-Gabrion built a formidable reputation on practical
applications of strategies for successful teaching in general music classrooms
in public schools. Her numerous textbooks reached a sizable percentage of
elementary students in the United States. Partially as a result of the
prominence brought about by this authorship, Professor Nadon-Gabrion is in
constant demand as a speaker at music education conferences, school
districts, and sister institutions of higher education. Since 1990, she has led


193




December Meeting, 1997


workshops, lectured, and consulted in 21 states and in Germany, Japan,
Panama, and South Korea. Her energy and enthusiasm capture a crowd, and
teachers have returned to their classrooms enriched and invigorated.
Professor Nadon-Gabrion has made far-reaching contributions within her
profession.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Catherine A. Nadon-Gabrion professor emerita of music (music education).

reduced to 50% so that she may serve as VisiTek's principal investigator for
the project.
4.  Zongnan Lu is an employee of the University with a 100% appointment. In
addition to his work at the University, Mr. Lu will perform work for VisiTek
on the project up to 16 hours per week at a pay rate of $25.00 per hour.
Establishment of School of Education and Human Services at
UM-Flint
Chancellor Nelms observed that the proposed changes reflect the
maturation of the University of Michigan-Flint, from its founding in 1965 as
a liberal arts college to its current configuration that includes a number of
professional programs. He noted that currently, education is the single
largest major on the campus and that the Flint campus is the largest
provider of teachers for the Flint/Mid-Michigan region of the state. Creation
of the School of Education and Human Services will allow the campus to
respond more effectively to the needs of the urban environment in which the
campus is located.
He noted that faculty consultation will continue to be sought as the new
structure is implemented and announced that the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation has made a commitment of $1.5 million to implement the new
structure.  This grant will provide administrative support and faculty
positions, enabling the campus to improve its service learning programs.
President Bollinger commented that the Ann Arbor campus fully
supports this proposal. Regent McFee inquired whether the "Communities
in Schools" program is active in the city of Flint. Chancellor Nelms
responded that one of the faculty positions to be funded by the program will
serve as a resource to the community. He noted that a number of
community leaders in Flint had visited schools in other states to see how the
community education movement operates. He said he anticipates that a
community education initiative will be announced in the coming months that
would be similar to, but somewhat different from, the original community
education movement. He noted that this movement had been started in
Flint and funded by the Mott Foundation about 25 years ago.
Regent Maynard observed that it is important that institutions in an
urban setting are relevant to the community, and that the new initiative was
very exciting in this regard.


197




December Meeting, 1997


Regent McGowan moved that the faculties of the Department of
Education and the Department of Social Work (both currently in the College

President Bollinger stated that he is proposing creation of the position
of vice president and general counsel, to be appointed by the Board of
Regents on the recommendation of the president and reporting directly to
the president. To the extent that the Bylaws need to be amended to
incorporate this position and to define its authority, amendments will be
proposed as part of the current process of Bylaws revision.
Regent Newman moved approval of creation of the position of vice
president and general counsel. Regent Horning seconded the motion, and it
was approved unanimously.

Medical School Sesquicentennial
Regent Power called on Regent McFee, who noted that she was very
pleased to be able to read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
One hundred and fifty years ago, on January 19, 1848, the
Regents of the University of Michigan officially established the
University of Michigan Medical School. In so doing, our predecessors
not only acknowledged the University's developing strength in the
biomedical sciences, they anticipated the broader community's future
needs for excellence in medical education and research and for
outstanding medical care.
The University of Michigan Medical School and its parent, the
University of Michigan Health System, are today among the nation's
finest. We congratulate the Medical School for its rich heritage and
note with pleasure its prospects for future excellence.
There followed a round of applause, after which Executive Vice President
Omenn noted that he had invited some leaders of the Medical Center to attend
the meeting. He introduced former Medical School deans William Hubbard
(1959-70) and Giles Bole (1990-96), and former vice provost for health affairs
Rhetaugh Dumas (1994-97). He noted that Dr. James Neel had planned to
attend, but was ill. He noted that Dr. Neel had begun his tenure as a Medical
School faculty member during the school's centennial, 50 years ago, and that he
personally considered Dr. Neel's career to have been one of the most
distinguished in American medicine, and especially in the field of human
genetics.


199




January Meeting, 1998


Executive Vice President Omenn read the following remarks that Dr.
Neel had prepared:
It is an extraordinary privilege to say a few words concerning
the upcoming 150th anniversary celebration of our medical school
during the academic year 1999-2000. I suspect my presence as a
faculty spokesperson stems from the fact that I am one of the few
medical school faculty who has been active here during the 50 years
since we celebrated the centennial, and so have personally witnessed
the developments during this period. We carried a proud tradition
of excellence and innovation into the 1950 celebration, and I believe
you'll find that tradition alive and well for the 150th.
Executive Vice President Omenn noted that he will keep the Regents
informed of plans for celebration of the sesquicentennial as they materialize.
He also reviewed some of the history of the Medical School, noting that one
of the original members of the Board of Regents, Dr. Zina Pitcher, had been
a leader in its founding.

Retirement Memoirs.     Provost Cantor submitted four retirement

Gerald E. Crane, professor of urban planning in the College of
Architecture and Urban Planning, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 1997.
Born and raised in London, Professor Crane received a Graduate
Architect degree in 1950 from South West Essex Technical College, a
Certificate and Diploma in Town Planning and Civic Architecture in 1954
from University College, and a Master of Regional Planning Degree in 1955
from Cornell University. He held the position of senior lecturer from
1960-66 at Wayne State University and served in visiting capacities at
Cornell, Syracuse, Michigan State, University of London, University of
Illinois, and University of Florida before joining the University of Michigan
faculty in 1966 as adjunct professor of Planning. He was promoted to
professor in 1967 and served as chair of the Urban Planning Program from
1968-76.
Professor Crane has had an outstanding career as an educator teaching
graduate-level courses in urban design. His innovative teaching methods
have involved direct field work in the underdeveloped areas of Detroit. He is
a registered architect in Michigan and the United Kingdom, a registered
town planner in the United Kingdom, a registered professional community
planner in Michigan and a chartered town planner in the United Kingdom.
He has been an active member of the American Institute of Architects and of
many other professional organizations. His personal commitment to professional organizations serving the architecture and planning professions was
passionately communicated to his students who represented the future of these
professions.
In recognition of his leadership in the field of urban planning, Professor
Crane received the Charles A. Blessing Award from the Detroit Chapter of the
American Institute of Architects in 1992. Prior to becoming the chair of the
Urban Planning Program in 1968, he had been president of Crane & Gorwic, a
Detroit firm that planned many large projects in southeastern Michigan and the
Midwest. Among these were the Detroit Medical Center, the Elmwood Park
residential district east of downtown Detroit, and Professional Plaza on Woodward Avenue. He continued his consulting while a member of the faculty, and
this active involvement brought currency and vigor, as well as a healthy dose of
reality, to his pedagogy.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Gerald E. Crane professor emeritus of urban planning.

January Meeting, 1998


of North Carolina, the University of Colorado, Syracuse University, and the
University of California at Berkeley before joining the University of Michigan
faculty in 1978 as director of the University Library and professor of library
science. Professor Dougherty also served as acting dean of the School of
Library Science (now known as the School of Information) from 1984-85.
Professor Dougherty has been a compelling and forceful advocate of core
values in librarianship throughout his extensive professional career. As
president of the American Library Association from 1990-91, he helped bring
information access issues to the attention of the general public and mounted
a literacy and reading campaign for children. As academic library director at
the University of Michigan, he spearheaded initiatives which resulted in
computerized access to the library's catalogs. As an educator, Professor
Dougherty engaged his students in critical thinking and dialog concerning issues
of professional management, ethics, and values. As publisher of leading journals
in academic librarianship, he provided an important venue for discussion and
dissemination of library issues and developments. He is internationally
recognized for his vision and articulation of key challenges confronting academic
libraries and has been active as a speaker and consultant in national and
international venues.
Professor Dougherty has received numerous honors during his career.
Most recently he was honored with the Joseph Lippincott Award at the
American Library Association's annual meeting in July 1997. In 1988 he
was honored as the first recipient of the Hugh C. Atkinson Memorial Award
given by ALA. In addition to his extensive involvement with the ALA,
including service as president, Professor Dougherty has been highly involved
with numerous other professional groups. He has also received two honorary
degrees: from Purdue University in 1991 and from Stellenbosch University,
South Africa, in 1995.

Richard M. Dougherty professor emeritus of information.
John W. Wright, associate professor of English language and literature
in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, retired from active faculty
status on December 31, 1997.
Professor Wright received his B.A. degree from Hobart College in 1955,
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Rochester in 1961 and
1967, respectively. He came to the University of Michigan in 1963 as an
instructor, and was promoted to assistant professor in 1965 and associate
professor in 1970.
Professor Wright was a specialist in romanticism, with a special
emphasis on poetry and the visual arts. He published Shelley's Myth of
Metaphor in 1970. He has also published essays on Borges, Hawthorne, and
Johnson, as well as numerous essays and analyses of Blake's prints and
poetry. His lifelong passion has been the interrelationship between the
poetry and etchings of the late eighteenth-century, early nineteenth-century
visionary poet, William Blake; for the past 25 years, his research has focused
on Blake's printmaking techniques. Professor Wright's knowledge of Blake's
unique technical methods for printmaking is unsurpassed. He received an
American Council on Learned Societies fellowship in 1971-72 and a National
Endowment for the Humanities fellowship in 1976-77 to study etching,


219




January Meeting, 1998


printmaking and the graphic arts at the Slade School of Art, London. He
also received numerous Rackham Faculty Research Grants in aid of his work
on Blake. He was consultant for the King's College/Scholar Press facsimile
edition of Blake's 1826 Songs of Innocence and Experience. He served as
consultant to the composer William Bolcom for his song series, William
Blake's Songs (1986), and also curated two special exhibits of the works of
William Blake for the Hatcher Graduate Library.
In addition to teaching "Introduction to Poetry," the English department's
prerequisite for the major, and a variety of survey courses, Professor Wright
was best known for two much-loved upper-division courses. His course on Blake
has remained an important and popular fixture among the department's
offerings; he has passed on to generations of students his understanding and
passion for Blake's artistic vision. Equally important has been Professor
Wright's course, "Creative Writing and the Other Arts," in which he has
generously supported a wide variety of student creative projects. His tireless
advocacy on behalf of students has endeared him to many who have felt lost
in a large university.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
John W. Wright associate professor emeritus of English language and
literature.
Karl L. Zinn, research scientist in the Information Technology Division,
retired from active faculty status on October 6, 1997.
Dr. Zinn received his B.A. degree from Swarthmore College in 1959 and
his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1962 and
1964, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1963 as a
research associate in the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching
(CRLT) and lecturer in psychology. He was promoted to research scientist in
1969 and maintained that title until his retirement.  He joined the
Information Technology Division in 1995.
Dr. Zinn's first assignment in CRLT was to help faculty with problems
related to testing and evaluation and to investigate the possible role of
computers in teaching. He soon became one of the best informed individuals in
America in the area of computer-assisted instruction, establishing connections
with other research centers and setting up demonstration projects using
access to the experimental computer systems at IBM, Dartmouth and the
University of Illinois. During this time, he wrote a proposal to the State of
Michigan for collaborative work among major universities which resulted in
a planning grant for a state-wide network. He also wrote the proposal to the
National Science Foundation that led to the Merit computer network. Dr.
Zinn became the associate director of Merit and had a number of grants and
contracts to promote its use for instructional purposes. One of these projects
produced specifications for education programming languages which were
adopted widely in North America.
Among other accomplishments at the University of Michigan, Dr. Zinn has
introduced computer graphics; put the first interactive programming language
on MTS; programmed simulations and academic games for instruction; and set
up the first computer-based conferencing system on campus. More recently, he
introduced faculty and students to Gopher and the World Wide Web and has
continued consulting with faculty members in developing courses or new uses of
resources found on the Web. Within the Information Technology Division, he
220

has provided invaluable support in building relationships with the schools and
colleges and in creating technology-based partnerships with the deans.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Karl L. Zinn

be realized by refinancing the Hospital Revenue and Medical Service Plan
Revenue Bonds described in the Regents Communication should be considered


221

only as illustrative of the magnitude of savings being sought. The actual
savings will be dependent on the market conditions at the time of
refinancing.
Regent McFee moved that:
The Regents adopt the following resolution authorizing the executive
vice president and chief financial officer to issue Hospital Revenue or
Medical Service Plan Revenue Refunding Bonds to refinance all or a portion
of the Hospital 1986A, Hospital 1990, or the MSP 1991 Bonds, or a
combination of them, and:
1.  Develop the terms and legal documentation for the refinancing with
the assistance of the underwriter and outside legal counsel.
2.  Complete and distribute preliminary and final official statements
describing the University, the activities of the Hospital and the
Medical Service Plan, the revenue flow providing the security for the
refunding bonds, and the structure of the bonds.
3.  Solicit the rating of the bonds from Moody's Investors Service and
Standard & Poor's Corporation.
4.   Obtain a final proposal for the bonds and any derivatives.

the underwriters, Derivative Agreements with counterparties to be
selected, Trust Indentures with trustees to be selected, Escrow
Agreements with escrow agents to be selected, any agreements
required for the remarketing and liquidity of any variable rate bonds
issued, and execute and deliver the bonds, all within the limitations
of the attached resolution.
Regent Horning seconded the motion. Regent McFee observed that it is
very gratifying to note that people are watching the University's finances
and the opportunities to enhance them as closely as is evidenced by this
proposal.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Regents of the University
of Michigan, as follows:
1. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery under the
Master Indenture of hospital revenue bonds of the Issuer (herein called the "Hospital
Bonds") in one or more series to be designated as shall be determined by an
Authorized Officer (but which designation shall include the words "HOSPITAL
REVENUE REFUNDING BONDS") with appropriate series designations, in the
aggregate original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but
not to exceed the principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of $97,000,000, to
be dated as of the date or dates established by an Authorized Officer, for the purpose
of providing funds which, together with other available funds, may be used to pay all
or a portion of the costs of refunding the Hospital Refunded Bonds and to pay costs
incidental to the issuance of the Hospital Bonds and to the refunding. The Hospital
Bonds shall be serial bonds, or term bonds, which may be subject to redemption
requirements, or both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first
maturity shall be not earlier than June 1, 1998 and the last maturity shall be no later
223




January Meeting, 1998


than December 1, 2027. The Hospital Bonds may bear no interest or may bear
interest at stated fixed rates for the respective maturities thereof as shall be
established by an Authorized Officer, but the highest fixed rate of interest for any
maturity shall not exceed 6% per annum, and the Bonds may be issued in whole or in
part as capital appreciation bonds, which for their term or any part thereof bear no
interest but appreciate in principal amount over time at compounded rate (not in
excess of 6% per annum) to be determined by an Authorized Officer. Alternatively,
all or part of the Hospital Bonds may bear interest at a variable rate of interest for all
or a portion of their term, and the variable rate of interest shall not exceed the
maximum rate permitted by law. In addition, all or part of the Bonds may be issued
in related series, one of which bears interest at a variable rate and one of which bears
interest at a residual rate determined by subtracting the variable rate from the fixed
rate paid by the Issuer, but the combined rate on such Hospital Bonds, taking the two
related series together, which shall be determined by an Authorized Officer, shall not
exceed 6% per annum. The Hospital Bonds may be subject to redemption or call for
purchase prior to maturity at the times and prices and in the manner as shall be
established by an Authorized Officer. The average annual scheduled principal and
interest requirements on the Hospital Bonds, taking into account any swap or other
arrangements described below, and assuming the variable rate on any Hospital Bonds
not also subject to a swap or other arrangement, and not issued as part of related
series as described above, is equal to 6% per annum, shall not exceed $10,000,000.
Interest on the Hospital Bonds shall be payable at the times as shall be specified by
an Authorized Officer. The Hospital Bonds shall be issued in filly registered form in
denominations, shall be payable as to principal and interest in the manner, shall be
subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be executed and authenticated, all as shall
be provided in the Series Indenture. The Hospital Bonds shall be sold to the
Underwriter pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement for a price to be established
by an Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of original issue
discount, shall not exceed 0.8% of the principal amount thereof) plus accrued interest,
if any, from the dated date of the Hospital Bonds to the date of delivery thereof. In
connection with the issuance of the Hospital Bonds, either of the Authorized Officers
may, on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into an interest rate swap, cap or
similar agreement or agreements (collectively, the "Hospital Swap Agreement") with
a counter-party or counter-parties to be selected by the Authorized Officer. Such
Hospital Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the Issuer and the
counter-party related to interest on the Hospital Bonds or indexed or market
established rates. The expected effective interest rates on the Hospital Bonds, taking
into account the effect of the Hospital Swap Agreement, shall be within the
limitations set forth herein.
Any or all of the Hospital Bonds may be made subject to tender for
purchase at the option of the holder thereof. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase
any such bonds made subject to tender options may be made payable from available
cash reserves of the University, subject to limitation to the amount of certain assets of
the Hospital, or may be made payable from a letter of credit, line of credit or other
liquidity device ("the Hospital Liquidity Device"), all as shall be determined by an
Authorized Officer and provided for in the Series Indenture. Any reimbursement
obligation for draws under the Hospital Liquidity Device shall be a limited and not
general obligation of the Issuer, payable from Hospital Gross Revenues and may be
secured by a pledge of Pledged Hospital Gross Revenues. Either Authorized Officer is
authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any agreements or
instruments necessary to obtain, and provide for repayments under, any Hospital
Liquidity Device deemed by such officer to be required for the purposes of this
Resolution. Purchase obligations shall not be considered as "principal and interest
requirements" hereunder.

service plan revenue bonds of the Issuer (herein called the "MSP Bonds") in one or
more series to be designated as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer (but
which designation shall include the words "MEDICAL SERVICE PLAN REVENUE
REFUNDING BONDS"), with appropriate series designations, in the aggregate
original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but not to
exceed the principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of $60,000,000, to be
dated as of the date or dates established by an Authorized Officer, for the purpose of

shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first maturity shall be not earlier

at a variable rate of interest for all or a portion of their term, and the variable rate of
interest shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by law. In addition, all or part
of the MSP Bonds may be issued in related series, one of which bears interest at a
variable rate and one of which bears interest at a residual rate determined by
subtracting the variable rate from the fixed rate paid by the Issuer, but the combined
rate on such MSP Bonds, taking the two related series together, which shall be
determined by an Authorized Officer, shall not exceed 6% per annum. The MSP
Bonds may be subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the
times and prices and in the manner as shall be established by an Authorized Officer.
The average annual principal and interest requirements on the MSP Bonds, taking
into account any swap or other arrangements described below, and assuming the
variable rate on any MSP Bonds not also subject to a swap or other arrangement, and
not issued as part of related series as described above, is equal to 6% per annum, shall
not exceed $5,500,000. Interest on the MSP Bonds shall be payable at the times as

registered form in denominations, shall be payable as to principal and interest in the

authenticated, all as shall be provided in the MSP Indenture. The MSP Bonds shall
be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement for a price to
be established by an Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of
original issue discount, shall not exceed 0.8% of the principal amount thereof) plus
accrued interest, if any, from the dated date of the MSP Bonds to the date of delivery
thereof. In connection with the issuance of the MSP Bonds, either of the Authorized
Officers may, on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into an interest rate
swap, cap or similar agreement or agreements (collectively, the "MSP Swap
Agreement") with a counterparty or counterparties to be selected by the Authorized
Officer. Such MSP Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the Issuer
and the counterparty related to interest on the MSP Bonds or indexed or market
established rates. The expected effective interest rates on the MSP Bonds, taking
into account the effect of the MSP Swap Agreement, shall be within the limitations
set forth herein.
Any or all of the MSP Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the
option of the holder thereof. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any such MSP
Bonds made subject to tender options may be made payable from available cash
reserves of the University, subject to limitation to the amount of certain assets of the
Medical Service Plan or the Medical School, or may be made payable from a letter of
credit, line of credit or other liquidity device (the "MSP Liquidity Device"), all as shall
be determined by an Authorized Officer and provided for in the MSP Indenture. Any
reimbursement obligation for draws under the MSP Liquidity Device shall be a
limited and not general obligation of the Issuer payable from Medical Service Plan
Revenues and may be secured by a pledge of Medical Service Plan Revenues. Either
Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the
Issuer, any agreements or instruments necessary to obtain, and provide for
repayments under, any MSP Liquidity Device deemed by such officer to be required
for the purposes of this Resolution. Purchase obligations shall not be considered as

227




January Meeting, 1998


in Harbor Springs, Michigan, and authorized the sale of the property, as
described in the Regents Communication.
President Bollinger arrived at this point, at 2:20 p.m.
Secretary of the University
President Bollinger described a recommendation to expand the duties of
Walter L. Harrison, vice president for university relations, to include the
function of secretary of the university and to change his title accordingly. He
noted that Roberta Palmer has been serving as secretary since 1995 and had
served admirably in that role, and said that she would be assuming a new role
as special advisor to him. President Bollinger observed that the position had
been constructed to include both roles prior to Ms. Palmer's appointment, and
this would be a return to the former structure.
Regent McFee moved that the position of secretary of the university be
combined with the position of vice president for university relations and that
Walter L. Harrison be appointed vice president for university relations and
secretary of the university, effective January 1, 1998. Regent Power seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Public Comments
There were no speakers wishing to address the Regents.
Closed Session
President Bollinger stated that the Regents would now meet in closed
session to consider the periodic personnel evaluations of two employees
pursuant to their request under section 8(a) of the Open Meetings Act. The
meeting then continued in executive session from 2:25-6:30 p.m.
Friday, January 16, 1998
The meeting convened at 9:45 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
Regents Horning, Maynard, McFee, McGowan, Newman, and Power. Also
present were Executive Vice President Kasdin, Executive Vice President
Omenn, Provost Cantor, Vice President and Secretary Harrison, Chancellor
Nelms, Chancellor Renick, and Interim Co-General Counsel Barry. Regent
Taylor, Regent Deitch, Vice Presidents Hartford, Kinnear, and Neidhardt
were absent.
Resolution in Honor of 1997 Michigan Wolverine Football Team
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and called on Regent
Horning. Regent Horning introduced Coach Lloyd Carr and Co-Captain Jon
Jansen to the assembly. He observed that in the locker room following the
Rose Bowl victory, Coach Carr and the others who spoke to the team had
stressed their pride in representing the University, rather than emphasizing
their own individual achievements. He then offered the following resolution:


228




January Meeting, 1998


Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend the 1997
Michigan Wolverine football team for its perfect 12-0 season, which
culminated in a 21-16 Rose Bowl victory over Washington State
University.
In their come-from-behind win in Pasadena, players and coaches
again displayed the tenacity, discipline, and resiliency they had shown
throughout the season. Ranked number one during the final month of
the regular season, the Wolverines were named national champions in
the Associated Press Top 25 poll, resulting in the University's first
national football championship in 50 years and the Big Ten's first
such title since 1968.
All-American junior Charles Woodson also made history when he
became the first primarily defensive player to win the Heisman
Trophy. With his agility, speed, and personal drive, Charles Woodson,
also the winner of the Walter Camp Football Foundation's Player of
the Year Award, left no doubt that he is college football's most
outstanding player.
Demonstrating the qualities of perseverance, determination, and
poise that he has exhibited all season, quarterback Brian Griese
earned the Rose Bowl's Most Valuable Player Award. An exemplary
student athlete, he also received an NCAA Today's Top VIII Award,
recognizing his achievements in athletics, academics, character, and
leadership, and was one of six team members to garner Academic All
Big Ten honors.
Finally, the Regents commend Coach Lloyd Carr, winner of five
coach-of-the-year awards, including those from the Walter Camp
Football Foundation and the American Football Coaches Association.
In the best tradition of Michigan football, he stressed the importance of
acting with integrity and setting and achieving goals on and off the
field, while also continually emphasizing the importance of the team
over individual players. A gifted motivator, he inspired players and
fans alike and made believers out of skeptics across the nation.
Following the Rose Bowl game, Coach Carr stated, "I don't think
anyone could ask any more of a team than what they gave." The
Regents express their wholehearted agreement and salute the entire
football team: the coaches; the captains, Jon Jansen and Eric Mayes;
and each and every one of the players, all of whom have contributed so
vitally to the hallowed tradition of Michigan football. Hail to the victors!
There followed a standing ovation, after which Coach Carr responded
that it was important to him to have a football team the Regents, alumni,
and Michigan residents can be proud of. Co-Captain Jon Jansen thanked


229




January Meeting, 1998


people for their continued support and noted that the support had been very
important to the players, both this year and in previous seasons.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Environmental Interpretive Center
Chancellor Renick noted that the environmental interpretive center is
an important component of the campus' academic program and institutional
strategy. He called on Mr. Doug Hanna, University architect.
Mr. Hanna noted that the Regents had previously approved the project,
architect, and site, and that approval was now being requested for the proposed
design and a revised budget. He gave a presentation including a site plan,
renderings of the exterior and interior, and an architectural model.
Following some discussion, Regent Horning moved approval of the
proposed design and revised budget for the UM-Dearborn Environmental
Interpretive Center. Regent McFee seconded the motion. The vote was then
taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Field House Addition
Mr. Hanna gave a presentation describing the proposed design of an
addition to the University of Michigan-Dearborn Field House, including a
computer-generated rendering of the proposed design.
Following some discussion, Regent McGowan moved approval of the
proposed design for the UM-Dearborn Field House Addition. Regent McFee
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan-Dearborn General Campus Renovation Project
Phase II: College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters (CASL) Building
Component
Chancellor Renick informed the Regents of the principal design
objectives that have been identified for the College of Arts, Sciences, and
Letters (CASL) building component.
University of Michigan-Flint Campus Master Plan
Chancellor Nelms stated that the Regents are being asked to approve
the incorporation of the 25-acre parcel on the north side of the Flint River
(previously known as the AutoWorld property) into the University of
Michigan-Flint Master Plan.
He noted that input had been received from faculty, staff, and members
of the community. The goal is for the University of Michigan-Flint to have
one campus, as opposed to a north campus and south campus or any other
type of separate campus arrangement. He said that development of the site
will be driven by the academic needs of the campus and the region over a 20
to 25-year period of time. He called on Mr. Fred Mayer, university planner,
to present the proposed plan.
Mr. Mayer reviewed the University's general approach to planning,
noting that the current approach evolved during the 1960s and involves
developing a master plan that provides a broad conceptual framework for the
230




January Meeting, 1998


physical growth of the campus while incorporating the flexibility needed to
make changes based on fluctuating enrollments, changing academic programming
needs, and technological developments. Decisions on individual building projects
are made on a specific, project-by-project, basis. As academic programming needs
become identified, these are compared to potential developable sites, and
recommendations are then made for specific sites for particular projects.
Architectural details are brought to the Board once an architect has been
identified and has consulted with those who will be using the building and
developing the program.
Mr. Mayer displayed diagrams of the original plan, developed in the
1970s, along with the 1983 and 1992 updates. The purpose of the current
discussion is to incorporate the recently acquired AutoWorld property into
the plan, making it into one cohesive campus. He introduced Richard
Rigterrink, of Johnson Johnson & Roy, Inc., the Flint Campus' planning
consultant, to review the proposed master plan update.
Mr. Rigterrink observed that the master plan needs to incorporate
flexibility, as well as a physical framework within which that flexibility can
occur. He noted that until now, the campus has grown in an east-west
configuration. Incorporating the property north of the Flint River provides
an opportunity to make the river a focal point.
Mr. Rigterrink displayed a map of the proposed 1998 Master Plan that
incorporates the AutoWorld site. He pointed out that land adjacent to the
river is not owned by the University; it is a flood plain managed by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, and cannot be built upon. He noted that the plan
would include changing both the type and direction of traffic on the three
existing city streets and bridges that cross the campus, including changing
Harrison Street from a one-way to a two-way street in the campus area and
possibly transferring ownership of this street to the University.
Mr. Rigterrink stressed that a major emphasis of the plan is to bring the
community to campus. He displayed a map indicating future development
sites, pointing out that there are underground utilities corridors underneath
the AutoWorld property that cannot be built upon but that could be used for
roads and open spaces. It was emphasized that the building zones indicate
areas within which buildings can be placed, not actual buildings or building
footprints. The plan also indicates three possible areas that could be used for
parking.
Following some discussion, Regent Newman moved approval of
incorporation of the AutoWorld property into the existing campus master
plan, to be known as the 1998 Master Plan Update, according to the
presentation at the meeting. Regent Horning seconded the motion. There
was further discussion about the area on the north shore of the river that
constitutes the flood plain maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers.
Regent Newman stated that she fully supports the plan and that her
questions were meant not as criticism, but rather as a means for gaining a
better understanding of all of the issues.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.


231




January Meeting, 1998


University of Michigan-Flint Professional Studies and Classroom
Building (PS&CB) Project
Chancellor Nelms presented exterior design objectives for the PS&CB
project. This project, which had been approved by the Board in April 1997,
involves construction of a new building on the Flint campus. Regent Power
urged that closer attention be paid to the program characteristics prior to
discussion of exterior design elements and elevation in future projects.
University of Michigan-Flint Professional Studies and Classroom
Building
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent McGowan, the
Regents unanimously approved an increase in scope of the Professional
Studies and Classroom Building to incorporate a multimedia instructional
center.
Michigan Health Corporation (MHC)/Annual Business Plan
Executive Vice President Omenn announced that the MHC board had
unanimously approved a 1997-98 Business Plan and submitted it for
approval by the Board. Regent McFee requested that as the plan is
implemented, the Board continue to be apprised of MHC's activities. Regent
Power noted that it would be helpful if future plans would address the
objectives the MHC is trying to reach and how it plans to achieve these
objectives.
There being no further discussion, on a motion by Regent Power,
seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents unanimously approved the Michigan
Health Corporation's 1997-98 Business Plan and authorized MHC to take all
action necessary and appropriate to operate MHC.
Henry Russel Awards for 1998
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved the selection of Susan E. Alcock, associate
professor of classical archaeology and classics, and Trevor D. Wooley,
associate professor of mathematics, as 1998 Henry Russel Award recipients.
Recommendation for Appointments to Medical Staff Membership
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Horning, and on
the recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive
Board, the Regents unanimously approved certain specified appointments to
medical staff membership.
Presidential Salary
Regent Power made the following motion:
Lee C. Bollinger became president of the University of Michigan
on February 1, 1997. The letter of engagement between the Regents
and President Bollinger called for annual performance reviews. The
Regents have now undertaken this review.


232




January Meeting, 1998


The results were unanimous and outstanding.    President
Bollinger's performance in office has met, and in all instances,
exceeded our expectations.
Consequently, I move that his annual base salary be increased by
4.5%, from $275,000 per year to $287,375, effective February 1, 1998
and running through August 31, 1998, at which time another
performance review will take place so as to put any adjustments in the
president's salary on the same cycle as for other University of Michigan
employees.
I understand that the consolidated salary schedules of all other
University of Michigan employees will also be released to the public
today.
Regent McFee seconded the motion.
Regent Power observed that Regent Deitch had participated in
yesterday's performance review session and could not be present at today's
meeting, but had asked him to read into the record his views:
I regret not being here this morning; I've had a client commitment
arise which I could not rearrange. I enthusiastically support the
decision on President Bollinger's salary. He has done a superlative job
this past year.
Regent McFee commented that the evaluation had concluded that the
president had not only lived up to the Board's expectation, but had exceeded
them in all respects.
Regent McGowan observed that one of the paramount requirements and
expectations of the new president was in the area of his personnel appointments.
She pointed to the newly appointed executive officers at the table as evidence of
his skills in the area, and noted that the evaluation of the president's
performance had taken into account the exceptional appointments he had made.
Regent Newman stated that she concurs in the evaluation and commends
President Bollinger for his leadership, his appointments, and his vision.
However, she disagrees with the percentage increase that had been decided
upon, and stressed that her plan to vote against the salary increase in no way
reflects her admiration for his performance over the past year.
Regent Homing expressed agreement with the others' opinions of the
president's performance. He noted that one of the factors in his selection as
president had been that he would be able to "hit the ground running," and that
the president had indeed done that. He said that he intended to support the
salary increase, although he would like to have these kept more in line with
inflation.
Regent Maynard observed that even though she and Regent Taylor had
not been members of the Board when President Bollinger had been selected,
they were very pleased with the decision. His vision and energy have been
most valuable to the University community.


233




January Meeting, 1998


President Bollinger thanked the Regents for their comments and
expressed how wonderful his experience as president had been so far.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved, with Regents
Horning, Maynard, McFee, McGowan, and Power voting in favor, and Regent
Newman opposed.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at about
10:45 a.m. Regents' expenses for December 1997 totaled $868.66. The next
meeting is scheduled for February 19-20, 1998.
Walter Harrison,
Secretary of the University


234




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1998


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, February 19, 1998
The Regents convened at 1:40 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Horning, Deitch, Maynard, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Provost Cantor,
Executive Vice President Kasdin, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice
President and Secretary Harrison, Vice President Hartford, Vice President
Kinnear, Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellor Nelms, and Interim
Co-General Counsel Barry. Chancellor Renick was absent; Provost Simpson
attended in his place.
Vice President for Development
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and announced the
recommendation of Susan K. Feagin as vice president for development,
beginning May 4, 1998, to succeed Thomas Kinnear.
He noted that Vice President Kinnear had joined the administration
four years ago when there were a number of pressing issues facing the Office
of Development. He said that he had brought "an absolutely top sense of
professionalism and organization to central development, closing out the
capital campaign with the largest amount of money raised by any public
university." President Bollinger expressed appreciation for Vice President
Kinnear's service on behalf of the entire University. There followed a round
of applause.
Regent McFee moved approval of the appointment of Susan K. Feagin as
vice president for development, effective May 4, 1998. Regent McGowan
seconded the motion. President Bollinger observed that Susan Feagin is
widely known in the development community as an outstandingly capable
professional, and he was extremely pleased to be able to recommend her for
appointment to this position.
The vote was then taken, and the motion to approve. the appointment of
Susan K. Feagin as vice president for development was approved unanimously.
Environmental Theme Semester
Provost Cantor noted that since 1992, the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts has held "theme semesters," in which various activities are
organized around themes of particular interest to the campus and more
broadly. The current theme semester is organized around the environment
and issues related to it. She noted that faculty from a number of schools and
colleges, along with an unusually high number of students, have been
involved in planning and organizing this theme semester. She called on
Professor John Knott, who serves as faculty chair of the Environmental
Theme Semester.


235




February Meeting, 1998


Professor Knott observed that the Environmental Theme Semester
marks the first time that students have genuinely become involved in the
theme semester. This is largely due to the leadership of Mona Hanna, a
senior in the School of Natural Resources and Environment, who chairs the
student committee associated with the event. He then introduced Ms. Hanna.
Ms. Hanna aired a multimedia presentation that had been created by
another student, Albert Garcia. Following the presentation, she noted that
press kits had been distributed to national media to promote the theme
semester, and she reviewed the contents of the press kit with the Board.
President's Report
President Bollinger announced the names of professors who had been
awarded Fulbright grants and other awards.  He also noted that the
University of Michigan Women's Health Program had been named a national
center of excellence in women's health, one of thirteen centers nationwide to
have been so designated by the U.S. Public Health Service.
President Bollinger also noted the deaths of Professor Gardner Ackley, the
Henry Carter Adams Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Political Economy;
William Jenkins, chancellor emeritus of the University of Michigan-Dearborn;
and Joseph Wojczynski, a senior student in the dance department who was
killed in an automobile accident.
Comments from Executive Vice President Omenn
Executive Vice President Omenn reported that increased volume in the
hospital had led to improved budget projections for the health system;
currently a net operating margin of $15 million is predicted, rather than the
break-even budget that had been projected.
Regarding the $200 million expenditure reduction program, he noted
that the program is intact, although the timing for achieving the goal has
been changed.
Executive Vice President Omenn announced that he had signed a contract
with the Henry Ford Health System to serve children with especially complicated
medical needs. This involves a major partnership with the state's department of
community health. He also noted that a new health plan with Ford Motor
Company is coming to fruition, called "Partnership Health." He also reported
on other items of interest in the health system.
Consent Agenda

Amin, Kaushik. Associate Professor of Finance, with tenure, appointment canceled
(previously reported as effective March 1, 1997)
Retirement Memoirs. Four retirement memoirs were submitted for
approval.
Rane L. Curl, professor of chemical engineering, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 1997, following an exemplary and productive
career.
Professor Curl received his S.B. (1951) and Sc.D. (1955) degrees in chemical
engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Following
employment by the Shell Development Corporation and Technische Hogeschool
Eindhoven in the Netherlands, he came to the University of Michigan in 1964 as
associate professor of chemical engineering. He was promoted to professor in
1969.
As a teacher, Professor Curl enhanced the curriculum by improving
existing courses and introducing new ones. In the last decade he introduced
an important change in the senior laboratory course. From a set of
perfunctory separate experiments, the course has evolved into one in which
real problems are simulated and experiments are performed that lead to
their solution. The course also emphasizes laboratory safety and environmental protection.
Professor Curl's research and more than 70 publications pursue the
explanation of commonly accepted, but incompletely understood, phenomena
in fields ranging from industrial processes to medicinal chemistry. A large
portion of his research is his life-long study of caves and karsts, where his
work has extended far beyond the interests of a pure naturalist into the
application of the new field of fractals to the explanation of geological
characteristics. He has been a force in the development of the National
Speleological Society as a true professional organization, serving as its
president and in other administrative positions.
Within the department, Professor Curl established and chaired the
Safety Committee, making him a leader in recognizing the need for
introducing environmental and safety concerns into the educational process.
His colleagues and students will remember his clear enunciation of the
consistently high standards of performance expected in his classes and in
graduate research.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming him Rane L.
Curl professor emeritus of chemical engineering.
Cedomil Goic, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento Professor of SpanishAmerican Literature, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1997.
Professor Goic earned his undergraduate degree in 1953 and his Ph.D.
degree in 1965 from   the University of Chile in Santiago.  He held
professorships in Chilean and Spanish American literature at that university,


261




February Meeting, 1998


as well as numerous visiting professorships in North America, before joining
the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1976 as professor of Spanish.
An internationally renowned specialist in a broad range of SpanishAmerican literature, with particular concentration in the modem period,
Professor Goic is the author of many scholarly works. His publications
include La novela chilena (1968), Historia de la novel hispanoamericana (1972),
La novela de la revolucion mexicana (1983), and Los mitos degradados: Ensayos
de comprension de la literature hispanoamericana (1992), and over seventy-five
articles. He is also the editor of the three-volume Historia y critica de la
literatura hispanoamericana (1988-91).
Professor Goic served his department and the University in a number of
capacities, including graduate advisor, head of the Spanish section, member of
the department executive committee, and member of the Rackham Divisional
Board. He directed University foreign study programs in both Spain and Chile.
He will be remembered by generations of Michigan students as a versatile and
learned teacher of literature, exceptionally successful in the direction of
doctoral dissertations. The University honored him by appointment to the
Domingo Faustino Sarmiento Professorship in 1982.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Cedomil Goic
the Domingo Faustino Sarmiento Professor Emeritus of Spanish-American
Literature.
Keki B. Irani, professor of electrical engineering and computer science,
retired from active faculty status on January 1, 1998.
Professor Irani received B.S.E. (Mech.) and B.S.E. (E.E.) degrees, in
1946 and 1947, respectively, from the University of Bombay, and M.S.E. and
Ph.D. degrees, in 1949 and 1953, respectively, from the University of
Michigan. Following employment at Philips Telecommunications Industries
from 1950-56 and serving as a faculty member at the University of Kansas
from 1956-61, he returned to the University of Michigan in 1962 as an
associate research engineer. He was promoted to associate professor in 1963
and professor in 1968.
Professor Irani supervised more than 50 doctoral students, many of whom
have gone on to positions of leadership in academia and industry. As a faculty
member in a rapidly developing field, he was known for developing and
maintaining expertise in many aspects of both computer science and computer
engineering. Over the years, students have praised him for his ability to
present extremely complicated subjects in a clear and exciting manner. In
1992 he received the Teaching Excellence Award from the College of
Engineering.
Within the college, Professor Irani served as chief program advisor for
computer engineering from   1977-86 and from   1990-96, and he was
instrumental in the development of the computer science and computer
engineering curricula. He served as associate chair of the Department of
Electrical and Computer Engineering from 1976-84 and as associate chair of
the Division of Computer Science and Engineering in the newly formed
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from 1986-90,
both critical periods in the evolution of the department.
The author of more than 85 publications, Professor Irani has made
contributions to remarkably diverse areas, including control theory, computer


262




February Meeting, 1998


display and communication systems, computer scheduling, database systems,
computer architecture, parallel computing, artificial intelligence, and programming
languages. He has been elected fellow of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers, and has also had a long-standing involvement with the
engineering accreditation organization, the Accreditation Board of Engineering
and Technology.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Keki B. Irani
professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science.
John H. Jackson, the Hessel E. Yntema Professor of Law and professor
of law, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1997, after an
especially distinguished career of teaching and research.
Professor Jackson received his A.B. degree, magna cum laude, from
Princeton University in 1954 and his J.D. degree from the University of
Michigan in 1959. He practiced law in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from 1959-61 and
was on the faculty of the School of Law at the University of California at
Berkeley from 1961-65. He joined the University of Michigan Law School in
1966 as professor of law. He was named the Henry M. Butzel Professor of Law
in 1982 and the Hessel E. Yntema Professor of Law in 1983.
From 1988-89, Professor Jackson also served as associate vice president for
academic affairs. From 1973-74, while on leave from the University, he served
as general counsel for the Office of the President's Special Representative for
Trade, and in 1974, he was acting deputy special representative for trade. He
has also held visiting professorships and fellowships at a number of other
institutions, including the University of Delhi, the University of Brussels, and
Georgetown University Law Center.
Professor Jackson is the preeminent American legal scholar on the subject
of international trade, with a special focus on the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT). He has written nine books, including World Trade and the
Law of GATT, Legal Problems of International Economic Relations, and The
World Trading System: Law and Policy of International Economic Relations, as
well as many articles. He has served on the editorial boards of eight journals,
including the American Journal of International Law, and has served as a
consultant to numerous governmental bodies. He has twice been co-chair of the
ABA Committee on International Trade, and he was the s first chair of the
Section on International Law of the Michigan Bar Association. Most important,
he has inspired several generations of international trade scholars, many of
whom have gone on to significant careers in government and the academy.
The Regents now salute this accomplished scholar and educator by naming
John H. Jackson the Hessel E. Yntema Professor Emeritus of Law and professor
emeritus of law.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported to the
Regents this month.
Degrees. The Regents approved final degree lists for the December 1997
commencements of the various schools, colleges, divisions, and branch
campuses; and they approved changes to previously approved degree lists.
Copies of all degree lists are on file in the Office of the Secretary of the
University.


263




February Meeting, 1998


Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Horning,
seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the
Consent Agenda.
Audited Financial Reports for WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM and
WFUM-TV for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1997; WFUM-TV and
WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM Statements of Support, Revenue and
Expenditures (Operating Fund) for the Years Ended June 30,
1997 and 1996
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted the financial reports and
statements of support, revenue, and expenditures for WUOM/WVGR/WFUMFM and WFUM-TV. He then called on Vice President Harrison.
Michigan Radio Annual Report
Vice President Harrison introduced Mr. Donovan Reynolds, director of
broadcasting for Michigan Radio (WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM), to present the
Michigan Radio Annual Report.
Mr. Reynolds gave a presentation describing what had occurred at
Michigan Radio since the format change to a news and information format in
1996. He observed that since implementation of the new format in July 1996,
the station's accumulated deficit had been eliminated, the number of
listeners had increased by 30 percent, and the budget had increased from
$1.5 million to $2.15 million. The proportion of the budget attributed to
University funds and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting had decreased,
while corporate and foundation support had increased.
Mr. Reynolds reported that some of the major challenges currently
facing Michigan Radio are to provide funding for studio renovation,
replacement of outdated equipment, and replacement of the towers in Grand
Rapids and Flint. This will allow the station to continue to develop its
original programming projects, with the goal of becoming a center for
program production within the public broadcasting system.
Mr. Reynolds noted that Michigan Radio serves as the voice of the
University in other areas of the state by relaying programming featuring
University of Michigan commentators and performances. He thanked the
University for its support during the transition period between the old
format and new format.
Regent Power observed that the achievements of a 30 percent audience
increase and of going from a budget deficit to a budget surplus, both in one
year, are "astonishing."
In response to a request from President Bollinger, Mr. Reynolds described
the formatting change that had occurred in 1996, which involved a change from
classical music and NPR news to a news and information format.
Following further discussion, the Regents turned to a report on WFUM-TV.


264




February Meeting, 1998


Annual Report, WFUM-TV
Mr. Leon Collins gave a report on the University of Michigan-Flint
public television station, WFUM, describing plans for conversion to digital
technology and how this new technology will enhance the station's
programming capabilities.
Following the reports, Regent Horning moved adoption of the audited
financial reports for WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM and WFUM-TV for the Fiscal
Year ended June 30, 1997.
Commitment of up to $30 million from the Long Term Portfolio
to Alternative Equity Investments
Executive Vice President Kasdin informed the Regents that pursuant to
Regents' policies, two follow-on investments had been made: One of $20
million in R. Chaney & Partners IV, L.P., and the second of up to $10.0
million to Summit Ventures V, L.P.
Emerging Markets Equities
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved Everest Capital Frontier Ltd. as an emerging
markets fund, subject to review of the fund documents by the general
counsel for legal acceptability. Regents Deitch, McGowan, and Newman
were away from the table for this and the following five items.
Alternative Asset Investments
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved commitment of $20.0 million to Crow Family
Realty Partners, L.P., plus payment of management fees, pending favorable
review of the documents by the Office of the General Counsel.
Northwood III Underground Utilities Replacement
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved a revised budget for completion of phase
three of the underground utilities replacement project for the Northwood III
apartment buildings.
S. T. Dana Building Courtyard Enclosure
Regent Power moved approval of proceeding with a project to enclose
the existing courtyard of the S. T. Dana Building, as described in the Regents
Communication. Regent McFee seconded the motion.
In response to a question from Regent Power regarding who would be
doing the architecture work, Executive Vice President Kasdin responded that
the architectural work was being done in-house. Regent Power noted that
Schembechler Hall had been approved without the architectural plans having
been presented to the Board. Following that incident, the Board had adopted
a policy that building plans would never again be approved without the
Board's having reviewed them. He expressed a desire for the Board and the


265




February Meeting, 1998


University community to see the proposed plans for the courtyard enclosure.
Executive Vice President Kasdin responded that he would be happy to
present the plans to the Board, either the next day or at the next meeting.
The vote was then taken, and the motion to proceed with the project to
enclose the existing courtyard in the S. T. Dana Building was approved
unanimously.
University Hospital Wall Protection Replacement and Restoration
Project
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved proceeding with a project for replacement
and restoration of the existing wall protection system at University of
Michigan Hospitals, as described in the Regents Communication.
Renovation and Expansion of the Emergency Department, University
of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers
Regent Power moved approval of a project for renovation and expansion
of the Emergency Department at University of Michigan Hospitals, and
authorized submission of a Certificate of Need application to the Michigan
Department of Public Health. Regent Horning seconded the motion. Regent
McGowan returned to the meeting at this point.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Cut-Stone Wall adjacent to Palmer Field
Regent Power observed that there is a cut-stone wall along Huron
Street, immediately west of Palmer Field, which has been deteriorating for a
long time. He noted that this is an eyesore and is dangerous, in that stones
could break off and fall into the road.
Executive Vice President Kasdin responded that the wall and the road are
both owned by the state, and that the state has supplied funding to the city to
repair the wall. He stated that he did not believe the University would be liable
if an accident was to occur as a result of the wall's state of disrepair. He noted
that the city has made a commitment to repair the wall this spring.
1998-99 Residence Hall and Family Housing Rates
Vice President Hartford observed that the University has the seventh
largest campus housing system in the country, housing 11,103 students.
During the fall term, the system operates at 100 percent of capacity, during
the winter term, at 98 percent of capacity, and during the summer term, at 52
percent. She enumerated several areas in which Regents had expressed an
interest over the past year, and addressed what has been done regarding them.
With respect to benchmarking, she reported that an in-depth comparison
had been made with one peer institution, and that staff is working nationally
and within the Big Ten to develop industry standards from which
comparison data can be derived in the future.


266




February Meeting, 1998


On the issue of overcrowding, she noted that plans are underway to
reduce the number of converted triples by half in the fall of 1998 and to
eliminate them entirely in 1999. Office space located in West Quad is also
going to revert back to living space to provide additional rooms.
Vice President Hartford observed that the last comprehensive survey of
student needs was done in 1965. She reported that focus groups have been
conducted this year in preparation for designing a new comprehensive survey
of student needs.
Regarding living/learning communities, a proposal to expand these
initiatives is being presented to the provost's office this month. She noted
that the provost would take the lead in the next phase of this project.
In the area of privatizing and outsourcing, Vice President Hartford
noted that over $4 million per year is currently being outsourced into the
community. She said she and her staff will continue to look at ways to
increase these initiatives, although she cautioned that tax issues affect the
extent to which this can be done.
Regarding the possibility of new residence hall construction, she
reported that a 500-bed traditional residence hall would cost $31.5 million.
Using conventional financing, this would lead to a 5.4 percent increase in
room and board rates. Better use of current space is also being explored.
Vice President Hartford also noted that the Housing Division has
continued to work on reducing costs. She said that $473,000 was cut from
the current budget to arrive at the proposed rates for 1998-99. This was
done while adding an additional $150,000 to the general student residence
reserve, which is used for renovation and facilities.
With respect to long-range planning, Vice President Hartford stated that
housing staff has been working on a set of long-range plans, including an
assessment of the physical condition of each building and the estimated cost
for true renovation. Various scenarios for improving the operation of dining
services are also being evaluated.  Other plans include the creation of
neighborhoods in housing, around which a number of services would be
developed. Vice President Hartford noted that long-range planning in housing
is also dependent on decisions made elsewhere in the University, including the
academic decision of whether to expand living/learning communities.
In summary, Vice President Hartford said that the current budget includes
$477,000 worth of cuts and putting as much as possible into renovation. She
noted that a utilities increase of 6.4 percent and a bargained-for employee salary
increase of 3.0 percent also impacted the proposed rate increase of 2.7 percent
for residence halls and 2.45 percent for apartments. She pointed out that these
proposed increases are below those recommended by the student rate committee.
Vice President Hartford reported that she and her staff are considering
setting up a task force to explore the issues of what the role of housing
should be, which students should constitute the highest priority for
resources, what is the ideal percentage of students that should be housed,
and what types of housing should be offered. Plans also include conducting a


267




February Meeting, 1998


survey of student needs and creating long-range plans for renovation,
construction, and staffing needs. She observed that plans for a new dining
commons had been put on hold during development of the campus master
plan, but noted that such a project would be critical for providing for the
needs of students.
Regent Newman returned to the table at this point.
Executive Vice President Kasdin and his staff responded to questions
about the reasons for increases in utilities rates, pointing out that there had
been significant increases in natural gas rates over the past three years. He
observed that the question of whether the University should consider the
privatization of utilities is being raised, but is not under active consideration
at this point in time.
Regent Power expressed a desire to have a presentation on how utilities
rates and pricing mechanisms operate. Regent Horning also said it would be
helpful to compare the cost of maintaining a central stores operation with
contracting for these services in the private sector. Executive Vice President
Kasdin responded that these questions pose an important intellectual
discipline that would be very important to explore.
In response to a question from Regent Power, Vice President Hartford
indicated that the demand for housing in traditional residence halls exceeds
the supply at the present price level.
Regent Newman asked whether consideration was being given to
establishing a presidential commission to examine the future of housing on
campus, similar to the one that was in operation in 1965. Vice President
Hartford responded that such a task force had not yet been constituted, but
that plans were to establish one in the future.
Regent Power moved approval of the proposed 1998-99 University
residence hall and family housing rates, as described in the Regents
Communication. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously. Regent Deitch was away from the table for this vote and for
the remainder of the votes taken.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Chad Baily, student, on problems
related to the University's contractual relationship with the Nike
Corporation.
Following Public Comments, the meeting resumed at about 4:10 p.m.
Vice President for Research
President Bollinger presented a proposal for a change in the structure of
the Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR), such that the vice
president would report through the provost to the president. He noted that
the position would retain the title of vice president, to emphasize its
important role. The reason for the change is to bring together the academic


268




February Meeting, 1998


programming occurring within the OVPR into collaboration with the Office
of the Provost.
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a change in the reporting relationship of the vice
president for research from the president to the provost, and creation of the
position of associate vice president and executive director of research
administration.
Regent Taylor requested that the Regents be provided with an
organizational chart reflecting the key staff appointments in the president's
office over the past year. It was noted that the remaining openings are for
vice president and general counsel and vice president for research.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan
and Integrated Sensing Systems, Inc. (ISSYS)
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent McGowan, the
Regents unanimously approved a proposed license agreement between the
University of Michigan and Integrated Sensing Systems, Inc. (ISSYS), under
which a number of inventions developed and owned by the University would
be practiced and commercialized. Regents Power and Deitch were away from
the table when the vote was taken. Because two University employees,
Khalil Najafi and Kensall D. Wise, also hold equity interests in the proposed
licensee, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and
Integrated Sensing Systems, Inc., a company in which Khalil Najafi
and Kensall D. Wise hold an equity interest.
2.  Contract terms include:
A license issue fee of $6,700.00, credited against patent cost
reimbursements and royalties otherwise due to the University of
Michigan (other than toward minimum annual royalties).
Royalties to the University of 4% for catheter products and $0.10 for
each sensor for noncathetor products.
Royalties of 25% on sublicense revenue.
Exclusive right to practice and commercialize the technology, subject
to certain rights reserved by the University to practice it for research
and educational purposes and to grant licenses to the Semiconductor
Research Corporation. The University retains ownership.
Minimum annual royalties of $6,700.00 for 1999; $6,600.00 for 2000;
and $2,000.00 for 2001 and each year thereafter during the term of
the agreement.
Term of the agreement is for the life of the patents.
No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of
University employees, is obligated under the agreement.


269




February Meeting, 1998


3.  The pecuniary interests of Khalil Najafi and Kensall D. Wise arise
from their ownership interests in ISSYS. Khalil Najafi was not an
inventor on any of the subject inventions and thus would have no
potential to share in revenues received by the University. Kensall D.
Wise was an inventor on these inventions and has waived any
personal participation in the sharing of royalties received by the
University from the company.
Proposed Purchase Agreement with On-Line Training, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved a purchase agreement with On-Line
Training, Inc., as a result of a grant to the University from the Michigan
Department of Consumer and Industry Services, under the direction of
Sheryl S. Ulin. Because the president and chief stockholder of On-Line
Training, William J. Anderson, is also a University of Michigan employee and
a consultant on this project, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement will be the Regents of the University of
Michigan and On-Line Training, Inc.
2.  The agreement will be a standard purchase order for one year in the
amount of $3,000. The prime award from the Michigan Department
of Consumer and Industry Services is for one year in the amount of
$60,000. MDC&IS has awarded the grant with the knowledge that a
purchase order would be issued to Dr. Anderson at On-Line
Training. The proposed purchase order will detail the scope of work
and the budget.
3.  Dr. Ulin will not be compensated outside of her University salary for
this project. However, Dr. Anderson, as president and majority
shareholder of On-Line Training, will receive the benefit of
compensation paid to On-Line Training.
Rackham Interdisciplinary Seminars
On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent McGowan, the
Regents unanimously granted approval for the Horace H. Rackham School of
Graduate Studies to offer interdisciplinary courses through a newly created
program called the Rackham Interdisciplinary Seminars, as described in the
Regents Communication.
Membership of M-Care Board of Directors
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the appointment of Gilbert S. Omenn to the M-Care
board of directors, replacing Chandler W. Matthews, who has resigned.
Recommendations for Appointment to Medical Staff Membership
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Maynard, and on
the recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive
Board, the Regents unanimously approved certain specified appointments to
medical staff membership.


270




February Meeting, 1998


Closed Session Motion
Regent Power made the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(e) and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202 and 1996 PA 464, I move that the Board of
Regents meet in closed session on February 19, 1998, in the Regents'
Room, for the purposes of consulting with our attorney regarding trial
or settlement strategy in connection with specific pending litigation
(section 8e) and of considering material exempt from discussion or
disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (section 8h).
Such exempt material consists of a written opinion from the Board's
legal counsel.
Regent Taylor seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then continued in executive session from 4:20 to 5:30 p.m.
Friday, February 20, 1998
The Regents met at 9:45 in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Horning, Deitch, Maynard, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Provost Cantor, Executive
Vice President Kasdin, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President and
Secretary Harrison, Vice President Hartford, Vice President Neidhardt,
Chancellor Nelms, Chancellor Renick, and Interim Co-General Counsel
Barry. Vice President Kinnear was absent.
S. T. Dana Building Courtyard Enclosure
Executive Vice President Kasdin called on Mr. Fred Mayer to present the
plans for the S. T. Dana Building courtyard enclosure. Mr. Mayer reviewed the
history of the building and the courtyard, and showed schematic drawings of
each level of the enclosure, noting the uses that would be made of the space on
each level. He pointed out that changes to the exterior of the building would be
very minor. The Regents expressed satisfaction with the proposed plans.
Technology Transfer Fund
Vice President Neidhardt acknowledged the assistance of everyone who
had contributed to the development of this proposal. Executive Vice President
Kasdin said that this proposal would create a separate technology transfer
fund within the University's funds functioning as endowment. It would
allow for the taking, holding, and disposal of the equity positions resulting
from the University's technology transfer activities.
Regent Taylor moved adoption of the following resolution establishing the
Technology Transfer Fund as part of the funds functioning as endowment of the
University. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Resolution
Resolved, that a separate Technology Transfer Fund (the
"Fund") shall be created as funds functioning as endowment of the
271




February Meeting, 1998


University, to invest in, hold and dispose of equity positions relating
to the technology transfer and intellectual property development
activities of the University and to enhance the potential for
successful development of technology and intellectual property
created within the University.
Resolved, that the Fund shall be an endowment fund within
the meaning of Section 2(a) of the Uniform Management of
Institutional Funds Act (the "Act") as adopted in Michigan. While
it is anticipated that amounts at least equivalent to the value of
initial deposits to the Fund shall be held, with respect to each
holding, on a long-term basis, the right is reserved to distribute or
expend part or all of the corpus of the Fund as may be deemed
appropriate to further the technology transfer mission or other
purposes of the University.
Resolved, that this Resolution, together with any subsequently
adopted terms governing the Technology Transfer Fund, shall be
deemed to be the gift instrument within the meaning of Section 2(b) of
the Act.
Resolved, that the Fund shall be managed to further the
educational, scientific and charitable purposes of the University of
Michigan, and as is otherwise permitted by the Act and other
governing law.
Resolved, that the associate vice president and treasurer, under
the auspices of the executive vice president and chief financial officer
and the vice president for research, and in accordance with the
management structure as discussed in the Request for Action and
recommendation for this Resolution, shall have the authority
necessary to manage the Fund.
Resolved, that the terms of this Resolution may be amended at
any time by resolution of the Regents, and further the Fund may be
terminated at any time by Regental resolution.
Change in Name of School of Engineering at UM-Dearborn
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved a change in the name of the School of Engineering at
the University of Michigan-Dearborn to the College of Engineering and
Computer Science.
UM-Dearborn General Campus Renovation Project Phase III:
College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters Building
Chancellor Renick observed that the site and architect for the College of
Arts, Sciences, and Letters (CASL) Building had been previously approved
by the Regents. He called on Mr. Doug Hanna to present the design.
Mr. Hanna displayed a map of the Dearborn Campus, noting the site for
the project and describing the placement on the site and access routes. He
displayed drawings of each floor of the proposed design, noting pertinent
272




February Meeting, 1998


details of the floor plan, and also showed a computer-generated rendering
and a model of the completed building.
In response to a question from President Bollinger about the brick
selected for the exterior, Mr. Hanna said that the color was chosen to match
the adjacent buildings. There was a discussion of the window placement, the
rotunda, and various other elements of the design. Chancellor Renick
pointed out that the design was meant to signify the central role of the
College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters to the mission of the Dearborn campus.
In response to a question from Regent Newman, Mr. Hanna said that
the design phase is about 15 percent complete. Regent Power noted that in
March 1997, it was established that the design objectives for major new
projects would be submitted to the Regents as items for information in time
to allow approval and receive Regent comment prior to presenting the design
for approval. It was noted that the design objectives were provided at last
month's Regents' meeting.
Regent Deitch expressed concern about the size of this building
compared with other buildings on campus, and about how it blends with the
general "feeling" of the campus.
Chancellor Renick noted that the Regents would be meeting on the
Dearborn campus the following month, and he suggested that during this
meeting, the Regents could visit the site and put the proposed building
design in context with the rest of the campus.
Regent Deitch agreed that this would be a good idea, and moved to table
consideration of the design of the CASL building until the March meeting.
Regent Newman seconded the motion.
Regent McFee raised the issue of the building that is to be constructed
to house the UM-Dearborn's glass museum. It was noted that the Regents
had previously approved the design for this building, but that funds for
construction of this building have not yet been raised. Regent Power
suggested that material describing this building and its relationship to the
rest of the campus be available for the Regents to review next month as well.
During the discussion, the Regents suggested that samples of the brick
and metal to be used for the CASL building be made available as part of the
review of the project next month. Regent Deitch again expressed "major
concerns about this expanse of one-story building that almost seems to be a
disconnected barrier to the other buildings."
President Bollinger suggested that the architects come to the meeting
and explain their thinking about the building's design. Regent McFee
suggested that advance notice be given to Chancellor Renick prior to the
next meeting regarding any further issues the Regents would like to have
addressed about the CASL Building.
Regent Power observed that during his tenure on the board,
presentations about new building projects have been given by University
staff rather than the architect who designed the project. Executive Vice
President Kasdin responded that this has been the historical pattern desired
273




February Meeting, 1998


by past administrations and boards, but that he and his staff would be happy
to change the practice if the Board so desired.
Regent Newman also expressed concerns about the coordination
between the Ann Arbor campus and the branch campuses when designs are
presented for buildings on the branch campuses. Her impression is that Ann
Arbor campus design personnel are not heavily involved in branch campus
projects, even though they present the designs. She noted that to her, the
three campuses are one university, and she would like to have explained how
all the campus designs fit together.
Executive Vice President Kasdin said that he would consult with the
chancellors in order to describe the current process and to identify a way in
which it could work more effectively.
The vote was then taken on the motion to table, and it was approved
unanimously.
Environmental Interpretive Center-Dearborn Campus Wayne County
Agreement
Chancellor Renick informed the Regents that Wayne County had agreed to
contribute $500,000 toward construction of the Environmental Interpretive
Center. The terms of the agreement are described in the Regents
Communication.
Renovation and Expansion of the Emergency Department, University
of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers
Executive Vice President Kasdin clarified that the funding for the
project for renovation and expansion of the Emergency Department is
coming from Hospital reserves.
University of Michigan-Flint Professional Studies Classroom
Building
Chancellor Nelms noted that the design objectives for this building had
been approved at the January meeting. He observed that completion of this
facility would mark the first time in the history of the Flint campus that all
programs would be located on one campus. He called on Mr. Doug Hanna to
present the building's design.
Mr. Hanna reviewed all of the programs that would be housed in the
building. He displayed the campus master plan, noting where the building
would be located. He described the site plan and reviewed the plans for each
floor of the building, and displayed renderings of the building's exterior.
Following some discussion, Regent Horning moved approval of the
schematic design for the Professional Studies Classroom Building. Regent
Taylor seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.


274




February Meeting, 1998


Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 10:50
a.m. Regents' expenses for January 1998 totaled $2,976.14. The next
meeting is scheduled for March 19-20, 1998.
Walter Harrison,
Secretary of the University


275




MARCH MEETING, 1998


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, March 19, 1998
The Regents convened at 1:50 p.m. in the Henry Ford Estate-Fairlane
on the Dearborn campus. Present were President Bollinger and Regents
Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McFee, McGowan, Newman, Power, and Taylor.
Also present were Provost Cantor, Executive Vice President Kasdin,
Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President and Secretary Harrison,
Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellor Nelms, Chancellor Renick, and Interim
Co-General Counsel Barry. Vice President Hartford and Vice President
Kinnear were absent.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and thanked Chancellor
Renick for hosting the meeting on the Dearborn campus. He noted the
deaths of Professor Emeritus Daniel Katz, one of the founders of the
Institute for Social Research (ISR); Abramo Fimo "Ken" Organski, professor
of political science and senior research scientist in the Center for Political
Studies at the Institute for Social Research; Beverly Payne, research scientist
emeritus at ISR; and President Emeritus Harlan Hatcher. He also called
attention to the recommendation for adoption of a retirement memoir for
former executive vice president and chief financial officer, Farris Womack.
Monthly Report on Investments
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted the monthly investment
report, noting a change on page two. He said that consideration was being
given to changing the information presented in this report, so that it would
focus on the Long Term Portfolio, with separate reports periodically being
given on the other invested funds.
1997 Report on Investments
Executive Vice President Kasdin suggested changing the timing of this
annual report to the fall, which would allow it to be timed to June 30th fiscal
year data, rather than December 31 of the previous year, thereby allowing for
more meaningful comparisons to other institutions. He said that the next
report would be so timed unless any objections were raised.
He introduced Associate Vice President and Treasurer Norman Herbert.
Mr. Herbert stated that the Long Term Portfolio comprises 80 percent of the
University's $3.7 billion of invested capital. It is the investment portfolio for
the University's endowment funds and other core capital and its purpose is to
provide long-term returns that will support the endowment's objective of
maintaining and enhancing the purchasing power of endowment distributions
in perpetuity. He noted that the overall portfolio is well-diversified and the
investments are managed externally.
Mr. Herbert reported that the strategy for the Long Term Portfolio has
added significant value to the University's Investment Pool and to the


277




March Meeting, 1998


Veritas reserves; for 1997 the total return on the Long Term Portfolio was
16.2 percent and for the past five-year period the total return was 13.8
percent. He commented that while the returns are unusually high from a
historical perspective, they would have been even stronger if the portfolio
had had greater exposure to the conventional U.S. stock and bond markets.
The decision to invest in commodities and maintain an exposure to tactical
asset allocation also hurt performance in 1997. However, he pointed out that
the diversification strategy is designed to produce premium returns over
time, even if in any given year buying the S&P index would have led to a
superior performance.
Mr. Herbert announced that in the coming year, the plan is to take a
fresh look at investment strategies and direction, focusing on the Long Term
Portfolio allocation of assets and perhaps shifting the emphasis from equity
and fixed income investments to a marketable and nonmarketable investment
approach.
Mr. Herbert then introduced Mr. David Thurston and Ms. Mary Cove, the
University's investment consultants from the firm of Cambridge Associates,
Inc., to discuss the Long Term Portfolio's 1997 performance and planned
initiatives for 1998. They distributed a booklet pertaining to their presentation.
Mr. Thurston and Ms. Cove reviewed the Long-Term Portfolio strategy as
described in the handout.  They pointed out that the University had
underperformed the Cambridge Associates Endowment Median by 1.9 percent
in 1997. Mr. Thurston explained that even though it had outperformed in 10 of
the 12 asset classes over one, three, and five year periods, the fund had been
diversifying out of common stock at a time when the S&P 500 had had
extremely favorable returns. The other factor leading to the underperformance
had to do with the Tactical Asset Allocation program, which had been instituted
to reduce the risk of the portfolio and, in retrospect, clearly wasn't necessary in
a rising market.
Ms. Cove reviewed the remainder of the highlights of 1997 and noted
that for 1998, initiatives would include continuing commitments to high
quality alternative asset funds, discontinuing the Tactical Asset Allocation
Program, examining the role and appropriate allocation of fixed income in
the Long Term Portfolio, reviewing the role of "inflation hedges," and
exploring the adoption of a multi-asset policy portfolio.
Executive Vice President Kasdin pointed out that all of these points
underscore the importance of asset allocation. In response to a question
from Regent Power about the underlying assumptions behind the proposed
policy initiatives, he said that there are no implicit assumptions because
other than the suggestion to drop the Tactical Asset Allocation Program,
these suggestions are meant to be viewed as topics meriting exploration, not
as specific policy initiatives.
Regent Power also observed that the Regents need to know on the basis
of what benchmark the University's performance should be fairly evaluated.
Executive Vice President Kasdin agreed, noting that the Board needs to be
put in a position where it has clear recommendations from staff on each of


278




March Meeting, 1998


those issues. He said that the purpose of the current discussion is to identify
an intellectual agenda, rather than to make specific policy suggestions (other
than the continued movement to alternative asset funds and discontinuation
of the Tactical Asset Allocation Program).
Regarding the Tactical Asset Allocation Program, Executive Vice
President Kasdin explained that he favors its discontinuance because there is
no need to further reduce exposure to equities. Mr. Thurston noted that this
program most recently covered only 10 percent of the portfolio. He also
noted that as diversification into alternative assets proceeded, the intent was
to further reduce the Tactical Asset Allocation Program. Therefore, now
that the portfolio has been well diversified with the corresponding decrease
in risk, there is no longer a need for this program.
Mr. Thurston reviewed other comparative data in the Cambridge
Associates handout. In response to a question from Regent Newman about
the benchmarks that will be used from this point onward, Executive Vice
President Kasdin commented that there will be three different benchmarks:
A comparison with other institutions; a customized benchmark (a model
portfolio) that reflects the University's asset allocation strategy; and a
sample 80% S&P500/20% Lehman Government-Corporate. He commented
that at this moment in the history of markets, the question of how long the
bull market will continue is "excruciatingly difficult." He noted that this had
been "a terrific decade of wealth creation," and the challenge ahead is to
maintain self-discipline and make sure that the people who benefit from the
funds and who donate the funds believe that the funds are being managed in
a prudent and appropriate fashion.
Proposed Design of the UM-Dearborn College of Arts, Sciences and
Letters Building
President Bollinger noted the design presentation was being made for
information and discussion purposes only. He called on Chancellor Renick,
who introduced John Pressley, dean of the College of Arts, Sciences and
Letters (CASL).
Dean Presley reported that the college is very excited about having had
the opportunity to design a home for its programs and for the faculty of the
humanities, mathematics, and behavioral sciences departments. Program
planning for the building has been ongoing for many years, and serious
planning began with the selection of the architects, Smith, Hinchman, and
Grylls. He said that the architects have spent hundreds of hours in
consultation with the programming committee and in open forums and other
meetings with faculty, and that the process has been very collegial and
enjoyable throughout. He then introduced the project architects: Mssrs.
Coke Florance, Gary Worthy, Jeff Housman, and Carl Roehling.
Mr. Florance explained that the faculty had established certain goals
with respect to the building: that it underscore the significance of liberal arts
at UM-Dearborn; that it provide a strong identity for the campus; that it be a
student-centered building; that it encourage interaction between students
and among students and faculty; that it be responsive to the campus and to


279




March Meeting, 1998


the specific site; and that it "raise the bar" architecturally for the campus. It
was also important that the building help the campus interact with the
community, and that it at least abstractly express the use of technology to
enhance learning.
Using first a site model and then a building model, he explained the
design concept. He pointed out that the basic strategy was to provide
generous light and views for the public spaces and controlled light and views
for the general classrooms on the ground floor. The latter is necessary
because the use of advanced electronic and technological equipment in the
classrooms requires that rooms be able to be darkened without complicated
and expensive window treatment and screening apparatus. A further reason
for that strategy was the desire to screen out the impact of the large parking
lot on one side of the ground floor and the distraction of the pedestrian
traffic on the other side. Noting the concern that had been expressed
previously about the lack of natural light in the classrooms, he said the
strategy was to control natural light in the classrooms for the reasons
mentioned but to make it very abundant in the public spaces.
Mr. Florance displayed a site plan and several renderings of the
building, and reviewed the floor plans for each floor. He pointed out that the
building would be constructed of brick, curtain wall, and metal panels. The
coloration will be consistent and compatible with the general coloration of
the other buildings on the campus. The ground floor level would use the
same brick as the University Mall, while smoother, slightly darker, brick
would be used for the upper stories. He pointed out that the curtain wall is
intended to reflect the grove of trees opposite the building.
Regarding the concept of the structure as a "signature building," Mr.
Florance cautioned that this concept implies the personal signature of an
individual. He said the architects were interested in creating in a positive
identity and positive image for the campus through a building that is
memorable and perceived to be of high quality. This is done through the
classic architectural devices of height, stature, sculptural massing, and the
use of complimentary materials. He pointed out that since much of the
classroom activity will occur after dark, the rotunda will be lit up at night in
order to enhance and reinforce the building's impact.
Mr. Florance explained that the building's design is currently at the
schematic level, at which about 15 percent of the design process has been
completed. He concluded that the architects believe they are "on the way to
a memorable building that will linger in the public mind." The hope is that
students will make use of the building between classes, rather than sitting in
their cars as is currently a common practice.
There followed a discussion about programmatic and architectural
features of the building. Regarding the issue of the view of the first-floor roof
from the four-story wing, it was explained that the number of people actually
seeing the roof would be very limited. It would only be seen by people
standing at the window sill on the second floor. It was also noted since the last
presentation, more windows had been added to the four-story building.


280




March Meeting, 1998


In response to the concern expressed by the Regents about lack of light
in the classrooms, Dean Presley pointed out that during the initial public
forums, students expressed the desire for sound-proof classrooms with easily
controlled light, as the heavy use of computers, projection devices, and other
technology in these classrooms will require darkened rooms. In fact, he said
that a survey of the entire Dearborn campus faculty about how the teaching
and learning environment could be improved revealed that a major desire
was to renovate the existing classrooms so that they can be darkened. The
intent was not to keep the students in the dark while reserving the light
spaces for faculty.
Regent Deitch raised the issue of how programmatic needs are balanced
with aesthetic concerns in the design of such buildings. He agreed that many
of the programmatic needs have been addressed, but expressed that the
building is not as attractive a building as it might be. He said he would like
to be supportive of the achievement of the campus's programmatic needs,
while recognizing that "this is a hundred-year decision."
Mr. Florance responded that the architects believe they have struck
such a balance, noting that the intention was to break "out of the box." He
said that design cues were taken from the site, from the idea of a cross axis,
and creation of a strong central space, and pointed out that opinions about
the resulting design are by nature, subjective.
Another of the architects, Mr. Worthy, cautioned against focusing too
much on the exterior shape, noting that for a building to be memorable, it
must be experienced. He pointed out that architects strive to strike a
balance between meeting programmatic needs while achieving a memorable
building. He believes that once it is experienced, the building will be
perceived as very memorable.
Dean Presley noted that certain elements of the design, including the
serpentine wall and the rotunda, reflect the history of Dearborn. In addition,
as a practical matter, the master plan calls for buildings to face inward
toward the green part of the campus, away from the parking lots. While this
building complies with that, at the same time, it projects an interesting
facade toward the parking lot. He said that while the constant movement in
the parking lot will create a distraction, at the same time it will be evident
from the parking lot that sunlight will be bathing the interior and it will be
evident that activities are occurring in the building. Thus, consistent with
other campus buildings, the building looks inward, but also presents a facade
outside, making a different statement from the other buildings.
Regent McGowan commented that the strength brought to this project by
the involvement of so many people "leaves us, at least externally, with at best,
a compromise." She expressed grave concern that the many programmatic
elements featured in this building were incorporated with no overarching
vision, and that this is reflected in the design.
Regent Taylor commented that the building looks fine to him. He
observed that, while as with any structure, there may be some elements of
the design that he might not like, he believes that this building is "quite


281




March Meeting, 1998


lovely."  He said that he is "baffled" by the concerns that have been
expressed about this one building in the University's entire complex of
campuses, and expressed that he would be willing to cast his vote for
approval right now.
Regent Horning expressed agreement with Regent Taylor. He asked the
architects whether from a financial basis, it would have been more cost
effective to design one five-story building instead of two linked buildings.
Mr. Jeff Hausman, another of the architects, responded that a cost
analysis revealed the current design is less expensive than constructing one
five-story building and explained why that is the case. Mr. Florance also
pointed out that the master plan calls for four stories as the maximum
desirable building height. One four-story building would contain a very large
volume of totally interior space with little exposure to daylight.  The
architects opted instead for a building that was more responsive to the
landscape while responding to programmatic needs.
Regent Newman observed that this opportunity to interact with the
building's architects has been "incredibly helpful," and thanked the
architects for making the presentation. She noted that courtyards tend to
get used for recreation, and wondered whether the noise level generated by
the courtyards had been taken into account in the design. It was noted that
the windows surrounding the courtyards would be double glazed, which
provides a very good sound barrier.
Regent Maynard stated that she had been very impressed by the process
with which the building was thought about and planned on the Dearborn
Campus, and that it was unfortunate that this discussion with the building's
architects had not occurred at the previous meeting. She expressed hope
that this experience would change the way the Board examines building
projects in the future. She said that she would be ready to vote today, noting
that she believes the building will suit the programmatic needs of the
UM-Dearborn very well, and that it will blend very well with the other
buildings.
Regent Taylor observed that if the protocol by which the Board reviews
building projects is changed, he hoped it would not lead to an inordinate
amount of time being spent in these endeavors. He said that the current
situation indicates a flawed process which should be fixed.
Regent Deitch stated that he is "completely comfortable with one
person's aesthetic judgment being different than another's." He agreed that
it had been helpful to interact with the designers of the building. However, he
noted that in terms of time management, reviews of major building projects
"are the only hundred-year decisions we make." He believes it is important to
underscore the permanence of these decisions and the responsibility entailed,
and that they deserve to have a lot of time and thought spent on them.
Regent Taylor agreed, but noted that "this is not the way to make a
hundred-year decision." He said that he did not mean to minimize the
importance of the project, but rather noted that the process by which these


282




March Meeting, 1998


decisions are made needs to be changed, so that buildings are not designed at
Regents' Meetings.
Regent McFee stated that she is satisfied with the design of the building,
and that the features pointed out during the discussion had been extremely
helpful. She said that she had heard many comments about the color of the
brick on the Dearborn campus and requested that the color of the building's
exterior brick be reconsidered.
The architects observed that they understand the seriousness of the
Regents' concerns, but they have given the project a great deal of thought
and are confident that what they have done is appropriate.
Regent Power noted that there are a number of methods that can be
used to control light in classrooms other than the one that had been
presented. Regarding the process, he observed that the process by which
buildings are conceived, programmatically considered, and designed at the
University had been deeply flawed for many years. He expressed the opinion
that "there are systemic ways of dealing with the question of how do we get
good buildings designed to meet programmatic requirements in limited
periods of time," and that much of the current discussion is driven by the
University's failure to do this up to now. Another underlying concern, he
believes, is that the Regents are not very satisfied in general with the
architecture used on the Dearborn campus. That is why to him, the most
successful parts of the design of the CASL building have to do with the
serpentine form and the rotunda, and the least successful parts are the
rectilinear elements.
Regarding the question of process, President Bollinger pointed out that
the comments made were not meant as criticism of the University's staff.
Rather they relate to expectations and process on an institutional level. He
said that in order to allow both the architects and Board additional time to
reflect on the discussion, he would not call for a vote today but would expect
the issue would be ready to be presented and voted upon at the April meeting.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Edward McNamara, Wayne County
executive, on UM-Dearborn and Wayne County partnerships; and Michael
Guido, mayor of Dearborn, on UM-Dearborn's role in the City of Dearborn.
Friday, March 20, 1998

A native of Ohio, Professor Fesmire received his B.S. degree in business
administration (1957) from The Ohio State University, his M.B.A. degree (1960)
from Xavier University, and his Ph.D. degree (1982) from the University of

From 1960-82, he taught successively at Valparaiso University, Northern Illinois
University, Ferris State College, Bradley University, Northern Michigan

joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty in 1982 as an associate professor,
was granted tenure in 1987, and was promoted to professor in 1991.
In 1983, Professor Fesmire became the faculty advisor of the Student
Accounting Club. Through his guidance, the club petitioned and received a
charter as Eta Xi Chapter of Beta Alpha Psi in 1988. Through the years, he
has continued to lead this group and has been recognized nationally as an
outstanding faculty advisor. The chapter has also twice been named a
Superior Chapter by the national Beta Alpha Psi organization in (1989 and
1990). These honors resulted in two student scholarships and a $5,000 award.
Professor Fesmire has been an active member of the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants, the Michigan Association of Certified Public
Accountants, the National Association of Accountants, the Institute of


294




March Meeting, 1998


Internal Auditors, and the American Accounting Association. He has twice
been the recipient of the Faculty Achievement Award for Distinguished
Service at the University of Michigan-Flint (1987 and 1994) and has also been
awarded the Michigan Accountancy Foundation Doctoral Grant. He is a
member of Beta Gamma Sigma and has served as president of its Flint
chapter; he is also a member of the accounting fraternity, Beta Alpha Psi,
University of Mississippi Chapter.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated
service by naming Walker E. Fesmire professor emeritus of accounting.
Martin Mayman, professor of psychology, College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, and clinical psychologist, Psychological Clinic, Institute

Professor Mayman received his B.S. degree (1943) from City College of New
York, his M.S. degree (1947) from New York University, and his Ph.D. degree
(1953) from the University of Kansas. From 1951-66, he was the director of
psychological training at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas. He was
also a faculty member at the Topeka Institute for Psychoanalysis from 1960-67
and a visiting professor at the University of Colorado and the University of
California at Berkeley (1965-66). He completed psychoanalytic training at the
Topeka Institute for Psychoanalysis, one of the very few psychologists at that
time to be accepted into the program. He came to the University of Michigan as
a visiting professor in 1966 and was named professor of psychology in 1967. He
served as the associate director of the Psychological Clinic from 1967-73 and as
co-director (with Joseph Adelson) from 1974-81.
Professor Mayman's early research focused on personality assessment,
psychological testing, and projective techniques. He continued to research
psychological testing, authoring or co-authoring 28 papers on the topic, many of
which have become classics in the field. He later became interested in shame
and its role in development and in psychopathology. Professor Mayman was a
caring clinical supervisor who influenced generations of clinical psychology
students with his clinical acumen and his extraordinary sensitivity.
Professor Mayman was an advisory editor for a number of journals and
has served on the executive committees of a number of professional
organizations. He is a fellow of the American Psychological Association (APA)
and the Society for Projective Techniques. He has received the Distinguished

administration from 1977-79, and executive vice president from 1979-81;
concurrently, he was an associate professor of higher education from 1975-79
and full professor from 1979-83. In 1981, Professor Womack became the

controller of the State of North Carolina in 1987 and joined the University of
Michigan in 1988 as vice president and chief financial officer and professor of
education. His title was changed to executive vice president and chief
financial officer in 1993.

Management.
The Regents now salute this faculty member and administrator for his
dedicated service by naming Farris W. Womack professor emeritus of
education and executive vice president and chief financial officer emeritus.
Memorials.   Provost Cantor submitted two memorial statements.
Regent Deitch noted the passing of Mark Nickerson, a former member of the
faculty whom he believed had been treated unfairly during his tenure at the
University.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness the death of President Emeritus Harlan H. Hatcher on
February 25, 1998, at the age of 99.
Serving as Michigan's eighth president, from 1951-67, Harlan Hatcher
skillfully led the University during a period of epic change. President Hatcher
envisioned a Michigan destined to serve the nation and the world and worked
with the Regents and faculty to realize that vision. He established the
administrative structures that allowed the University to respond effectively to
phenomenal growth in enrollments and research activity. His presidency was
marked by an unprecedented high level of construction on the Ann Arbor
campus and the purchase and initial development of the North Campus site,
as well as the establishment of the Flint and Dearborn campuses. President
Hatcher was one of the first to see the need for private funds to support
public education; as a result, the University of Michigan became the first
public institution to establish a permanent fundraising unit and to launch a
comprehensive capital campaign.
President Hatcher always sought to nurture academic excellence in faculty
and students.   Annual awards to distinguished professors and the
undergraduate Honors Program were instituted during his administration, and
the Opportunity Awards Program was created to identify and recruit to campus
African American students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In 1959, President
Hatcher headed a State Department educational mission to the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, and in 1962 he led another trip to South America. In 1966,
he participated in the U.S.-Japan Conference on Cultural and Education
Exchange in Tokyo.
Born in Ironton, Ohio, in 1898, President Hatcher received bachelor's
and Ph.D. degrees from The Ohio State University in 1922 and 1927,
respectively. He served as professor of English and vice president at Ohio
State before assuming the presidency of the University of Michigan. He was a
veteran of World War I and a reservist in World War II.
President Hatcher maintained his broad intellectual interests and vitality
throughout his retirement, lecturing broadly, remaining active in numerous
cultural and civic groups, and serving on the state Judicial Tenure
Commission. He also remained an avid golfer, often shooting his age when he
was well into his 80s.
As we mourn the loss of this courageous University president, successful
scholar, and remarkably optimistic and gracious man, our condolences go to
his wife, Anne; his daughter, Anne Berenberg; his son, Robert, and


297




March Meeting, 1998


daughter-in-law, Sherry; and his grandchildren, Jessamyn Hatcher, Juliet
Hatcher, Daniel Berenberg, and Thomas Berenberg.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with great
sadness the death March 6, 1998, of Abramo Fimo Kenneth Organski,
professor of political science, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and
senior research scientist in the Center for Political Studies, Institute for
Social Research.
Professor Organski was an internationally known student of world
politics. His work on the impact of economic growth on international conflict
led to pioneering research on the causes of major wars and on the relationship
between the organization of governments and their ability to mobilize
resources to achieve policy objectives.
Professor Organski was born in Rome in 1923. He came to the United
States in 1939 as his family fled the anti-Jewish laws of the Mussolini regime.
After service in the U.S. Army, he earned three degrees from New York
University: B.A. (1947), M.A. (1948), and Ph.D. (1951). He joined the faculty
of the University of Michigan in 1965 where he remained as professor of political
science and as senior research scientist in the Institute for Social Research from
1969 until his death. He was honored as a guest of the University of Bologna on
the occasion of that university's 900th anniversary and was awarded the
Cavalieri dela Republica by the government of Italy. His books included World
Politics; Population and World Power, co-authored with his first wife, Katherine
Davis Fox; Birth, Death and Taxes, written with several of his students; Stages
of Political Development; The War Ledger, written with Jacek Kugler; and The
Thirty-Six Billion Dollar Bargain.
Professor Organski's intellectual accomplishments were recognized by
numerous honors at the University of Michigan, including the Distinguished
Faculty Achievement Award. In 1992, he was awarded a lifetime achievement
award by the Conflict Processes Section of the American Political Science
Association for his contributions to the study of international conflicts.
Kenneth will be remembered not only for his intellectual depth and originality,
but also for his ebullience, love of language, human warmth, and gift for
friendship. He was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather. Our deepest
condolences go out to his wife, Patricia Joan Bard; his daughter, Elizabeth
Anna Organski-Horn and her husband Steven Horn; his son, Eric Fox
Organski; his grandson, Steven Horn, Jr.; his brother, Guido Organschi, of
Litchfield, Connecticut; and generations of devoted students.
Degrees. There were no actions with regard to degrees.

Appointment of Auditors for 1997-98
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted a recommendation for the
reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 1997-98. He noted
that this would be the twelfth year of this engagement. He pointed out that
while it is good practice to rotate auditors, this year would be an especially
difficult time to do so because of the implementation of the PeopleSoft
project. He noted that the auditors had been told last year that their
engagement would last for three more years, but that he has informed them
that the question of their reappointment next year would be held open for
the time being.
Regent Deitch stated that he strongly encourages Executive Vice President
Kasdin to make the change next year.
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent McFee, the

Health. This health plan represents a new initiative for the University of
Michigan Health System.
Michigan Stadium Scoreboards and Video Production Facility
Executive Vice President Kasdin called on Mr. Tom Goss, athletic director,
to present a request for approval of a project to replace the Michigan Stadium
scoreboards with video scoreboards and to install a video production facility at
Crisler Arena that would be used to produce video images on the scoreboards.
Mr. Goss displayed an illustration of the stadium with the current
electric scoreboards. He then showed illustrations of both internal and
external views of the stadium with the proposed new video scoreboards,
which would be placed at the north and south ends of the stadium. He called
on Mr. Tom Cecchini, director of marketing and communications in the
Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, to describe the proposed scoreboards
and video production facilities.
Mr. Cecchini described the enhancements that would be possible with
the new scoreboard and videoboard, noting that the project also includes an
enhanced sound system. He pointed out that the video production facility
would also allow highlights of football games and other events held in the
stadium, such as commencements, to be broadcast on the Internet.
Executive Vice President Kasdin reported that the proposals had
received the support of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics. Mr.
Goss also noted that Jose-Marie Griffiths, the executive director of the
Information Technology Division, had been involved in the project to ensure
that it fits in with the University's plans in this area. Ms. Griffiths observed
that these projects will bring the Athletics department into the Internet
world. The technology plans described in these proposals are entirely
consistent with what is going on elsewhere at the University.
Mr. Goss stated that consistent with past practices, there will be no
commercialization inside the stadium, including on the scoreboards.
Regent Deitch moved approval of the Crisler Arena video production
facility. Regent McGowan seconded the motion. He then moved approval of
the project for replacement of the Michigan Stadium scoreboards, as described
in the Regents Communication. Regent McGowan seconded that motion.
Regent Deitch commented that these projects will be "wonderful
enhancements to life at Michigan," and that they have the potential to improve
the commencement experience as well as the experience of attending football
games. He said he was pleased that there would continue to be no commercial
sponsorship within the stadium. He also praised the capabilities that will be
made possible by the new production facility, especially the ability to publicize
non-revenue-producing sports.
In response to a question from Regent Horning about the display on the
back side of the stadium scoreboards, Mr. Cecchini stated that on the outside
of the scoreboard on the south side of the stadium, there will be a message


302




March Meeting, 1998


board that will allow for the posting of scores, notices of upcoming events,
and other communications.
The votes were then taken on each of the motions, and they were
approved unanimously.
Trademark Licensing
Mr. Goss observed that there had been a lot of discussion recently about a
proposal made by Duke University regarding licensees who do business in
other countries. He noted that the University of Michigan and over 100 other
universities are affiliated with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC). CLC,
in conjunction with the University of Michigan and other institutions, is in the
process of developing its own code about this issue. He said the Regents would
have an opportunity to review the code before it is finalized.
Regent McGowan said that she had read the code of conduct adopted by
Duke University with enormous interest. She expressed the opinion that
rather than waiting for all of the institutions within the CLC to agree to a
code, the University of Michigan should be a leader in promulgating such a
code. Mr. Goss replied that the University is writing its own code in
conjunction with CLC. He reiterated that because the issue affects the entire
institution, the Regents will have an opportunity to review it before it is
adopted. He said that the decision of whether the University's code is
adopted with the CLC or independent of it is beyond the purview of the
Athletics Department.
Regent Deitch observed that Duke University is also a member of CLC.
He pointed out that he has had "serious, long-standing, concerns about the
University's licensing policy," and that he has never been comfortable with
the University's contract with Nike Corporation.  One reason for that
discomfort is the fact that Nike's labor practices may fall short of the
standards maintained by the University. He said that "it is important for us to
take a leadership role on principle on these issues," particularly since the
University receives more royalties from its licensed products than any other
institution. Therefore, he strongly urged the University to take an affirmative
role, to the point of terminating contracts as a matter of public policy when it
becomes "impossible to get appropriate buy-in to our values from our
licensees."
Mr. Goss said that a draft of the proposed code would be forwarded to
the Regents in the near future.
Revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 11.13 (The Medical School: The
Executive Faculty)
Provost Cantor observed that the proposed revision would grant
membership on the executive faculty of the Medical School to primary
research scientists and clinical II faculty members.
She observed that the purpose of the revision is to be responsive to a
vote in April 1997 by the governing faculty of the Medical School to expand
the executive faculty to include primary research scientists. A similar vote in


303




March Meeting, 1998


May of 1986 had expanded voting membership on the executive faculty to
clinical II faculty. However, due to an oversight, it was discovered in 1997 that
this change to the bylaw had never been recorded. The current proposal,
therefore, is to update the bylaw by including both revisions. Provost Cantor
noted that clinical faculty have been voting as members of the executive
faculty since 1986, and the revision is intended to correct the oversight made
that year and add primary research scientists.
She explained that membership on the executive faculty in the Medical
School for clinical II faculty and primary research scientists means that these
staff members have voting rights, but cannot be elected to the University's
Faculty Senate or the Medical School Executive Committee. Provost Cantor
clarified that clinical II faculty are faculty members hired by the Medical
School with more than 50 percent appointments; they all teach and all work
within a clinical setting. She noted that nine of the ten schools and colleges
with clinical track II faculty have already granted voting privileges to these
individuals.
Provost Cantor observed that there is a growing sense within the
University that a discussion is necessary about the composition of the faculty
and the definition of governing faculty rights and privileges. She said that
discussions were begun last fall within various faculty and administrative
bodies across the University about "the full sense in which we appoint and
evaluate and appropriately privilege different parts of the governing faculty
of the University and the different roles that people play." These discussions
will take place over an extended period of time and should be independent of
the current proposal for revision of the bylaws regarding the Medical School
faculty.
Vice President Neidhardt clarified that primary research scientist
faculty have always been members of the University Senate.
Provost Cantor called on Professor Lou d'Alecy, chair of the Senate
Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA) to present the point of view
of SACUA on this issue.
Professor d'Alecy thanked the Board and the administration for giving the
faculty an opportunity to speak in opposition to a proposed action request.
Speaking from prepared remarks, he urged the Regents to table or otherwise
delay this action for the following reasons: the Bylaws are the foundation of
university governance and should not be changed without full and considered
discussion; this discussion should occur before making changes in the Bylaws;
no urgency has been publicly expressed for making this revision; elected
faculty governance is concerned that this action will set a "damaging pattern"
that ultimately could eliminate tenure-track faculty throughout the University.
Furthermore, Professor d'Alecy stated that since 1990 there has been a
tenfold increase in clinical II non-tenure-track appointments just within the
Medical School, and that with ten schools and colleges now offering similar
tracts, there is a potential for marked erosion in the percent of tenure-track
faculty in these units. The concern with clinical track faculty is that they
primarily practice medicine and operate under a substantially different


304




March Meeting, 1998


incentive structure, and faculty do not believe that practicing medicine is the
equivalent to being an executive faculty member.
Professor d'Alecy said that faculty disagree with the opinion that the
proposed change simply codifies existing practice. Rather it increases the
rights and privileges of the two supplementary tracks and potentially gives
clinical track faculty full, University-wide executive faculty status. Finally,
he questioned the validity of the 1986 vote upon which the current action
request is based. He concluded by requesting that the Regents delay
consideration of the bylaw change.
Following some discussion, President Bollinger said that he was sorry
there was disagreement between SACUA and the administration on this
issue. However, the administration agrees that there are serious issues
about the composition of the faculty and the relationship of tenure-track to
non-tenure-track faculty and the privileges that go along with this. He
reiterated that a group of deans is studying this issue and that Executive
Vice President Omenn has requested that Medical School faculty also
consider it. He said that the question is whether to delay and disrupt
standard practice in the Medical School or to codify what has been standard
practice now but initiate a general discussion of the issues.
In response to a question from Regent McFee, Provost Cantor said that
this bylaw change will have no impact on any other school or college but the
Medical School.
Jayne Thorson, assistant dean for faculty affairs in the Medical School,
described the role of clinical track faculty in the Medical School. She noted
that most are clinical teachers who are not involved in research and who
work off-site, and therefore are not appropriately placed in the tenure track.
However, they play a critical role in the school.
Regent Deitch moved approval of a change in Regents' Bylaw Section
11.13 as described in the Regents Communication.     Regent Maynard
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The following is the text of the new bylaw:
Sec. 11.13. The Medical School: The Executive Faculty
The executive faculty shall consist of all faculty members of the rank
of professor, associate professor, and assistant professor, clinical professor
II, clinical associate professor II, clinical assistant professor II, senior
research scientist, senior associate research scientist, and assistant
research scientist. and those instructors of one or more years' standing
approved by a majority vote of the professorial staff of the Medical School.
It shall perform the duties assigned to the governing faculties of other
schools and colleges.
New Degree Program for the School of Health Professions and
Studies, UM-Flint
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved a new degree program, "Bachelor of Science
305




March Meeting, 1998


in Radiation Therapy," to be offered in the School of Health Professions and
Studies at the University of Michigan-Flint.
Official Enrollment Count Dates for the University of MichiganFlint Campus
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Deitch, the
Regents unanimously approved a change in the official enrollment count
dates for the Flint campus, as described in the Regents Communication.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. Regents'
expenses for February 1998 totaled $1,598.79. The next meeting is scheduled
for April 21, 1998.
Walter Harrison,
Secretary of the University

APRIL MEETING, 1998


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Tuesday, April 21, 1997
The Regents convened at 1:45 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McFee, McGowan,
Power, and Taylor. Also present were Provost Cantor, Executive Vice President
Kasdin, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President and Secretary
Harrison, Vice President Hartford, Vice President Kinnear, Vice President
Neidhardt, Chancellor Nelms, Chancellor Renick, and Interim Co-General
Counsel Barry. Regent Newman was absent.
Resolution in Honor of 1997-98 Hockey Team
Regent McGowan invited Coach Red Berenson, Captain Matt Herr, and
Assistant Captains Bill Muckalt and Marty Turco to join her at the podium.
She then read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan applaud and congratulate
the Michigan Wolverine hockey team and its head coach, Gordon "Red"
Berenson, for winning the 1998 NCAA championship - Michigan's
second hockey championship in three years.
Originally thought to be in a rebuilding phase, the hockey team
earned a 34-11-1 record and demonstrated repeatedly the results of
teamwork, perseverance, and determination by pulling out victories
in close games. Never was this more evident than in the electrifying,
sudden-death overtime win on April 4 at the Fleet Center in Boston. That
night, as they had throughout their college careers, the team's five
seniors provided exemplary leadership. These highly-motivated student
athletes also finished the season as the most victorious class in
Michigan hockey history, with 133 wins and two national championships.
Coach Berenson, himself a former Michigan standout, proved once
again that he is one of the University's most outstanding coaches. He
encourages his players to excel in the classroom and demonstrates
through his words and actions that the education and growth of his
players are his highest priority. As a result, since he took over in 1984,
Michigan's graduation rate has ranked near the top of college hockey,
while at the same time, Coach Berenson's teams have also won two
national championships, gone to the NCAA Tournament eight consecutive times, and made six Final Four appearances in the past seven seasons.
The Regents now salute the entire hockey team, including Captain
Matt Herr and Assistant Captains Bill Muckalt and Marty Turco, as
well as Coach Berenson and his staff, for their exhilarating national
championship season.


307




April Meeting, 1998


There followed a round of applause, after which Coach Berenson thanked
the Board for its support. Captain Matt Herr described the emphasis on
academics that is an invaluable part of being on the hockey team, noting that
players are expected not only to attend class, but to get good grades. He said
that students on the hockey team feel like people really care about them, and
he gave Coach Berenson much of the credit for the success of the program. He
also recognized the support of the academic leaders of the institution and
Athletics Director Tom Goss for contributing to the program's successes.
Report of Child Care Task Force
Provost Cantor noted that the Child Care Task Force, chaired by Dean
Ada Sue Hinshaw, had been commissioned in 1996 and charged with the
responsibility of assessing the needs of the University community with
respect to child care services. She thanked the task force members for their
thorough study and excellent report and noted that she would be presenting
the task force's specific recommendations.
Provost Cantor stated that the University administration is very
committed to the issue of child care, and it will be trying as much as possible to
implement the recommendations according to a staggered schedule. One of
the short-term recommendations is that the University increase its contributions
to the child care scholarship fund to $150,000 annually. Provost Cantor said
that she is in support of this recommendation, and that it will be incorporated
into the 1998-99 budget recommendation. The second recommendation is to
implement a child care program for sick children of employees, known as "Kids
Kare." This program is currently being operated on a pilot basis, but the
University will continue it on a permanent basis at an estimated cost of
$40,000 per year. The recommendation includes a sliding fee scale with a subsidy
for lower income faculty and staff families on the Ann Arbor campus. In
addition, a one-year pilot project to include children of students in this program
will also be initiated to assess need and feasibility.
To help offset the high cost of child care, the University will initiate a
program of a sliding scale subsidy to the existing University-run child care
centers to make it possible for the centers to offer reduced fees to low income
faculty and staff.
The final short term recommendation was to improve the availability of
data on children of faculty, staff, and students. The hope is that further data
collection on child care needs can be done in conjunction with implementation of the PeopleSoft project.
Regarding the Task Force's long term recommendations, the University
will pursue the possibility of finding external funding to expand the North
Campus child care center to provide more space for infants and toddlers.
The other demand recognized by the task force was to improve the off-hour
child care options using existing child care facilities. The administration would
like to support this recommendation, but the complex operational issues it
raises require further study.
The task force also enumerated several policy recommendations that have
strong support across the University community. These include increase the
308




April Meeting, 1998


number of accrued sick days that employees can use to care for sick children.
Provost Cantor said that she would be recommending that changes to the
current policy be put in place by July 1999. Another recommendation was to
encourage deans to consider part-time academic programs whenever possible,
and Provost Cantor noted that she does intend to do this.
Regent McGowan commented that she was delighted to receive the Child
Care Task Force Report. She observed that with the report and the recommendations that are to be implemented, "this university has come a long way
since a very astute and caring sophomore led us on a course to be able to
make some sense out of the child care provisions that the University of
Michigan offers to students, faculty, and staff." She noted that this report
and the provost's recommendations are "extremely heartening" to a great many
people.
Regent Maynard concurred, noting that although there is still a lot of
work to be done, it is exciting that progress is being made. Regent Deitch agreed,
noting that he didn't thin ththat an institution that promotes inclusiveness
and advancement for women can really mean that unless it addresses head
on and in a committed way the issue of childcare. He expressed that it is
important for the University to be a leader in this arena.
Provost Cantor observed that there is widespread support for these
recommendations throughout the campus.
Report of the Committee on the Economlic Status of the Faculty
(CESF)
President Bollinger called on Professor Thomas Dunn, chair of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty, to present the committee's
annual report. Professor Dunn reviewed the report, copies of which were
distributed at the meeting.  He noted that the report had two parts:
recommended guidelines for faculty salaries and direct compensation, and
benefits issues for faculty and staff as a whole.
Professor Dunn reported that CESF believes there are principles which are
applicable to both the determination of direct compensation and of benefits.
These are that compensation should be based on merit; the elements
comprising merit within each unit should be written and disseminated; the
process of determining compensation should be open, without compromising
individual privacy; and that meaningful communication should occur on a
regular basis between unit administration and individual faculty regarding
their performance as it relates to their compensation.
Regarding benefits, Professor Dunn reported that CESF believes that there
are issues relating to the conflicts of interest between the University's roles
as an employer and as a service provider, and that these conflicts should be
recognized and dealt with openly. CESF also believes that with the increasing
decentralization of the University, the wishes of faculty and staff will be even
more important than they have been in the past. He noted that specific recommendations are contained in the Regents Communication.


309




April Meeting, 1998


In response to a question from Regent Power, Professor Dunn outlined
the process by which the CESF's recommendations are reviewed by the
faculty senate and by the administration.
Michigan Student Assembly Biannual Report
Vice President Hartford called on Mike Nagrant, outgoing president of
Michigan Student Assembly.    Mr. Nagrant reviewed the goals and
accomplishments of his presidency over the past year, including holding
down tuition, increasing the hours of operation of the Harlan Hatcher
Graduate Library, and advocating for a student regent. He thanked the
Regents and the administration for the support he'd received during his
term.
Mr. Nagrant then introduced the newly elected MSA president, Trent
Thompson. Mr. Thompson expressed excitement at the prospect of serving
as MSA president for the coming year. He reviewed specific projects that
MSA had initiated and successfully concluded during the past year, and then
enumerated how the University would benefit by having a student regent.
He concluded his remarks by describing new projects planned by MSA for
1998-99.
Regents' Resolution in Honor of Thomas C. Kinnear
Regent Power called Vice President Kinnear to the podium and read the
following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend Thomas C.
Kinnear as he completes his term as vice president for development
on May 3, 1998.
Since assuming this position in September 1994, midway into the
Campaign for Michigan, Vice President Kinnear has provided strong
and effective leadership for what turned out to be the most successful
fundraising drive in University history and the largest ever completed
by an American public university. He quickly became acquainted with
development staff, both in the central development office and in the
schools and colleges, and, traveling from coast to coast, he met with
hundreds of volunteers and donors. By the time the campaign concluded
in September 1997, $1.41 billion had been raised. Since the conclusion
of the campaign, he has been working to establish a long-term
program to continue the University's fundraising momentum.
During his tenure as vice president for development, Vice President
Kinnear oversaw the planning and implementation of a comprehensive
new computer and information management system for development
staff. A superb manager of resources and people, he has fostered open
communication and teamwork among development staff and has
created strong partnerships among the central development office, the
deans and staff in the schools and colleges, and more than 1,500 fundraising volunteers.


310




April Meeting, 1998


Prior to his appointment as vice president for development, Vice
President Kinnear served as senior associate dean in the School of
Business Administration. He was named the D. Maynard Phelps
Professor of Business Administration in 1992 and was appointed the
Eugene Applebaum Professor of Entrepreneurial Studies in December
1997.
The Regents now express their deepest appreciation to Thomas C.
Kinnear for his outstanding service as vice president for development,
and wish him well as he returns to his role as a distinguished faculty
member in the School of Business Administration.
There followed a standing ovation. Vice President Kinnear responded
that it had been a tremendous honor for him to have had the opportunity to
serve the University, noting he had met "the most fantastic people" within
the past four years, including faculty, staff, students, and alumni.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Consideration of the March 1998 minutes was deferred until
the next meeting.
Reports.     Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted reports of
investments, plant extension, and a quarterly report of noncompetitive
purchases over $5,000 from single sources. He noted that reports on the
Long Term Portfolio would continue to be submitted on a monthly basis, but
reports about the other portfolios would be submitted on a less frequent
schedule.
Co-General Counsel Barry submitted the Litigation Report. Vice President
Neidhardt submitted a report on Projects Established for March 1998.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear submitted the monthly
report on voluntary support. He observed that gifts for 1997-98 are on pace
to set an all-time record.

Retirement Memoirs. Provost Cantor submitted retirement memoirs
for six retiring faculty members.
Robert G. Carter, senior associate librarian, retired on April 1, 1998, after
41 years of service.
A native of Iowa, Robert Carter earned his B.A. degree from the University
of Iowa in 1951. Following two years of service in the Army Medical Service
Corps and a year of teaching English in Iowa, he came to Ann Arbor in 1955
to enroll in the University's School of Library Science. He received his M.L.S.
degree in 1956 and joined the University Library in 1957.
From 1960, when he was named the exchange and gift librarian, until his
retirement, Mr. Carter devoted his career to enriching the library's collections
through the acquisition of materials not available through the usual purchasing
channels. He was instrumental in establishing, negotiating, and maintaining
exchange agreements with more than 3,000 institutions from around the
world, bringing to the library materials from Eastern Europe and China when
purchasing from those areas was almost impossible. Because of the library's
extensive relationships with libraries in these countries, he was often able to
acquire obscure materials needed for faculty research, thereby maintaining
the strength of the library's collections, especially in the areas of Slavic and
East European publications.
As part of the exchange process, the University library sends materials
to its exchange partners in return for the materials they provide to the
library. Mr. Carter maintained contacts with many departments around
campus and worked with the University Press to ensure that such materials
were available for exchange. Highly accurate records are also necessary, and
he acted most responsibly in maintaining these records. Due to his depth of
knowledge and years of experience, other institutions would also consult
with him about this process.
Through his dedication to professional excellence and his broad knowledge
of the library and its collections, Mr. Carter has made a significant contribution
to generations of University scholars.
The Regents now salute this librarian for his dedicated service by naming
Robert G. Carter senior associate librarian emeritus.
Thomas S. Cohn, professor of psychology at the University of MichiganDearborn, will retire from active faculty status on April 30, 1998.
Professor Cohn earned his A.B. (1947), A.M. (1948), and Ph.D. (1953)
degrees at the University of Michigan. He began his teaching career as a
lecturer at the University of California at Santa Barbara from 1950-52. From
1953-61, he was on the faculty of Wayne State University, where he was


325




April Meeting, 1998


promoted to associate professor. He joined the faculty of the University of
Michigan-Dearborn in 1961 as associate professor of psychology and sociology
and chair of the Section of Social Sciences. He was promoted to professor in
1965.
As a member of a relatively small faculty body, by necessity Professor Cohn
taught a great variety of courses. He later became best known for his courses in
group dynamics and the psychology of leadership. As a scholar, Professor Cohn's
published work in such publications as American Psychologist, Journal of
Abnormal and Social Psychology, and Journal of Social Psychology reflect his
broad interest and involvement in several subfields of psychology.
In addition to his distinguished faculty career, Professor Cohn made
substantial administrative contributions to the growth and development of the
Dearborn campus as it made the transition from a small, two-year, senior college
to a comprehensive four-year undergraduate institution with an expanding
curriculum and a growing faculty body. Having served as public information
officer for the Michigan Psychological Association and board member and
president of the Michigan Association for Gifted Children, Professor Cohn's
commitment to the profession of psychology has clearly been far-reaching.
The Regents now salute this dedicated teacher and senior member of the
Dearborn faculty by naming Thomas S. Cohn professor emeritus of psychology.
Izzeddin S. Habib, professor of mechanical engineering at the
University of Michigan-Dearborn, will retire from the active faculty status on
April 30, 1998, after many years of faithful and dedicated service.
Professor Habib received his B.M.E. degree from the American University
of Beirut in 1956, his M.S.M.E. degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in
1961, and his Ph.D. degree (mechanical engineering) from the University
of California at Berkley in 1968. He worked as a design engineer in Beirut,
Lebanon, from 1957-60, as a group leader at Chrysler Corporation from 1964-66,
and as a research assistant at the University of California at Berkley from
1966-68.
Professor Habib joined the University of Michigan-Dearborn as an
assistant professor of mechanical engineering in 1969. He was promoted to
associate professor in 1970 and professor in 1973. He served as chair of the
Department of Mechanical Engineering from 1971-75 and as interim chair
from 1990-92.
Professor Habib was a visiting scholar at Stanford University in 1975 and a
visiting professor at the Laboratoire d'Etudes et de Recherches en Mechanique
Energ6tique des Surfaces, in Nancy, France, in 1989. He served as chair of the
ASME K-12 Committee on Aerospace Heat transfer from 1983-86. Professor
Habib has been involved in engineering education for more than 30 years and
has lectured nationally throughout his career.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Izzeddin S.
Habib professor emeritus of mechanical engineering.
Evelyn L. Smith, head of technical services and librarian in the Law
Library, retired on March 31, 1998.
Ms. Smith received her A.B. degree from Antioch College in 1963 and her
A.M.L.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1964. She joined the
University of Michigan Law Library as a cataloger in 1964. She was promoted to


326




April Meeting, 1998


chief catalog librarian in 1970 and head of the Technical Services Department in
1987.
Librarians in academic and research libraries considered Ms. Smith to be
an expert in all types of cataloging. Under her guidance, the cataloging and
related records at the University of Michigan Law Library became nationally
known for carefulness, completeness, and intellectual thoroughness. As
libraries were able to use each other's computerized records, Ms. Smith's work
became accessible to ever more libraries, first in the United States and now,
via the internet, around the globe.
Ms. Smith's major contributions to the profession were through participation in professional organizations such as the American Library Association
and the American Association of Law Libraries, which developed standards for
machine readable records. At Michigan, she trained two generations of catalogers
directly and strongly influenced dozens of other professional librarians who
were her colleagues over the last 34 years.
Ms. Smith's expertise was critical to every major undertaking in the Law
Library: using computers to assist in cataloging in 1979; moving half the
collections to the Allan and Alene Smith Addition in 1981; implementing an
integrated computer system for all Law Library records in 1991; and overseeing
the conversion of catalog cards to computer format in 1998. Ms. Smith
remained firmly committed to creating and maintaining bibliographic records
which met the scholarly and research needs of those who used, and those who
worked in, the Law Library. The solid foundation she created will forever
support scholarly research in the Law Library.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming Evelyn
L. Smith librarian emerita.
Paul K. Trojan, professor of metallurgical engineering at the University
of Michigan-Dearborn, will retire from active faculty status on April 30, 1998,
following 42 years of service.
Professor Trojan received his B.S.E. degree in 1955, his M.S.E. degree in
1956, and his Ph.D. degree in 1961, all from the University of Michigan. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1956 as an instructor in chemical
and metallurgical engineering and moved to the Dearborn campus in 1960.
He was promoted to assistant professor in 1961, associate professor in 1964,
and professor in 1970. Professor Trojan also served as chair of the Engineering
Division from 1962-64, acting dean of the School of Engineering from
1980-82, and interim dean from 1988-90.
Since 1956, Professor Trojan has conducted sponsored research on the Ann
Arbor campus, and many of his publications have resulted from such research
cooperation. He has also lectured nationally throughout his career. He is a
member of the American Foundrymen's Society, American Society for Metals,
American Society for Engineering Education, and a number of honor societies.
He received the American Society for Metals' Henry Marion Howe Gold Medal
in 1963, the American Foundrymen's Society's Thomas Pangborn Gold Medal
in 1978, and the Best Research Paper award from the Brass and Bronze
Division of the American Foundrymen's Society eight times.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming Paul K. Trojan professor emeritus of metallurgical engineering.

April Meeting, 1998


Gregory S. Y. Yeh, professor of materials and metallurgical engineering
in the Department of Chemical Engineering, will retire from active faculty
status on April 30, 1998, following 31 years of service.
Professor Yeh earned his B.S. degree in physics from Holy Cross College in
1957, his M.S. degree in engineering physics from Cornell University in 1960,
and his Ph.D. degree in polymer physics from Case Institute of Technology in
1966. From 1960-64, he worked as a research physicist at Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Company and then as a senior research physicist at General Tire and
Rubber Company. After completing postdoctoral studies at Case Institute of
Technology in 1966, Professor Yeh joined the faculty of the University of
Michigan College of Engineering as an assistant professor in 1967. He was
promoted to associate professor in 1969 and professor in 1972.
His work, documented in 80 scientific publications and numerous invited
presentations at scientific meetings all over the world, spanned a wide range of
timely topics, with emphasis on the morphology and kinetics of single and
multiple polymeric systems and on solid state polymer processing and deformation. He also made seminal contributions to the morphology and kinetics of
strain-induced crystallization of polymers and to the elucidation of chain
conformation in amorphous polymers.
Professor Yeh was twice named a Fulbright Scholar, and he received a
Humboldt Award three times. In Germany, he was a visiting professor at the
University of Ulm, the Technical University of Berlin, and the Max Planck
Institute in Berlin. Later, he also served as a visiting professor at the
University of California at Berkeley and the University of Technology, South
China. Within the College of Engineering, Professor Yeh had an impact not
only through developing and teaching polymer courses, but also through his
role as Ph.D. thesis advisor for 15 students.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Gregory S. Y. Yeh
professor emeritus of materials and metallurgical engineering.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported this
month. However, President Bollinger noted the deaths of three emeritus

MAY MEETING, 1998


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, May 14, 1998
The Regents convened at 1:45 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Maynard, McFee, Newman, Power, and
Taylor. Also present were Provost Cantor, Executive Vice President Kasdin,
Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President and Secretary Harrison,
Vice President Feagin, Vice President Hartford, Vice President Neidhardt,
Chancellor Renick, and Interim Co-General Counsel Barry. Regents Deitch,
Horning, and McGowan and Chancellor Nelms were absent. Provost Renate
McLaughlin attended in place of Chancellor Nelms.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and welcomed Vice President Susan Feagin to her first Regents' Meeting.
Resolution in Honor of Walter Harrison
President Bollinger called on Regent Newman, who noted that this
would be the last Regents' Meeting for Walter Harrison. Regent Newman
called Vice President Harrison to the podium and read the following
resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate and
commend their loyal friend and trusted adviser Walter Harrison,
vice president for university relations and secretary of the university,
as he leaves the University on May 31, 1998, to become president of
the University of Hartford.
Vice President Harrison came to the University of Michigan as
executive director of university relations in 1989, was named vice
president in 1993, and was appointed secretary of the university in
January 1998. With his quick intelligence, ready smile, and keen
insight, he has provided a calm, clear voice during times of spirited
debate. Whether handling controversies surrounding athletics, indirect
cost recovery, or affirmative action, Vice President Harrison has been
a responsive and steady presence, always available to support and
provide counsel to Regents, executive officers, and the broader
University community.
Under Vice President Harrison's leadership, the University's
media relations efforts were successfully restructured, and the oncefaltering fortunes of Michigan Radio have been reversed to the point
where in the past year it experienced the largest percentage increase
in audience and fund-raising of any public radio station in the


333




May Meeting, 1998


country. As a member of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics, Vice President Harrison provided strong leadership as
chair of the NCAA Athletics Certification Steering Committee. He
also has been an inspiring and popular teacher of undergraduate
students, conveying his passion for American literature and culture
with eloquence and good humor.
The Regents now salute Walter Harrison for his numerous
contributions to the University community as an executive officer,
faculty member, and friend. The Regents also express their appreciation
to Dianne Harrison for her equally dedicated years of service and
leadership and extend warmest best wishes to Walt and Dianne as
they embark on their exciting new adventure at the University of
Hartford.
There followed a standing ovation. Vice President Harrison responded
that "it's been the highest honor of my life to serve the University of Michigan,"
and thanked everyone for their support and friendship.
Report on "The Year 2000 Problem"
Provost Cantor introduced Jose Marie Griffiths to present a report on
what is being done to prepare the University infrastructure for the year
2000. Dr. Griffiths described what is meant by "The Year 2000 Problem"
and what the consequences would be if it were not addressed. She noted that
most of the centrally-managed systems that handle most critical business
functions will be Year-2000 compliant by the end of calendar year 1998, and
the remaining ones will be compliant by February 1999. An institution-wide
information awareness campaign has recently been launched to make people
aware that this is a problem they need to address. In addition, every unit on
campus has a Year-2000 representative who is responsible for assessing the
ability of that unit to continue operating through the Year 2000. Once the
status of each unit is known, then plans will be made for addressing any
remaining problems.
Discussion ensued about costs, institution-wide compliance, and other
challenges related to this issue. Executive Vice President Kasdin pointed out
that with the PeopleSoft implementation a number of aspects of the software,
which could have been problematic with respect to the Year 2000 problem,
are being addressed.
Regent Power suggested that periodic reports be made to the Board
about how this issue is being addressed, and it was suggested that the first of
these be given this summer. In response to a question to Dr. Giffiths from
Regent Power about whether adequate support is being provided for addressing these matters, she responded that it was. The unit assessments being
conducted across the institution, including action plans, will be completed by
September 1. Units will also be preparing quarterly reports about implementation of their action plans which can be made available to the Board.
Following further discussion, the Regents turned to the Consent Agenda.

"absolutely overwhelmed by the sterling quality of the research and teaching"
of the promotion candidates.
Regent Power observed that in reviewing the recommendations, he had

Retirement memoirs. Provost Cantor submitted 26 retirement memoirs.
Sally L. Allen, professor of biology, will retire from active faculty status on
May 31, 1998, following 31 years on the faculty at the University of Michigan.
Professor Allen received her A.B. degree from Vassar College in 1946 and
her Ph.D. degree from the University of Chicago in 1953. At Chicago, she
worked on the genetics of the mouse with two of the most famous geneticists
of the twentieth century, Sewall Wright and George Snell, who later received
a Nobel Prize for the work on which she participated. Professor Allen came to
the University of Michigan in 1953 as a research assistant in the Department
of Zoology, where she carried out research in the single celled ciliates. She
was promoted to associate professor of botany in 1967 and professor in 1971.
She also served as an associate dean of the College of LS&A from 1988-91.
For most of her career, Professor Allen's research has focused on the
genetics and evolution of the ciliated protozoa, an unusual group of organisms
with a bizarre life cycle that have produced many fundamental insights into the
functioning of all organisms. She is recognized as a national and international
leader in this field. For many years, she has served as editor of Genetics, the
field's premier scientific journal.
Professor Allen's classroom activities have centered around the large
junior-senior majors course in genetics. She strove long and hard to make
improvements in this course and to have it keep pace with the revolutionary
advances in this field. Her devotion to the honors course in genetics has
been much appreciated by past and present students alike.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Sally L.
Allen professor emerita of biology.
Richard D. Duke, professor of urban planning in the College of Architecture and Urban Planning, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1998.
Professor Duke received his B.S. degree (1952) from the University of
Maryland, his B.S. (1954) and Master of Urban Planning (1956) degrees from
Michigan State University, and his Ph.D. degree (1964) from the University
of Michigan. From 1958-67, he was an assistant professor (1958-63), associate


352




May Meeting, 1998


professor (1963-67), professor (1967), and director of the Urban-Regional
Research Institute (1966-67) at Michigan State University. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as professor of urban planning in December 1967.
Professor Duke served as chair of the Urban Planning Program from
1976-82. He has taught a range of graduate-level courses to urban planning
students, with a particular concentration on gaming. He has served on a
number of dissertation committees and has also been an active member of
many program, college, and University committees.
Professor Duke has had an outstanding career as an educator. He is a
member of NASAGA (North American Gaming and Simulation Association)
and a founding member of both ISAGA (International Simulation and Gaming
Association) and IPEG (International Policy Exercise Group). A pioneer in the
field of gaming, he is internationally recognized for his contributions in the
field of simulation and gaming, not only for his theoretical work, but also for
the significant contributions he has made in making this approach to strategic
planning known throughout the world. He has authored numerous games,
books, and articles on gaming and simulation.
Professor Duke has received many awards, including the ISAGA 25th
Anniversary Award in 1995 for the founding of ISAGA and the ISAGA Medal
and the Medaille Praga Didacta in 1989. He received a National Science
Foundation Faculty Fellowship in 1962-63; studied in Germany as a Fulbright
Scholar in 1969; and was a fellow in the Netherlands Institute for Advanced
Study in 1973-74.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Richard D.
Duke professor emeritus of urban planning.
Joe G. Eisley, professor of aerospace engineering, will retire from
active faculty status on May 31, 1998, following a 42-year career at the
University of Michigan.
Professor Eisley received his B.S. degree in aeronautical engineering in
1951 from Parks College of St. Louis University and his M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees in 1952 and 1956, respectively, from the California Institute of
Technology. He joined the University of Michigan as an assistant professor
in 1956 and was promoted to associate professor in 1960 and professor in
1965. Professor Eisley also served as associate dean for curriculum and
continuing education in the College of Engineering from 1967-81.
Professor Eisley has done research in the areas of structural dynamics,
flutter, and computer graphics and has published extensively in the area of
nonlinear vibrations. He has been very effective in the teaching of structural
mechanics and in converting academic ideas into industrial practice. In 1989,
he published the textbook, Mechanics of Elastic Structures. Professor
Eisley's students have consistently rated him as an outstanding teacher. He
pioneered the use of energy methods in structural mechanics and guided the
department's program in structures in that direction. This has made the
department a leader in the methods that have culminated in the broad use of
the finite element method, with many students from other departments
attending the aerospace engineering department's structures courses.
One of Professor Eisley's emphases has been to increase minority and
female enrollment in the College of Engineering. He has served as a contact


353




May Meeting, 1998


for visits by minority students and for summer visits by women sponsored by the
Society for Women Engineers. He has served on the University's President's
Commission on Minority Affairs. Professor Eisley has also devoted much
effort to serving as undergraduate program advisor for aerospace engineering,
and has served on the departmental curriculum committee. He has been the
director of the Space Grant College activities at Michigan, dealing with
outreach at all educational levels, encouraging elementary school children to
become interested in space activities and high school students to take the
courses necessary to pursue a career in space-related activities.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Joe G. Eisley
professor emeritus of aerospace engineering.
Daniel N. Fader, professor of English, will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 1998.
Professor Fader received his B.A. (1952) and M.A. (1954) degrees from
Cornell University and his Ph.D. degree (1962) from Stanford University.
He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an instructor in 1961. He
was promoted to assistant professor in 1963, associate professor in 1968, and
professor in 1973.
Professor Fader was, above all, a great storyteller, and in his teaching
(especially of Shakespeare) he drew students into the great narratives of
English literature. As a scholar he was a storyteller too, and he brought to
his work a persuasive and even compelling brilliance. He was in great
demand as a lecturer and a commencement speaker.
Early in his career at Michigan, he began working with juvenile offenders
at the Maxey School in Whitmore Lake. From his work with young people
there, he wrote a modest pamphlet: "Teaching English at Boys Training School"
(1965). Working with Professor Elton B. McNeil, he enlarged this small effort
into Hooked on Books (1966), a revolutionary affirmation of the transforming
power of literacy that has gone through successive editions and still influences teachers, parents, and students to believe that reading changes
children's lives.
Professor Fader also believed that the literacy of Michigan students
could be transformed if only teachers would be attentive to students' voices.
In 1976, he was named founding chair of the English Composition Board, a
faculty body which oversees literacy efforts in the College of LS&A. With his
colleagues, he visited high schools throughout the state to explain what kind
of literacy was expected at the U-M and how important it was that students
come prepared to learn.
Though Hooked on Books was his most influential publication, his books
The Naked Children (1971) and Paul and I Discover America (1975) were
also widely read. The former is an account of pupils disabled by the schools
in our nation's capital, the latter a road book in which he examined patriotism
and its transformation from his generation to his son's. Professor Fader told
stories about caring for others, and made others care to tell stories too. He
remains particularly proud of having been the 1952 National Collegiate
Billiards Champion.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Daniel N. Fader
professor emeritus of English.

Irene Fast, professor of psychology, will retire from active faculty status
on May 31, 1998.
Professor Fast received her A.B. degree from Bethel College in Kansas in
1951 and her Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1958. From
1958-63, she was a lecturer in the Department of Psychology. She left in 1963
to serve as chief of psychological services at the San Fernando Valley Child
Guidance Clinic in California but returned to the University of Michigan in
1965 as a lecturer in psychology. She was promoted to associate professor in
1968, professor in 1973, and professor of psychology in the Department of
Psychiatry in 1974. She served as associate director of the counseling center
from 1982-87.
Within the department, Professor Fast played a central, prolonged, and
demanding role in formal courses and agency supervision in the diagnostic
training of clinical psychologists. Also greatly valued was her assistance in
the complicated transition years as the Counseling Center was transformed
into the current University Center for the Child and Family.
Professor Fast's scholarly contributions have had a significant impact,
beginning with her early work on bereavement and on step-parenting and her
papers demonstrating the vital role of personality variables in vocational
choice. Subsequent investigations produced new perspectives on depression
and borderline personalities, especially with respect to nature of borderline
psychotic children. But perhaps her most compelling studies were set forth in
her books, Event Theory: A Piaget-L-reud Integration; Gender Identity: A
Differentiation Perspective; and the forthcoming Selving: A Relational Theory of
Self-Organization. Event Theory is a powerful recasting of concepts of early
development, pressing far beyond earlier work. Gender Identity builds a richly
textured new formulation of gender differentiation from wide-ranging sources
of evidence. Selving seeks to bring psychology back to the study of the
neglected I-Self (self as subject) component of William James' distinction of
I-Self vs. Me-Self (self as object), in the process drawing a persuasive picture of
a dynamic, relational self. Recognition of this remarkable set of contributions
has led to numerous roles on editorial and advisory boards and to the awarding
of distinguished honors from the American Psychological Association.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Irene Fast
professor emerita of psychology.
Carl Gans, professor of zoology in the Department of Biology and
adjunct curator, Museum of Zoology, College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1998, following 25
years of service.
A native of Germany, Professor Gans fled the Nazis with his family and
entered the United States in 1939. He received his B.M.E. degree from New
York University in 1944 and then served in the U.S. Army from 1944-46. He
received his M.S. degree from Columbia University in 1950 and his Ph.D.
degree from Harvard University in 1957. From 1958-71, he was a faculty
member at the University of Buffalo (now SUNY at Buffalo). He joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1971 as professor and chair of the Department
of Zoology.


355




May Meeting, 1998


During his tenure as chair of the zoology department, Professor Gans
participated in the merger of the Department of Botany and Zoology into
what became the present Department of Biology. Following his term as
chair, he continued as professor and served on numerous university and
college committees, including the LSA Executive Committee. In 1996, he
assumed the latest of many visiting professorships, this one in the Department
of Zoology at the University of Texas, Austin.
Professor Gans' research specialty is functional morphology, the fusion
of anatomy and physiology that aims to interpret biological structure in
terms of its function. Within this specialty, he has concentrated on reptiles
and amphibians, contributing importantly to such fundamental topics as
breathing, eating, and locomotion. His classroom activities were centered on
the course, "The Biology of Vertebrates," which was famous among undergraduates for the demanding laboratory involving vertebrate dissection;
among graduate student instructors for the high standards imposed; and
among counselors for the distinction of being one of the few courses that
students praised even when they did not received a good grade.
Professor Gans is known worldwide, due to the many working visits that
he made to universities and museums all over the globe and to his collecting
trips, exemplified by his role as founding patron of the Irula Snake-catcher's
Cooperative Society in Madra, India.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Carl Gans
professor emeritus of zoology.
Rosalie J. Ging, M.D., assistant professor of psychiatry, retired from
active faculty status on February 28, 1998, after a productive career as an
administrator, teacher, and clinician.
Dr. Ging received her A.B. degree in 1942 and her M.D. degree in 1945,
both from the University of Michigan. She completed a psychiatric residency
at the University of Kansas Medical Center in 1952. She joined the University of Michigan as an instructor in 1957 and was promoted to assistant
professor in 1965.
Dr. Ging was appointed as a staff psychiatrist at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center in 1956. She served as chief of the psychiatry service at
the Ann Arbor Veteran's Administration Medical Center from 1960-84 and as
acting chief from 1984-86. She was responsible for administering and coordinating clinical supervision and education of psychiatric residents and medical
students. She has been a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association since
1967 and was selected as Federal Professional Woman of the Year in Michigan
in 1972.
Dr. Ging continues her clinical activity as an attending psychiatrist with
the Consultation-Liaison Service. She is a consultant in the MCD Cardiology
Clinic. Dr. Ging's research activity includes a study of Cushing's patients
and involvement in Telemedicine for the Department of Psychiatry.
Dr. Ging's devoted loyalty as administrator, teacher, clinician, and
mentor has been recognized over the years. Her insightfulness, expertise, and
contributions to the department have been consistently recognized by
faculty, trainees, and staff.

May Meeting, 1998


The Regents now salute this distinguished member of the faculty for her
dedicated service by naming Rosalie J. Ging assistant professor emerita of
psychiatry.
Assya K. Humesky, professor of Slavic languages and literatures, will
retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1998.
Born in the former Soviet Ukraine, during World War II Professor
Humesky lived under German occupation and was sent to Austria to do forced
labor until the end of the war. After spending two years in displaced persons
camps in western Europe, she came to the United States and resumed her
studies. She received her B.A. degree in 1948 from Albertus Magnus College
in New Haven, Connecticut, and her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees, in 1951 and
1955, respectively, from Radcliffe College. Professor Humesky came to the
University of Michigan in 1953 as an instructor in Slavic languages and
literatures. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1959, associate
professor in 1961, and professor in 1967.
Among Professor Humesky's published works are articles dealing with
poetry and poetics as well as language teaching. The book that resulted from
her dissertation, Majakovsky and his Neologisms (Rausen, N.Y., 1964), is
unique in that it lists all the instances of word coinage by the famous
Russian poet. This book is well-known and used by many Slavic scholars.
Professor Humesky is also co-author of a widely acclaimed two-volume
Russian grammar, Modern Russian (Harcourt, Brace & World, N.Y., 1964,
1965) and the author of Modern Ukrainian, now in its sixth printing
(Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, Edmonton-Toronto, 1980). The
Russian grammar was the first to use the audio-lingual approach and the
first to illustrate Russian intonation. The Ukrainian textbook is the most
widely used introductory grammar of the language in the world, including
Ukraine itself, where it is used in Kiev at the International Ukrainian
Studies Summer School.
Professor Humesky has served as president of a number of scholarly
organizations, including the Permanent Ukrainian Conference at Harvard,
the Slavic section of the Michigan Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American
Association for Ukrainian Studies, and others. She has directed scores of
doctoral dissertations and many of her former students are teaching throughout the United States.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Assya K.
Humesky professor emerita of Slavic languages and literatures.
Joachim W. Janecke, professor of physics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1998.
Professor Jainecke received his Dipl.Phys. (1952) and his Dr.rer.nat.
(1955) degrees from the University of Heidelberg. He first came to the
University of Michigan in 1960 as a research associate and lecturer. After
leaving for Florida State University in 1962, he returned to the University of
Michigan in 1965 as an associate professor. He was promoted to professor in
1969. Professor Janecke has also been a frequent visiting professor at
laboratories in Germany, the Netherlands, Israel, and particularly Japan,


357




May Meeting, 1998


where he received a fellowship from the Japanese Society for the Promotion
of Science and a COE professorship from Osaka University.
Professor Janecke has served the University of Michigan in many roles,
including terms on the Rackham graduate school executive board, the Senate
Assembly, and on other University-wide committees. He has served as chair
or member of 29 dissertation committees. Professor Janecke was elected a
fellow of the American Physical Society in 1972 and has served as associate
editor of Atomic Data and Nuclear Tables, a standard reference source.
In a distinguished research career, Professor Janecke has contributed to
physics theory with the development of nuclear mass models that are widely
used in nuclear astrophysics and nuclear physics to predict masses for unstable
and unknown nuclei.   He has also coauthored the field's authoritative
compendium of beta-decay functions.
In experimental research, he has conducted precision measurements of
Coulomb energies in nuclei and other nuclear reaction measurements related
to the isospin part of the nuclear force. He has also performed systematic
studies of a-particle transfer reactions and clustering in nuclei, such as 2C
and 160, to very long-lived a-decaying nuclei, such as 238U. He has been at
the forefront in high-resolution studies of charge-exchange reactions and
giant resonances, which are manifestations of the nuclear many-body system.
He has performed reaction studies with short-lived unstable nuclear beams,
particularly with high-energy tritons.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Joachim W.
Janecke professor emeritus of physics.
Lawrence W. Jones, professor of physics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1998.
Professor Jones received his B.S. (1948) and M.S. (1949) degrees from
Northwestern University and his Ph.D. (1952) degree from the University of
California at Berkeley. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
instructor in 1952 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1956, associate
professor in 1960, and professor in 1963. He served as chair of the department from 1982-87.
During his first decade at Michigan, he collaborated intensively in the
Midwest Universities Research Association (MURA), an accelerator design
and development group that pioneered the concept of colliding beams and
other innovations now universal in modern accelerators. With colleague Kent
Terwilliger, he built a small electron accelerator that demonstrated a
number of the new concepts he had developed with MURA. This model
became the vehicle for his first participation in international conferences in
the 1950s and early 1960s. Since then, he has collaborated at most of the
major accelerator laboratories, most recently at CERN in Europe.
Professor Jones' detector contributions include development of the
luminescent (scintillation) chamber, various optical spark chamber concepts,
and the ionization calorimeter for hadron energy measurement. His accelerator
experiments include hadron cross sections, elastic and inelastic scattering,
particle production, dimuon production, prompt neutrino production, and
charm production by protons. During the 1980s, he served as leader of the


358




May Meeting, 1998


team that developed a state of Michigan site proposal for the national Superconducting Super Collider.
At a time when accelerator facilities could provide energies no higher
than 30 GeV, Professor Jones exploited cosmic rays for free quark searches
and for the study of strong interactions at energies above 100 GeV. His
expertise in both cosmic-ray and accelerator physics has made him a much
sought-after intermediary between the two groups. Recently he has been
part of a project to use lasers as compact electron accelerators for particle
physics-so-called "table-top accelerators." He has also made contributions
in medical radioisotope imaging and helped pioneer the concept of hydrogen
as an alternative chemical fuel.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Lawrence W.
Jones professor emeritus of physics.
Virginia C. Kane, associate professor of history of art, will retire from
active faculty status on May 31, 1998.
Professor Kane received her B.A. degree from Mount Holyoke College in
1956 and her M.A. degree from the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University,
in 1961. She earned her Ph.D. degree from Harvard University in 1969, with
a dissertation entitled "Chinese Bronze Vessels and their Inscriptions." She
came to the University of Michigan in 1969 as an instructor and was
promoted to assistant professor in 1970 and associate professor in 1975.
Throughout her career at the University, Professor Kane has been a
devoted teacher of Asian art and Buddhist studies. Although her specialized
research has focused on Chinese bronzes, her range in the classroom has
been extraordinary-moving across temporal and cultural expanses in China,
Japan, and Southeast Asia, tracing the story and meanings of international
Buddhism through the artistic record. A deeply learned scholar and a
demanding instructor, Professor Kane's seminars are widely acknowledged
by multiple generations of graduate students in the Department of History of
Art as a superb training ground in research methodology and pedagogy as
well as in the substantive areas under discussion around the table.
Professor Kane contributed significantly to the creation at Michigan of
an Asian art program of international acclaim. Her efforts to build the
department's visual resources in Asian art and to maintain and enhance the
quality of its publication, Ars Orientalis, leave an inspired legacy of her
commitment to excellence.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Virginia C.
Kane associate professor emerita of history of art.
C. Philip Kearney, professor of education, School of Education, will
retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1998, after 18 years of service to
the University of Michigan.
Professor Kearney received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University
of Portland (Oregon) in 1954 and 1960, respectively; he was awarded his
Ph.D. degree in 1967 from the University of Chicago. From 1967-68, he
served as assistant superintendent of the Orange Local School District in
Cleveland. From 1968-77, Professor Kearney served as associate superintendent
in various capacities for the Michigan Department of Education. From 1977-80,

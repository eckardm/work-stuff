The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
July 15, 2010
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Maynard, Ilitch, Newman, and Richner. Also
present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice
President Harper, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President
Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regents
Taylor and White participated by telephone. Regent Deitch was absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order and welcomed Phil Hanlon to his
first meeting as provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. She
announced that for the 16th consecutive year, the University of Michigan Hospitals and
Health Centers has been placed on the honor roll of America's Best Hospitals by U.S.
News and World Report. The University was ranked 14th overall, and all of its
specialties were ranked.
President Coleman also commented on a visit to campus by the Gary Locke,
secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce, to attend a forum on universities' role
in economic development, and mentioned that she had been appointed co-chair of the
newly formed National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. She
reported that the Solar Car Team had won the American Solar Challenge with its car,
Infinium, marking the third consecutive and sixth overall championship since the race
began in 1990. President Coleman concluded her remarks by announcing that the
incoming freshman class of about 6,350 will be the largest in school history.
President Coleman called on Kevin Graffagnino, director of the William L.
Clements Library.
Presentation by Kevin Graffagnino
Mr. Graffagnino, director of the Clements Library, described the history of the
Clements Library, and noted that its world-class collection of documents pertaining to
early American history is used by serious scholars from around the world. He pointed
out that as director, he has been working hard to make the library welcoming and
accessible and integrate it more fully into the library system and the campus.
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report - Ann Arbor Campus
Professor Fred Askari, chair of the Ann Arbor CESF, presented this report. He
noted that with 50% of faculty eligible to retire in the next three years, competition for
recruiting and retaining top faculty will increase, so improvements in compensation and
benefits packages are needed. The committee also requested that it have input in
choosing the institutions against which the University is benchmarked in studies of
salaries and benefits. Other recommendations included improvements in disability

benefits, retirement benefits, the tuition assistance program, and campus fitness
facilities.
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report - Dearborn Campus
Professor Seth Hirschomrn, of the Dearborn  campus, highlighted four
recommendations from the Dearborn CESF: 1) Adjust the salaries of those faculty
whose salaries are "outliers" compared with those of others; 2) Increase faculty salaries
so they are at or above the mean of those of peer institutions; 3) Link merit pay
increases to the cost of living; 4) adjust the salary levels of administrators and faculty
so that the salaries grow at the same rate, rather than grow further and further apart.
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report - Flint Campus
Professor Christopher Douglas, chair of the Flint Campus CESF, reported that
the committee focused on two areas: comparisons of UM-Flint faculty salaries to those
of peer institutions, and the decline in the number of tenured and tenure-track faculty
that is occurring concurrent with growth in student enrollment and academic programs.
This enrollment growth is being met by an increase in the number of full and part-time
lecturers and professional/administrative positions. The committee recommends an
increase in the number of full, associate, and assistant professors in a manner consistent
with program and enrollment growth.
University of Michigan Film Office
Ms. Lee Doyle, director of the Film Office, gave a presentation describing the
University of Michigan Film Office, which was established within the Office of the
Vice President for Communications in 2008. Since that time, ten movies have been
filmed on campus. She pointed out that having movies filmed on campus provides
opportunities for students to learn about and gain experience in the film industry and
also boosts the local economy by increasing hotel room, business, and restaurant sales.
Regental Committee Assignments for 2010-2011
Regent Darlow, chair of the Board of Regents, announced that she, Regent
Newman, and Regent Deitch would serve on the Health Affairs Committee, with
Regent Deitch serving as chair. Regents Richner and Ilitch will serve on the Personnel,
Compensation and Governance Committee, with Regent Richner serving as chair.
Membership on the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee will include Regents
White, Maynard, and Taylor, with Regent White continuing as chair.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that she and Regent Maynard,
Executive Vice President Slottow, and for the latter part of the meeting, President
Coleman, had participated in the meeting. The agenda included the 2010 Human
Capital Report, which examined the most recent faculty and staff demographic data
with Associate Vice President Laurita Thomas and University Human Resources Senior
Business Analyst Tom Palmer. She reported that the committee had requested that this
data be presented at a formal board meeting later in the year. The committee then met
with Carol Senneff, executive director of University audits, and Associate Vice

﻿July Meeting, 2010

for a series of compounds to aid in the discovery and development of new drugs.
Another area of his work explored the prediction of protein conformation from the
amino acid sequence by converting these sequences into three-dimensional structures in
order to discover their biological function, thus leading to the construction of potential
functions that globally favor the native conformations. Professor Crippen is known as
an effective educator, especially at the graduate level, where his clarity of expression
and insight are greatly appreciated.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scientist and educator for his
dedicated service by naming Gordon M. Crippen professor emeritus of pharmaceutical

Alternative Asset Commitment
Executive Vice President Slottow informed the regents that a follow-on
commitment of $15 million had been made to Sequoia Capital 2010, L.P.
South State Commons II, LLC
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Newman, the regents
approved a restated lease agreement with State Commons II, LLC, for property located
at 1000 Oakbrook Drive, and the South State Commons II, LLC Data Center Leasehold
Improvements Project, as described in the regents communication. Regent White
recused herself from voting due to a conflict of interest.
University Endowment Distribution Policy
Executive Vice President Slottow submitted a request for approval of adjusting
the endowment distribution rate from 5.0 percent to 4.5 percent as a means of more
effectively protect the purchasing power of the University's endowments and the
distributions they provide. The adjustment would be implemented in such a way that
there would not be a reduction in endowment distribution per share as a result of the
change.

15






﻿July Meeting, 2010

Regent Newman moved that beginning with the distribution for the quarter
ending September 30, 2010, the distribution rate begin to be lowered from 5.0 percent
to 4.5 percent to more effectively protect the purchasing power of the University's
endowments and the distributions they provide. The distribution rate would continue to
be based upon the one-quarter lagged 28 quarters average market value of endowment
shares. The lowering of the distribution rate would be implemented gradually over a
number of years in a flexible manner. Distributions would be managed towards the 4.5
percent distribution rate by keeping quarter to quarter distributions per share unchanged
only when prior increases in share value otherwise would result in higher per share
distributions. Furthermore, she moved that the upper limit on distributions remain at
5.3 percent of the current market value to protect the value of the University's
endowment in down markets. Regent White seconded the motion.
Regent Darlow stated that she opposes this recommendation because she
believes it does not adequately address the University's responsibilities to the public.
She said that those opposed to lowering endowment spending rates argue that since
endowments are built through tax privileges granted to donors, tax-free funds should
not be hoarded, while proponents reason that they are maintaining the value of the
endowment for perpetuity. Regent Darlow noted that some people believe colleges are
more concerned with their own financial well-being than in providing a quality
education, and while she disagrees with this view, she expressed concern that adoption
of this proposal would provide fodder for it. She believes that, rather than focusing on
conservatively stockpiling earnings, the University should concentrate on continuing to
enhance its remarkable development efforts and investment practices that have built the
endowment in recent years. She expressed concern that reducing the endowment
payout would lead to a reduction in endowment funds that are designated for financial
aid and instruction. She believes the current spending rule provides strong and
appropriate limitations on endowment spending, and cautioned that "it would be wise
not to change it at this time."
Regent Richner stated that he believes that based on a 4.1% return on
endowment over the past 10 years, "we simply cannot sustain a 5% spending rule
annually," and the spending must be reduced in order to preserve the corpus. Regent
Maynard said that after having consulted with a number of individuals, both within and
outside the University, she has come to the same conclusion as Regent Richner.
Adjusting the spending rule would be a way to maintain, with minimal damage, the
value of the University, and to ensure it thrives. Regent Taylor stated that he also
supports the proposal, as it is based on the recommendation of the University's own
expert staff and advisors.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved, with Regents Maynard,
Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White in favor, and Regents Darlow and Ilitch opposed.
Crisler Arena Renovation
Executive Vice President Slottow introduced Donald Dethlefs, president of Sink
Combs Dethlefs, to present the schematic design for the Crisler Arena renovation
project. Mr. Dethlefs noted that the major focus of the renovation would be
infrastructure improvements, including life safety, mechanical, and electrical systems,
and roof replacement. More visible improvements include construction of a portal that

16






﻿July Meeting, 2010

On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Richner, the regents
unanimously approved the schematic design for the Crisler Arena Renovation Project
as presented at the meeting.
Golf Practice Facility
Executive Vice President Slottow introduced Daniel Jacobs, senior principal
with Ann Arbor Architects Collaborative, to present the design for the indoor golf
practice facility. Mr. Jacobs displayed a floor plan of the facility, noting there would be
a driving range, putting and chipping area, and space for both men's and women's
teams. He displayed exterior renderings, pointing out that coaches' offices would be
situated so as to allow them to watch students using the driving range.
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Richner, the regents
unanimously approved the schematic design for the Golf Practice Facility Project as
presented at the meeting, and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding
construction contracts, providing that the bids are within the approved budget.

exterior rendering. On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Richner, the
regents unanimously approved the schematic design for the Institute for Social
Research Addition Project, as presented at the meeting.
North Campus Chiller Plant Expansion
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Maynard, the regents

﻿SEPTEMBER MEETING, 2010

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
September 16, 2010
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Ilitch, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Lampe,
Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President
Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice
President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She commented on recent
activities marking the beginning of the new school year, including the opening of North
Quad, the rededication of the renovated Michigan Stadium, and the completion of the
Central Campus Transit Center.  She noted that "EarthFest," highlighting the
University's sustainability efforts, would be held next week, and announced that on
October 13 and 14 the University would be commemorating the 50th anniversary of
John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech to University of Michigan students on the steps of the
Michigan Union that led to the formation of the Peace Corps.
President Coleman recognized Jun Min ("Lion") King, member of the men's
golf team and winner of the 2010 U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship, and his
coach, Andrew Sapp, who were present. She noted that winning this championship
qualifies Mr. King to compete in the 2011 Master's Tournament in Augusta.
President Coleman commented on the passing of alumnus and former standout
student athlete Ron Kramer. She also congratulated Regent Darlow, chair of the Board
of Regents, on being recognized by Michigan Lawyers Weekly as one of the state's
leading lawyers.
Statement by Regent Darlow
Regent Darlow commented that recent events are of great concern to the board,
and read the following statement on behalf of the board: "When any member of the
University of Michigan community is targeted because of his or her identity, we are all
attacked. We know that our community will continue to stand together and uphold the
University's values with dignity and respect."
Institute for Social Research at 60
President Coleman noted that the Institute for Social Research (ISR) has been a
pioneer in survey research for 60 years, and called on James Jackson, director of ISR.
Professor Jackson noted that the motto of ISR is "social science research in the
public interest," and said that this is an accurate description of the kind of research done
within the institute. He described a number of projects currently underway at ISR,
including the "Survey of Consumer Attitudes," which surveys a national sample of the

25






﻿September Meeting, 2010

population on a monthly basis to try to understand how the American public views
unemployment, opportunities for economic growth, and similar issues. This survey,
which produces the "Index of Consumer Sentiment," has been shown to be predictive
of economic behavior, and is the only index used by the federal government in setting
various rules, regulations, and policies in these areas.
Other surveys include the "Monitoring the Future" project, which yields
information regarding drug use among adolescents in the United states across time, the
"American National Election Studies," which has been ongoing since 1948 and is used
by political scientists around the world to gain an understanding of American politics.
The "Panel Study of Income Dynamics" seeks to gain an understanding of what
happens to people and families across time as their economic circumstances change,
and has transformed our understanding of poverty. Several studies address the issue of
our aging population and its transformative consequences, including the "Health and
Retirement Study" and "Society 2030 Consortium."
Professor Jackson also highlighted the Army Study to Assess Risks and
Resilience in Service Members ("Army STARRS"), whose goal is to develop data-
driven methods for mitigating or preventing suicide behaviors and improving the
overall mental health and behavioral functioning of Army personnel during and after
their Army service. This is a very large, $50 million dollar study involving several
other universities and a number of component studies, and is expected to become a
major part of ISR activities over the next ten years.
Professor Jackson noted that in 2009-10, ISR received more than $130 million
in funding, including $41 million in stimulus funding. ISR employs 1,231 individuals,
including Ph.D. research scientists, permanent staff, and contingent staff, and is
planning to hire 40-50 new scientists over the next ten years. Building expansion is
underway to serve the needs of the five research centers within ISR, funded in part by
stimulus grants provided by the National Institutes of Health.
In the discussion that followed, it was noted that many ISR studies are regularly
cited in the national media. Professor Jackson further pointed out that ISR is both
interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, with more than 22 different disciplines
represented.

voluntary support activity for 2009-2010. He noted that total receipts for 2009-10 of
about $254 million represent a decrease of about 4%, which can be attributed to the
ongoing economic downturn. Of this, about $154 million is from individuals, an
increase of $5 million from the previous year. Corporate giving was off by 1%.

﻿OCTOBER MEETING, 2010

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
October 14, 2010
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room.        Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Maynard, Ilitch, Newman, Richner, Taylor,
and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Vice President Harper, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor
Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz,
Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regent Deitch was absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She called attention to the
University's celebration of the 50th anniversary of the events that launched the Peace
Corps, and the 55th anniversary of the announcement at the University of Michigan that
the polio vaccine was safe and effective. The latter milestone is being recognized on
November 4 by the award of the Thomas Francis, Jr. Medal in Global Public Health to
Dr. Alfred Sommer on November 4, 2010. President Coleman congratulated Regent
White on having been recognized by Wayne State University Law School with the
school's highest honor for teaching. She called on Regent Darlow.
Statement by Regent Darlow
Regent Darlow commented that since making their statement at the last month's
meeting, the board had been proud of the way the University had come together in such
a positive way. To express their appreciation and support, she announced that the
board would like to make an additional statement, which she read on behalf of the
board:
When we first became aware of the targeting of one of our students, we sent a swift and
powerful message: This must stop. As we said at our September 16 meeting, when one member
of our community is targeted, we are all attacked. As the elected governing body of the
University of Michigan, we want to express our unequivocal support for the decisive way the
University has responded to this unfortunate situation. We are proud of the way the Division of
Student Affairs immediately reached out to offer support to our students. We are encouraged by
the coordinated approach from many units and individuals throughout the University
community to address the situation with thoughtfulness and compassion. Looking ahead, we
will remain ever vigilant to unacceptable displays of intolerance. At the University of
Michigan, we often speak of the "Michigan Difference": those unique attributes that set us
apart. Today we appreciate the values that are common to all of us.
Social Media in Higher Ed: Teaching and Learning
President Coleman called on Jeffrey Mackie-Mason, dean of the School of
Information, and E.J. Westlake, associate professor of theatre, for a presentation on the
role of social media in teaching and learning.
Dean Mackie-Mason described social media as "platforms on which we build
opportunities for on-line interactions." His presentation described the uses being made

71






﻿October Meeting, 2010

of this technology both in the classroom and in society in general, focusing on the
impact of social media on both teaching and on learning. He also pointed out that it is
incumbent upon faculty to teach students the moral and civil uses of this technology to
ensure that students understand the consequences of using it to invade privacy or to
engage in cyber-bullying.
Professor Westlake, a scholar who studies the performance aspects of the on-
line self through Facebook, discussed her research on how students learn appropriate
behavior through their participation in social media. She noted that despite popular
perception, college-age students tend to use Facebook as a means to bond and to set
behavioral norms.
A discussion followed, covering such topics as Wikipedia, "back channel"
learning and how it is used in the classroom, and University classes that focus on social
media. It was noted that it isn't the mere fact of the technology and using it that makes
it either educational, harmful, or distracting, it is learning how to harness it so as to
benefit education and learning.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that the committee, consisting of
herself and Regents Maynard and Taylor, had met that morning with Executive Vice
President Slottow. Regent Darlow and President Coleman also attended the meeting.
The first agenda item was a review of the Report of Investments as of June 30, 2010
with Chief Investment Officer Erik Lundberg. Regent White reported that due to Mr.
Lundberg's "excellent and outstanding work," the value of the endowment on that date
was $6.6 billion, an increase of $600 million since June 30, 2009. The investment
return on the Long Term Portfolio was 12.3%, 2 percentage points ahead of benchmark
and equal to that of the average university endowment. The annualized ten-year return
of the Long Term Portfolio was 6.2%, which is 2.6 percentage points ahead of the
benchmark and significantly ahead of the S&P 500, which experienced an average
annual loss of 1.6 percent for the same period.
Regent White noted that last year, the University distributed $255.6 million
from the endowment to support operations, up from $244 million in FY2009 and $227
million in FY2008. Over the past five years, $1.5 billion in endowment distributions
has been returned to the units to support University operations. She concluded, "Our
Long Term Portfolio performance over the past ten years is in the top quartile of
investment returns for University endowments, and we look forward to continuing
strong investment returns given our strategic and prudent fiscal policies, coupled with
our aggressive cost-containment measures."
Regent White noted that the committee also reviewed the debt program rating
strategy with Associate Vice President Rowan Miranda, University Treasurer Greg
Tewksbury, and Assistant University Treasurer Milagros Dougan.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner,
chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that he and
Regent Ilitch had attended this meeting. Provost Hanlon presented two reports: the

72






﻿October Meeting, 2010

annual report of dean and major director reviews and searches, and a faculty
recruitment and retention report.
President's Performance Review
Regent Richner reported that the Personnel, Compensation and Governance
Committee, along with the entire board, had completed its annual performance review
of the president, and made the following comments:
"I am pleased to say that by all measures, the University is doing quite well under the
leadership of President Coleman. President Coleman and the outstanding leadership team she
has assembled have continued to promote the academic standing of the University while acting
as responsible stewards of our financial resources, all in the face of a challenging academic
environment. This year, we saw an increase in financial aid to record levels, sustained our AAA
bond rating, brought in over $1 billion in research funding, kept our resident undergraduate
tuition increase to the lowest level in over 25 years, increased our endowment, opened the first
new residence hall in over 40 years, retained and recruited top-notch faculty, moved in to the
North Campus Research Complex, improved our Health System operating margin, and
rededicated a renovated and expanded football stadium. This year, President Coleman was
named one of the ten best university presidents by Time magazine. All in all, a pretty good
year."
Accordingly, on behalf of the committee and the board, he moved that in
addition to extending their personal gratitude for a job well done, the board approve a
3% increase in President Coleman's salary, effective August 1, 2010. He noted that
this recommendation is well supported by the market salary data that the committee
reviewed. Regent Maynard approved the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
President Coleman thanked the board for their support, noting how much she
enjoyed working with her executive team and with the board.
Health Affairs Committee. The Health Affairs Committee did not meet this
month.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.

University of Michigan Health System. There was no additional report
regarding the University of Michigan Health System.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper had no additional report.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Person noted that the Flint campus
is looking forward to hosting the November Board of Regents meeting.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little reported on several
recognitions recently received by the Dearborn campus that illustrate the impact of the
university on metropolitan Detroit. These include the 2010 Detroit Public Television
Partnership Award, the New Detroit "Closing the Gap Award," and individual awards
received by Vice Chancellor Ed Bagale and Professor Orin Gelderloos in recognition of
their community and civic involvement.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. MSA president Chris Armstrong
described MSA sponsored activities and initiatives that have been going on in recent
weeks. He also expressed his gratitude to the University community for the support
that has been expressed for him in recent weeks. "The support the University has
expressed has been incredibly humbling for me, and has motivated me to keep moving
in my service to the student body. I would not be here if it were not for the University
of Michigan, and its reaction [to recent events] has reignited my faith in the institution."
He further cited the "Elected by Us, Respected by Us" campaign created by the Dean of
Students office to promote tolerance and a positive atmosphere on campus. He
expressed hope that the positive attitude that has been established on campus will
continue to promote a safe space for future students.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted the report on voluntary
support for September 30, 2010. He thanked Chief Investment Officer Erik Lundberg
and Executive Vice President Slottow and their teams, noting that their professional
leadership and resulting investment performance and financial oversight greatly
enhance the confidence that donors have in giving private support to the institution. He
then described how social networking, using such tools as Facebook, blogging, texting,
and crowd sourcing has become a very important tool in the fundraising process.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to determine: (i) the specific amount of the cost of each
component of the Project to be financed from the proceeds of the Bonds; (ii) the portion, if any, of the
Notes to be refinanced using the proceeds of the Bonds; and (iii) the portions, if any, of the Outstanding
General Revenue Bonds, Senior Lien Indebtedness and Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds to be
refunded using the proceeds of the Bonds, based on whether such refinancing would produce interest
costs savings, more favorable debt service schedules, more flexible documentation or a more favorable
security structure for such outstanding indebtedness, and to cause to be called for redemption such of the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, Senior Lien Indebtedness and Outstanding Hospital Revenue
Bonds as is appropriate and consistent with the foregoing objectives. Subject to the Issuer's policies
regarding approvals of capital projects, any Authorized Officer may subsequently approve additional
components of the Project and specify that such additional components shall be financed in whole or in
part from the proceeds of the Bonds, upon which occurrence such components shall thereupon become
components of the Project hereunder.
2. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Bonds in one or more series
to be designated GENERAL REVENUE BONDS, with appropriate series designations, if any, in the
aggregate original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but not to exceed the
principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE MILLION
DOLLARS ($225,000,000) for the Project and costs related to the issuance of the Bonds, plus the
amount, if any, required to refund all or any portion of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, Senior
Lien Indebtedness, Notes and Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds and costs related to the refunding.
The Bonds shall be dated as of the date or dates established by an Authorized Officer, and shall be issued
for the purpose of providing funds which, together with other available funds, will be used to pay all or a
portion of the costs of the Project, all or a portion of the costs of refunding all or a portion of the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, the Senior Lien Indebtedness, the Notes and the Outstanding

98






﻿October Meeting, 2010 - Appendix

Hospital Revenue Bonds and the costs related to the issuance of the Bonds and the refunding, including
capitalized interest, if any, for such period as an Authorized Officer may determine appropriate, and bond
insurance premiums, if appropriate. The Bonds shall be serial bonds or term bonds, which may be subject
to redemption requirements, or both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first
maturity shall be no earlier than April 1, 2011 and the last maturity shall be no later than December 31,
2045. The Bonds may bear no interest or may bear interest at stated fixed rates for the respective
maturities thereof as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the weighted average yield
(computed using the stated coupons and the stated original offering price) for the Bonds shall not exceed
7.0% per annum for tax-exempt Bonds or 11.0% per annum for taxable Bonds, and the Bonds may be
issued in whole or in part as capital appreciation bonds, which for their term or any part thereof bear no
interest but appreciate in principal amount over time at compounded rates (not in excess of 7.0% per
annum for tax-exempt Bonds or 11.0% per annum for taxable Bonds) to be determined by an Authorized
Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds may bear interest at a variable rate of interest for all or a
portion of their term, and the variable rate of interest shall not exceed the lesser of the maximum rate
permitted by law or the maximum rate, if any, to be specified in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds may be
subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the times and prices and in the manner as
shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but no redemption premium shall exceed 3% of the
principal amount being redeemed unless the redemption price is based on a "make whole" formula, in
which case no redemption premium shall exceed 40% of the principal amount being redeemed. Interest
on the Bonds shall be payable at such times as shall be specified by an Authorized Officer. The Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered form in denominations, shall be payable as to principal and interest in
the manner, shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be executed and authenticated, all as shall
be provided in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds shall be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond
Purchase Agreement or through a competitive sale or bidding process pursuant to a Notice of Sale for a
price to be established by an Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of original
issue discount, shall not exceed 1.5% of the principal amount thereof) plus accrued interest, if any, from
the dated date of the Bonds to the date of delivery thereof.
All or any portion of the Bonds may, subject to the parameters set forth above, be issued as Build
America Bonds or under any other structure established or enhanced by the provisions of ARRA, and in
connection therewith, each of Authorized Officers is authorized to make, for and on behalf of and as the
act of the Issuer, any and all designations or elections (revocable or irrevocable), to execute and deliver
any agreements, certificates or other instruments to or with the federal government or any agency thereof
or the State of Michigan or any agency thereof, and to take any other actions necessary for the Bonds, the
holders of the Bonds and the Issuer to receive any benefits, funds or federal subsidies available under
ARRA.
In relation to the debt service on all or any portion of the Bonds, or in relation to debt service on all or
any portion of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds or the Senior Lien Indebtedness, any of the
Authorized Officers may, at any time, on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into an interest rate
swap, cap, forward starting swap, option, swaption, rate lock or similar agreement or agreements
(collectively, the "Swap Agreement") with a counter-party or counter-parties to be selected by the
Authorized Officer. Such Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the Issuer and the
counter-party related to interest on all or a portion of the Bonds, the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds
or the Senior Lien Indebtedness, at indexed or market established rates. If the Swap Agreement is entered
at approximately the same time as the issuance of the Bonds, the expected effective interest rates on the
Bonds, taking into account the effect of the Swap Agreement, shall be within the limitations set forth
herein. Any Swap Agreement in the form of an option, swaption or forward starting swap may, if the
Bonds to which such agreement relates are not ultimately issued, be required to be terminated, with a
possibility of a resulting termination payment due by the University.
Any or all of the Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the option of the holder thereof or
to mandatory tender. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any Bonds subject to tender options may be
made payable from General Revenues, from available cash reserves of the University, subject to such
limitations as may be specified in the Trust Indenture, or from, directly or as support for the cash
reserves, a letter of credit, line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity device, or
one or more of the same, or any combination thereof (collectively, the "Liquidity Device"), all as shall be
determined by an Authorized Officer. The Liquidity Device, or any part thereof, may also be used to

99






﻿October Meeting, 2010 - Appendix

provide liquidity for any other indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer, including the Notes, the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, any variable rate Senior Lien Indebtedness and any variable rate
Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds. Any reimbursement obligation for draws under the Liquidity
Device shall be a limited and not a general obligation of the Issuer, payable from, and may be secured by
a pledge of, General Revenues. Any portion of the Liquidity Device which provides liquidity for any
Senior Lien Indebtedness or Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds may, but shall not be required to, be
additionally or alternatively payable from, and may be secured by a lien on, any revenue stream securing
the obligations for which the liquidity is provided. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and
deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any agreements or instruments necessary to obtain, maintain,
renew or replace, and provide for repayments under, any Liquidity Device deemed by such officer to be
required for the purposes of this Resolution.
Any Bonds authorized and issued hereunder may, at any time, upon direction of an Authorized Officer,
be subsequently converted to another mode or structure authorized hereby, either through procedures
established in the Trust Indenture pertaining thereto, or through the issuance hereunder of refunding
bonds to refund and replace the outstanding Bonds to be converted. Any such refunding bonds issued
hereunder shall be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Resolution. Any
Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any documents or
instruments, including but not limited to, any amendments to the Trust Indenture, necessary or convenient
for the purpose of accomplishing the conversion as described in this paragraph.
3. The Bonds, and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement, if any, and the Liquidity
Device, if any (except as specifically provided otherwise in Section 2 hereof or below in this Section 3),
shall be limited and not general obligations of the Issuer payable from and secured by a lien on the
General Revenues (as shall be defined in the Trust Indenture in a manner generally consistent with the
definition thereof contained in the Trust Agreements pursuant to which the Outstanding General Revenue
Bonds were issued), subject only to the senior liens on portions of General Revenues securing the
respective series of Senior Lien Indebtedness (until each respective series of such Senior Lien
Indebtedness is paid or defeased in accordance with its terms). The lien on General Revenues securing
the Bonds shall be on a parity basis with the lien securing the Notes and the Outstanding General
Revenue Bonds. The Bonds and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement, if any, and the
Liquidity Device, if any, may also be payable from and secured by a lien on moneys, securities or other
investments from time to time on deposit in certain funds created pursuant to the Trust Indenture or
agreements entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount of or interest or premium on the Bonds,
or for the payment of any amounts owing under the Swap Agreement, if any, or the Liquidity Device, if
any, or any claim based thereon against the State of Michigan, or any officer or agent thereof or of the
Issuer or the University, as individuals, either directly or indirectly, nor, except as specifically provided in
the Trust Indenture or the instruments entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or the
Liquidity Device, if any, against the Issuer, nor shall the Bonds and interest with respect thereto, or any
obligations of the Issuer in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or Liquidity Device, if any
(except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 2 hereof), become a lien on or be secured by any
property, real, personal or mixed of the State of Michigan or the Issuer, other than the General Revenues
and the moneys from time to time on deposit in all or part of the funds established by the Trust Indenture
or the agreements entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or Liquidity Device, if
any.
Any pledge of General Revenues, and funds specified in the Trust Indenture or agreements entered into in
connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or Liquidity Device, if any, shall be valid and binding from
the date of the issuance and delivery of the Bonds or such agreements, and all moneys or properties
subject thereto which are thereafter received shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without
physical delivery or further act. The lien of said pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties
(other than the holders of any outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations secured by a senior or parity
lien on any portion General Revenues) having a claim in tort, contract or otherwise against the Issuer,
irrespective of whether such parties have notice of the lien.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any obligations of the Issuer under the Swap
Agreement or any agreement with respect to the Liquidity Device may, if determined appropriate by an

100

General Revenues at levels expressed as a percentage of debt service on the Bonds or all General
Revenue Bonds, with respect to the issuance of additional bonds, notes or other obligations payable from
and secured by General Revenues, and with respect to limitations on or prohibitions against the issuance
of additional Senior Lien Indebtedness. In addition, any Authorized Officer is hereby authorized,

determined by an Authorized Officer, selection of the Underwriter and the setting of the terms for all or
any portion of any series of the Bonds may be made through a competitive sale or bidding process. Any
Authorized Officer is authorized to accept the winning bid or offer of the Underwriter for the purchase of
such Bonds.

﻿NOVEMBER MEETING, 2010

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
November 18, 2010
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. on the campus of the University of
Michigan-Flint. Present were President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Maynard, Ilitch,
Newman, Richner, and Deitch. Also present were Vice President and Secretary
Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Provost Hanlon, Vice
President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive
Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President
Slottow, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regents White and Taylor participated in the
meeting by phone.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She commended the UM-Flint
for having been named Michigan's fastest-growing public university. President
Coleman also congratulated Regents Newman and Richner on their recent re-election to
the board. She pointed out that Rick Snyder, Michigan's newly elected governor, has
three degrees from the University of Michigan and he understands the value of higher
education and the role it plays in the state's economic vitality. President Coleman
noted that a satellite designed and built entirely by University of Michigan students was
being launched the next day. She called on Regent Darlow.
Motion by Regent Darlow
Regent Darlow requested that as chair of the Board of Regents, she be allowed
to chair the meeting during consideration of the motion she was about to make, and
President Coleman ceded the chair. Regent Darlow then made the following motion:
Appointed by the Board of Regents to serve as the University's 13th president in 2002
for an initial five-year term, Mary Sue Coleman is now serving in her ninth year as president of
the University of Michigan. Following a thorough review of her performance in 2006, the Board
renewed her appointment for a second five-year term. That second five-year term ends July 31,
2012.
Throughout her service to the University, President Coleman has performed to
extraordinarily high standards and has gained extraordinarily wide recognition for her
excellence. We have seen many fine institutions falter during this period -- an unsettling and
uncertain time. President Coleman has kept our focus firmly on our mission, and we have
achieved outstanding accomplishments on global, national and local levels. For the entire
University community, she has preserved and strengthened our balance, our direction and our
self- confidence.
In recent months, the regents and President Coleman have discussed whether her
appointment should be extended. The motion I propose reflects a conclusion that extending her
appointment now for a two-year period, beginning Aug. 1, 2012 and ending July 31, 2014, is in
the best interest of the University.
To implement this conclusion, my motion includes approval of an amendment to the
president's present employment agreement with the University. This amendment sets forth
important goals for the board and the president to focus on in the next four years. They include:

105






﻿November Meeting, 2010

To strengthen the University's core academic mission and enhance its worldwide
stature as a center for excellence in teaching and scholarship.
To develop financial strategies for a spectrum of resources (tuition, state support,
research grants and contracts, philanthropy and other revenue sources) to preserve and
enhance the University's academic excellence, accessibility and affordability.
To enhance the University's mission and its campus life with improved facilities across
the campus, including, but not limited to, building on the success of the Residential Life
Initiative to improve University housing across the campus.
To position the University for continued success and to maximize the University's
reputation for quality and innovation in the rapidly developing global market for higher
education.
To develop plans for a new capital campaign.
To strengthen the position and preserve the excellence of the University's health care
system.
The proposed amendment also includes provisions for the board and the president to
work collaboratively to develop strong candidates for leadership positions throughout the
University, including its presidency. While not intended to supplant national leadership
searches, the amendment is intended to enrich the University's leadership pool.
The amendment also    addresses various transition possibilities and  related
compensation with respect to the last year of the extended presidential term.
With respect to compensation, the amendment leaves in place the president's current
salary and benefits package and carries the benefits stated in her present agreement forward for
the two years of the extended term. This means that the president's salary is not increased by
the amendment. It will continue to be reviewed annually by the board and any increases will be
set at the discretion of the board, taking into consideration performance and other relevant
factors, as we did at our last board meeting in October.
In addition, the amendment adds a supplemental deferred compensation program to
President Coleman's benefit package that will contribute $100,000 a year for this contract year,
ending July 31, 2011, and for each of the following three contract years. This compensation
will not be received by President Coleman until the end of her service as president. The
amendment is designed to build a substantial contribution to her retirement over the remainder
of her term. Certainly, she has earned it!
Based on these considerations, and with deep appreciation to President Coleman for
her service to this great university, I move that her appointment as president of the University
be extended for a two-year term, ending July 31, 2014, and that the Amendment to the
Employment Agreement between the University and the president, in the final form presented to
the regents prior to this meeting and attached to this resolution, be approved and entered into
the minutes of this meeting for the public record.
Regent Darlow called for a second to the motion, and Regent Maynard
responded, "I think we all want to second this motion." Several regents noted that there
was no need for discussion, due to Regent Darlow's comprehensive, well-expressed
motion. The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously. A round
of applause followed.
President Coleman stated that she was excited and honored by this vote of
confidence by the board. "I have had so much fun over the last eight years," she said.
"And now in my ninth year (I can't believe it's been nine years!), we've had enormous
challenges we've had to face. Since the University of Michigan is such a prominent

institution, it's always going to be in the center of everything that's important
happening in higher education. I am grateful to have the ability to work with my vice
presidents-the greatest team in the world-and to work with the board to advance the
University."
"One of the things that I believe so much is that every year we have to offer a
better experience to students than we offered the year before. It simply has to keep
getting better. We will have to find ways to keep ourselves affordable and accessible,
and I am committed to doing that. I want the people in the future to look back and say
that those of us who were here at this time-me, our regents, our board, our vice
presidents, our deans-did the right things for the University. We made the right
decisions and we moved the institution forward. That is the kind of legacy that I want
to have for the University. I look forward to the next four years. It's been a great
experience and it will be a great experience going forward, so thank you very much."

Presentation: "Wyatt Exploration Program"
Chancellor Person commented that the Wyatt Exploration Program was made
possible by a generous bequest from Dr. Dorothea E. Wyatt, who was one of the
original faculty members of the Flint College when it was founded in 1956 and was the
first chair of the Department of History. Regent Maynard noted that she had known Dr.
Wyatt, and believes she would have been pleased at how her bequest is being used.

and Theodesia Robertson, associate professor of history, gave a presentation about the
Wyatt Exploration Program and the recent expedition to Poland that had been made by
students participating in this program.

Professor Ed Rothman, chair of SACUA, commented that the reappointment of
President Coleman was "wonderful news," and noted that President Coleman and the
other members of the administration enjoy the full support of the faculty. He reviewed
some of the issues that SACUA and the Senate Assembly are currently addressing, and
noted that SACUA has been focusing on becoming more proactive in addressing issues
of concern. Overall, however, he said that the faculty is "a happy group."

﻿November Meeting, 2010

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for three
retiring faculty members.
John A. Faulkner, Ph.D., professor of molecular and integrative physiology,
Medical School, and professor of biomedical engineering, College of Engineering,
retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2010.
Professor Faulkner received his B.A. (1949) and B.P.H.E. (1950) degrees from
Queen's University and his M.S. (1956) and Ph.D. (1962) degrees from the University
of Michigan. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1960 as an associate
supervisor of physical education and was promoted to assistant professor in 1963 and
associate professor in 1966. He became associate professor of physiology in 1966 and
was promoted to professor in 1971. He was appointed professor of biomedical
engineering in 1974.
Professor Faulkner made significant contributions as a scholar, teacher, and
administrator in the molecular and integrative physiology and biomedical engineering
departments and in the Institute of Gerontology. During his tenure as associate director
and as an active participant in the Institute of Gerontology and its biogerontology
program, Professor Faulkner helped lead the Institute to national prominence. In 1995
and 2000, he was principal investigator of a National Institute on Aging grant that led
to the Institute's funding as one of the Nathan Shock Centers of Excellence in the
Biology of Aging. Professor Faulkner's superb administrative skills also played a
pivotal role in the establishment of the Department of Biomedical Engineering in 1996.
An internationally recognized expert in the fields of exercise science, muscle
physiology, and biogerontology, Professor Faulkner has served as an editor or on the
editorial boards of the most prestigious journals in his field, and has published more
than 130 journal articles and some 70 book chapters and reviews. His contributions
have been recognized by the American College of Sports Medicine, the Gerontological
Society of America, the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering, and
the American Physiological Society. Professor Faulkner chaired or co-chaired 36
doctoral committees and supervised 21 postdoctoral fellows. In 1997, he received the
University's Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his 50 years of
dedicated service by naming John A. Faulkner professor emeritus of molecular and
integrative physiology and professor emeritus of biomedical engineering.
Roberto R. Kampfner, Ph.D., associate professor of computer and information
science, College of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan-
Dearborn, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2010.
Professor Kampfner received his B.S. degree from the National Polytechnic
Institute of Mexico in 1962, his M.Sc. degree from the London School of Economics
and Political Science in 1975, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in
1981. From 1981-87, he served on the faculty of Wayne State University. He joined
the University of Michigan-Dearborn faculty in 1987 as an associate professor in the
School of Management (now College of Business). In 1992, he became associate
professor of computer and information science in the College of Engineering and
Computer Science.

123






﻿November Meeting, 2010

Professor Kampfner's research interests focused on the application of biological
information processing principles and mechanisms to the analysis and design of
information systems in modem organizations. His publications included a biologically
motivated approach to the analysis of distributed control and information processing, the
integration of molecular and digital computing from an information systems development
perspective, dynamics and information processing in adaptive systems, digital and
biological computing in organizations, and adaptability and the integration of computer-
based information processing into the dynamics of organizations. His work contributed to
understanding how knowledge about the structure of control and function of an
organization can help determine its information processing requirements.
Professor Kampfner was a highly valued and dedicated instructor who was well-
liked by his students. He enjoyed teaching and believed in the importance of the
analytical approach to the core information systems courses he taught, and he also
made substantial service contributions at the department, school, and campus levels.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and educator by naming
Roberto R. Kampfner associate professor emeritus of computer and information
science.
Robert L. Simpson, Ph.D., professor of biology and environmental science,
College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters, professor of science education, School of
Education, and former provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs, University of
Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2010.
Professor Simpson received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from Fresno State
College in 1965 and 1967, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from Cornell University
in 1971. He was a faculty member at Rider College from 1970-85, and was dean of the
School of Science and Mathematics at William Paterson College from 1985-91.
Professor Simpson joined the University of Michigan-Dearborn faculty in 1991 as
provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs and professor of biology. In 2006, he
completed his appointment as provost and returned to the faculty, receiving an
additional appointment as professor of science education in the School of Education.
Professor Simpson's research focused on freshwater wetlands, with special
emphasis on the ecology of tidal freshwater wetlands of the upper Delaware River
estuary. His work addressed a range of topics, including life history strategies and
production processes of aquatic macrophytes, decomposition processes, nutrient and
heavy metal cycling, and marsh paleoecology, and produced a significant record of
research and publications. As provost from 1991-2006, Professor Simpson led campus
efforts to expand applications of instructional technology, advances which enabled the
campus to launch several distributed learning initiatives. He also focused on improving
the campus infrastructure. Among other initiatives, he headed capital outlay projects in
the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the College of Arts, Sciences,
and Letters. Professor Simpson played a major role in developing a sense of campus
life at the Dearborn campus, including instituting regular forums to highlight faculty
research and scholarship, supporting presentations of undergraduate research projects,
and sustaining efforts to enhance ethnic, gender and cultural awareness.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Robert L.
Simpson provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs emeritus, professor emeritus
of biology and environmental science and professor emeritus of science education.

Center, clarifying the Department of Internal Medicine's responsibility for oversight of
the administration of the Geriatrics Center and the reporting line for the director of the
Geriatrics Center to the chair of the Department of Internal Medicine. Details can be
found in the regents communication.
Annual Operating Request to the State for the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
Provost Hanlon submitted the annual operating request to the state for the
University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus for fiscal year 2012. The request is for an
appropriation increase of 2.6%.
Regent Newman questioned why the University isn't asking for a higher
increase to make up for inflation and for the significant loss of state funding in recent
years. Vice President Wilbanks noted that the request provides an opportunity for the
University to set forth its goals and aspirations, and to make the case that the University
of Michigan will play a vital role in the state's economic recovery, while understanding
that the full request is not likely to be granted. In past years, it has been made clear that
the requests were to take into consideration the "realistic parameters" that the state is
facing.
Regent Newman again expressed concern that the document "doesn't put
enough on the table." Regent Richner suggested that as the situation changes in the
state or the university, there is flexibility to amend the request. Vice President

Year 2012 for the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Noting that the campus has lost

﻿November Meeting, 2010

14% of its state support over the past 8 years, the campus views the request as an
opportunity to demonstrate where the campus is going and to lay out its case for
support, with the knowledge that the request is unlikely to be successful. In addition to
requesting additional funding for financial aid, the document requests funding to
establish health professions programs on the Dearborn campus.
Annual Operating Request to the State for the University of Michigan-Flint
Chancellor Person submitted the annual operating request for fiscal year 2012
for the Flint campus, noting that she views it as a work in progress in anticipation of the
adoption of a new strategic plan. A major component of the request is for funding for a
new nursing simulation lab.

﻿DECEMBER MEETING, 2010

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
December 17, 2010
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. President Coleman
and Regents Darlow and White were present; Regents Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard,
Newman, Richner, and Taylor participated by phone. Also present were Vice President
and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Provost
Hanlon, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor
Person, Vice President Scarnecchia, and Executive Vice President Slottow. Executive
Vice President Pescovitz and Vice President Wilbanks were absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She noted that the meeting had
been rescheduled to allow participants to attend the funeral of Executive Vice President
Pescovitz's husband, Dr. Mark Pescovitz, and she extended the sympathy of the entire
university community to the Pescovitz family. President Coleman announced that
University of Michigan start-up companies and student teams had recently been
awarded the top prizes in the Accelerate Michigan Innovation Competition. She called
attention to the upcoming winter commencement and the Gator Bowl.
Turning to the regular business agenda, President Coleman pointed out that
because the committees did not meet this month, there were no committee reports, and
that the items involving conflicts of interest would be considered first.
Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman stated that the agenda includes 3 conflict of interest items,
each of which requires 6 votes for approval. It was noted that a fourth item, the
proposed license agreement between the University of Michigan and Life Magnetics,
Inc., was being withdrawn from consideration. On a motion by Regent White,
seconded by Regent Maynard, the regents unanimously approved the following 3 items:
License Agreement between the University of Michigan and Fusion Coolant
Systems Inc.
The regents approved a license agreement with Fusion Coolant Systems Inc.
("Company") which will allow the Company to license the following technology from
the University: UM File No. 3024, "Metal Working Lubricant Formulations Based on
Supercritical Carbon Dioxide;" UM File No. 4035, "Methods for Controlling Tool
Temperature and Diffusive Flank Wear;" and UM File No. 4117, "Metalworking
Lubricants Delivered at Low Temperature and High Velocity with Rapidly Expanding
Gases and Supercritical Fluids." Because Dr. Steven Skerlow, a University of
Michigan employee, is also an owner of the Company, this agreement falls under the
State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:

131






﻿December Meeting, 2010

1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Fusion
Coolant Systems Inc.
2. Agreement terms include giving the Company an exclusive license with the right to
grant sublicenses. The Company will pay a royalty on sales and reimburse patent
costs. The University will retain ownership of the licensed technology and may
continue to further develop it and use it internally. No use of University services or
facilities, nor any assignment of University employees, is obligated or contemplated
under the agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees and indemnification apply,
and the agreement may be amended by consent of the parties. University procedures
for approval of these changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest
review will be done as appropriate.
3. The pecuniary interests of Dr. Skerlos arise from his ownership interest in Fusion
Coolant Systems Inc.
License Agreement between the University of Michigan and Ascentage Pharma
Group Corporation, Ltd.
The regents approved a license agreement with Ascentage Pharma Group
Corporation, Ltd. ("Company") to allow the company to obtain an exclusive license for
the following technologies from the University: UM OTT File No. 4139, "Bivalent
Diazo Bicyclic Smac Mimetics and the Uses Thereof" "Treatment of Cancer;" UM
OTT File No. 4241, "Stat3 Inhibitors and Therapeutic Methods using the Same;" UM
OTT File No. 4676, "Peptidomimetic Small Molecule Inhibitors of the WDRS and
MLL1 Interaction;" UM OTT File No. 4790, "Bivalent Small-Molecule Antagonists of
IAP Proteins and Their Use Thereof;" and UM OTT File No. 4791, "Small-Molecule
Inhibitors of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl Proteins and Their Use Thereof." Because Shaomeng
Wang, a University of Michigan employee, is also partial owner of the Company, this
purchase falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Ascenta
Pharma Group.
2. Agreement terms include granting the Company an exclusive license with the right to
grant sublicenses. The Company will pay a license fee, annual minimums, milestone
payments and royalties on sales while reimbursing patent costs. The University will
retain ownership of the licensed technology and may continue to further develop it
and use it internally. No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment
of University employees, is obligated or contemplated under the agreement.
Standard disclaimers of warrantees and indemnification apply, and the agreement
may be amended by consent of the parties. Additional review by the Medical School
Conflict of Interest Board will be done as appropriate.
3. The pecuniary interests of Dr. Wang arise from his ownership interest in Ascentage
Pharma Group Corporation, Ltd.
Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and Internet2
The regents approved a research agreement with Intemrnet2 which will allow
Intemrnet2 to support a research project in the School of Information entitled "CI Days at
UM." Because Doug Van Houweling and Mary Sue Coleman, University of Michigan
employees, are also president and CEO of Internet 2 (Van Houweling) and member of
the Internet2 board (Coleman), this agreement falls under the State of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Internet2.

132

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for five
retiring faculty members. Provost Hanlon commented on the retirement of Professor H.
Don Cameron, following a 51-year career at the University of Michigan.
H. Don Cameron, Ph.D., Arthur F. Thurnau Professor, professor of Greek and
Latin, and curator, Museum of Zoology, College of Literature, Science, and Arts, will
retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2010.
Professor Cameron received his A.B. degree from the University of Michigan in
1956 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Princeton University in 1958 and 1962,
respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an instructor in 1959, and
was promoted to assistant professor in 1964, associate professor in 1967, and professor
in 1978. He was appointed associate curator in the Museum of Zoology in 1974 and
was promoted to curator in 1978. He was appointed Arthur F. Thurnau Professor in
1992.
During the course of his 51-year career at the University of Michigan,
Professor Cameron has achieved the status of an "institution." His early scholarly
research was devoted especially to the tragedian Aeschylus, about whom he published
an important work, "Studies on the Seven Against Thebes of Aeschylus," in 1971.
More recently, in 2003, he published a very useful commentary on Book 1 of the
historian Thucydides. Along with articles on tragedy and other classical subjects, he
also regularly published work on spiders, entomological and arachnid nomenclature,
and cladistics. His multifarious service to the University includes his recent stint as
LSA Parliamentarian. Above all, however, it is for his efforts as a teacher, and
particularly in his "Great Books" course, that he has been inscribed indelibly in the
memories of students and colleagues. His teaching has been recognized by the
University with the Class of 1923 Distinguished Teaching Award (1965), the Amoco

146






﻿December Meeting, 2010

Foundation Good Teaching Award (1985), the Arthur F. Thurnau Professorship (1992),
and by being named the first Collegiate Fellow in Honors (1999). In 1987, he received
the American Philological Association's Award for Excellence in Teaching at the
Collegiate Level. Professor Cameron's dedication to his students and to the University
and its intellectual life has been exemplary and inspirational.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and scholar by naming H.
Don Cameron Arthur F. Thurnau Professor Emeritus, professor emeritus of Greek and
Latin, and curator emeritus.
Conrad P. Kottak, Ph.D., Julian H. Steward Collegiate Professor of
Anthropology and professor of anthropology, College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2010.
Professor Kottak received his A.B. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia
University in 1963 and 1966, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an assistant professor in 1968, and was promoted to associate professor in
1971 and professor in 1976.
Professor Kottak's research focuses on social and cultural transformations in the
context of ecology, political economy, technological change, and processes of
globalization. His original field research was done in Arembepe, Brazil. Subsequently,
he worked in Madagascar and in a variety of settings in the United States. The
Arembepe work has continued throughout his lengthy career at the University of
Michigan and resulted in numerous publications devoted to race and ethnicity, the
impact of tourism on local communities, and the interactions between new forms of
media and family life. His work in Madagascar explored the relationships between
environment, local political formations, and sociocultural systems, while research in the
United States focused on topics ranging from media and family relationships to
ethnicity to the gender-work-family relationship in suburban contexts. He was elected
to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005 and to the National Academy
of Sciences in 2008.
Professor Kottak served as chair of the Department of Anthropology from 1996-
2006. He was noted for his commitment to undergraduate and graduate education and
to the continuing robustness of all four of the discipline's sub-disciplines, and for his
exemplary mentorship of junior faculty.  He taught numerous undergraduate
anthropology courses, most notably the large introductory lecture courses, and is the
author of one of the most widely used introductory textbooks in the field.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
Conrad P. Kottak professor emeritus of anthropology.
Richard D. Swartz, M.D., professor of internal medicine, Medical School, will
retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2010.
Dr. Swartz received his B.S. and M.D. degrees from the University of Michigan
in 1968 and 1970, respectively. Following an internship and residency at Boston City
Hospital, Harvard Medical School (1970-71 and 1973-74), he completed a residency at
Boston City Hospital, Boston University Medical School (1974-75), and a nephrology
fellowship at Beth Israel Hospital, Harvard Medical School (1975-77). He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1977, and was promoted to
associate professor in 1982 and professor in 1987.

147






﻿December Meeting, 2010

Dr. Swartz is widely regarded for his expertise in the area of chronic kidney
disease and end-stage renal disease, and on end-of-life care for patients with these and
other conditions. He has published more than 120 peer-reviewed articles and has
presented nearly as many abstracts and courses at national meetings. His expertise has
also been recognized by his appointment to the editorial board of the American Journal
of Kidney Disease (2000-05) and in his role as assistant editor for Advances in Renal
Replacement Therapy (1999-04). Dr. Swartz's service within the Division of
Nephrology has been invaluable. He has served as medical director of acute dialysis
(1977-2007), chief of clinic (1988-91 and 2003-10), director of the inpatient service
(1996-2001) and chief of staff (1999-2003). He also contributed significantly as a
member of the Medical School's Executive Committee for Clinical Affairs (1990-93)
and the Institutional Review Board (2009-present). Dr. Swartz is the recipient of
numerous awards, including the University of Michigan's H. Marvin Pollard Award for
outstanding resident teaching (1991) and the National Kidney Foundation of
Michigan's Distinguished Service Award (1995). He has been listed as one of the
"Best Doctors in America" every year since 2006.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Richard D. Swartz professor emeritus of internal medicine.
Thomas R. Trautmann, Ph.D., Marshall Sahlins Collegiate Professor of
History and Anthropology, professor of anthropology, and professor of history in the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 2010.
Professor Trautmann received his B.A. degree from Beloit College in 1962 and
his Ph.D. degree from the University of London in 1968. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1968, and was promoted to associate
professor in 1971 and professor in 1977. He was appointed Marshall Sahlins Collegiate
Professor of History and Anthropology in 1997.
Trained as a historian of ancient India, Professor Trautmann made contributions
to that field as well as to the historiography of colonial India, the history of
anthropology and the history of kinship. His early work revised the authorship of a
canonical Sanskrit text, the Arthashastra; subsequent work laid a lasting foundation for
all later studies of Dravidian kinship. More recently, his studies of British Orientalism
in India have made signal contributions to the intellectual history of colonial India as
they have refashioned understanding of the history of anthropology as a discipline. The
range of his erudition and influence is suggested not only by his publications, but also
in his role as editor of the prestigious journal, Comparative Studies in Society and
History, from 1997-2006.
Professor Trautmann taught undergraduate and graduate courses in Indian
civilization, ethnology, and kinship. He also provided distinguished service as director of
the Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies (1975-77), chair of the Department of
History (1987-90), and the Mary Fair Croushore Professor of Humanities and director of
the Institute for the Humanities (1997-2002). From 2003-09 he served as a development
officer in the Department of History; during that time, the department's endowment funds
nearly doubled, from $12.5 to $22.6 million.

148






﻿December Meeting, 2010

The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
Thomas R. Trautmann professor emeritus of anthropology and professor emeritus of
history.
Norman Yoffee, Ph.D., professor of near eastern studies, professor of
anthropology, and curator, Museum of Anthropology, College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2010.
Professor Yoffee received his B.A. degree from Northwestern University in
1966, and his M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale University in 1971 and 1973,
respectively. He began his career at the University of Arizona as an instructor in 1972,
and was promoted to assistant professor in 1973, associate professor in 1979, and
professor in 1987. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1993 as professor
and chair, Department of Near Eastern Studies, and curator of archaeology.
Professor Yoffee's research focuses on the rise and fall of early civilizations.
Proceeding from his own area of expertise in the initial stages of Mesopotamian
societies, he compared the development and decline of early civilizations from China to
Mesoamerica, identifying factors that contributed to the flowering, collapse, and
possible recovery of pre-modern complex social formations. More particularly, within
Mesopotamian studies, Professor Yoffee's work centered on the ancient Babylonian
city of Kish, resulting in the publication of two volumes of cuneiform texts. An active
facilitator of the work of others, he edited or co-edited eight volumes of essays, served
as series editor of the Cambridge World Archaeology series, and for many years was
editor of the Journal of Social and Economic History of the Orient.
Professor Yoffee taught undergraduate and graduate courses on Mesopotamian
history and culture and seminars on anthropological topics. He served on a large number
of thesis panels and departmental and college committees. As chair of the Department of
Near Eastern Studies from 1993-98, he presided over a reorganization of the
undergraduate and graduate curricula.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Norman Yoffee
professor emeritus of near eastern studies, professor emeritus of anthropology, and
curator emenritus.

﻿December Meeting, 2010

Issuance of Debt by Merit Network, Inc.
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that Merit Network, Inc. had
received a $102.9 million grant to build approximately 2,300 miles of an advanced
fiber-optic network throughout the state of Michigan focusing on underserved and
remote areas. The financing fees for this project can be reduced if the ten universities
that are members of Merit Network can back a small portion of the matching funds, or
about $8 million.
Regent White moved adoption of a resolution authorizing the executive vice
president and chief financial officer or the associate vice president for finance, or the
treasurer to develop the final terms, and negotiate and execute the legal documentation
for the support by the University of the proposed Merit's debt through the assessment
agreement, and obtain and approve any agreements required for the support of Merit's
debt. Regent Darlow seconded the motion. Regent Richner recused himself from
voting due to a conflict of interest. The vote was then taken and the motion was
approved, with Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Taylor, and White
in favor and Regent Richner abstaining. The resolution can be found in the appendix
on page 153.
Alice Crocker Lloyd Hall Renovation
Mr. Paul Stachowiak, president of Integrated Design Solutions, presented the
proposed schematic design for the renovation of Alice Crocker Lloyd Hall, noting that
the project primarily involves infrastructure renewal and a repurposing of the old dining
hall and kitchen that were vacated upon the completion of the Hill Dining Center. He
displayed a number of panels depicting the site plan and the plans for the various
building levels. He concluded with a rendering of the exterior, noting that the main
entrance would be changed from the east side to the west side (Palmer Field).
Regent Newman commented that she thought the project would be well
received and she was very supportive of it. President Coleman pointed out that when
this project is completed, every residence hall on the hill will have been completely
renovated.
Regent Newman moved approval of the schematic design for the Alice Crocker
Lloyd Hall Renovation Project as presented. Regent White seconded the motion, and it
was approved unanimously.
George Granger Brown Memorial Laboratories Mechanical Engineering Addition
As described in the regents communication, the George Granger Brown
Memorial Laboratories Mechanical Engineering Addition Project's scope and budget
have been reduced from what was originally approved in June 2009. Robert Goodwin,
design principal, Perkins + Will, presented the proposed schematic design for the
project. He displayed illustrations of the site plan, the designs for each level of the
building, and renderings of the exterior.
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that renovation of the existing G.G.
Brown building, to be funded in part by a grant from state capital outlay funds, would
be submitted at a future date.

﻿DECEMBER MEETING, 2010 - APPENDIX

RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
APPROVING AN ASSESSMENT AGREEMENT WITH MERIT NETWORK, INC.
WHEREAS, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Regents") is a body corporate
created by and existing under the Constitution of the State of Michigan with full constitutional authority
over and general supervision of The University of Michigan (the "University") and control and direction
of all expenditures from the University's funds; and
WHEREAS, Merit Network, Inc. ("Merit"), a Michigan nonprofit corporation, has been formed
to promote computer resource sharing through the provisions of resources, including a high-speed
research and education network within the State of Michigan for use by public universities in Michigan
and other education and research groups and institutions; and
WHEREAS, the governing members of Merit are the Regents, the Board of Trustees of
Michigan State University (the "Trustees"), and ten other public universities in Michigan (collectively,
the "Members"); and
WHEREAS, Merit has been awarded grants from the federal government in the approximate
amount of $103,000,000 to be used for the construction of additional network facilities within Michigan;
and
WHEREAS, in order to receive and utilize the federal grant for the purposes described above, it
is necessary for Merit to borrow the sum of not to exceed $8,000,000 through the issuance of a tax-
exempt bond (the "Bond") by the Michigan Strategic Fund, the proceeds of which will be loaned to, and
repaid, with interest, by, Merit; and
WHEREAS, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank (the "Bank"), has agreed to purchase the Bond, but only
upon the execution of an Assessment Agreement (the "Assessment Agreement") by the Members, under
which the Members agree to pay to Merit sufficient funds to pay the debt service requirements on the
Bond; and
WHEREAS, the benefits to the University from its membership in Merit and from the
indebtedness to be incurred by Merit and guaranteed under the Assessment Agreement include:
Service by Merit to its Members of advanced networking services on a high-quality network
infrastructure. As controlling Members of Merit the universities ensure themselves that they have a
trusted source for network connectivity.
As Members of Merit, the public universities in the State of Michigan have access to and control
a private network. They are their own regulators of costs and the policies on that network. Access, both
in scope and capacity, is not dictated by an outside service provider. The Members have available to their
facilities almost unlimited use of bandwidth. Merit is the only allowed provider in the State of multiple
connections to Internet2 and to other Midwest regional networks required for research purposes. Merit
partners with over 20 national and international networks to provide peering relationships; providing a
direct path to and from other networks for exchanging sensitive data. This connectivity permits Michigan
based universities to work with other institutions across the nation on research and educational projects
over their private networks.
The borrowed funds with the federal grant would build approximately 2,300 miles of an
advanced fiber-optic network throughout Michigan focusing on underserved and remote areas (the
"REACH Michigan Middle Mile Collaborative or REACH 3MC').
Membership in Merit provides residual interests in the assets of Merit upon its dissolution.
And,
WHEREAS, the Bond is being delivered and sold under certain provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which provisions expire on December 31, 2010; and
WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of the Assessment Agreement by the Members of
Merit requires that the governing boards of each public university Member authorize such execution and

153






﻿December Meeting, 2010-Appendix

delivery, and it may not be possible for all of the Members to achieve such authorization in time to
permit the Bond to be delivered on or before December 31, 2010; and
WHEREAS, in order to assure that the Bond can be delivered prior to December 31, 2010, it is
necessary for the Regents and the Trustees to each agree that they will assume up to one-half of the
liabilities under the Assessment Agreement until such time as the remaining Members have authorized
and executed the Assessment Agreement, upon which the liabilities of the Regents and the Trustees will
be proportionately reduced; and
WHEREAS, the Regents, in the exercise of its constitutional duties, has determined that the
guarantee of a portion of Merit's obligation with respect to the Bond through the execution and delivery
by and on behalf of the Regents of the Assessment Agreement as described above is in the interest of the
University;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:
The guarantee by the Regents of a portion of the obligations of Merit in connection with the
Bond through the execution and delivery of the Assessment Agreement is hereby authorized and
approved; provided, however, that the obligations of the Regents under the Assessment Agreement shall
be limited obligations of the Regents, payable solely from General Revenues, as defined in the trust
agreements under which the General Revenue Bonds of the Regents have been issued. As provided in
the Assessment Agreement, the Regents' liabilities may be increased in the case of default by any other
Member, but in no event shall the Regents' obligations under the Assessment Agreement exceed the
principal amount of four million dollars ($4,000,000), plus interest on that principal amount and any
penalties, premiums or other charges related to that principal amount. Upon execution of the Assessment
Agreement by all of the Members, the primary liability of the Regents will be reduced to a minimum
principal amount of $2,200,000 plus interest on that principal amount and any penalties, premiums or
other charges related to that principal amount.
The initial form of the Assessment Agreement on file with the Secretary of the University is
hereby approved, and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Associate Vice
President for Finance and the Treasurer (each an "Authorized Officer") or any one of them individually
are hereby authorized to execute and deliver the Assessment Agreement substantially in such form, with
such changes not inconsistent with the terms of this Resolution as the executing officer may determine
appropriate, as evidenced by his signature thereon. Each of the Authorized Officers and each other
appropriate officer or representative of the Regents is hereby authorized to negotiate, execute and deliver,
for and on behalf of the Regents, any other certificates, opinions, documents or instruments necessary to
effect the purposes of this Resolution.
The Regents find that the value of the benefits derived and to be derived by the University from
the proceeds of the indebtedness related to the Bond exceeds the liabilities to be incurred by the Regents
from the execution and delivery of the Assessment Agreement.

154






﻿JANUARY MEETING, 2011

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
January 20, 2011
The regents convened at 3:30 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Deitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, and White. Also
present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice
President Harper, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President
Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent
Ilitch participated in the meeting by phone. Regents Darlow and Taylor were absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She noted that she had attended
Governor Snyder's "State of the State" address the previous evening, and was
encouraged by his understanding of the contributions that are made by higher education
to the state's economy. At the same time, the University is preparing for the shared
sacrifices required by the state's unprecedented financial challenges, while looking
forward to working with him and the state legislature to help move the state forward.
President Coleman also commented on the appointment of Brady Hoke as the
new football coach, the election of 9 faculty members to the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, and the selection by Entrepreneur magazine of Allen
Kim, senior in the College of Engineering, as College Entrepreneur of the Year.
Finally, she noted that the University had received two significant architectural awards:
the "Institute Honor Award for Architecture," presented by the American Institute of
Architects for the renovation and expansion of the Museum of Art, and the "Best of the
Best" award, presented by McGraw-Hill Construction for the Michigan Stadium
renovation project.
President Coleman then called on Vice President Forrest.
Annual Report on Research: "Innovation, Engagement and the Connected
University"
Vice President Forrest pointed out that engaging with the outside world is a core
mission of the University of Michigan, and that making a difference to the economic
health of our state is a crucial to fulfilling this mission. His presentation focused on
steps the University is taking to accelerate innovation and become further connected to
the entrepreneurial community. One important step toward this goal was the purchase
of the North Campus Research Center ("NCRC"). This allowed the creation of the
Michigan Venture Center, which will serve a critically important role as a venture
accelerator. He noted that the University of Michigan ranks eighth nationally in the
number of agreements and startups, and tenth in revenues.
Vice President Forrest concluded by announcing the recipients of the 2011
Distinguished University Innovator Awards, Ken Wise and Khalil Najafi.

155






﻿January Meeting, 2011

Presentation: "The Rewards of New Business Creation"
Vice President Forrest introduced Dr. James Baker Jr., professor of internal
medicine, professor of biomedical engineering, and Ruth Dow Doan Professor of
Nanotechnology. Dr. Baker noted that the University of Michigan has a tradition of
providing opportunities for the economic development, as well as academic
development, of its students, and this core mission is more important than ever in the
current, exceptionally difficult, economic climate. Dr. Baker pointed out that most
wealth creation stems from new business development, and it is incumbent upon the
University to provide an environment that will make young entrepreneurs want to stay
in the state. Translational research helps the institution by bringing in more funding for
research, product development, and job creation.
In response to a question from Regent Deitch about what further steps the
University can take towards furthering an entrepreneurial culture at the University, Dr.
Baker stated that the most important thing that can be done is to provide opportunities
for students to "make their mark" after they graduate so that as many as possible will
stay after they graduate. One way to do this is to expand and enhance the business
creation initiatives underway in the Office of the Vice President for Research.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that the committee, consisting of
herself and Regent Maynard, had met that morning with Executive Vice President
Slottow. They considered the following agenda items: the annual lease portfolio report
(with Associate Vice President Hank Baier, and Mark Eboch, manager for real estate
and space information); information technology security and disaster recovery systems
(with Associate Vice President Laura Patterson and Paul Howell, chief information
technology security officer); and the bi-monthly internal audit update (with Carol
Senneff, executive director of internal audits).
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner,
chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that the
committee had met with Associate Vice President Rowan Miranda and Ms. Senneff to
review the University's enterprise risk management programs. Provost Hanlon
provided an update on dean searches, and the committee met with Vice President
Churchill about proposed amendments to the Regents' Bylaws.
Health Affairs Committee. Regent Deitch noted that Regent Darlow had been
unexpectedly called away and was unable to attend the meeting. He reported that he
and Regent Newman had met with Executive Vice President Pescovitz, other Health
System and Medical School officials, and legal counsel to review the governance
structure of the Health System and its various affiliates. The committee also discussed
issues related to the changing health care marketplace. He commented that the regents'
increased engagement with the Health System through this committee will be
productive for the University.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for three
retiring faculty members.
Phyllis C. Blumenfeld, Ph.D., professor of education, School of Education,
retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2010.
Professor Blumenfeld received her B.A. degree from Brown University in 1968
and her Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1973. She
joined the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1972, and was promoted to
assistant professor in 1974, associate professor in 1978, and professor in 1987.
Professor Blumenfeld taught in the Combined Program in Education and
Psychology. Her research focused on the influence of teacher behavior and classroom

187






﻿January Meeting, 2011

tasks on student motivation. Professor Blumenfeld's work on socialization in schools
explored the relationship between classroom management, norms, expectations, and a
student's sense of responsibility for learning. Her research on student engagement in
urban areas revealed that student disengagement with school starts very early and is
strongly influenced by instructional practices and policies. She also investigated the
impact of curriculum design and inquiry instruction on student motivation and
achievement in science.
Professor Blumenfeld's research was funded by grants from the National
Science Foundation and the Spencer Foundations. She published widely, including
articles in the American Education Research Journal, Educational Researcher, Journal
of Educational Psychology, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and Journal
of Learning Sciences. She has published numerous book and handbook chapters on
science education, developmental psychology, education psychology, and learning
sciences.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Phyllis C.
Blumenfeld professor emerita of education.
Werner J.A. Dahm, Ph.D., professor of aerospace engineering, College of
Engineering, retired from active faculty status on October 31, 2010.
Professor Dahm received his B.S.E. degree from the University of Alabama in
1978, his M.S. degree from the University of Tennessee Space Institute in 1981, and his
Ph.D. degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1985. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1985, and was promoted to
associate professor in 1991, and professor in 1997. He was appointed head of the
Laboratory for Turbulence and Combustion in 1994.
Professor Dahm made a number of distinguished contributions to teaching and
research. His challenging course on turbulence was popular with graduate students
because of the depth and clarity of his lectures. He mentored a number of graduate
students who owe their successful careers to his guidance. Professor Dahm's research
resulted in some of the first visualization of the fine-scale structure of turbulence and
the quantification of one of the fundamental scaling laws of turbulence. He pioneered
the use of several laser diagnostic techniques and utilized these techniques to discover
some aspects of the fundamental physics of turbulent flows. His research is known for
clever innovations, which led him to invent a new type of micro-engine and a new
propulsion concept for small jet engines. He has given over 100 invited and plenary
lectures worldwide and authored more than 180 technical publications.
Professor Dahm also has been a leader in serving our nation. He served as the
chief scientist of the United States Air Force in the Pentagon, Washington, DC from
2008-10. During this time he authored the "Technology Horizons" vision document.
Prior to this appointment he served on the U.S.A.F Science Advisory Board. His
awards include Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
(2006), Fellow of the American Physical Society (1998), the William F. Ballhaus
Aeronautics Prize (1985), and numerous departmental research and teaching awards.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Werner J.A. Dahm professor emeritus of aerospace engineering.

School of Nursing in 1964, her B.S.N. degree from Ball State University in 1972, her
M.S.N. degree from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1979, and her M.B.A.
and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Pittsburgh in 1986 and 1990, respectively.
She joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty as a lecturer in 1988, and was

Velthouse served as senior faculty advisor to the chancellor in 2007-08, and interim
dean of the School of Health Professions and Studies in 2008-09.
Within the School of Management, Professor Velthouse has served on the

also served on numerous university-wide committees, including Faculty Council,
Honors Program Advisory Council, Academic Affairs Advisory Committee, Blue
Ribbon  Commission, Physical Therapy    Advisory  Committee, and   Business
Priorities/Chancellor's Advisory Committee.
Professor Velthouse is recognized as an outstanding teacher with years of
student evaluations at both the undergraduate and graduate levels consistently falling in

﻿FEBRUARY MEETING, 2011

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
February 17, 2011
The regents convened at 3:10 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Vice President Harper, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor
Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz,
Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regent Maynard was absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She commented on the
governor's state budget proposal that had just been released, noting that, while it
proposes a significant cut to higher education funding, the University had been
preparing for continuing reductions for several years by making substantial cuts in
expenditures. President Coleman also recognized Professor Michael Daugherty for
having received three Grammy Awards for his composition "Deus Ex Machina," and
University Musical Society director Ken Fischer, for having received the 2011 Fan
Taylor Distinguished Service Award from the Association of Performing Arts
Presenters. President Coleman concluded by announcing that the March 2011 board
meeting would be held in Detroit, providing an opportunity to celebrate the many
collaborations between the University of Michigan and Detroit, and to meet with
community and business leaders and elected officials.
President Coleman introduced Professor Mark Tessler, vice provost for
international affairs.
Presentation: "Dimensions of Internationalization at the University of Michigan"
Vice Provost Tessler discussed the presence and impact of international students
at the University and the varying experiences of Michigan students who study abroad.
He noted that enrollment of international students has increased by 34% since 2001,
and that they currently account for 12.5% of the student body, mostly at the graduate
level. Most international students come from Asian countries, especially China, India,
and South Korea.   He described various efforts being undertaken to increase
international student enrollment.
Vice Provost Tessler pointed out that the number of Michigan students studying
abroad has nearly doubled in the past five years. He said that the University is working
to increase the array of opportunities available to students for international study and to
discover and address obstacles to increased participation in study abroad programs.
Regent Newman asked why the University does not sponsor any programs in
Israel. Vice Provost Tessler responded that University policy prohibits establishing
ongoing programs in countries that are on the State Department's travel advisory list.

197






﻿February Meeting, 2011

He pointed out that a number of students travel to Israel and other countries on the
travel advisory list through programs offered by other institutions, and that students
may sign a waiver and participate in experiential trips with other students and a faculty
member. Provost Hanlon commented that the University's current policy regarding
travel to countries on the State Department's travel advisory list will be re-examined to
see if it still appropriate.
Noting the emphasis that has been placed recently on attracting highly educated
immigrants to Michigan, Regents Richner and Deitch suggested that data be collected
regarding the number of international students who decide to settle in Michigan after
completing their education.
Following this discussion, two students, Bianca Renee Lee and Grace van
Velden, described how the international experiences they've participated in as
University of Michigan students have broadened their horizons and transformed their
world view.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that the committee, consisting of

Associate Provost Pollack, and Vice President Wilbanks); a bi-monthly internal audit
update (with Carol Senneff, executive director of internal audits); and an update on the
Hospitals and Health Centers 10-year strategic capital plan (with Executive Vice
President Pescovitz, UM Hospitals and Health Centers Chief Executive Officer Doug
Strong, and Dean Woolliscroft). The two other committees joined the Finance, Audit
and Investment Committee for the latter session.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner,
chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that the
committee, consisting of he and Regent Ilitch, had met with Ms. Senneff and Fiona
Linn for an update on the new compliance website, which will consolidate information
about compliance issues and regulations in one place. Provost Hanlon provided an
update on dean and executive director searches.

Raymond P. Kettel, Ed.D, associate professor of education in the School of

Professor Kettel received his B.S., M.Ed., and Ed.D. degrees from Wayne State
University in 1966, 1972, and 1981, respectively. He served as a Peace Corps

﻿February Meeting, 2011

Dearborn faculty as an assistant professor in 1988 and was promoted to associate
professor in 1994.
Professor Kettel is widely regarded for his expertise in the area of children's
literature and for his innovative contributions to the teaching of reading and language
arts. His publications have appeared in such journals as The Reading Teacher, English
Journal, Storytelling World, Voices from the Middle, and the American Library
Association's Book Links. He directed both the CLUE ME IN project, a motivational
reading program for young readers, and the ASK program, which encouraged students
at the college and pre-college levels to delve deeply into literature by interviewing
authors. His knowledge of children's literature was instrumental in assembling the
Mardigian Library's Juvenile Historic Collection, which is one of the most important
historical collections of children's literature in the United States.
Professor Kettel was active in the International Reading Association and the
Michigan Reading Association, and he served on the board of directors of the Michigan
Reading Association from 1982-85. He has received numerous awards, including the
University of Michigan-Dearborn's Distinguished Teaching Award (1993) and the
Michigan Reading Association's Teacher Educator Award (2005). In 1995, he was
named "Most Inspirational Faculty Member" by the UM-Dearborn Association of
Educators, and in 2005 the UM-Dearborn Alumni Society named him "Faculty
Member of the Year."
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated service by
naming Raymond P. Kettel associate professor emeritus of education.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted memorial statements for two
recently deceased faculty members.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Linnea S. Hauge, Ph.D., assistant professor of surgery and assistant
professor of medical education, Medical School, who died December 25, 2010, after a
courageous battle with breast cancer.
Professor Hauge received her B.M.E. degree from the University of Wisconsin-
Eau Claire in 1987, her M.S. degree from the University of Illinois-Chicago in 1993,
and her Ph.D. degree from the University of Utah in 1997. From 1998-2006, she was an
education specialist in the Department of Surgery at Rush University. She joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 2007 as assistant professor of surgery and assistant
professor of medical education.
Professor Hauge was a tireless advocate, friend, and guide for learners at all
levels, a national leader in education organizations, and a mentor to individuals

Research Fund for her project on assessing medical student performance during phone
consultations with nurses. Following her diagnosis and throughout her treatment,
Professor Hauge continued to work, publishing as recently as December 2010 in the
Journal of the American College of Surgeons. A lecture series at Rush University
Department of Surgery, and the Promising Education Scholar Award of the Association
for Surgical Education will be named in her honor.
As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our sincere
condolences to her husband, Thomas Barber, and members of her family.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Ruth R. Winter, M.D., clinical assistant professor of anesthesiology,
Medical School, who died on December 29, 2010, after a courageous battle with
cancer.
Dr. Winter received her B.A. and M.D. degrees from The Ohio State University
in 1980 and 1984, respectively. She completed an internal medicine residency at the
Mayo Graduate School of Medicine (1984-85) and an anesthesiology residency at the
University of Michigan Medical Center (1985-87). Following completion of her
residency, she was a clinical instructor at the University of Michigan Medical Center
(1987-91) and a staff anesthesiologist at the W.A. Foote Memorial Hospital (1991-99).
She returned to the University of Michigan faculty as a clinical assistant professor of
anesthesiology in 1999.
Dr. Winter began her medical career at the University of Michigan as a resident
and later became a valued faculty member and trusted colleague. She worked in the
operating rooms at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, taking care of patients while
teaching  medical students and  anesthesiology  residents.  A  highly skilled
anesthesiologist and a talented communicator, she had a unique talent for teaching and
mentoring, believing that demonstrating sound clinical judgment was as important as
imparting excellent clinical skills. She was highly respected by anesthesiologists,
surgeons, house officers, and nursing staff.
An active member of her community, Dr. Winter served on the Hebrew Day
School of Ann Arbor Board of Directors and on the Ann Arbor District Library Board
of Trustees. She was also an active member of Beth Israel Congregation in Ann Arbor.
As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our heartfelt
condolences to her husband, Dr. Steven Silverman, her daughters, Albie and Paula, and
members of her family.

﻿MARCH MEETING, 2011

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
March 17, 2011

Present were President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard,
Newman, Richner, and Taylor. Also present were Vice President and Secretary
Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Provost Hanlon, Vice
President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive
Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President
Slottow, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent White participated in the meeting by
telephone.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order, noting how pleased the board
was to be meeting in Detroit. She recognized Detroit City Councilwoman Saunteel
Jenkins, who presented the University with a resolution from the Detroit City Council
in honor of the Semester in Detroit program. A round of applause followed.
President Coleman noted that in keeping with the University's tradition of
inviting newly elected governors to address graduates at commencement, Governor
Rick Snyder is being recommended for approval to receive an honorary degree at the
2011 Spring Commencement. He would also deliver the commencement address.
President Coleman commented on the gift from Charles Munger for renovation of the
Lawyers Club housing complex and proposed naming of the complex in his honor. She
also announced the upcoming community open house for North Quad.
President Coleman congratulated Regent Ilitch, who along with her mother,
Marian Ilitch, is receiving the Trillium Lifetime Achievement Award from the
Michigan Women's Foundation. She concluded by noting that the men's basketball
team, the wrestling team, the men's and women's swimming and diving teams, and the
hockey team are competing in championship tournaments, and she sent best wishes for
success.
Presentation: Semester in Detroit
President Coleman introduced Professor Charles Bright, faculty co-director of
the Semester in Detroit program. Professor Bright reviewed the history of the Semester
in Detroit program. Larissa Carr, a sophomore and current participant in the program,

Development Corporation, described collaborative programs underway within the City
of Detroit aimed at improving the health of its residents.
Presentation: Revitalization and Business: Detroit Impact
Neesha Modi, a graduate student pursuing a dual master's degree in the Stephen
M. Ross School of Business and the School of Natural Resources and Environment, and
David McCarty, an MBA student in the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, gave a
presentation on a student initiative, "Revitalization and Business: Focus Detroit,"
which seeks to shift perceptions about Detroit among students so that they view the city
as an exciting place to build a career and have an impact, thereby helping to fuel the
city's revitalization.
Public Comments on Agenda-Related Topics
The regents heard comments from Zachary Goldsmith, Andrea Ronquist, and
Richard Durance, students, expressing their opposition to the selection of Governor
Rick Snyder as speaker at the April 2011 commencement:.
Regent Deitch pointed out that President Obama spoke at last year's
commencement, despite the fact that many of the people in attendance probably hadn't
voted for him, and the same will most likely hold true when Governor Rick Snyder
speaks at the 2011 Spring Commencement. He said that inviting the governor, an
enthusiastic alumnus who holds three University of Michigan degrees, to speak at
commencement is a long-standing University of Michigan tradition, to be maintained
whether or not one agrees with all of the governor's political positions. Universities
serve as a market place of ideas and exemplars of free speech and academic freedom,
where protests and pickets are also welcome. Regents Richner, Newman, and Maynard
thanked the students for voicing their opinions, and expressed agreement with Regent
Deitch's comments.

Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that the committee, consisting of

﻿March Meeting, 2011

As the first African American professor hired by the College of Engineering,
Professor McAfee had a lasting impact on generations of students. From 1976-79, he
was program director for the Program in Engineering Research and Teaching for
Minority Students. He also served in various roles with the Detroit Area Pre-College
Engineering Program. During the 1970s and 1980s, he was the university-wide faculty
coordinator for the Bell-Labs One-Year-on-Campus graduate program. From 2000-10,
as associate director for education in the NSF Engineering Research Center for
Wireless Integrated MicroSystems, Professor McAfee led a group of faculty who
developed educational and outreach programs attended by thousands of college, high
school, and middle school students, primarily from under-represented minority groups.
He has been electrical engineering graduate chair, electrical engineering undergraduate
chief program advisor, and the EECS department safety committee chair.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Leo C.
McAfee Jr. associate professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science.
Samuel B. Mukasa, Ph.D., Eric J. Essene Collegiate Professor of Geological
Sciences and professor of geological sciences in the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2010.
Professor Mukasa received his B.Sc. degree from the University of New
Hampshire in 1977, his M.Sc. degree from The Ohio State University in 1980, and his
Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1984. From 1985-89
he was an assistant professor at the University of Florida. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an associate professor in 1989, was granted tenure in 1992, was
promoted to professor in 1999, and was appointed Eric J. Essene Collegiate Professor
of Geological Sciences in 2008.
Professor Mukasa's research focused on the origin and evolution of the earth's
mantle and the role played by magmatism and the recycling of oceanic lithosphere (i.e.,
subduction). He used radiogenic isotopes as a primary tool to identify and understand
chemical heterogeneities in the mantle, coupled with extensive field studies of volcanic
and plutonic provinces across the world. He dated the age of rocks using U/Pb and
40Ar/39Ar geochronology, which he used to constrain the rates at which juvenile and
mature continental crust forms at subduction zones. Professor Mukasa's research took
him to Antarctica 9 times (and to the South Pole 4 times), to Bulgaria, Chile, China,
France, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Venezuela, Zimbabwe,
and across the U.S. He published over 65 research papers, served on numerous
scientific panels, and began a two-year term as president of the Geochemical Society in
2009.
Professor Mukasa chaired the Department of Geological Sciences from 2007
until his retirement. He taught introductory and upper-level undergraduate courses, and
a popular graduate course in isotope geochemistry. He also served for five years on the
University's STRIDE ("Strategies and Tactics for Recruiting to Improve Diversity and
Excellence") Committee, and lectured nationally and internationally to promote
diversity in higher education.
The Regents salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming Samuel B.
Mukasa professor emeritus of geological sciences.

Charlotte A. Wolfe, A.M.L.S., senior associate librarian, University Library,
retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2010, following fifty years of highly
distinguished service.
Ms. Wolfe received her B.A. degree from Vanderbilt University's Peabody
College of Education and Human Development in 1958, and her A.M.L.S. degree from
the University of Michigan in 1960. She joined the University Library in 1960 as a
music and special materials cataloger, and for the following five decades was
instrumental in making the rich resources of the Music Library collection accessible to
faculty, students, and patrons.
Ms. Wolfe's dedication to music cataloging and bibliographic excellence and
her efforts in helping to lead the library into the digital age are among her most notable
contributions. When the library began to explore the possibility of adding data sets and
machine-readable text files to the collection, Ms. Wolfe contributed to the high-profile
national effort to catalog the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social
Research's data sets. She also coordinated the conversion of the library's microfilm
master collection into the Research Libraries Information Network. In 2000, Ms.
Wolfe designed and planned a viable strategy for providing bibliographic access to the
Thomas Edison Collection of American Sheet Music, one of the largest single
collections of antebellum sheet music in the United States. Among her other
contributions, she chaired the Cataloging Policy Council, which was responsible for
establishing specifications for the library's first integrated system; headed the NEH

﻿APRIL MEETING, 2011

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
April 21, 2011
The regents met at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Harper, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,
Interim Vice President Michels, Chancellor Person, Vice President Scarnecchia, and
Executive Vice President Slottow. Executive Vice President Pescovitz and Vice
President Wilbanks were absent. Regent Deitch left the meeting at about 3:40 p.m.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order, and said that the meeting would
begin with a very special announcement.
Announcement of Major Gift and Authorization to Name the Biomedical Science
Research Building in Honor of A. Alfred Taubman
President Coleman described how   A. Alfred Taubman's extraordinary
generosity has, over the years, advanced so many aspects of the University, from the
Health System to the Museum of Art, to the College of Literature, Science and the Arts,
to the College of Architecture and Urban Planning. She continued,
"I am extremely pleased to announce that Mr. Taubman is extending his long-
standing support of the Taubman Medical Research Institute with a gift of an additional
$56 million. This latest gesture brings his funding of the Taubman Institute to a total of
$100 million. His extraordinary philanthropy will allow our scientists to conduct high
risk, but potentially high reward research into some of the most terrible diseases that
any family ever has to experience: breast cancer, rare genetic conditions, Lou Gehrig's
Disease, and more. Mr. Taubman's endowed gift will be solely for this kind of
research."
President Coleman noted that Mr. Taubman understands that if you don't take
risks, you'll never get any potential rewards, and he understands that not all ideas will
bear fruit. "But he is willing to make a bet on the best scientists who have good ideas
to try." She noted that there are no public agencies that provide funding for the type of
research that Mr. Taubman's gift will fund, and concluded:
"He instinctively saw how this investment could potentially make huge
advances that we can only hope for and imagine now. As a university president, as a
scientist, and as a person whose family has been affected by one of these terrible
diseases, I can say with confidence and with deep, deep affection and feeling for the
whole Taubman family, that this will make a tremendous difference to our researchers,
and patients and families will benefit from new discoveries."

257






﻿April Meeting, 2011

"Alfred, on behalf of the entire University, our scientists, our students, and our
patients, I want to express to you our enormous gratitude. This is a special day for our
university."
Regent Darlow noted that Mr. Taubman was a Michigan native whose company
is still based in Michigan, and said, "Mr. Taubman, on behalf of the Board of Regents,
I want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for this life-changing commitment
you have made to the A. Alfred Taubman Medical Research Institute. Your generosity
will save lives."
Regent Ilitch stated that she was particularly excited about stem cell research
being funded through Mr. Taubman's gifts, exclaiming, "You are a rock star!"
Regent Deitch commented that Mr. Taubman's philanthropy has extended also
to the Detroit Institute of Art and other Detroit-area enterprises that have enriched the
life of the state. He made special note of Mr. Taubman's contributions in support of the
state-wide initiative for enabling stem cell research. "That was unique. That was
something an entrepreneur would do, and it was of extraordinary importance to the life
of this university and to the great research that you are now supporting through the
enhanced gifts to the Taubman Institute."
Regent Newman noted that Mr. Taubman's gift had "put this university on the
map," making it able to attract and retain the top scientists in the world. "You have
done more for this institution through this gift, and through your other gifts, than we
could have hoped for, and we really appreciate it."
Regent Richner thanked Mr. Taubman and his family for their dedication to the
state, noting, "I can't imagine the state of Michigan without the Taubman family."
Regent Taylor also expressed thanks to Mr. Taubman for having leant his
support to such a critical area of research.
A message was then relayed from Executive Vice President Pescovitz.
Mr. Taubman then addressed the assembly, noting that "it is truly my honor to
be able to support this great university and its world-class educators, researchers, and
physicians." He recounted his involvement with the project that replaced the "Old
Main" hospital, and praised Dr. Eva Feldman, his personal physician, who had taught
him the value of medical research utilizing embryonic stem cell therapy, which was
illegal in Michigan for many years. He was a major contributor to the successful
campaign to amend the state Constitution to legalize stem cell research, leading to the
promising research being conducted at the Taubman Institute.  "What we're
accomplishing at the Taubman Institute holds the promise of eliminating suffering and
pain around the world, and thanks to the brilliant medical minds collaborating on this
campus, we're on the threshold of major breakthroughs that will yield cures for our
most devastating diseases. That's what today's announcement is all about, and why
I'm so enthusiastic about our future and proud of my family's $100 million
commitment to the institute."
Regent Newman moved that the Biomedical Science Research Building be
named the A. Alfred Taubman Biomedical Science Research Building. Regent
Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

258






﻿April Meeting, 2011

There was then a short performance by the Friars, followed by a 5-minute break.
The meeting reconvened at 3:35 p.m.
President's Opening Remarks, Continued
Vice President Churchill continued with President Coleman's opening remarks,
due to President Coleman's laryngitis. She recognized Sam Mikulak, of the men's
gymnastics team, and Kylee Botterman, of the women's gymnastics team, for winning
the men's and women's all-around NCAA titles in gymnastics, along with their
coaches, Kurt Golder and Bev Plocki. She also recognized Kellen Russel, NCAA
wrestling champion, and his coach, Joe McFarland, and a round of applause followed.
Presentations: Students with Disabilities
Vice President Churchill recognized Stuart Segal, director of the Office of
Services for Students with Disabilities. She then called on three students to make
presentations. Carrie Lofgren, a freshman in LSA, Brian Rappaport, a senior in the
Ford School of Public Policy, and Edward Timke, a doctoral student in the Department
of Communications, talked about their respective experiences as students with
disabilities and they described the support they had received from the Office of
Services for Students with Disabilities.
Following the presentations, Regent Darlow thanked MSA for its efforts on
behalf of students with disabilities and then recognized members of the Council for
Disability Concerns who were in attendance.
Public Comments on Agenda-Related Topics
The regents heard comments from the following individuals, all regarding the
proposed revision to Regents' Bylaw 5.09: Edward Rothman, professor and chair of
SACUA, and Professors Benjamin Allen, Abby Stewart, David Bloom, Kathleen A.
Cooney, Rob Salmond, and Chris J. Dickinson.
The regents then turned to the regular agenda.
Committee Reports

Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that the committee, consisting of
herself, Regent Maynard, and Regent Taylor, had met that morning with Executive
Vice President Slottow. The first agenda item concerned the human subject research
compliance and incentive payment program, which tracks and manages the program
through which researchers provide incentives for subjects who participate in research
programs.  Participants included Associate Vice President Miranda, University
Treasurer Greg Tewksbury, and James Gorman, manager of project consulting in the
Treasurer's Office. The second agenda item was an FY2012 to FY2014 General Fund
budget update. For this session, the FAI committee was joined by members of the other
two committees, Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Newman, and Richner. Provost
Hanlon, Associate Provost Pollack, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Chancellors

Retirement Memoirs. No faculty retirements were reported this month.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted memorial statements for David
C. Blair, professor of computer and information systems, and Robert L. Frost, associate
professor of information.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of David C. Blair, Ph.D., professor of computer and information systems in
the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, who died on March 27, 2011 at the age of 63.
Professor Blair received his A.B. degree in 1969 from Whitman College, his
M.L.S. degree from the University of Washington in 1973, and his Ph.D. degree from
the University of California, Berkeley in 1981. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty as a lecturer in 1979, and was promoted to assistant professor in 1981, associate
professor in 1992, and professor in 2001. From 2001-03 he was the Jack D. Sparks-
Whirlpool Corporation Research Professor of Business Administration.
Professor Blair's research focused on the problem of representing information
in the context of information retrieval. Information retrieval is concerned with the
linguistic, logical, and computational issues of representing and providing access to the
intellectual content of information, especially on computers. He established and
anchored himself in his major research stream early in his academic career with a
groundbreaking study of the effectiveness of IBM's "STorage And Information
Retrieval System" (STAIRS).
Professor Blair taught across all degree programs for over 20 years in a field
which has experienced phenomenal changes in content, direction, and tools. He served
on numerous school and university-wide committees, including the Senate Advisory
Committee on University Affairs (SACUA). He served on the editorial boards of
Information Processing and Management, the Journal of the American Society for
Information Science, and Operations Research, was active in the American Society for
Information Science and Technology, and was a reviewer for many of the field's top
journals. Professor Blair was named the 1999 Outstanding Researcher of the Year by
the American Society for Information Science.
As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our heartfelt
condolences to his wife, Barbara, and his sons, Alian and Christopher.

﻿April Meeting, 2011

The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Robert L. Frost, Ph.D., associate professor of information in the School
of Information. Professor Frost died on March 26, 2011, after a lengthy battle with

Professor Frost received his B.A degree from Grinnell College in 1974, and his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1978 and 1983,
respectively. A devoted, energetic, and beloved teacher throughout his academic
career, between 1983 and 1995, he taught at Carthage College, Wabash College,
American University, and the State University of New York at Albany. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1995 as a visiting associate professor of history, and
moved to the School of Information in 2000. He was promoted to associate professor
in 2003.
In 2006, Professor Frost and his wife, Professor Margaret Hedstrom, established
the Frost Open Access Fund at the School of Information by donating copyright
royalties from the estate of his great-grandfather, poet Robert Frost, to support open
access to scholarly and artistic works.
Professor Frost will be greatly missed by his family, friends, colleagues, and
students, and will be remembered for his forthright manner, his deep concern for the
welfare of others, and his unwavering commitment to teaching. As we mourn the loss
of this dedicated faculty member, we send our condolences to his wife, Margaret
Hedstrom.

﻿April Meeting, 2011

Approval of Academic Calendar for 2013-2014
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Ilitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the Ann Arbor campus academic calendar for 2013-2014, as set
forth in the Regents Communication.
Proposed Revisions to Regents' Bylaw Section 5.09
Vice President Churchill reported that the proposed amendment to Bylaw 5.09
was being put forward following an extensive period of discussion and consultation
with faculty stakeholders, review by the Regents' Personnel, Compensation and
Governance Committee, and posting in the University Record to solicit public
comment. Provost Hanlon noted that the proposal, which would increase the maximum
allowable tenure probationary period from eight years to ten years would not result in
any changes to how tenure functions at the University or the University's strong
commitment to tenure. The length of the tenure probationary period is set by the
faculty of each school and college, he said; the proposed revision would change the
upper limit of the maximum allowable tenure probationary period, providing greater
flexibility to the governing faculty. The provost explained that the change is being
proposed in response to the increasing complexity and changing nature of scholarship
in some areas of the University, and because of the faculty's interest in balancing work
and family life.
Provost Hanlon noted that the proposal has been debated vigorously throughout
the faculty. In response to concerns that were raised about the possible unintended
consequences of an increase in the maximum tenure probationary period, Provost
Hanlon said that if the revision were to be adopted, he would convene a committee to
advise him on steps that his office and others could take to monitor and provide
oversight if a department decides to extend its maximum tenure probationary period.
Regent White moved, and Regent Darlow seconded, approval of the following
proposed revision to Regents' Bylaw 5.09 (deletion efre ssed-*u4; addition underlined):
Sec. 5.09.  Procedures in Cases of Dismissal, Demotion, or Terminal Appointmets (revised
November 1993)
Applicability. The procedures prescribed in this section shall be followed (a) before
recommendation is made to the Board of Regents of dismissal or demotion of a tenured member of the
University teaching staff or of any member of the teaching staff during the term for which any member
of the teaching staff is appointed; or (b) before recommendation is made to the Board of Regents of
dismissal, demotion, or terminal appointment of a teaching staff member holding appointments with the
University for a total of eight ten years in the rank of full-time instructor or higher. Subject to pursuing
these procedures, a recommendation of dismissal, demotion, or terminal appointment may be made for
causes accepted by University usage, properly connected with the improvement and efficiency of the
faculty, and consistent with the character of the tenure involved.
Regent White clarified that this bylaw change would merely increase the
maximum number of years available to schools and colleges when setting their own
rules for tenure, but that the bylaw itself would not be changing any existing rules
within the schools and colleges. She also pointed out that the individuals charged with
deciding whether to increase the tenure clock are faculty or members of committees
that are elected by the faculty; administrators would not be involved in selecting the
faculty members who would make these decisions.

unanimously approved changes to the Bylaws of the Board of Directors of the
Washtenaw   Community   Health  Organization, as described  in the  Regents
Communication.
University of Michigan Health System  (UMHS) Washtenaw   Community Health
Organization (WCHO) Reappointments to the WCHO Board of Directors
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the regents
unanimously approved reappointments of Martha Bloom and Jerry Walden to the

﻿MAY MEETING, 2011

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
May 19, 2011
The regents met at 3:10 p.m. at the Fairlane Center on the campus of the
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Present were President Coleman and Regents
Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, and White. Also present were
Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Provost Hanlon,
Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Interim Vice President Michels, Chancellor
Person, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Vice President Harper was absent. Regent Taylor was absent, but
participated in the first part of the meeting by telephone.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order, and thanked Chancellor Little
for hosting the meeting on the Dearborn campus. She called attention to the annual
Road Scholars tour and the historic 3-week tour of China currently underway by the
University of Michigan Symphony Band. She also commended C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital on being named among the best in the country by U.S. News and World
Report, and Coach Lloyd Carr for being inducted into the College Football Hall of
Fame.
Regents' Resolution Regarding Graduate Student Research Assistants
President Coleman turned the floor over to Regent Darlow, who moved that the
board adopt the following resolution:
Resolved, that consistent with the University of Michigan's proud
history of strong, positive, and mutually productive labor relations, the
Board of Regents supports the rights of University Graduate Student
Research Assistants, whom we recognize as employees, to determine for
themselves whether they choose to organize.
Regent Taylor seconded the motion.
Discussion of Resolution
President Coleman made the following statement:
Now I want to add a few thoughts of my own about this issue, one I feel passionate
about personally and am deeply concerned about on an institutional level. I must respectfully
disagree with the resolution. I am going to speak from my own experience, first as a graduate
and doctoral student, then as a researcher working side-by-side with research assistants in the
pursuit of new knowledge.
The most important thing I want to say is this: I do not see research assistants as our
employees but as our students. These are among our best and our brightest students, who will
learn from the researchers with whom they work and go on to even greater discoveries as they
take ownership of their shared scholarly study and then build on it.
When I was a graduate student, I did not see myself as working for the university and I
did not see my faculty mentor as my employer. Far from it. He was my mentor, my tutor, and my

281






﻿May Meeting, 2011

colleague as I progressed in my course of study.
As a PhD student, we were partners in the research enterprise, him helping me to
understand the process more deeply through our shared academic interest. We were in it
together for the long-term, and I had very specific goals: Do my best work and shine in the lab --
so that I could continue my work and, frankly, continue to be funded and successfully complete
my educational path.
And when I became a faculty researcher and mentor, I realized the critical importance
of recruiting research assistants with whom I could share that long-term interest and
commitment. Unlike the hiring of a GSI -- who may work for several different instructors to
address university needs -- research assistant hiring is done at the level of the faculty member,
based on a matching process between the interest of the faculty and the interest of the student. I
looked for specific research assistants who showed enormous potential and significant academic
performance. And research assistants sought me out as someone they could learn from.
Progress along the path was not an employee evaluation, but a measure of progress
toward degree completion.
I believed my most important role as an educator was to mentor and acculturate
promising graduate students, and to bring them along with me as we envisioned new frontiers for
our research. For me, this personal mentor and mentee relationship is the heart and soul of the
learning experience for research-based graduate students.
I know I speak for Provost Hanlon as well when I express my concern about
characterizing our research assistants as University employees. We believe it could
fundamentally alter the relationship between faculty and graduate students. Decisions about who
a student studies with must remain with the two people who care most about the outcome - the
student and his or her mentor. At highly competitive research institutions such as Michigan,
students seek out faculty based on specialized research that aligns with their interests, and they
choose the institution based on that particular faculty member.
This matching process, and the collegial relationship built on it, are the keys to the
recruitment of the very best faculty and staff and essential to the quality of our graduate
education overall.
I also want to clarify a few facts:
A student's performance as a research assistant is really indistinguishable from his or
her progress as a graduate student. In fact, a research assistant is expected to make and learn
from mistakes. There would be far more efficient ways to operate a lab and experiment without
involving graduate students who certainly take up quite a bit of time and energy as they are
"learning the ropes."
Also, the funding structure for research assistants is not a work-for-hire approach,
though assistants do earn salary as part of their funding package, along with financial aid and
other forms of support. Instead, faculty researchers are concerned with raising funds designed
to support the graduate student's total education - including their apprenticeship in the lab or in
other research-based academic settings.
Our research colleague Steve Forrest described it powerfully this way: The money
supplied by federal research funding provides the means for a student to pursue educational
goals while fostering innovation for the country. This has been an extraordinarily effective
strategy for more than 60 years, and it is a model used by every major research institution in the
country.
I do need to make one more fact clear about financial support, especially for the
University community: The University's standard and long-standing policy has ensured that
research assistants receive earnings and benefits increases comparable to those provided to GSIs
so they are not at a disadvantage when compared to teaching assistants.
I want to note that the University has enjoyed excellent relationships with the unions
who represent some of our employees. I hope and expect we will continue those positive working

282






﻿May Meeting, 2011

relationships. If this resolution is adopted, the University and its administration will abide by the
applicable election procedures. We will work to ensure that all individuals eligible to vote can
make a full and fair evaluation of the issue.
And finally: I appreciate this board's concern for our students as well as your work to
ensure Michigan's core academic quality. We have worked through many vexing issues together;
and, although there is disagreement over this issue, I know we share an unwavering commitment
to this great University.
Regent Deitch commented that the regents have a great deal of respect for
President Coleman, and that all agree on the extraordinary nature of her leadership and
her commitment to the institution. He stated that, while he has no opinion about
whether the graduate student research assistants ("GSRAs") should join a union, he is
confident that they are employees who have collective bargaining rights. He also noted
that "I fully expect and support the administration's prerogative to not agree to a
contract unless or until the central points which the president has articulated are
protected," especially when it comes to maintaining the selectivity and excellence of
the University's graduate students and its research capability.
Regent Richner commented on the "unprecedented action" by the board to
propose pursuing a different course than that advised by the president on an issue of
great importance to the University, and he lamented that he hadn't had sufficient
opportunity to review  the proposal before having to vote on it.    He requested
clarification from Regent Darlow on the definition of "graduate student research
assistant" and she responded that graduate student research assistants are defined in the
Faculty Handbook as one of the categories of employees listed under the heading
"Graduate Student Employees." She also observed that there is an established legal
process for determining the makeup of a bargaining unit. Regent Richner expressed
concern about whether the president would have any power to negotiate the makeup of
the bargaining unit. Regent Darlow pointed out that the board's job is to articulate
policy, and not to dictate actions to the executive.
Regent Richner expressed concern over what would happen if a legal authority
determined that GSRAs should not be recognized as employees, and about other
consequences of the board approving the resolution, including the impact it would have
on the University's reputation, faculty and student recruiting, and academic freedom.
He stated that he was opposed to the resolution.
Regent Newman commented that the regents had only been informed about this
resolution shortly before the start of the meeting, allowing insufficient time for
discussion, and said that she would oppose the motion. She said she is convinced that
GSRAs are not in an employee-employer relationship with their faculty mentors, and
adoption of the resolution would lead to a fundamental change in the relationship
between principal investigators and their research assistants. She noted that the board
and administration had managed to work productively together, despite their
differences, in moving the University forward during difficult times, and said she found
it "deeply troubling" that the majority of the board would proffer such a motion, against
the vehement disagreement from academic administrators with direct, personal
experience working with GSRAs.

The vote was then taken, and the resolution was approved, with Regents
Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Taylor, and White in favor, and Regents Newman and
Richner opposed.
Regents Taylor and Deitch left the meeting at this point.

Elaine G. Clark, Ph.D., professor of history in the College of Arts, Sciences,
and Letters, University of Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active faculty status on
April 30, 2011.
Professor Clark received her A.B. degree from the University of Detroit in
1966, her M.A. degree from Loyola University of Chicago in 1968, and her Ph.D.
degree from the University of Michigan in 1977. She joined the University of
Michigan-Dearborn faculty as an assistant professor in 1980, and was promoted to
associate professor in 1985, and professor in 1993.
Professor Clark's area of scholarship focused on the social-legal aspects of local
life in Medieval England. More recently, she developed an interest in the field of
nineteenth-century English religious history, specifically on the role of Catholics in the
campaign for women's suffrage in Victorian England. She has also done considerable
archival research on the parish missions of modern English Jesuits and on Jesuits as
military chaplains during World War I and II.
Professor Clark's reputation as a teacher on the Dearborn campus is legendary.
She received the University of Michigan-Dearborn's Distinguished Teaching Award
twice--in 1985 and 1999--and was also honored with a teaching award from the
Michigan Association of Governing Boards in 1987. Unlike some historians, who have
difficulty attracting students to a field they considered too esoteric, Professor Clark was
one of the most popular professors on campus, with most of her classes filled to
capacity before the start of the semester. Professor Clark chaired the Distinguished
Research Award Committee, co-chaired the 2002 Higher Learning Commission Report,
served on dean and chancellor search committees, and on the University Scholarship
Committee. An extraordinarily caring individual and gifted teacher, Professor Clark
has mentored hundreds of students during her lengthy career.
The Regents now salute this dedicated and accomplished teacher and scholar for

﻿May Meeting, 2011

Professor Culver was a tireless and effective advocate for string education in the
public schools. Working with prominent members of the Michigan chapter of the
American String Teachers Association (ASTA), he helped craft the program, "Services
for Strings," which was adopted by all thirteen state colleges and universities with
music training programs. Professor Culver became the special outreach chair for
Michigan ASTA and developed school string programs, string camps, summer string
teacher workshops, and feasibility studies which led directly to the creation of new
string programs in public schools. He was a long-time faculty member at national and
international string workshops and has been a clinician, all state orchestra conductor,
and consultant throughout the United States and abroad.
Professor Culver was president-elect, president, and past president of ASTA
from 1986-92. He developed the American String Workshop and was artistic director
of the Banff International Festival of Youth Orchestras. His extensive involvement in
the string community led to the recruitment and placement of graduate students and the
creation of 20 new string programs throughout Michigan. His publications include a
widely used evaluation program for non-musician administrators, The Master Teacher
Profile, and five articles in the American String Teacher journal. In 2010, Professor
Culver received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Michigan Chapter of the
American String Teachers Association.

University in 1966 and 1970, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an associate professor in 1978, and was promoted to professor in 1982.
Professor Dolgachev's work combines the most modemrn techniques of algebraic
geometry with an unparalleled knowledge of the classical literature. He has made
fundamental contributions to many areas in the field, including the theory of algebraic
surfaces and their automorphisms, the theory of singularities and vector bundles, and
geometric invariant theory. In 1981, he introduced a class of algebraic surfaces now
called Dolgachev surfaces that have become very important in topology. Well known
for his expository writing, he has published four books and a forthcoming survey of
classical algebraic geometry, and has written over 75 research papers with numerous
collaborators. In 1998, he co-authored with Yi Hu a seminal paper on the phenomena
surrounding the variation of polarizations in geometric invariant theory. In 2009,
Professor Dolgachev and V. Iskovskikh completed the classification of all finite
subgroups of the plane Cremona group. He has served on the editorial board of the
Michigan Mathematical Journal for 13 years, including two years as managing editor,
and is currently on the editorial boards of Number Theory and Physics, Electronic
Research Announcements (ERA) and the Journal Gokova Geometry Topology.
Professor Dolgachev has played a central role in the intellectual life of the
department over the last thirty years. He sponsored popular seminars in algebraic
geometry and in physics and geometry, and energetically mentored 16 successful Ph.D.
students and numerous postdocs in algebraic geometry. He has taught advanced

professor in 1992.
Professor Sameroff is a pioneering theorist who has made profound and long-
lasting contributions to our understanding of risk processes in human development and
behavioral science. He proposed a new theoretical model for conceptualizing how
biological and environmental risk factors operate together as causes of developmental
impairments in childhood, unlike most prior research in this area, which had been based
on reductionist and mechanistic models positing single risk factors as primary causes of
developmental impairments. Professor Sameroff's theory has enjoyed mainstream
popularity for over 30 years and continues to inspire new empirical and theoretical
research. His 1975 review article introducing his theory was listed by the Society for
Research in Child Development as one of the most influential contributions to
developmental science in the twentieth century. During a career spanning more than 40
years, Professor Sameroff has written or co-written 13 books and over 150 articles and
chapters. He is widely regarded as one of the founders of an important new field of
behavioral science, developmental psychopathology. In recognition of his lasting
contributions to developmental science, he has received numerous major awards,
including the G. Stanley Hall Award for Distinguished Contribution to Developmental
Psychology  from  the American   Psychological Association  (2001), and  the

degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1968. She served on the faculty of Indiana
University from 1968-81, and joined the University of Michigan faculty as professor in
1981. She was appointed the Eliza M. Mosher Distinguished University Professor in
1994.
Professor Vicinus, one of the most distinguished feminist historians and literary
critics in the Anglophone world, is a pioneer of nineteenth-century feminist studies,
labor history, and lesbian history. Her major monographs include The Industrial Muse:
A Study of Nineteenth-Century British Working-Class Literature (1974); Independent
Women: Work and Community for Single Women, 1850-1920 (1985); and Intimate
Friends: Women Who Loved Women, 1778-1928 (2004). She edited four volumes and
authored dozens of articles and was an influential editor of Victorian Studies and

1. The parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Lycera Corporation.
2. The service to be provided is the lease of 14,134 gross square feet of laboratory and
office space in Building 26 at the North Campus Research Complex, located at 2800
Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan, for three years. The lease will begin during
the summer of 2011. Tenant will pay a monthly rate of $42,083.33, with annual
increase of 3 percent. The lease is a full service gross lease with all costs covered by
monthly rent.
The service to be provided under the animal services agreement are regulatory
oversight of tenant research protocols utilizing research animals at the North Campus
Research Complex; housing and care of research rodents and the purchase of
research rodents. The animal services will begin during the summer of 2011 and will
be limited to the term of the lease. Tenant will pay standard rate(s) for these services
(see rates for Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine (ULAM) services for non-
university entities) that is non-negotiable and not to exceed a total annual value of
$500,000, billable in monthly installments.

that North Campus Research Complex executive director David Canter, Professor
Jamie Ferrara, Professor Gary Glick, and Associate Professor Anthony Opipari,
University of Michigan employees, are owners of an equity interest in Lycera
Corporation. David Canter does not manage lease or service agreements with private
companies at the North Campus Research Complex.

﻿JUNE MEETING, 2011

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
June 16, 2011
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Ilitch, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Forrest, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Harper, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President
Rudgers, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice
President Wilbanks.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. Noting that the new chair and
vice chair of the Board of Regents are elected annually at the June meeting, President
Coleman thanked Regent Darlow for her leadership as chair during the past year and
Regent Ilitch for her contributions as vice chair. She then called on Regent Darlow.
Comments from Regent Darlow
Regent Darlow thanked President Coleman, noting "what an amazing talent
she's brought to the institution, what incredible contributions she makes every day, and
particularly the efforts she makes to work with us as a board." She thanked Regent
Richner for his leadership as chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance
Committee, Regent White for her leadership of the Finance, Audit and Investment
Committee, and Regent Deitch for his work as the first chair of the newly established
Health Affairs Committee. She also thanked Regent Ilitch for her most valuable
assistance as vice chair of the board.
Election of Board Officers for 2011-2012
Regent Darlow stated that the Regents' Bylaws direct that the positions of chair
and vice chair of the board rotate based on seniority. She therefore moved the
nomination of Regent Denise Ilitch as chair of the Board of Regents and Regent
Laurence Deitch as vice chair, effective July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012. Regent
Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Statement
Regent Ilitch requested that a statement issued by a majority of the board be
made part of the record of the meeting. The statement, "Statement Concerning
Resolution of May 19, 2011," can be found in the appendix on page 373.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman welcomed Lisa Rudgers, vice president for global
communications and strategic initiatives, and thanked Associate Vice President Kallie
Michels for her service as interim vice president for communications. She announced
that in keeping with the University's institutional values of providing a healthy

329






﻿June Meeting, 2011

environment for faculty, staff, students, and visitors, beginning July 1, 2011, the
University would begin implantation of its previously announced "smoke-free campus"
initiative on all three campuses. She noted that programs are in place to support those
who smoke and would like to quit.
Introductory Comments Regarding Proposed 2011-2012 Revenue and
Expenditure Operating Budgets
President Coleman commented that the agenda includes the review and
approval of the University's 2011-12 budgets. She noted that the budget demonstrates
the commitment of the University's leadership to both academic quality and
affordability, even during this period of historic reductions in state funding. She
pointed out that increases to the financial aid budget make it possible for a Michigan
resident undergraduate with a family income of less than $80,000 pays less today than
in 2004, making the University affordable to students from all socio-economic
backgrounds.
President Coleman observed that the commitment to quality, affordability, and
accessibility has come at the cost of millions of dollars in cuts, cost controls, and
sacrifices on the part of faculty and staff, and that the proposed 2011-2012 budget
includes the most cuts of any year since the cost-control program began in 2003. She
called on a collective, statewide commitment to higher education as the University
approaches its bicentennial in 2017.
2010-2011 Operating Budgets - All Campuses
Executive Vice President Slottow gave a presentation focusing on the
University's balance sheet, which is one indicator of the overall strength of the
University. He said that two things are fundamental to protecting and strengthening the
balance sheet--adherence to sound financial policies and principles, and having a strong
internal control structure.
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the University has net assets of
$10.1 billion. The relation of overall assets to overall liabilities is healthy, as is the
relationship of financial assets to actual debt.  However, he pointed out that the
majority of financial assets are long-term assets with restricted uses. He also noted that
the balance sheet does not include approximately $600 million in deferred maintenance,
and the University can no longer depend on state funding to meaningfully contribute to
reducing this liability. Other threats include capital market volatility, the state and
national economies, rising health care and energy costs, and competitive pressures for
faculty recruitment and retention, financial aid, and external research funding.
Executive Vice President Slottow reported on the status of endowment of the
General Fund, noting that the $233 million endowment provided about $12 million in
annual revenue in FY 2011 to support core operating expenses. Other revenue
strategies to supplement the General Fund include additional annual and one-time
external revenue sources and internal reallocations, for a total of $66 million in annual
revenue and $40 million in one-time revenue to the General Fund.
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that the University owns a vast number
of physical assets that need to be maintained, and described how commitment to

330






﻿June Meeting, 2011

renewal of the physical plant pays off by both mitigating the need for building
replacement and reducing the annual operating costs of buildings. He also pointed out
how the University's commitment to sustainability efforts have yielded decreased use
of total energy, transportation energy, water use, and in emissions when normalized for
building square footage. New, stringent, energy-efficiency standards have been
adopted for new buildings with construction values over $10 million.
In the area of human capital, Executive Vice President Slottow described
investments such as the MHealthy programs for improving the overall health of faculty
and staff, and described features of the health benefits strategy, child care initiative, and
other programs meant to increase productivity and improve the work environment for
faculty and staff.
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the University enjoys the highest
possible credit ratings. He displayed a "debt profile" chart, describing how the cost of
debt had been reduced over time despite a significant reduction in the University's
exposure to variable rate debt. In conclusion, he observed that even in the midst of the
worst state economy in 50 years and other financial challenges, the University's
financial health remains strong and the proposed budgets support the University's
overall financial health.
2011-2012 Operating Budgets-All Campuses; Proposed Ann Arbor General Fund
Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates for FY 2011-2012
Provost Hanlon reported that total operating revenues will increase by 3.4% in
FY 2011-2012, from $5.8 billion to $6.0 billion. General Fund revenues are projected
to increase by 2.2%, the Designated Fund by .7%, the Auxiliary Fund by 3.3%, and the
Expendable Restricted Fund by 5.7%. Total expenditures do not equal total revenues,
due to the fact that auxiliary funds are permitted to operate with a margin. He praised
members of the budget team, noting that "this is the finest such team at any university
in the country."
Provost Hanlon reported that the Ann Arbor campus has been anticipating a
significant reduction in its state appropriation, and is following a multi-year financial
strategy based on the principles on investing in faculty, students and staff; enhancing
the student learning experience; focusing on stability and the predictability of tuition
and other revenue streams; and working relentlessly to drive down operational costs.
Provost Hanlon noted that the budget recommendation incorporates the largest
cut in state appropriation in the history of the University. It assumes a state
appropriation of $268.8 million, which is $47.5 million (15%) less than was received in
FY 2011, and the lowest amount in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1964. He reported
that the University's state appropriation has decreased by $166 million in real terms
since 2002, and that in FY 2011 it will comprise 17% of the General Fund, with tuition
and fees comprising 69%.
Provost Hanlon said that reallocation of existing resources will fund
investments in such areas as library collections, undergraduate entrepreneurship
programs, and instruction technology and facilities to ensure a high quality student
experience and continued excellence in the research enterprise. Significant continued
investments in centrally-awarded, need-based financial aid will cover the increased cost

331






﻿June Meeting, 2011

of attendance for undergraduates, and graduate student aid will increase by 4.9%.
Additional aid is provided by the individual schools and colleges.
Provost Hanlon stated that the investments in financial aid and academic
initiatives are made possible by nearly $44 million in reallocations and expenditure
reductions. He noted that these will impact the academic enterprise through the
elimination and downsizing of some centers and institutes, staff reductions in some
student service areas, and offering lower enrollment classes less frequently.
The recommended tuition increase for resident undergraduate students is 6.7%,
and for non-resident undergraduate students is 4.9%. Resident and non-resident
graduate student tuition will increase by 4.9%. He pointed out that Michigan's
proposed FY 2012 resident undergraduate tuition and fees are less than those of some
of its peer public and Big Ten universities, but they exceed those of peer public
institutions for non-resident undergraduates. Michigan ranks second in cost for resident
undergraduates among Michigan public universities.
The recommended FY 2012 General Fund budget for the Ann Arbor campus is
$1,587,037, an increase of 2.2% over FY 2011. He concluded that because of multi-
year planning in anticipation of a significant reduction, this budget proposal will enable
the University to successfully manage through the largest cut in state appropriation
history. However, this is only made possible because of a significant level of cost
reduction and reallocation undertaken over the past few years with the support of the
board.
Proposed Dearborn Campus FY 2011-2012 General Fund Operating Budget
Chancellor Little reported that Dearborn campus officials had been anticipating
the state appropriation reduction for the past several years and had been planning
accordingly. While the 15% reduction is the largest ever in the history of the campus,
he is confident that the proposed budget for the Dearborn campus honors the three
priorities of maintaining the academic excellence of academic programs, maintaining
accessibility, and maintaining a high quality work environment. The current budget
continues the pattern of cost reduction and budget reallocations that has occurred on the
Ann Arbor campus. The budget calls for an increase of only slightly more than 1%
over the previous year's budget. It includes a recommended tuition increase of 6.9%
for resident undergraduate students and graduate students, putting the campus in a
competitive position compared to other state colleges and universities. The budget is
premised on a 1% increase in credit hours, and it includes a 2% salary program, a 15%
increase in financial aid resources, and academic program investments.
Proposed Flint Campus FY 2011-2012 General Fund Operating Budget
Chancellor Person reported that the University of Michigan-Flint budget
assumes a 14.7% decrease in state funding, and a tuition and fee increase of 6.8% for
resident undergraduate students and 4.9% for graduate students. It also assumes a 1%
undergraduate and 9% graduate enrollment increase, and an 8.8% increase in
institutional financial aid.  The total budget of $92.5 million assumes a state
appropriation of about $17.8 million. It includes reductions in utilities expenses and in
general administration, and a planned reduction of the reserve as a means of weathering
the unprecedented decrease in state appropriation.

﻿June Meeting, 2011

2011-2012 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
Vice President Harper reported that the recommended fee assessments for MSA
and school and college governments would remain the same as those in 2010-11.
However, it is recommended that the Student Legal Services fee be increased by $2.50,
for a total of $8.50 per student per term. She gave an overview of the history, purpose,
and benefits of Student Legal Services, and said that an external review had
recommended establishment of a sustainable funding model for this organization. The
proposed fee increase is designed to sustain SLS until FY 2016.
2011-2012 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Harper submitted a recommendation for a 0.7% increase ($1.20)
in the Health Service fee, bringing the total fee to $172.40 per student per term.
Proposed FY 2012 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers
(UMHHC) Operating Budget
Mr. Doug Strong, chief executive officer of the UMHHC, presented the
proposed FY 2012 UMHHC operating budget.      He described the "Balance of
Excellence" used by the UMHHC to gauge its performance, and gave examples of the
Hospitals and Health Centers' successes and challenges in each of these areas. The
elements include quality and safety, being a provider of choice and employer of choice,
providing benefit to the community, having an external presence, preparing for the
future, and financial success. He reported that the UMHHC is the only health system in
the state to have seen patients from every county in state in FY 2011.
Mr. Strong noted that activities levels have continued to rise over time. The rate
of increase of revenues per adjusted case has diminished over time, and the rate of
increase in total expense per case has decreased accordingly. Productivity has
improved, and activity growth trends for FY 2012 are expected to be at historical
levels. He noted that additional capacity will be created in FY 2012 with the opening
of the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital and Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital, the
expanded adult emergency services, redeployment of services in the University
Hospital to Cancer Services, and expansion of ambulatory care in the Taubman Center.
Mr. Strong reviewed the challenges and uncertainties inherent in the FY 2012
budget. These include state and federal budget reductions, the pace of economic
recovery in Michigan, expected activity levels, continuation of the pace for productivity
improvements, and the complexities of activating the new children's and women's
hospitals.
Mr. Strong displayed a chart illustrating operating revenues and expenses. The
operating margin in FY 2010 was 3.2%, while the forecast margin of 2.1% for FY 2011
is less than had been expected. For FY 2012, the forecasted operating margin before
the cost of activation of the new hospitals and information systems is 3.0%, but taking
the net activation impact into account, it will yield an operating margin of -1.1% (-
$23.5 million). He concluded that the institution remains financially strong, and while
revenue pressures are expected to continue, UMHHC has a robust plan to improve its

333






﻿June Meeting, 2011

financial performance over the next 2-3 years after the new facility has been opened
and is fully operational.
FY 2012 University of Michigan Department of Athletics Operating Budget
Mr. David Brandon, Donald R. Shepherd Director of Athletics, reported that the
Athletic Department's budget surplus has allowed the department to make significant
investments in its facilities. The department also continues to fund a $4.5 million
allowance for deferred maintenance. He reported that Michigan Stadium premium
seats are sold out, and projects totaling more than $134 million are in process. Mr.
Brandon said that the department is in a sound financial position, with $310 million in
net assets, strong endowment balances, and a total debt ($197 million) that is well
within its debt capacity. There is sufficient funding to add men's and women's lacrosse
teams as varsity sports. The FY 2011-2012 budget calls for revenues of $121,218 and
expenses of $109,835, yielding an operating surplus of $11,383,000.
Mr. Brandon reported that the Athletics Department had recently undergone a
strategic planning process, which included the development of a new mission statement
("Relentlessly striving to make Michigan Athletics the leaders and best in every way")
and a number of guiding principles and long range goals.
Regent Richner asked how many Division 1 athletic departments are self-
supporting; Mr. Brandon responded that the University of Michigan is unique in being
not only self-supporting in operations, but also in facilities. Regent Newman pointed
out that the Athletic Department does not receive any money from the General Fund,
and Mr. Brandon confirmed that the department also contributes about $1.8 million per
year to the General Fund. Regent Newman said that the University of Michigan is
unique in this financial model.
Proposed Ann Arbor FY 2011-2012 Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Regent Richner asked Provost Hanlon how large the proposed tuition and fee
increase would have been if the University would have had to use tuition and fees
increases to cover the entire loss in state appropriation. Provost Hanlon said this would
have required an additional increase of about 6% beyond the current proposal.
Regent White moved approval of the proposed Ann Arbor FY 2011-2012
student tuition and fee rates. Regent Maynard seconded the motion.
Comments from Regent Ilitch. Regent Ilitch noted that the University is
proposing a tuition increase for the 14th year in a row, and this time, there will be a
higher percentage  increase  for Michigan  undergraduates than  non-resident
undergraduates. She expressed agreement with a recent Detroit News editorial, that this
"is a destructive cycle that has been ongoing in Michigan, as college costs have nearly
doubled every decade."
Regent Ilitch expressed her firm commitment to advocate for "an affordable,
accessible and quality education at the University of Michigan for all" and she
expressed concern that "this is becoming out of reach for our middle class and working
families." Tuition increases, she pointed out, "are particularly harmful to Michigan
families who have lost 22% of their household incomes in the past decade" and also
impact the diversity of the student body.

334






﻿June Meeting, 2011

Regent Ilitch said that while the University has made "terrific strides" with cost
containment and financial aid, and through savings that "have come from greater
sharing of health benefit costs, procurement initiatives, expanded energy conservation
efforts and reorganizations in facilities management, ... we need to look deeper into our
academic enterprise for efficiency opportunities" and "aggressively pursue greater
savings." Regent Ilitch continued that "It is most critical that we start the process of
creating a strategic plan for the long term that changes continued reliance of raising
tuition on the backs of our students to find new revenue. We must look for new ways
to address the skyrocketing costs of tuition."
Regent Ilitch stated that she is confident that "we can find solutions that will
keep a U of M education affordable and accessible to Michigan working families" and
noted that she would not be supporting the proposed tuition increase. She expressed the
hope that more would be done "to cut costs and enhance revenue, but not on the backs
of students."
Comments from Regent Deitch. Regent Deitch stated that he would be voting
against the proposed Ann Arbor General Fund budget and student tuition and fees rates
for the first time in his 19 years on the Board of Regents. He stated his opposition to
the governor's "cut and cap" budget, which cut higher education funding and imposed a
cap on tuition increases in order to receive that funding. He said that he recognizes the
cuts that have been made and the importance of maintaining excellence, but expressed
concern about the higher percentage increase for residents than that for nonresidents,
and how this would affect middle class Michigan families who may not qualify for
financial aid. His dissenting vote is meant to convey the idea that "when in doubt, the
benefit should go to Michigan people."
Regent Deitch also noted that comparisons of the University of Michigan's
tuition rates to those of other Big Ten universities rather than private institutions do not
accurately reflect the institutions Michigan actually competes with for nonresident
undergraduate students. That is why he advocated either a higher increase for
nonresidents or an equal rate for residents and nonresidents. So his dissention is based
on his belief that "the benefit of the doubt should go to Michigan residents in a time of
economic difficulty." However, he will support the proposed increases for the Flint and
Dearborn campuses because they do not have the resources available on the Ann Arbor
campus.
In response to a question from Regent Richner, Regent Deitch stated that his
proposal would be revenue neutral. Regent Richner asked Provost Hanlon what the
impact of Regent Deitch's proposal would be. Provost Hanlon responded that there
was anecdotal evidence from deans that the cost for nonresidents was having an impact
on competitiveness. Another, measurable factor is the negative effect on the socio-
economic diversity of the student body created by the fact that the University is not able
to meet the full demonstrated financial needs of nonresident students.
Comments from Regent Darlow. Regent Darlow spoke in support of the FY
2011-2012 Ann Arbor General Fund operating budget and student tuition and fee rates.
She pointed out that even with the discrepancy in percentage increases for resident and
nonresident students, the dollar amount of the increase for nonresidents is still more
than twice that for residents. Her support for the 2011-2012 tuition and fee rates is

335






﻿June Meeting, 2011

based on the amount of financial aid allocated for Michigan residents, and this aid is
applied for income levels of $80,000 and less, which is above the median state income
level. She noted that students who have been receiving aid will be better off than they
were the previous year, which has been the case for the past couple of years. However,
Regent Darlow suggested that in the future, more attention ought to be paid to financial
aid for nonresidents and the issue of improving the economic diversity of the student
body. She also cautioned that she does not believe the current rate of tuition increase is
sustainable, given that real family incomes in Michigan are decreasing.
Regent Deitch said that he agrees with Provost Hanlon's concern about
economic diversity, but noted that profound initiatives would be required to be able to
provide financial aid for out-of-state students, since current out-of-state students are
mostly at the higher end of the income spectrum. That is the basis of his belief that the
price differential should be geared more toward Michigan students.
Comments from Regent Newman. Regent Newman suggested that it would
be interesting to see data on how out-of-state students decide whether to come to
Michigan. Provost Hanlon responded that admitted students are surveyed to determine
the factors that inform their decision on whether to come to Michigan. Regent
Newman suggested that this would help determine whether other Big Ten schools are
significant competitors.
Regent Newman observed that her decisions on whether to support tuition and
fee increases are made on a year-by-year basis and she only supports increases when
actually necessary. While she is "concerned about pricing our students out of an
education, this year is one of those years when we need to support the increase because
the steep budget cuts made by the legislature this year are impossible to make up under
current scenarios." She noted that even though she doesn't like the fact that students
need to sacrifice along with the rest of the state's population to achieve the objectives
of the budget cuts, "I have to put the interest of the institution and the future of the
institution ahead as a regent. So I believe that the tuition increase this year is necessary
and that in order to do my duty, I will support the tuition increase."
Comments from Regent Maynard. Regent Maynard said she supports the
tuition increase, but noted that the issues being raised highlight the fact that in the
future, financial aid must be a consideration for both in-state and out-of-state students.
She noted that the University of Michigan must continue to be accessible to future
generations of students from out-of-state, as exemplified by the noted playwright,
Arthur Miller.
The vote was then taken on the motion to approved the Ann Arbor FY 2011-
2012 student tuition and fee rates, and it was approved, with Regents Darlow, Maynard,
Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White in favor and Regents Deitch and Ilitch opposed.
Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets for FY 2011-2012
Regent White moved approval of the revenue and expenditure operating
budgets for FY 2011-2012. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was
approved, with Regents Darlow, Maynard, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White in
favor and Regents Deitch and Ilitch opposed.

the University of Michigan faculty as an associate professor in 1981.
Professor Alfred taught courses in organizational strategy, leadership, and
financial management and effectiveness in colleges and universities with a particular
focus on community colleges. He is the founding director of the Center for Community
College Development and the author of more than 150 publications on the topics of
organizational strategy, governance, institutional effectiveness, planning  and
assessment, and change management in colleges and universities. He is a nationally
and internationally recognized writer, researcher, speaker, and consultant on the topic
of community college education.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Richard
L. Alfred associate professor emeritus of education.

Professor Bulkley earned two S.B. degrees, in political science and civil
engineering, in 1961, and S.M. and Ph.D. degrees, in 1963 and 1966, respectively, all
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Following two years of active duty in
the U.S. Army, he joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1968 as an assistant

Professor Bulkley is well-known for his research on the development and
application of both quantitative and qualitative means to help improve the planning,
evaluation, and management of natural resources-especially water resources-to
achieve sustainability. He has written on the risk associated with lead and mercury and
wet-weather and wastewater flows, and has argued for holistic planning through
watershed planning and management. He is a nationally and internationally recognized
expert on storm water, combined sewer overflows and water collections systems.
During his 43-year career at the University of Michigan, Professor Bulkley has

The University Attorney reported that the will of Dr. Laura A.           L. A. Lane:
Lane, who attended the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts          will
from 1898 to 1900 and who received her M.D. degree from the University of Colorado in 1904, has recently been offered for probate in
Ontario County, New York. Bequests are made to The University of
Michigan as follows:
"TENTH: I give and bequeath to the University of Michigan, of Ann Arbor,
Michigan, all my collection of lantern slides and such research data as I may
have, including my file of radiological reprints and abstracts, and a complete
radium index catalog of all the literature pertaining to the use of radium in Ophthalmology since its first use in 1904.
"TWELFTH: I direct that my executor reduce to cash the remaining items of
tangible personal property and my real property, and I give and bequeath the
same, together with all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate equally to the
University of Michigan, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, the University of Colorado, of
Boulder, Colorado, and the College of Physicians, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
(Chestnut and 22nd Streets), and I direct that the same be used by said institutions solely in connection with their respective departments of Ophthalmology and
Oto-laryngology."
The attorney for the estate advises that after specific bequests probably the
only asset will be the decedent's farm residence at Victor, New York.

The Regents, on recommendation of the President and the VicePresident and Dean of Faculties, appointed Dr. Myron Ezra Wegman
as Dean of the School of Public Health beginning September 1, 1960,
to succeed Dean Henry F. Vaughan.
The Regents paid a high compliment to all those who were instrumental in choosing Dr. Vaughan's successor. They were particularly
pleased with the final report on the candidate nominated and with the
procedures which culminated in the report.
The Regents adopted the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Regents of The University of Michigan express to William
C. Gibson, Acting Dean of the School of Public Health and Professor of Public
Health Engineering, their high esteem for the outstanding quality of leadership he
has shown in his position as Acting Dean of the School of Public Health. They
have observed with admiration his abilities in continuing the administration of his
School during an interim period that called for sound judgment and quiet action.
They congratulate him upon his graciousness, upon his self-effacement, upon his
deep loyalty to the University, and upon his devotion to the best interests of his
assignment. The Regents thank Professor Gibson for his splendid work and are
indebted to him for his exemplary administrative performance.
The following promotions, transfers, salary adjustments, and other
changes in status were approved (R.P., 1957-60, p. 1271):

The Secretary reported the retirement of seven members of the
faculty. The following memoirs were adopted:
F. N. Calhoon:     FLOYD    NEWTON     CALHOON, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, has
Memoir   asked for and received permission to commence his retirement on June 30 of this
year, at the age of sixty-five. He was graduated from the university of his native
state, Louisiana, and gained four years of professional experience and a year's
teaching experience at his alma mater before coming to The University of Michigan
as graduate student and teaching assistant. Here he earned his master's degree in
1925, and was appointed successively assistant professor, associate professor, and
professor. His technical specialty has been heating and air conditioning. Working
in close conjunction with architects, industrial engineers, and the research personnel
of the Wood Utilization Laboratory of the School of Natural Resources, he has
carried out investigations into such problems as the heat conductivity of building
materials, the effect of the size and shape of air spaces on the rate of heat transfer,
and the performance of water-coil air coolers under diverse atmospheric conditions.
In 1953 and the years following, he was invited to serve on the instructional staff
of the annual Industrial Ventilation Conference sponsored by the Michigan Department of Health and Michigan State University. Within his College and department,

Professor Calhoon was valued as a versatile teacher and director of research, a
judicious and sympathetic counselor to students, and a quiet, consistent worker on
committees and special assignments. On this occasion of conferring upon him the
title Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering, the Regents of the University
thank him for his long devotion and gratefully extend to him the privileges of his
new rank.
WALTER JOHNSON EMMONS, Professor of Highway Engineering in the
Department of Civil Engineering and Associate Dean and Secretary of the College
of Engineering, retired from the active faculty at the end of June after thirty-three
years of association with the University. A native of Rhode Island, he earned a
bachelor's degree from Brown University and a master's degree from Columbia
before entering upon his professional career. He was early attracted into highway
research; for four years he was Professor of Highway Engineering at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas and for three years Research Specialist in
the United States Bureau of Public Roads. Joining the faculty of The University
of Michigan as associate professor in 1927, he continued his inquiries into bituminous highway surfaces and served, for varying intervals, as Director of the Michigan State Highway Laboratory, President of the Ann Arbor Board of Public Works,
and officer, member, or consultant to a diversity of professional associations and
agencies. Drawn gradually into administrative affairs, he was appointed Assistant
Dean and Secretary of his College in 1944. In that office, his counsel to students
was at once sympathetic and exact and his superintendence of detail unobtrusively
efficient. It was in good part through Dean Emmons' sound judgment and unremitting labor that the College of Engineering was able to accommodate the
swollen enrollment of the postwar years with a minimum of dislocation. He continued, meanwhile, to keep abreast of developments in highway engineering, of
which he was appointed professor in 1952, and to serve the University on multifarious committees and governing boards. His title was changed to Associate Dean
in 1957. For his valuable professional contribution to his College, and for his
devotion beyond the call of duty in the discharge of his many executive and deliberative offices, the Regents of the University express their profoundest gratitude.
Conferring on him the titles Professor Emeritus of Highway Engineering, Associate
Dean Emeritus and Secretary Emeritus of the College of Engineering, they cordially extend to him the privileges attending his new rank.
ALBERT CARL FURSTENBERG, Dean of the Medical School, Professor of
Otolaryngology, Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology, and Medical
Adviser to the Health Service, is relinquishing his active duties after a lifetime of
distinguished service to the University and to medical science. Having elected a
combined course in the Literary College and the Medical School, Dr. Furstenberg
earned his baccalaureate degree here in 1913 and his Doctor of Medicine degree in
1915. Then, under the influence of the late Roy Bishop Canfield, he entered the
speciality in which he won his solid reputation as physician and scientist. After
completing his internship at the University Hospital, he remained to serve successively as Instructor, Assistant Professor, and Associate Professor of Otolaryngology.
Upon Dr. Canfield's death in 1932, Dr. Furstenberg was appointed professor and
departmental chairman. In 1935, upon the retirement of Dr. Frederick G. Novy,
he became Dean of the Medical School. In the years following-years which have
seen the great changes attendant upon a major war and a diversification of medical
knowledge unparalleled in history-he has presided ably and efficiently over the
University's program of medical instruction, seeking to conserve the best traditions
of existing practice while fitting each rising generation to meet the responsibilities
which the steadily increasing potential of the physician has brought with it. His
national reputation as a brilliant medical specialist he has meanwhile confirmed,
and the Department of Otolaryngology has grown and strengthened under his direction. The Regents of the University take this occasion to express the high value
they place upon Dr. Furstenberg's abilities and upon his conscientious industry.
They express a further debt for the services which he is continuing to render
under conditions of present emergency. Conferring on him the titles Dean Emeritus
of the Medical School and Professor Emeritus of Otolaryngology, they trust that he
will avail himself of the privileges attending those titles and long maintain his
University associations.
EDWIN BUTTERWORTH MAINS is retiring from the active faculty after
thirty years as Professor of Botany and Director of the University Herbarium.
A graduate of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in the Class of 1913,
he earned his doctorate here in 1916. In the ensuing years, while serving as a

botanist with the Agricultural Experiment Station of Purdue University, he established himself as an authority on those plant rusts whose changeling nature has
made them at once a scourge to the farmer and a challenge to the mycologist.
In 1930 the University recalled him to assume the offices from which he is now
retiring. Since his return, he has added significantly to his own stature and to the
sum total of human knowledge in his field. During the latter half of his career, he
has devoted also major attention to the fungi which are parasitic upon insects.
Professor Mains' bibliography contains over a hundred entries; his contribution to
the graduate program of his department has been outstanding; under his direction
the University's botanical collections have been greatly enriched and their uses
productively extended. The Regents of the University, conferring on him the titles
Director Emeritus of the University Herbarium and Professor Emeritus of Botany,
together with all perquisites of those titles, express their admiration for his professional attainments and their gratitude for his many faithful services.
W. V. Marshall:     The career of WALTER VANCLEVE MARSHALL, who is retiring as ProfesMemoir   sor of Architecture and Assistant Dean of the College of Architecture and Design,
is very nearly co-extensive with continuous instruction in the art of building at
The University of Michigan; he has been associated with the Department of Architecture during every phase of its growth. When he enrolled as an undergraduate
here in 1910, there had existed for four years a subdepartment of architecture in
the Department of Engineering. When he was halfway through his college course, a
partly autonomous Department of Architecture was established. When he returned
as instructor in 1925 after gaining practical experience in his native Montana, his
appointment was in the joint Colleges of Engineering and Architecture. And when,
with full autonomy in prospect, the faculty in architecture held its first recorded
meeting in 1929, Assistant Professor Marshall served as secretary. His subsequent
appointments as associate professor in 1936, as professor in 1946, and as assistant
dean in 1947 have been in the present separate College. A specialist in architectural mechanics, Professor Marshall presented the bases of structural theory
clearly, thoroughly, and with authority. His knowledge of University precedents
and procedures, his superior insight into the problems of his College, and his close
attention to detail made him an invaluable executive officer and representative on
cross-campus committees; his experience and long devotion have provided a necessary constant during a period of fluidity and change. The Regents of the University
join his colleagues in tendering to him their profound thanks and warmest good
wishes. Conferring on him the titles Professor Emeritus of Architecture and
Assistant Dean Emeritus of the College of Architecture and Design, they hope
that he will long avail himself of the privileges of his new rank.
S. W. McAllister:    SAMUEL WILSON       McALLISTER, Associate Director of the University
Memoir   Library, has attained the age of seventy and is entering upon his retirement. Mr.
McAllister remained at the University as library assistant after earning his bachelor's degree in 1916; with one interruption for military service, he has continued
in library work ever since. He returned to his assistantship here in 1919, earned a
master's degree in 1922, and thereafter served as librarian of 'the Ann Arbor
Public Library and of Central Michigan College. In 1928 he earned a Bachelor of
Science degree in library science at Columbia University. In 1930 the late William
Warner Bishop invited him back to The University of Michigan, and, upon Dr.
Bishop's retirement ten years later, Mr. McAllister was appointed to the office
which he is now relinquishing. Experienced in many branches of library operation
and painstaking in matters of detail, he lent coherence and steadiness to the University Library during two changes in directorship. Widely respected for his professional attainments, he lectured in library science here and at the Columbia
University School of Library Service, and presided over the Michigan Library
Association. The Regents of the University, expressing their deep appreciation of
his able service and of his strong personal loyalty, cordially invite him to enjoy
the privileges of the title which they now confer, Associate Director Emeritus of
the University Library.
H. F. Vaughan:     With the retirement of HENRY FRIEZE VAUGHAN, Professor of Public
Memoir   Health, Dean of the School of Public Health, and Chairman of the Department of
Public Health Practice, son of the beloved teacher and medical pioneer Victor C.
Vaughan, a career of distinguished service to The University of Michigan comes to
completion. Dr. Vaughan earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the College
of Engineering in 1912 and 1913 respectively; in 1916, the University conferred
upon him and one other candidate the first Doctor of Public Health degrees which
it had ever awarded. He had then already gained experience in the Michigan State
Department of Health and the Detroit Department of Health. As a captain in the




JULY MEETING, 1960


29


Army Sanitary Corps during the First World War, he served on a special pneumonia commission in the office of Surgeon-General Gorgas. Returning to Michigan
upon the termination of his active duty, he was appointed, though still only
twenty-nine, Commissioner of Health of the City of Detroit. He held appointments,
meanwhile, as associate professor and later as professor in the Wayne University
Medical School and as lecturer at Vanderbilt University and The University of
Michigan. The University appointed him Dean of its newly established School of
Public Health in 1941. Only a partial roll of Dr. Vaughan's accomplishments and
honors can be contained within this statement. The public health services which he
directed in Detroit, the immunization and child health programs in especial, were
models for the nation. A member of the governing council of the American Public
Health Association for nearly thirty years, he served for one year as its president,
edited its journal, The American Journal of Public Health, and was awarded its
Sedgwick Memorial Medal; as member, chairman, and consultant to the Association's Committee on Administrative Practice, he devised or assisted in devising
most of the administrative procedures now in use among public health agencies
throughout the country. As Dean of the School of Public Health here, he built up
superior resources, both of persons and of material facility in his field, strengthened and diversified the several programs of his School, and kept in harmony the
functions of instruction, research, and community service. The School of Public
Health has won a deserved acclaim for such outstanding achievements as its
evaluation of poliomyelitis vaccine. Its continuing and most distinctive achievement
remains the ministry to which Dr. Vaughan has devoted his mature life: the imparting at once of professional competence and breadth of outlook to future leaders
in the theory and practice of averting human malady. The Regents of the University, who now appoint him Dean Emeritus of the School of Public Health and
Professor Emeritus of Public Health, are mindful of their debt to him and of their
special sentiments of gratitude and affection for this distinguished family and name.
Inviting him to partake of the privileges of his new rank, they hope that he will
profit the University by his continued informal association.
The Secretary reported with regret the death of James Marshall           J. M. Plumer:
Plumer, Associate Professor of Far Eastern Art, on June 15, 1960. The       Memoir
following memoir was adopted:
James Marshall Plumer, Associate Professor of Far Eastern Art, died suddenly
June the fifteenth in Concord, New Hampshire. Professor Plumer was born in
Newton Centre, Massachusetts, in 1899, and educated at St. Paul's School, the
Boston Latin School, and Harvard University. In 1923 he entered the employ of
the Chinese Government in the department of Maritime Customs, and served in
port cities from Tientsin to Foochow and in such inland transportation centers as
Hankow and Mukden. During this period he became conversant with Chinese
language and culture generally and closely studied Chinese ceramic art, visiting
Buddhist cave temples in the northwestern provinces and exploring original kiln
sites in Fukien and Chekiang. On leave from his post, he taught Chinese language
at Harvard and acted as Secretary of the Harvard-Yencheng Institute. In 1935 he
joined the University of Michigan faculty as a Lecturer in Far Eastern Art. The
University appointed him associate professor in 1941. His subsequent career
embraced terms of public service as organizer of the China Unit of the Army Map
Service during the Second World War, and as fine arts adviser to General MacArthur in Tokyo in 1948-49. Ten years later, by special invitation of the Chief
Abbot of Horyu-ji Monastery and the former Marquis Hosokawa, he represented
The University of Michigan, the Fogg Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art,
and Harvard University at the unveiling of a monument to the late Professor
Langdon Warner of Harvard at the Horyu-ji in Nara, Japan. At that time
Professor Plumer was bringing to completion Professor Warner's unfinished lifework, Japanese Sculpture of the Tempyo Period. Death tragically prevented Professor Plumer from completing his own work on "Chinese Chien or Temmoku
Ware: Its Origin, Nature and Influence on Later Ceramics." A stimulating teacher
as well as a capable scholar, he lectured widely at universities and art museums
throughout the country. His colleagues honored him as well for his humane interests and temperament as for his technical proficiency. The Regents of the University mourn the early loss of this gifted and good man, and tender to his family
their profoundest sympathy.
The Secretary reported with regret the death of Chesser Milburn C. M. Campbell:
Campbell, President of the Tribune Company and Publisher of the Memoir

JULY MEETING, 1960


Chicago Tribune, on July 10, 1960. The Regents adopted the following
memoir:
The Regents were saddened by the death, on July 10, of Chesser Milburn
Campbell, publisher of the Chicago Tribune and loyal and liberal son of the
University. Chesser Campbell began his career in journalism at seventeen as a
correspondent in his native Sault Sainte Marie. At the University, from which he
was graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1921, he was city editor and news editor of the
Michigan Daily and publicist for the Michigan Union Opera. Shortly thereafter, he
entered the employ of the Chicago Tribune as a subscription salesman and was
advanced to posts of increasing responsibility until, in 1935, he became its advertising manager. He later served as treasurer and as vice-president of the complex
of enterprises of which that newspaper is part. In 1955 he succeeded the late
Colonel Robert McCormick as President of the Tribune Company and Publisher
of the Chicago Tribune. His tangible benefactions to the University included the
very liberal endowment fund which bears his name and additional gifts to studentaid monies and the Phoenix Project. As trustee of the James O'Donnell Bennett
Trust, he established the James O'Donnell Bennett Scholarship in Journalism. His
time and wisdom were freely devoted to the University's Development Council on
the occasion of its founding and during its crucial early years. The Regents are
happy that, last year, they conferred upon this generous friend and judicious
counselor their Outstanding Achievement Award. They now join the officers of the
University in mourning his loss and in extending their deepest sympathy to Mrs.
Campbell and to the members of Mr. Campbell's family.

J. L. Wilson:   On recommendation of the Dean of the Medical School, Dr. James
on Full-Time Basis  L. Wilson, Professor of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases and
Chairman of the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases,
was placed on a full-time basis beginning August 1, 1960.
J. H. Maxwell:    The following memoir on the death of Dr. James H. Maxwell, Proemoir  fessor of Otolaryngology and Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology (R.P., 1957-60, p. 1274), adopted by the Executive Faculty
of the Medical School, was received by the Regents for inclusion in the
minutes of the meeting:
Dr. James H. Maxwell, Professor of Otolaryngology and Chairman of the
Department of Otolaryngology of the University of Michigan Medical School, died
in his sleep on June 2, 1960, of coronary arterial thrombosis, thus prematurely
ending a very full and productive career.
Dr. Maxwell was born in Paw Paw, Michigan, on December 15, 1901. He
married Marjorie Arnold in 1936, who survives him with their sons, Robert and
John.
Dr. Maxwell received an A.B. degree from The University of Michigan, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, in 1924. He was granted an M.D. degree
from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1927. He received membership in Alpha Omega Alpha, Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, and Galens
honorary societies during his student days. His postgraduate training, consisting of
internship and residency in otolaryngology, was carried out at the University Hospital, Ann Arbor, between 1927 and 1932. He was Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology, University of Michigan Medical School, from 1933 to 1940, Associate
Professor, from 1940 to 1945, and Professor, from 1945 until his death. He was
appointed Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology in the Medical School
on July 1, 1958.
National and international recognition of Dr. Maxwell as a result of his interest
and abilities in teaching, research, and clinical otolaryngology led to his presidency
of the Otosclerosis Study Group, chairmanship of the Teachers Section of the
American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, and of the Committee
on Undergraduate Education and for Scientific Exhibits for the American Academy
of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology. He served on the President's Special Medical Advisory Group to the Administration of the Veterans Affairs of the Veterans
Administration. He was Secretary for the American Laryngological Association.




JULY MEETING, 1960

In addition, he was an active member of many other professional groups. He
served as a member of the Advisory Board of International Abstracts of Surgery,
Gynecology and Obstetrics, and was a member of the Editorial Board of the Annals
of Otology, Rhinology and Laryngology.
Dr. Maxwell loved his work in the Hospital and Medical School. He had few
hobbies and was happiest when working in his chosen field. He was an excellent
teacher, being able to stimulate his students to develop a critical and analytical
approach to the problem at hand. His diagnostic and surgical skills were in constant demand by the community at large and his many colleagues of the country.
He was proud of his Medical School and conscientiously emphasized the preservation of its better features and the improvement of its weaknesses.
The students and faculty of the Medical School and the medical profession
have lost a great teacher and colleague. We wish to pay the highest tribute to the
memory of- Dr. Maxwell for his many services to the University.
On recommendation of the Department of Physics and of the Dean
and Executive Committee of the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts, Professor Emeritus Harrison M. Randall was granted permission
to engage in research under grants from the U. S. Public Health Service
and other agencies from September 1, 1960, to August 31, 1961. Professor Randall was also granted permission to make use of the facilities of
the University in the prosecution of his research (R.P., 1957-60,
p. 1053).
In taking this action the Regents commended Professor Randall
most highly and extended to him congratulations and best wishes.
On recommendation of the Committee on University Fees and of
the School of Education, the Regents rescinded the following action
taken in October, 1922 (R.P., 1920-23, p. 646):
"On motion of Regent Clements the Board voted that the Vocational Education Department should be authorized to admit without fees to its courses given off
the campus students not desiring university credit. This action was taken in view
of the fact that the entire expense of this work is borne by the Smith-Hughes fund."
and authorized in its place the collection of the usual extension fee
($18 per credit hour) for persons electing courses in vocational education for no credit through the Extension Service.
On recommendation of the Dean and the Executive Committee of
the Medical School, an extension of the present principle of rotation
now applicable to junior personnel between the Medical School, the
University Hospital, and the Veterans Administration Hospital upward
to include professorial appointments was approved.
On recommendation of Alan W. MacCarthy, Director of the Development Council, and of the Vice-President for University Relations,
the following amendments to the Charter of Organization of the
Development Council were approved (R.P., 1951-54, p. 905):

North Campus   The North Campus Planning Committee, which has served as an
Planning Conr- advisory body for the University on campus planning, appeared before
the Regents and presented the following report, including the recommendation that William J. Johnson be retained to continue his campus
studies under the guidance and direction of the Committee on Campus
Planning:
Since its formation in October, 1959, the North Campus Planning Committee
has served as an advisory body for the University on campus planning. The mem

bership of the committee includes the Dean of the College of Architecture and
Design, the Chairman of the Department of Architecture, the Chairman of the
Department of Landscape Architecture, the Director of the Transportation Institute, the Vice-President for Business and Finance, the University Architect, and
the Assistant to the Vice-President for Business and Finance. The committee has
met thirteen times between October 6, 1959, and June 30, 1960.
A main focus of committee attention has been a conceptual study of the North
Campus area. Upon the advice of the committee, the Regents approved a study of
the North Campus area and the appointment of William J. Johnson, Site-Planning
Consultant of Ann Arbor, to carry out this study under direction of the committee.
The study is scheduled for completion in the fall of 1960.
As an outgrowth of the North Campus area study, the committee has explored
aspects of both the substance and the process of planning for the University
campus. In particular it has considered the prospect and advisability of extending
the concept of campus planning which has been adopted for the North Campus to
other University areas to assure a comprehensive and co-ordinated approach to
campus development. As a result of these deliberations the committee suggests a
framework for University planning and architectural services which would achieve
that end.
It is recommended that the concept and method of the North Campus study
be extended to the whole University area. This planning study should aim to
develop a flexible guide to long-range, integrated development. As far as possible
the major professional planning responsibility should be carried out under the
direction of a single firm or individual to cultivate a strong aspect of campus unity
embracing the major areas-the North Campus, the Central Campus, the Medical
Center, and the peripheral special areas.
As the over-all study of the entire campus progresses, it will be necessary to
develop studies in depth for those areas or centers of the total campus where
immediate building projects seem likely, and these studies will be developed under
the supervision of Mr. Johnson. For instance, it is as equally important in the
Medical Center that each of the buildings projected for the future be located so
as not to impair development of the Medical Center as it is important that the
development of the Medical Center does not impair development of the over-all
campus.
It is also recommended that William J. Johnson be retained to continue his
campus studies in these other areas as he completes the North Campus study. This
activity would be carried out under the guidance and direction of the Committee
on Campus Planning.
On recommendation of the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance, the firm of Smith, Hinchman and Grylls was appointed as
architects for the Institute of Science and Technology Building (R.P.,
1957-60, p. 1248). The firm of Holabird and Root was appointed to
provide architectural service for a building for hearing research in the
Medical Center.
The Regents heard a report by the Vice-President in charge of
business and finance concerning the University's policies and procedures
in the field of labor relations and the Regents' policy regarding the
Hutchinson Act (R.P., 1948-51, p. 1161). After hearing further from
the Vice-President in charge of business and finance concerning specifically a request from the Labor Mediation Board for the University to
meet with the Labor Mediation Board and a local union under the
provisions of Section 7 of Act 336 of the Public Acts of 1947 (Hutchinson Act) and to mediate alleged grievances of employees of the
Hospital main kitchen, the Regents authorized the Vice-President in
charge of business and finance to proceed in accordance with the provisions of Act 336 of the Public Acts of 1947.
The Regents directed that the record be corrected to show that Irwin
Spickler, B.S., College of the City of New York, was granted the
degree of Master of Public Health (Industrial Health) at Commencement, June 11, 1960.

The University Attorney reported that the will of Minnie L. Morrison, deceased, whose late husband, Charles N. Morrison, attended the
College of Engineering from 1899 through 1903 and who was for many
years a chemical engineer at the Dow Chemical Company in Midland,
Michigan, has been offered for probate in Dane County, Wisconsin.
The will provides for the establishment of a trust fund with the First
National Bank bf Madison, Wisconsin, as trustee. The income from the
trust is to be paid to several named beneficiaries during their lifetime,
and upon the death of the last survivor of the life beneficiaries, the
corpus of the trust is to be distributed to several named beneficiaries,
one of which is as follows:
"Eleven per cent thereof to the Regents of the University of Michigan, to be
used for the purpose, of establishing scholarships for needy and worthy students."
The attorney for the trustee estimates that the trust fund will exceed
$1,000,000.
The University Attorney reported that the will of Dr. Charles J.
Socall, M.D. 1930, has been offered for probate in Wayne County,
Michigan. Paragraph 4 of the will provides as follows:
"4. All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate that I may die seized
of, I give, devise and bequeath to the scholarship fund of the medical school of
the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. I further declare that whatever
the amount of this bequest, same be used unrestrictedly at the discretion of the
authorities of the scholarship fund at the University of Michigan."
The attorney for the executor is unable to estimate the size of the
residue at this time.
The University Attorney reported that the will of William P.
Woodworth, deceased, has recently been offered for probate in Wayne
County, Michigan. Article VI of the will provides as follows:
"Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, I give, devise and bequeath
to the University of Michigan (Music Department), all musical instruments,
violins, cellos, bows, cases, etc., which I may own at the time of my death, to have
and to hold to its successors and assigns forever.
a) This sub-paragraph is an expression of hope of future use and not a
directive which the court in the probating of my Will should be concerned with.
I am familiar with the care with which such instruments are handled and cared
for under the present personnel of the Music Department of the University of
Michigan. Therefore, it is my hope and recommendation that the continued use
of these instruments will be limited to the professors on the staff at the University of Michigan and to students who are well advanced in the study of music."
The attorney for the executor advises that they have not as yet
located the musical instruments referred to in the above paragraph,

The Secretary reported the retirement of two members of the
faculty. The following memoirs were adopted:
HENRY CHARLES ECKSTEIN, Professor of Biological Chemistry, is relin-       H. C. Eckstein:
quishing his active status after thirty-seven years on the faculty of the Medical  Memoir
School. Having earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Illinois, he
remained there for four years as graduate student and Assistant in Animal Nutrition and then completed his graduate education at Yale. He came to this University immediately upon receiving his doctorate to teach in the department called
then Physiological Chemistry and now, more broadly, Biological Chemistry, and
rose successively through the several ranks to a professorship. He was active and
effective in both graduate and undergraduate teaching. Avocationally, he was much
involved with civic affairs, serving on the Ann Arbor City Council. In the laboratory, Professor Eckstein studied chiefly the composition and physiology of animal
fats. His work in lipide metabolism and nutrition gained international attention.
He has further lent his counsel and wide experience to recent Phoenix Project
experiments which are extending the frontiers of biochemistry through the use of
radioactive tracers. The Regents of the University take this occasion to thank
Professor Eckstein for his long and devoted service and gratefully extend to him
the privileges of the rank which is now conferred, Professor Emeritus of Biological
Chemistry.
PEARL LUELLA KENDRICK, Resident Lecturer in Epidemiology, relin-           P. L. Kendrick:
quished her duties in the School of Public Health on August 24, after nine years  Memoir
of service. She brought to the University a rich professional experience, much of it
acquired in this state. After her graduation from Syracuse, she taught biology and
chemistry in New York high schools and assisted in research at the New York
State Department of Health. The Michigan Department of Health then attracted
her to its Lansing laboratory as bacteriologist and, in a few years, appointed her
Associate Director of Laboratories and Chief of the Western Michigan Branch
Laboratory in Grand Rapids. During leaves of absence, she pursued graduate study
at Johns Hopkins, earning her doctorate there in 1932. Though she continued to
fulfill her responsibilities within the state, her researches into the prevention of
whooping cough and her enthusiastic support of immunization programs were
international in scope and consequence. As consultant to the government of Mexico
and, later, to the World Health Organization, Dr. Kendrick became known

SEPTEMIBER MEETING, 1960


throughout the hemisphere and the world for her work in averting this dread
scourge of tiny children. Accepting her appointment here in 1951, she ably and
easily assumed her instructional duties and shared increasingly in administrative
affairs and community services. Not the least of her contributions to the School
of Public Health was the aura at once of public achievement and of personal
distinction and grace which she brought to her every office. Appointing her Resident
Lecturer Emeritus in Epidemiology, the Regents express their gratitude to her for
having lent to the University these ripe and fruitful years and warmly tender to
her the privileges of her new rank.
The Secretary reported with regret the death of David Barnard
Steinman, D.Eng.(hon.) 1956, August 21, 1960. The following memoir
was adopted:
D. B. Steinman:     DAVID BARNARD STEINMAN, builder of bridges, poet, and humanitarian,
Memoir   honorary Doctor of Engineering of this University, died in New York City on
August the twenty-first in the seventy-fifth year of his age. Dr. Steinman revealed
early promise in a brilliant school and university career, and taught for a decade
at the University of Idaho and the City College of New York before becoming an
independent consulting and design engineer. Uniting a superior abstract understanding of his art with a perennially fresh practical inventiveness, he thereafter
designed over four hundred bridges on five continents, including the world's longest
suspension bridge at Mackinac Straits in this state. The attainments and qualities
that earned him national esteem included also his literary gifts, manifested in his
volumes of poetry; and his idealistic vision of his civic and humane responsibility,
of which the benefactions of the Steinman Foundation are one of many tokens.
One labor which had great appeal for him and which, in a manner, represents his
life, was fitting the Brooklyn Bridge to its current burden of traffic while lovingly
preserving its formal beauty. The Regents of The University of Michigan mourn
the death not alone of the engineer who joined the peninsulas of our state but of a
devoted and good man. Their deepest sympathy is tendered to Mrs. Steinman.

CERTIFICATION
I HEREBY CERTIFY that the foregoing is a full, true, and correct copy of a
Resolution, and the whole thereof, of The Regents of The University of Michigan,
regularly presented and adopted at a meeting duly called and held in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, on September 23, 1960, at which a quorum was present and voted; and
the said Resolution is duly recorded in the minutes of The Regents of The University of Michigan and is still in full force and effect.


E. A. WALTER, Secretary
The Regents authorized a request for appropriations for the General
Fund operation approximating $41,500,000 for 1961-62, subject to
further study by the President and report for final approval in October,
1960.
The Regents authorized an application to the U. S. Public Health
Service for a grant in the amount of $250,000 which will be matched
by University funds, to provide an animal facility costing approximately $500,000.
Authorization was granted for the University to become a member
of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies for
a three-year period at an annual membership fee of $1,000, payable
from the General Administration Current account. At the end of the
three-year membership the problem of continuing membership in the
organization will be reviewed and reported to the Regents.
The Vice-President for Student Affairs presented a report on University enrollments for the first semester of the University year 1960-61.
The Director of the Dearborn Center presented a similar report for the
Center.
Regent Power, who had acted as the leader of the group of University professors who had attended the Congress of Orientalists at the
University of Moscow, gave his reactions to the Congress and to his
visit which took him to many parts of Russia. Many of the papers
contributed at the Congress represented petty scholarship, he said. The
Russians studiedly underrated Western scholarship in their discussion
of papers presented by American scholars. Through the United States
Embassy, it was possible for the Regent to make tentative arrangements for microfilming certain Russian library materials. Such materials,
he hoped, would be exchanged on a photographic frame-for-frame basis.
He found at the University of Moscow excellent microfilm cameras,
basically American, with ingenious adaptations. Regent Power was

struck by the uniformity of existence in the U.S.S.R., a uniformity
which embraced all aspects of life. He characterized the Russians as
a vigorous and intelligent people, individually most friendly but as a
people the unfortunate victims of the insidious propaganda of "the
party line." Since much of Regent Power's travel involved the exploration of the possibility of exchanging microfilmed materials for scholarly
use and duplicating them in his printing plant, he himself met the cost
of his journey.
A letter from Mrs. James M. Plumer, expressing her appreciation
for the memoir adopted by the Regents on the death of her husband
(p. 29), was received and placed on file.
A letter from Mrs. James H. Maxwell, expressing her gratitude for
the memoir adopted by the Regents on the death of Dr. Maxwell (R.P.,
1957-60, p. 1274), was received and placed on file.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the Regents
of The University of Michigan for the month of June, 1960, totaled
$291.92; for the month of July, 1960, totaled $209.57; and for August,
1960, totaled $285.20.
The Secretary presented a letter from Professor Wesley H. Maurer,
Chairman of the Senate Advisory Committee, thanking the Regents and
accepting their invitation to the Senate Advisory Committee for a
dinner meeting on Thursday, November 17.
The Regents adjourned to meet at the Dearborn Center on October 28.

sity and returned there to instruct after interning at Presbyterian Hospital in New
York. He came to Ann Arbor as Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine in 1925.
Four years later the University appointed him Associate Professor; it elevated him
to Professor in 1947. Dr. Barker enjoyed the confidence of the entire Medical
School and Hospital staffs. He assumed a large measure of responsibility for the
administration of his department and served in 1957 and 1958 as Acting Chairman. As a teacher, he was scholarly and clear. As a practitioner and director of
clinical practice, he rendered incisive and firmly grounded decisions. In his specialty
of cardiology, to which most of the fifty-odd articles that he wrote or collaborated
in were devoted, he contributed materially to the advance of medical science. His
colleagues elected him to the Senate Advisory Committee for the years 1956, 1957,
and 1958 and presented him the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award in
1960. The Regents of the University join his professional colleagues in regretting
his early retirement. Now conferring on him the rank Professor Emeritus of Internal
Medicine, they trust that he will long avail himself of the privileges due that title.
The Secretary reported with regret the death on September 26, 1960,        R. L. Potter:
of Richard Louis Potter, Associate Professor of Biological Chemistry and       Memoir
Principal Investigator of Biological Effects of Irradiation for the Atomic
Energy Commission. The following memoir was adopted:
The University community mourns the death, on September the twenty-sixth,
of Richard Louis Potter, Associate Professor of Biological Chemistry and Principal
Investigator in studies sponsored by the Atomic Energy Commission. He was in his
forty-second year. Professor Potter received his secondary school and collegiate
education in his native South Dakota, and entered graduate school at the University of Wisconsin in 1940. After wartime service in the Marine Corps, he returned
to Wisconsin to earn his doctorate. In 1950, he came to The University of Michigan to undertake research for the Atomic Energy Commission on the biological
effects of irradiation. The Commission designated him Principal Investigator in
1955. The Medical School appointed him Assistant Professor in the following year
and Associate Professor this past summer. A meticulous and single-minded research
scientist, Professor Potter established important and previously unsuspected sequences of events in the replication of cells exposed to radiation. In the Medical
School, he proved himself a dedicated and provocative teacher, asking of his
students the same perfect honesty, the same devotion to full and precise understanding, which spurred him to his own discoveries and kept him from resting
upon his attainments. The Regents of the University express their profound sense
of bereavement at the cutting off of a career rich in promise for this institution
and for mankind. They join his sorrowing faculty colleagues in tendering deeply
felt sympathy to Mrs. Potter.

On recommendation of the Dean of the Medical School and of the
Vice-President and Dean of Faculties, the following letter of understanding regarding affiliation of the Wayne County General Hospital
and Infirmary, The University of Michigan, and the Wayne State
University, was approved:
I. PURPOSE
Since medical education and patient care have purposes and problems in
common, it is appropriate that co-operative effort in these areas be undertaken to
the mutual benefit of the participating institutions.
This proposed affiliation will not alter in any way the responsibilities and
authority of the governing boards of the three participating institutions. It will,
instead, make it possible for each of the institutions to discharge its responsibilities
more effectively.
II. AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY
1. Patient Care
The Wayne County Board of County Institutions is charged with the
responsibility for the care of patients at the Wayne County General Hospital and
Infirmary and discharges this responsibility through the medical staff of that
institution.
2. Education and Research
The Board of Governors of the Wayne State University and the Regents
of The University of Michigan are responsible for educational and research programs sponsored by their respective institutions. This responsibility is unaltered in
the programs of education and research undertaken through this affiliation.
The responsibility for the training of interns and residents at the Wayne
County General Hospital and Infirmary is the responsibility of the Wayne County
Board of County Institutions discharged through the medical staff. This does not
preclude a joint responsibility for such training with the medical schools where
there is agreement that such a co-operative effort is desirable.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1960


153


3. Joint Use of Facilities
In the course of their various relations, and particularly in carrying out
their functions in teaching and in research, the medical schools and the Hospital
will find it necessary and advisable to use jointly and in co-operation the physical
facilities and clinical resources of the respective medical schools and the Hospital.
It is accordingly understood that the medical schools and the Hospital will give
each other access to and the reasonable opportunity to use their respective physical
facilities and clinical resources so far as practicable and advisable in order to carry
on instruction, research, and other activities in which they are co-operating.
4. Financial Responsibility
The costs of providing medical services to the patients whose care is the
responsibility of the Wayne County Board of County Institutions rest with that
board.
Direct expenses related to programs of education and research sponsored by
the medical schools will be the responsibility of those institutions through their
university's governing boards.
It is recognized that in order to realize the potential of this affiliation the
participating institutions will have to give full financial support to their respective
areas of responsibility.
5. Joint Administrative Committee
In order that each of the participating institutions may be appropriately
represented in the administration of the purposes of the affiliation, a Joint Administrative Committee will be formed.
This committee will be composed of a representative from the Wayne County
Board of County Institutions, a representative from the Administration of the
Wayne County General Hospital and Infirmary, a representative from the medical
staff of the Wayne County General Hospital and Infirmary, the Dean of the
Wayne State University College of Medicine, and the Dean of the University of
Michigan Medical School.
The responsibility of the Joint Administrative Committee will be to make
recommendations to the responsible administrative body of each participating
institution in all matters that involve the interests of that institution.
It will be the responsibility of the Joint Administrative Committee to receive
recommendations from any of its members on matters affecting the participating
institutions.
6. Appointment of Medical Staff
Nominations to the Wayne County Board of County Institutions for appointment to the medical staff of the Wayne County General Hospital and Infirmary
will be from the Joint Administrative Committee and will require the concurrence
of the deans of the participating medical schools.
7. Term of Agreement
This agreement may be terminated by any one of the participating institutions.
A written notice will be required, submitted on the anniversary date of the agreement to the Joint Administrative Committee one year before termination. In the
absence of such notification, it is assumed that this affiliation will be continued for
an indeterminate time.
The following conditions governing the administration of the Glenn
MacDonald Scholarships in Journalism, established in honor of Glenn
MacDonald, former editor of the Bay City Times (R.P., 1957-60,
p. 473), were approved:
1. That the fund be invested and reinvested in accordance with the customary
procedures of the Regents for the investment of endowed funds, the annual income
of which endowment would be used for scholarship purposes by the Department of
Journalism.
2. A committee to assist in the selection of students to benefit from this fund
in such manner and amounts and on such terms as its members stipulate would
be presently comprised of Mrs. Glenn MacDonald, widow of Glenn MacDonald,
Mr. George P. McCallum, manager of the Ann Arbor News, Dr. Francis H.
Letchfield, Pinconning, Michigan, the chairman of the Department of Journalism,
and one other member of the journalism faculty. New members may be appointed
by the chairman of the Department of Journalism to replace any of the nonfaculty
members who may resign or who may vacate their membership by death.

1957-60, p. 1079).
Zeta Beta Tau   The plan and site proposals for the development of a chapter house
HoAppus:lan  by Zeta Beta Tau fraternity on North Campus land, set aside for such
use, was presented for review by the Regents (R.P., 1957-60, p. 987).
These plans and site proposals were approved by James Livingston, the
University consulting architect for this project.
The Regents approved the plans for the chapter house and authorized the Vice-President for Student Affairs and the Vice-President in
charge of business and finance to continue the necessary arrangements
for carrying out the agreement with the fraternity.
W.C.T.U.: Letter  A resolution of the Mary J. Taft Union of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union was received and placed on file.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.

The Vice-President in charge of business and finance reported as
follows on the estate of Clare Beebe Beck, deceased:
Clare Beebe Beck, widow of Edward S. Beck (A.B. 1893), died a resident of
Chicago on May 12, 1960. The residue clause of her will provides in part as
follows:
"EIGHTH. A. One-fifth thereof to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,
Michigan, to be added to and to become a part of the fund provided for in
paragraph (a), page 1, of amendment dated December 22, 1937, of Trust No.
14061, created by me under date of May 22, 1931, and under which The First
National Bank of Chicago is trustee."
The trust referred to in the above-quoted provision of the residue clause was
created by Mrs. Beck on May 22, 1931, and an amendment to the trust dated
December 22, 1937, provided:
"Upon the death of the survivor of the Donor and her said husband, the Trustee
shall divide the Trust Fund into 100 equal parts and shall hold, and/or pay and
distribute them as follows:
"(a)  Ten (10) of such parts shall be paid and distributed to the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan, to be held by it as a separate fund, the income from which shall be used by said University to establish one or more
scholarships in the Department of American History, to be known as the Edward
Scott Beck American History Scholarships. The University of Michigan through
its Board of Regents may adopt such rules and regulations for the administration and award of such Scholarship or Scholarships as it shall from time to time
deem most conducive to the promotion of study and research in American
History."
The First National Bank of Chicago, Trustee, is now ready to distribute the
corpus of the trust, and it reports that the total amount distributable from the
trust is $371,481.55. One of the beneficiaries of the trust is no longer in existence,
so that the trustee proposes to distribute to The University of Michigan one-ninth
of this residue instead of the one-tenth specified in the above-quoted paragraph.
The University's distributive share will amount to $32,376.74 in securities and
$8,806.52 in cash, or a total of $41,183.26. The trustee has requested that a
formal resolution be adopted by this Board accepting the fund for the purposes
therein stated. When the probate estate is distributed, the University's share of the
residue will be added to the Edward Scott Beck American History Scholarship
Fund.
After hearing the report the Regents adopted the following resolution:
WHEREAS, The First National Bank of Chicago is Trustee under a Trust
Agreement dated May 22, 1931; and


C. B. Beck: Will

The Secretary reported with regret the death on October 30, 1960,          H. H. Goode:
of Harry Herbert Goode, Professor of Electrical Engineering, and                 emoir
former director of the Willow      Run Research Center. The following
memoir was adopted:
HARRY HERBERT GOODE, Professor of Electrical Engineering, and former
Director of the Willow Run Research Center, lost his life in a tragic accident on
the Detroit Expressway on the thirtieth of October. Professor Goode was born in
New York City in 1909, and earned degrees in history at New York University,
in chemical engineering at Cooper Union, and in mathematics at Columbia. Having
gained experience as a statistician for the New York City Department of Health
and as a research associate in mathematics at Tufts College during the Second
World War, he went to the Special Devices Center of the Office of Naval Research
in 1946 to take part in designing large-scale electromechanical and electronic:systems. Four years later he came to the Willow Run Research Center. Again,
four years later, he was appointed Professor of Electrical Engineering. In 1956-57,




166


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1960


he held a simultaneous appointment in industrial engineering. In 1958-59 he was
Technical Director of the Bendix Systems Division in Ann Arbor. A vigorous and
resourceful research scientist, Professor Goode was constantly and continuously
extending the industrial and military uses of electronic systems. To his teaching
and his many administrative offices, he brought the same gifts of imagination and
energy which distinguished his research. He devised and taught the first course
which any university has offered in systems engineering, basing it upon a book of
which he was principal author. The untimely cutting off of his career at the height
of his powers is a blow to the University, the state, and the nation. His professional colleagues are sensible of the loss of an inspiriting personality and a loyal
and devoted mentor and friend. The Regents of the University now make known
their own sense of bereavement and tender their deepest sympathy to Mrs. Goode
and her daughters.
Leaves of     The following leaves of absence were approved (p. 145):

The Regents gratefully accepted the proposal of Professor Emeritus
Louis A. Baier and Mrs. Baier to establish the Dr. and Mrs. James
McGeoch Memorial Fund under the terms and conditions outlined in
the following Trust Agreement:


Dr. and Mrs.
James McGeoch
Memorial Fund


TRUST AGREEMENT
THIS DECLARATION OF TRUST AND AGREEMENT, made and entered into by
and between Louis A. Baier and Grace M. Baier, husband and wife, of Ann Arbor,
Michigan (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Donor") and The Regents of
The University of Michigan, a constitutional corporation created by the Constitution of the State of Michigan, having the control and management of The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan     (hereinafter referred to as the
"University").
WHEREAS, The Donor desires to make a gift to the University of the property
hereinafter mentioned on the terms hereinafter set forth, and the University is
willing to accept said gift on said terms,
Now, Therefore, In consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
and undertakings herein contained, it is agreed by and between the parties hereto
as follows:
1. Concurrently with the execution hereof the Donor shall transfer and deliver
to the University and vest in the University full title thereto in trust, without any
right of revocation in the Donor whatsoever, the securities described in Schedule A
annexed hereto and hereby made a part hereof.
2. The University hereby acknowledges the receipt of said securities and
accepts the transfer thereof for the purposes hereinafter set forth, and the University further covenants that it will:
a) Maintain the securities or the proceeds thereof and any additions thereto
as a separate fund to be known as the "Dr. and Mrs. James McGeoch Memorial
Fund."
b) Invest and reinvest the said fund in income-producing securities, the
choice of any such investment, reinvestment, or holding to be determined by the
University at its discretion.
c) Pay the entire net income from the said fund to the Donor in semiannual
installments beginning six months from the date hereof and ending with the regular installment of such income next preceding the death of the last surviving donor.
Each payment to Donor shall be accompanied by a statement showing the
total income from the fund for the period and the sources of such income.
Net income shall be construed to mean the total income of the fund less only
amortization of bond premiums.
It is understood that the University will make no charge against the income
of the fund for administration or management of the investments during the life
of the Donor.
d)  After the death of the last surviving donor, continue to maintain the Dr.
and Mrs. James McGeoch Memorial Fund, but it may, if it so elects at that time,
commingle for investment purposes the said fund with other endowment funds of
the University and thereafter use the income from the said fund to provide medical care for selected children who are patients at the University Hospital of The
University of Michigan in accordance with the intent of the Donor as hereinafter
stated in Paragraph 2e.
e)  Appoint a committee composed of the Dean of the Medical School, the
Director of the University Hospital, and the Professor of the Department of




168                NOVEMBER        MEETING, 1960
Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases to recommend to the Regents the disbursements of the income from this fund as nearly as possible in accordance with the
intent of the Donor, which intent has been stated as follows:
"The intent of this gift is to establish an endowment fund at the University
of Michigan Medical School to be known as the 'Dr. and Mrs. James McGeoch
Memorial Fund,' the income from which shall be used to provide medical care
by the University Hospital of The University of Michigan for selected children
who may not otherwise be provided for from family, church, state, or community
sources. In selecting the children who would benefit from this fund, it is our
wish that the medical or surgical help which the child needs be significant to his
or her future well-being and hopefully would make possible a happier and more
fruitful life. It is our plan that these children be members of families of limited
financial means but not entirely indigent or supported by welfare agencies. In
this family setting the cost of necessary medical or surgical treatment may be
burdensome, and when it is found that such necessary treatment could not be
met by the family without resorting to financial sacrifice that would undermine
the family security or force it to accept public welfare support, then it is our
wish that the income from this endowment fund be used to meet in whole or in
part the cost of such necessary treatment for the child. We would propose that
The Regents of The University of Michigan authorize a committee composed of
the Dean of the Medical School, the Director of the University Hospital, and
the Professor of the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases to
recommend to the Regents the disbursements of the income from this fund."
3. The Donor reserves and shall have the right to make additional gifts to
the University by transfer and conveyance to the University from time to time
and at any time of other property of any kind by such instrument as may be
necessary and appropriate to transfer the same to the University, it being understood that such other property shall be received and administered by the University and added to the aforesaid fund in accordance with all of the provisions of
this agreement in the same manner as if originally transferred hereby.
4. Neither the Donor nor any person claiming through the Donor shall have
any beneficial or other interest in said fund or in the assets thereof other than
the right to receive income as hereinabove provided.
5. All questions as to the validity, construction, and effect of this agreement
shall be determined according to the laws of the State of Michigan.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The said Louis A. Baier and Grace M. Baier have
hereunto set their hands and seals, and The Regents of The University of Michigan
has caused this instrument to be executed in its name on behalf of the said corporation by Harlan Hatcher, its President, and W. K. Pierpont, its Vice-President,
and its corporate seal to be hereto affixed this.......................... day

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1960


169


The Vice-President for Student Affairs presented a housing program for women students, the program to be planned in connection
with the Peirsol property located in the area bounded in part by
Geddes Avenue, Oxford Road, and Hill Street. The structures would
provide organized living for freshmen and sophomores as well as balanced related suite accommodations for approximately twenty-five
upperclass residents. This housing, referred to as "participation housing," would carry on the spirit of the Adelia Cheever House tradition
and would be a University-sponsored co-operative type of housing.
The Regents authorized Vice-Presidents Lewis and Pierpont to
proceed with the planned experiment.
Pursuant to the regental request at their October meeting that the
Vice-President in charge of business and finance bring them a list of
specifics pertinent to the implementation of the North Campus Plan
study (p. 133), the Vice-President presented lists of specifics under the
following three headings: (1) University-community traffic improvements, (2) intracampus traffic circulation improvements, and (3)
land acquisition and disposition. He illustrated his remarks by reference to "Map No. 1."
The Regents authorized the Vice-President to proceed in accord
with the specifics he presented and outlined.
The Vice-President for Student Affairs and the Vice-President for
University Relations announced that the University Symphony Band,
under the direction of Dr. William D. Revelli, has been invited to
present a series of concerts in the principal cities of the U.S.S.R., of
the Soviet satellite countries, and in some of the Mediterranean countries. The four months' tour is sponsored as a part of the International
Relations Program of the President of the United States. In addition
to the Director and the student musicians, some faculty members,
expert in the use of the Russian language and in other subject-matter
areas, a medical doctor, and a nurse will also make the trip. The total
number of those making the trip will not be more than 104. Adequate.
insurance policies are being arranged for all members of the party.
The Regents were most happy to receive the announcement and
congratulated Dr. Revelli and his student musicians for the honor the
invitation reflects upon them, upon The University of Michigan, and
upon the state and the nation.
Regent Thurber reported briefly upon his visit last summer to Camp
Davis, at Jackson, Wyoming. He believed a fine piece of work is being
carried on at the Camp, under the direction of Professor Glysson,
whom he characterized as "just the right man to be in charge of such
an operation." The Regent believed it most unfortunate that all of the
accommodations, which although quite simple are completely adequate
for the temporary housing of students, should not be used to capacity.
He asked whether other disciplines besides engineering might use the
facilities in connection with summer study programs. He also made the
point that if maximum use may not be made by the University of the
facilities and opportunities now available, other schools or universities
might be invited to use them separately from our University's use or
jointly with it.

APPENDIX A
OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison and Erich A. Walter
Voted September 23, 1960 (p. 93)                Presented November 5, 1960
HARRY ELMER CHESEBROUGH, B.S.E.(M.E.), 1932; Vice-President of
Chrysler Corporation and General Manager of the Plymouth-DeSoto-Valiant
Division. It is a joy for the University to contemplate prominent men who once
made their abilities manifest in its classrooms. Such a man is Harry Chesebrough,
whose record as a student in the College of Engineering was narrowly short of
perfect, and who has subsequently become an outstanding automotive engineer and
executive. He entered the Chrysler Institute of Engineering immediately upon
graduating from the University. During the Second World War, while still only
thirty-three, he was appointed Project Engineer for DeSoto aircraft production.
At war's end, he became Chief Engineer at DeSoto and pioneered in the uses of
automation for automobile manufacture. Thereafter he rose rapidly to his present
offices. His judgment as industrial executive is as highly regarded as his scientific
and technological acumen. It is a fitting token of the solid technical basis of his
career that he should now be serving as national president of the Society of Automotive Engineers. It is a tribute to his strong sense of personal loyalty that he
finds time to serve also as chairman of the Industry Committee for the College of
Engineering. The University, appreciative both of his achievements and his personal qualities, is happy to confer upon Harry Chesebrough its Outstanding
Achievement Award.
GARRETT HEYNS, A.B., 1915, A.M., 1916, Ph.D., 1928; Director of the
Department of Institutions of the State of Washington. After graduating with
distinction from the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, Dr. Heyns interspersed terms of graduate study throughout a versatile career as school principal,
superintendent of schools, and college and university teacher of history. His second
career, as penologist, began with his appointment as Warden of the Ionia Reformatory in 1937. Since then he has served also as Director of the Michigan Department of Corrections and member of the Michigan Parole Board. In 1957, the state






NOVEMBER MEETING, 1960                              171
of Washington invited him to Olympia to direct all penal and mental institutions
under state control there. Nationally, he has served as president of the American
Prison Association and the American Parole Association and consultant to the
Secretary of War on military prisons.
Dr. Heyns possesses in pre-eminent degree the disparate qualities essential to
the penologist: conviction and humanity, an imperviousness to pressure, and a.sympathetic insight into individual human potentialities. His many articles and
the courses of lectures on criminology which he has offered here and at Calvin
College testify to a scholarly bent in harmony with the power of decisive action.
In tendering him this Outstanding Achievement Award, the University expresses
admiration for his attainments and qualities and gratitude alike for his services to
the state and the honor which he has reflected upon his Alma Mater.
WESLEY MINNIS, Ph.D., 1922; Director of Research of the Allied Chemical   W. Minnis:
and Dye Corporation. After earning bachelor's and master's degrees at the Univer-  Outstanding
sity of Washington, Dr. Minnis came to The University of Michigan as a graduate  Achievement
student in organic chemistry and, after a term of military and industrial service  Awar
occasioned by the First World War, returned to complete his doctorate. He then
entered upon his long career as research chemist and director of research in the
chemical industry. His present responsibilities as Director of Research for Allied
Chemical and Dye were assumed in 1951. As chairman of company committees
awarding fellowships and grants, Dr. Minnis has fruitfully expressed his continuing
interest in chemical education, initiating or expanding programs of aid for chemistry students in many universities, not least The University of Michigan. The
example of his company during his tenure has perhaps called forth as much
support again from other corporations. And he has further fostered the cause of
chemical education through personal gifts, one of these being an annual prize
awarded through the Department of Chemistry here. In tendering him an Outstanding Achievement Award, the University honors at once a gifted scientific
mind, a statesmanlike career, and a generous man.
EMILIE GLEASON SARGENT, A.B., 1916, M.S.P.H., 1938; for many years        E. G. Sargent:
Executive Director of the Visiting Nurse Association of Detroit. Miss Sargent,  Outstanding
Achievement
who originally prepared herself to teach English, was attracted into nursing during  Aceveta
the First World War, and her University, her City, and her State have richly
benefited from her labors in the latter calling. Appointed to her present post before
her thirtieth year, she has steadily improved and diversified the services which the
Visiting Nurse Association has rendered, communicating her own energy and devotion to her fellow workers and introducing new skills, like those of physical and
occupational therapy, as the medical and health sciences have made them available. To the School of Public Health, her aid and counsel have proved invaluable.
In concert with the faculty in public health nursing, she has devised programs of
supervised field experience for students and freely adapted these to changing educational needs. Among Miss Sargent's many professional offices have been the
presidency of the Michigan Public Health Association and the National Organization for Public Health Nursing, and the vice-presidency of the American Public
Health Association. Earlier this year, the American Nursing Association conferred
on her its Pearl Mclver Public Health Nurse Award for her "outstanding contribution to mankind." The University takes this occasion to make known its grateful esteem.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1960

The following report by the University Attorney on the estate of        c. E. Love:
Clyde E. Love, deceased, was filed for the information of the Regents      Estate
(R.P., 1957-60, p. 1202):
Pursuant to the provisions of Article V of the will of Clyde E. Love, Professor
Emeritus of Mathematics, the State Bank and Trust Company, executor of the
will, has delivered an executor's deed to the Regents of The University of Michigan of a parcel of land described as:
Commencing at the NE corner of Lot 21, Scottwood First Addition to the
City of Ann Arbor, as recorded in Liber 4 of Plats, page 8, Washtenaw County
Records, Washtenaw County, Michigan; thence in the east line of Lot 21
extended N 0~ 17' W 30.0 feet for a Place of Beginning; thence S 88~ 25' 30"
W 128.6 feet to the east line of a public street; thence in the east line of said
public street, N 3~ 32' 30" E 71.96 feet; thence 75.43 feet in the arc of a
circular curve concave to the East, radius 127.20 feet, chord bearing N 20~ 45'
E 74.34 feet; thence S 51~ 55' 30" E 133.93 feet; thence N 88~ 25' 30"
E 92.34 feet; thence S 0~ 03' 30" E 55.0 feet; thence S 88~ 25' 30" W 100.00
feet to the Place of Beginning, being a part of Lot 20 and part of the Community Park of Scottwood First Addition to the City of Ann Arbor, Washtenaw
County, Michigan.
The will directs that the land be maintained in substantially its present condition as a bird refuge but provides that, if at some future time the Regents deem
that the property is no longer suited for the purpose mentioned, then the Regents
of The University of Michigan may in their discretion sell or otherwise dispose of
the lands in question.
The property is a heavily wooded lot having a frontage of approximately 147
feet on Scottwood Avenue with a depth of 228 feet.
The University Attorney reported that the will of Margaret Earhart M. E. Smith:
Smith, M.S.W., 1946, the wife of Dr. Clement Smith, has recently been Will
offered for probate in Boston, Massachusetts.
The will provides:
That one-fifth of her estate be set up as a trust fund, the income from which
is to be paid to Miss Ernestine Friedman in the amount of not more than $2,000.00
per year and to Miss Hilda W. Smith in the amount of not more than $1,250.00
per year, and upon the death of the survivor of Miss Friedman and Miss Smith,
one-half of the entire principal and accumulated income is payable to The University of Michigan to establish a fund for the following purposes:
".. to be held and known as the Mary Malcomson Raphael Fund, the
income to be used for the tuition and living expenses of women graduate
students in the social sciences and/or the humanities in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts of The University of Michigan. It is my expectation that
other friends of Mary Malcomson Raphael may wish to add to the fund by
their wills or otherwise and to that end, I specifically authorize The University
of Michigan to accept additions to the fund and to commingle the same with my
bequest. It is my wish that each holder of a fellowship will know something of
Mary Malcomson Raphael and the history of her life, and it is my hope, though
I express no trust, that each holder be given a folder with a picture of Mary
Malcomson Raphael, giving a brief history and chronology of her life, the
expenses to be borne by the trust. I have left with my will a suggested form of
folder which I do not incorporate in my will but leave merely as a suggestion.
If the fund shall not initially be large enough to produce net income sufficient
to pay in full the charges for tuition and essential living expenses of one such
student, the net income shall be accumulated and added to principal until the
fund shall reach that size. The sum granted in any year shall not exceed the
amount found after inquiry to be needed by the holder of the fellowship for
tuition and essential living expenses, without sacrifice of her own time, or of
resources needed presently, and for a reasonable time after completion of graduate studies undertaken under this fellowship, to ensure adequate maintenance.
If any surplus income accrues in any year, it may be used to appoint one or
more additional holders of this fellowship, or it may be accumulated and added
to principal. It is hoped that holders of this fellowship will have both a capacity
for intellectual growth and a genuine concern for the welfare of others, giving
promise of exceptional usefulness to society."

a) Maintain the securities or the proceeds thereof and any additions thereto
as a separate fund to be known as the "Dora Fund."
b) Invest and reinvest the said fund in income-producing securities, the choice
of any such investment, reinvestment, or holding to be determined by the University at its discretion. It is understood, however, that it is the Donor's present
desire that the Southern Company stock transferred herewith be retained by the
University as an investment of this fund until such time as it shall appear to the
University that the said stock is not a sound investment for the fund.
c) Pay the entire net income from the said fund to the Donor in semiannual
installments beginning six months from the date hereof and ending with the regular installment of such income next preceding the death of the Donor. Each payment to Donor shall be accompanied by a statement showing the total income
from the fund for the period and the sources of such income. Net income shall be
construed to mean the total income from the fund less only amortization of bond
premiums. It is understood that the University will make no charge against the
income of the fund for administration or management of the investments during
the life of the Donor.

under the direction of the Dean of the Medical School of The University of
Michigan or such other person as he may designate with the approval of The
Regents of The University of Michigan. After the death of the Donor, the said
fund may be expended for cancer research or, in the discretion of the University,
the fund may be set up as a permanent endowment fund with the income used in
support of such cancer research, in which event the said fund may be commingled
for investment purposes with other endowment funds of the University.
3. The Donor reserves and shall have the right to make additional gifts to
the University, by transfer and conveyance to the University from time to time
and at any time, of other property of any kind by such instrument as may be
necessary and appropriate to transfer the same to the University, it being understood that such other property shall be received and administered by the University and added to the aforesaid fund in accordance with all of the provisions of
this agreement in the same manner as if originally transferred hereby.
4. Neither the Donor nor any person claiming through the Donor shall have
any beneficial or any interest in said fund or the assets thereof other than the
right to receive income as hereinabove provided.
5. All questions as to the validity, construction, and effect of this agreement
shall be determined according to the laws of the State of Michigan.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The said Grace Moses has hereunto set her hand and
seal, and The Regents of The University of Michigan has caused this instrument
to be executed in its name on behalf of the said corporation by W. K. Pierpont,

2. The Regents of The University of Michigan acknowledge, upon the basis of
the market value of said securities, and upon the basis of independent advice obtained by them relative to the value of such securities, that such securities have a
fair market value in excess of the consideration paid by them to A. Harold
Frauenthal
3. Both parties acknowledge that the consideration paid by The Regents of
The University of Michigan for the transfer of securities made to them by A.
Harold Frauenthal reflects an intention on the part of A. Harold Frauenthal to

consideration; furthermore, it is agreed between these parties that such contribution shall be used for cancer research through the Michigan Memorial-Phoenix
Project.

the sum of $32,000 from the purchaser.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1960


189


On recommendation of the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance, the firm  of Stickel, Moody, and Associates was appointed as
architects for the Oxford Street Housing Project (p. 169).
After hearing a summary of a study on the capital program for
heating-power plant by the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance, the Regents postponed action on the report pending still further
information from Regent Otto E. Eckert and from William J. Johnson,
Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture.
The Regents heard the following and final report on the agreement
between the University and the City of Ann Arbor entered into in
December, 1956, in which the University agreed to pay a part of the
costs and expenses of the extension of the city water- system in the
northeast Ann Arbor area in keeping with the plans for the development of the North Campus (R.P., 1954-57, p. 1311).
The City agreed to expand its water pumping transmission and storage facilities in the northeast Ann Arbor area to provide a water supply to meet the
requirements of 3,000,000 gallons per day for University use. Following analysis
of the program by staff and consulting engineers, the University agreed to reimburse the City for 45 per cent of the total cost of expansion, with a maximum cost
of $450,000 under present conditions and usage requirements. The first phase of
this project was completed in 1958-59 at a total cost of $648,261.70 and provided
a 2,000,000 gallon reservoir, a 10,000,000 gallon per day booster pumping station,
a 500,000 gallon elevated tank, and the necessary 20-inch, 16-inch, and 12-inch
water mains to make the distribution system operational. The University's share
of the cost of this phase was $291,717.75.
The City has now submitted plans and has under construction phase two of
the project which would provide the 20-inch gravity main capable of supplying
5,000,000 gallons per day from the 16-inch main at North Main Street to the
distribution center in the North Campus area. Phase two, providing this main
distribution line, is estimated to cost $364,000.
Phase three, which would complete the system, is scheduled for completion by
1964 and would provide a second 16-inch main from the filtration plant easterly
to North Main Street and a new booster pumping station near the river crossing.
The estimated cost of this final phase is $136,000.
The allocation of cost by phase and the University's share can be shown as
follows:
NORTHEAST ANN ARBOR WATER TRANSMISSION EXPANSION

Total...............      $1,148,261.70         $450,000.00
The proposed development of water supply for the North Campus area has
been reviewed by staff engineers and representatives of the consulting engineering
firm of McNamee, Porter, and Seeley. It is their recommendation that the proposed
extension of this water supply system be approved as meeting the conditions of
the 1956 agreement.
The Regents appropriated $140,000 to fulfill the terms of the
agreement covering the North Campus area water-service expansion.
On recommendation of the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance, the University Hospital capital outlay budget request to
the state was amended to provide for a separate program of elevatorservice improvements at a total program cost of $1,000,000 with a
request of $300,000 for 1961-62.

The Regents approved the establishment of the Marshall Byrn
Memorial Library Endowment Fund.
On recommendation of the Dean of the College of Engineering, the
Marian Sarah Parker Memorial Awards Fund was established, and a
committee consisting of the Dean of the College of Engineering, the
Dean of the College of Architecture and Design, and the Dean of
Women, or their representatives, was authorized to administer the fund
(R.P., 1926-29, p. 759, and R.P., 1920-23, p. 773).
On recommendation of the Department of Mathematics and of the
Dean and Executive Committee of the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, two special instructorships in the Department of Mathematics, to be known as the T. H. Hildebrandt Research Instructorships,
were established. It was further agreed that these instructorships would
be open to persons under thirty years of age who have the Ph.D. degree, and that the instructorships would provide a reduced teaching
load of advanced courses, and for the University year 1961-62 would
pay a stipend of $6,000. These instructorships are named in honor of
Professor T. H. Hildebrandt, who long served the Department of
Mathematics as professor and chairman, and whose work reflected much
distinction upon the University (R.P., 1957-60, p. 671).
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized
to foreclose a mortgage executed by Dr. David C. English and Grace
L. English, his wife; the taxes now due to be paid by the University
and added to the balance due on the mortgage in accordance with the
terms of the mortgage; and the firm of Burke, Burke and Ryan to be
retained to institute foreclosure proceedings on the mortgage without
delay.
The Vice-President for Research, in giving a brief account of the
beginning of the Institute of Science and Technology, noted that it was
established by a special appropriation of the state legislature on June
30, 1959, which was followed by an action of the Regents on July 24,
1959, formally creating the Institute (R.P., 1957-60, p. 979). The
action of the legislature was in response to initiative taken by an
informal group of University faculty and administrators which resulted
in the formation of President Hatcher's Scientific Advisory Committee.
In an exchange of ideas of this Committee with Governor Williams and
state officials and legislators, the legislature indicated its conviction that
the advancement in pure science and applied science must develop
together and must go hand in hand with higher education. The legislature indicated its confidence that investment in science and technology
at The University of Michigan could not fail to be of real and lasting
value to the industrial development of the state. Following the appointment of Dr. Robert R. White as Director of the Institute of
Science and Technology on October 1, 1959, and the appointment of an
Executive Committee of faculty members and deans to outline policy,
the work of the Institute began. When Professor White resigned on
September 1, 1960 (p. 90), the opportunity presented itself for a
union with the Institute of the large and established Willow Run
Laboratories that are carrying on a program at the level of about
$8,000,000 a year, primarily in support of the national defense effort.
This merger of the Willow Run Laboratories and the Institute of




DECEMBER MEETING, 1960


191


Science and Technology was approved by the Regents at their September meeting, 1960 (p. 83). The union has made the Institute of Science
and Technology the largest research unit in the University. In the
meantime the 1960 Michigan legislature appropriated funds for the
Institute of Science and Technology building, which is now rapidly
progressing. The appropriated funds from the legislature will be
assisted by a grant from the National Institutes of Health of nearly
half a million dollars, to be used toward the construction of facilities
for a biophysics laboratory.
The Vice-President said that in response to a request from Governor
Williams a progress report has just been completed on what has been
done by the Institute and what is being planned for it. This report has
been prepared by Dr. Joseph A. Boyd. Dr. Boyd, in addressing the
Regents, made the following points: that the most important function
of the Institute of Science and Technology is to conduct research,
much of which has been and will be sponsored by the federal government in support of long-term defense research programs; that state
support of the Institute of Science and Technology will mean the
initiation and conduct of research of special interest in Michigan; that
the Institute of Science and Technology will serve as an administrative
unit to conduct research in the University, with special emphasis upon
the organization and direction of interdisciplinary research programs;
that the Institute of Science and Technology will serve as an integral
part of the University program in the advanced training of scientists
and engineers by providing the environment for the faculty and students
to conduct their research which is an essential part of graduate
education.
Dr. Boyd spoke of the Great Lakes Research Division of the
Institute of Science and Technology, and said that additional support
to that received from the state is expected from federal agencies, that
the reorganization of the Biophysics Research Center as the Biophysics
Research Division of the Institute of Science and Technology (R.P.,
1957-60, p. 1277) is part of the Institute's continuing emphasis on the
support and encouragement of studies in fundamental life processes.
He also spoke of IST's co-operation with the committee on Michigan's
economic development.
The Regents received with enthusiasm the report addressed to the
Governor and the remarks made about it by Dr. Boyd.
The President reminded the Regents that Parke, Davis & Company
and The Bendix Corporation had established research units at the University because of the research work that is being done here; that
Bendix had just recently purchased Micrometrical Manufacturing
Company to expand research operations in Ann Arbor in a number of
new fields, that Electronic Assistance Corporation of Red Bank, New
Jersey, had purchased the old Vokar plant in Dexter and would establish a new center for long-range electronic research, and that Paramount
Pictures, through its subsidiary Autometric Corporation, was announcing the location in Ann Arbor of a new research organization to be
known as the Conductron Corporation. The President cited these
cases, as examples only, of a demonstration that here, in Ann Arbor,
because of the University, such industries are provided the kinds of

DOCTOR OF SCIENCE
Voted October 27, 1960 (p. 146)                 Conferred December 1, 19{0
JUSTIN LAWRENCE POWERS, pharmacist, advocate of superior pharmaceutical standards. Possessor of three degrees from the University's College of
Pharmacy, Justin Powers is also held in affectionate memory as a teacher here
from 1926 to 1940. In succeeding years he has served the American Pharmaceutical Association as chairman of its Committee on National Formulary, director of
its national laboratory, and editor of the Scientific Edition of its Journal. He has
further edited Drug Standards, a bimonthly record of progress in the development
of standards for drugs new and old, and chaired the National Research Council's
Committee on the Purity of Chemical Products. The recently completed National
Formulary XI, the fifth revision of that volume which Dr. Powers has directed,
is a wholly comprehensive and authoritative pharmaceutical compendium. As expert
adviser to the World Health Organization and member of the United States Committee on International Drug Standards, he has contributed to the responsible
practice of pharmacy throughout Latin America and the world. Acknowledging
his distinguished professional career and mindful, still, of his attractive and
humane personal qualities, the University happily confers upon this loyal son and
devoted man the degree Doctor of Science.
FRANCIS LAWRENCE SCHMEHL, organic chemist, Chief of the Health
Research Facilities Branch of the Division of Research Grants of the National
Institutes of Health. The entire professional life of Francis Schmehl has been
involved with scientific research. After earning degrees from Catholic University
in chemical engineering, chemistry, and physics, he entered government service and
advanced through posts as Assistant and Associate Chemist to the office of Biological Chemist in the National Institutes of Health. He later served as executive
officer of the Children's Cancer Research Foundation of Boston and Assistant Chief
of the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center in Bethesda, Maryland.
When, in 1956, the Institutes of Health established a separate Health Research
Facilities Program, his former associates there enthusiastically invited him to
direct the new agency. His scientific acumen and his wide experience in conducting
and directing research have endowed him with a sound professional judgment; he
further possesses exceptional executive gifts and an unfailing tact; his dispensation
of the moneys in his charge has been just, orderly, and sympathetic. Health scientists throughout the nation are deeply in his debt. The University of Michigan
expresses a widely shared sense of gratitude and esteem in conferring upon him the
degree Doctor of Science.

The Secretary reported with regret the death on December 17, 1960,
of Ralph Leroy Belknap, Associate Professor of Geology, and of
Joseph Brinkman, Professor of Piano, on December 26, 1960. The
following memoirs were adopted:
R. L. Belknap:     RALPH LEROY BELKNAP, Associate Professor of Geology, died in Ann
Memoir   Arbor on December the seventeenth, early in his sixty-second year. A native of
St. Clair, he came to the University in 1918 to earn a baccalaureate in civil
engineering. His master's and doctor's degrees he earned here in subsequent years
while instructing in the Department of Geology. The University appointed him
assistant professor in 1930, and associate professor in 1939. Throughout his
career, Professor Belknap was devoted to exploration and field instruction, for
which his energy, his enthusiasm, and the warmth of his associations with colleagues and students admirably fitted him. He was Chief Surveyor for the first of
the University's Greenland expeditions in 1926, and Assistant Director of the
second and third expeditions. In 1932 he himself led a final Greenland expedition,
jointly sponsored by The University of Michigan and Pan-American Airways, to
record geological and meteorological conditions in previously uncharted wastes.
He later served as director of the Meteorological Station in Ann Arbor and of

geologic study at Camp Davis in Wyoming. It was while teaching a class in the
field at Camp Davis in 1946 that Professor Belknap sustained the injury which
cut short his vigorous and fruitful career. But the same resources of courage upon
which he had drawn during his active life sustained him during his long disability.
His liveliness of interest and sweetness of nature never deserted him. The Regents
of the University, moved at once by profound pity and deeply felt respect, now
mourn his death and tender their sincerest sympathy to Mrs. Belknap and her sons.
The University community was saddened by the death, on December 26, of
JOSEPH BRINKMAN, Professor of Piano and Chairman of the Department of
Piano, after an association extending over thirty years. Professor Brinkman earned
his baccalaureate at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago in 1921 and
subsequently studied under Lee Pattison and Artur Schnabel. It was through Professor Brinkman's agency that Artur Schnabel later came repeatedly to Ann Arbor,
leaving a permanent imprint on the musical life of the University and the area.
During his early career, Professor Brinkman was a frequent soloist with the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra and gave solo and ensemble recitals in New York
and in other principal cities throughout the East and Middle West. He later
performed with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Boston and Ann Arbor. Until a
few years before his death, he continued to play with notable warmth, authority,
and expressiveness. His career as teacher was very nearly conterminous with his
performing career and was informed by the same distinguished musicianship.
Having taught piano and theory at the American Conservatory after his graduation, he came to the University as. Instructor in Piano in 1930. Here he rose
through the several ranks to professor and department chairman.
Within his department, Professor Brinkman maintained the highest instructional standards and was appropriately rewarded by the confidence of his entire
staff. His students reflected his sensitive and skillful tuition in the superior quality
of their recitals; many of them have since enjoyed great success in careers of their
own. To the new and largely uncharted doctoral program in musical performance,
he gave significant encouragement and direction.
On this sorrowful occasion, the Regents of the University wish to express the
high value which they placed upon Professor Brinkman's abilities and his devoted
service and to tender their profoundest sympathy to Mrs. Brinkman.
The request of Miss S. Katharine Hill, Teacher of Mathematics in
the University School and Instructor in the School of Education, to
retire at the end of the current University year, in June, 1961, was
granted. Miss Hill will become sixty-five years of age on March 31,
1961. The request was granted with the understanding that retirement
would be without any continuing salary obligation on the University's
part.
The following leaves of absence were approved (p. 183):
*Wilbur J. Cohen, Professor of Public Welfare Administration in the School of
Social Work, for the second semester of the University year 1960-61, without
salary, to work in the U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in
Washington, D.C.

building and equipment plus a ten-year operating appropriation which
would reach a level of approximately $900,000 annually during each

Nelson, the University's first Counselor to Foreign Students. Professor
Emeritus Nelson died January 1, 1961, at age eighty-seven.
The Board of Governors of the International Center expresses its sincere
sympathy to the family of Professor J. Raleigh Nelson, the first Counselor to
Foreign Students, the founding Director of the International Center, and the
originator of this Board.
Professor Nelson, through his devoted love of humanity, set the course of the
University's concern for foreign students. To him, the individual student and his
needs formed the core for all action. His efforts and his friendship for students
from many lands were designed to make this a better world-one of greater understanding between peoples.
The path shown by Professor Nelson, and the high ideals he held on the road
to true understanding, serve as a map to guide us. It is only hoped that we now
can carry on the task with the high goals set for us by his example.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the Regents
of The University of Michigan for the month of November, 1960,

APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREES
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison and Erich A. Walter
Conferred January 21, 1961
DOCTOR OF LAWS


Chester Bowles:
Honorary Degree
Nobumoto Ohama:
Honorary Degree


The Honorable CHESTER BOWLES, public servant and author. During one
of the political conventions last summer, there was heard a voice lifted above
partisan acerbities and national vainglory, extending to all men a "friendship
which goes beyond governments and ideologies to our common human interest in a
better world." It is because such voices can make themselves heard on these
occasions that we retain confidence in our present political institutions. It is because men like the author of this declaration can appropriately be preferred to
positions of trust that we remain confident of our nation's beneficent role in world
affairs. Former Governor of Connecticut and Congressman from Connecticut, beloved Ambassador to India from 1951 to 1953, exemplar in his life of the amity
and fraternity which his books have eloquently commended to us, Chester Bowles
has been, since yesterday, acting as our Undersecretary of State. We gratefully
anticipate his further distinguished service to our nation and to mankind. The
University is proud to confer on him the degree Doctor of Laws.
NOBUMOTO OHAMA, educator and jurist, President of Waseda University.
Receiving his legal education at Waseda and at the University of London, President Ohama served as law professor and dean of the law school before representatives of the alumni, employees, and faculties of his university elected and re-elected
him to his present office. As a legal scholar, he has combined an intensive proficiency in commercial law with a statesmanlike command of juridical science
generally. As university president, he has supplied wise and temperate leadership,
manifesting a flexibility which is founded on inner assurance. He has moved at
once to strengthen the traditional curricula at Waseda and to extend and diversify
those courses of study and research upon which a growing industrial economy
makes heaviest demands. It is congenial to the American temperament to honor
this man, who has risen to eminence by virtue of his own signal gifts alone. It is
fitting that The University of Michigan, which has maintained a fraternal association with President Ohama's university and is beholden to him for unfailing kindness and tact, should proffer the honor. Upon him we now confer our highest
degree, Doctor of Laws.
DOCTOR OF ARCHITECTURE
MINORU YAMASAKI, architect of Detroit and Birmingham, Michigan.
American architecture in this century has sought to create the spatial forms
appropriate to an industrial age. Rejecting ornamentation as pretense, the contemporary designer has made it his creed to assert chiefly material function and
frankly to reveal steel or concrete frames. Too often, however, our modern buildings are revelatory of structure and of little else. And the human spirit, which
cannot live by structural logic alone, has longed for the nurture of lightness, of
fantasy, of joy.
It has been the mission of Minoru Yamasaki to supply this deficiency. He
conceives of architecture as a pleasurable and festive art. Alone among the moderns,
he delights in decorative symmetry, rich screens, and curtain walls. In such buildings as the St. Louis Airport Terminal, the Music Conservatory at Oberlin College,
and the McGregor Conference Center, the Reynolds Metals Building, and the
American Concrete Institute in Detroit, he has once more granted the imagination
and emotions the right of autonomous being. He is the forerunner, it may be, of a
general movement to reconcile the measure of his art to the measure of man.
Expressing admiration for his manifold talents and gratitude for his contributions
to architectural amenity within our state, the University now confers on him the
degree Doctor of Architecture.

M. Davis: Will     The Attorney for the University reported that the will of Marie
Davis was recently offered for probate in New Orleans, Louisiana.
Paragraph (3) of the will provides as follows:
"I give and bequeath to my sister, Alberta Paul, the usufruct for life of
$10,000 and subject to my sister's said usufruct, I give and bequeath the naked
ownership thereof to The University of Michigan. My sister is dispensed with
giving any bond or other security as usufructuary."
This provision under Louisiana law gives the University a claim in the amount
of $10,000 against the estate of Alberta Paul after her death. The executor
advises that Mrs. Paul has a life expectancy of seven years.
Arthur L. Davis, the deceased husband of Marie Davis, was a practicing
lawyer in New Orleans, and he attended the Literary College of The University of
Michigan between 1897 and 1900.

obligation is deemed an essential of good conduct and students who are guilty of
laxness in this regard to a degree incompatible with the general standards of
conduct as set forth in Section 8.03 shall be liable to disciplinary action by the
proper University authorities. Students shall pay all accounts due the University

Flint Board of    The   Regents   approved    the  following   agreement between     The
Agreement with  University of Michigan and the Flint Board of Education for combining the library services of the Flint College of The University of
Michigan and the Junior College of the Flint Board of Education, the
agreement to become effective February 28, 1961:
AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AND THE FLINT BOARD OF EDUCATION
LIBRARY SERVICES
The Flint Board of Education and the Regents of The University of Michigan,
recognizing with satisfaction and sincere appreciation the generosity of Mr. C. S.
Mott in his gift of a new College Library Building to the Flint Board of Education, welcome the opportunity of working together to make the library collections
of the Flint Senior College of The University of Michigan and the Junior College
of the Flint Board of Education more useful by bringing them together in one
location, to add systematically to their respective or common collections, and to
develop facilities and services consistent with the educational needs of the Flint
community, the common objectives of the two colleges, and their separate educational requirements.
To this end, the Flint Board of Education and the Regents of The University
of Michigan agree to be governed in this undertaking by the policies, principles,
and understandings hereinafter set forth:
1. That the building now designated as the Charles Stewart Mott Library, in
compliance with the deed of gift, is the property of the Flint Board of Education.
2. That the Flint Board of Education shall assume the responsibility for the
custody of the building and for necessary maintenance and building services, including light, power, other utilities, and the usual custodial services, with the
understanding that the Regents of The University of Michigan shall pay a proportionate share, as herein defined, of all such costs.
3. That Article VI, Rules and Regulations Governing Use of Property, of
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN AND THE FLINT BOARD OF EDUCATION (copy attached),
approved by the Flint Board of Education on April 28, 1959, and by the Regents
of The University of Michigan on May 22, 1959, shall apply equally to the
Charles Stewart Mott Library.
4. That it is the intention of the donor that the building shall be used
primarily as a library facility, but that the Flint Board of Education may, in its
discretion, permit other incidental uses, with the understanding that when such
permission is granted to either the Senior College or to the Junior College and
other educational programs of the Flint Board, the party benefiting shall be
solely responsible for all special costs incurred in such incidental uses.
5. That the libraries shall be administered in a manner reasonably calculated
to effect economies, avoid duplication of purchases and overlapping of services;
and that where the educational purposes of the two colleges can be jointly served,
they shall co-operate in the development of a library collection for their common use.
6. That the administration of the business and financial affairs of the
libraries shall be the responsibility of the Flint Board of Education, acting on




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1961


227


behalf of both. A separate library account or accounts shall be established and an
audit of such accounts shall be published annually. Library personnel shall be
employees of the Flint Board of Education.
7. That a single, appropriate and complete library budget for each fiscal
year shall be prepared and submitted in due time for adoption by the Flint Board
of Education and the Regents of The University of Michigan, respectively, with
the understanding that the budget shall be suitably categorized and itemized
(a) to reveal the operational and maintenance plans for the ensuing year, and
(b) to identify and segregate those items of expense incurred by reason of joint
occupancy, common purchases, and common services, from those items of expense
which are incurred for the primary use of the one or the other of the two colleges,
and with the further understanding that subsequent to adoption of the budget by
the respective Boards, transfers among or within categories designated for common
use shall require prior authorization by the Board of Education and the Regents
of The University of Michigan.
8. That all costs herein defined as costs incurred in the joint occupancy of the
Charles Stewart Mott Library and in the furnishing of joint and common library
facilities and services, shall be proportionately shared between the Flint Board of
Education and the Regents of The University of Michigan, and that the respective
shares shall be determined by the total number of credit hours elected and
computed on the basis of one unit for freshmen and sophomores, two units for
juniors and seniors, and three units for graduates, with the understanding that the
facilities of the library will be available to other institutions offering courses in
the Flint community provided, however, that equal and proportionate charges shall
be required from other institutional users, and that the income from such uses
shall be credited to the library account.
9. That the Flint Board of Education shall designate the Director of
Libraries as responsible to the Flint Board of Education for seeing that library
operations in the Charles Stewart Mott Library are conducted in accordance with
this agreement with the policies of the Board, and in co-operation with the two
deans acting jointly. It shall be a part of the duties of the Director to assure good
co-operation between the library program and services of the Charles Stewart Mott
Library, the Flint Public Library system, and other libraries in the Flint area.
The Director shall be responsible for the preparation of an annual budget and,
with the advice and consent of the two deans, he shall recommend all professional
staff members, including the Librarian of the College Library, to the Board of
Education for appointment. On recommendation of the Librarian he shall appoint
all nonprofessional library staff members in accordance with rules and regulations
established by the Board of Education.
The Librarian of the Charles Stewart Mott Library shall be administratively
responsible to the Director of Libraries for library operations and the supervision
of library staff in the Charles Stewart Mott Library. Pending the completion of an
appointment to a vacancy in the librarianship, the Director, after consultation with
the deans, may recommend and the Flint Board of Education may appoint, an
Acting Librarian to take temporary charge of the Library.
10. The Director and the two deans, acting jointly, shall be responsible for
the determination of general policies governing the development, use, and preservation of the college library collections, and shall formulate such rules and regulations as are necessary to effectuate the educational objectives of the two colleges
as they pertain to library services. The two deans shall review and approve for
transmittal the annual budget, and shall consider such other matters as the
Director shall present.
11. In recognition of the progress which has been made and the interest
which has been demonstrated in community-wide education, the Charles Stewart
Mott Library shall co-operate with the Flint Public Library in a manner reasonably calculated to serve this purpose, subject to such policies and procedures,
including acquisition policies and borrowing privileges, as are necessary to preserve
and promote the primary purpose of providing library services for the students
and faculties of the two colleges.
12. That the statement of policies and principles set forth in this document
may be revised from time to time and shall be reviewed at the request of either
party.




228                 FEBRUARY MEETING, 1961
Excerpt:
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN AND THE FLINT BOARD OF EDUCATION
(R.P., 1957-60, p. 855)
VI. RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING USE OF PROPERTY
Recognizing that the Flint Board of Education is responsible for the maintenance of all buildings and grounds and has a primary responsibility for the conservation and security of its properties, it is agreed:
1. That the rules and regulations governing the use and security of its
property and student conduct in relation thereto now in force or hereafter adopted
by the Flint Board of Education, shall apply equally to students of the Flint
College of The University of Michigan;
2. That the Regents of the University shall regard such rules and regulations
as equally applicable to the Mott Memorial Building and other properties of the
Flint Board of Education which by reason of the terms and conditions of this
agreement may be deemed subject to control by the Regents of the University; and
3. That the Regents of the University shall adopt such rules and regulations
as are necessary to compel compliance with the rules and regulations adopted by
the Flint Board of Education for the conservation and security of its properties
occupied by the Flint College of The University of Michigan.
Library     On recommendation of the Director of the University Library and
Regulations  of the Vice-President and Dean of Faculties, the Regents adopted the
following changes in the regulations governing the use of the University
Library:
a) That the use of the Medical Library be limited according to a fixed schedule
of hours and in accord with these regulations:
1. Establish a control desk at the entrance to the library, including registration of users.
2. Use Student, University Hospital, and Faculty identification cards as
evidence of admissibility.
3. Restrict library use to (a) medical students, (b) nursing students,
(c) public health students, (d) dental students, (e) hospital administration students, (f) graduate students, generally, (g) hospital staff, including interns and
residents, (h) faculty members, generally, (i) research staff members, generally,
(j) visiting scholars, (k) other students in possession of a note signed by a faculty
member or a professional staff member of the University Library, requesting permission to use the library for a specific time-period or project.
4. Staff the control desk with an employee who has discretion and tact.
b) That the use of the University libraries be extended to high school students
under special conditions as stated in the form "High School Student Request for
University of Michigan Library Privileges."
These regulations were found necessary because of overcrowding in the Medical
Library and in the Undergraduate Library by readers, many of whom were not
University students, who were using the libraries as study halls or as places for
social gatherings.
J. M. Plumer:     Regent Power voted against the change. Regent Thurber did not
Citation vote since he had been out of the room at the time the changes were
discussed.
It was voted to incorporate the following citation honoring Professor James M. Plumer and his work in Japan. This citation has just
recently been received by Mrs. Plumer. Professor Plumer died on
June 15, 1960 (p. 29).




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1961


229


The
Association for Japan-United States Amity and Trade Centennial
in sincere appreciation of the
Devoted and Outstanding Services
rendered by
Professor James Plumer
for advancement of the national life of the people of Japan
presents to him
this Certificate of Merit
and
Token of Gratitude
in commemoration of the One Hundredth Anniversary
of the exchange of the ratifications of the
Treaty of Amity and Commerce
Signed and sealed in the City of Tokyo
on this Tenth Day of the Month of November
in the Year Nineteen Hundred and Sixty
SHIGERU YOSHIDA                     TAIZO ISIZAKA
Honorary President                     President
The Vice-President for Research reviewed briefly for the Regents
an address he had presented to the Research Club on the evening of
November 16, 1960. Since at the request of the Senate Advisory Committee the address had been made a part of the minutes of the senate,
the address was not circulated generally until February 15. The VicePresident said that $38,000,000 of identifiable research costs may be
found in University budgets. He believed that an independent research
agency, which had to pay all costs including housing, salaries and
wages, equipment, supplies, and administration, would spend at least
$100,000,000 for an equivalent amount of research. He believed that
at least a thousand members of the faculty are involved in research in
all areas; that a thousand graduate students are engaged in doctoral
research; and that approximately two thousand students are employed
part time as research assistants. During the past year, 850 different
research projects supported by non-state funds were under way. The
smallest of these projects represented $500 of financial help, the largest,
$4,000,000. This latter was Project MICHIGAN supported by the Army
Signal Corps and to which the Army has contributed about $32,000,000
over the last eight years.
"The University of Michigan," the Vice-President said, "has for
many years been committed to the idea that research and teaching go
together and that the best teacher is a man who is also interested in
research.... As long as we are not receiving the full indirect costs, our
research program is a net expense to us and as the amount of outside
money available increases rapidly, this expense becomes greater. Our
problem is definitely not whether this is an improper cost or an undesirable cost, but whether we can support this cost and how far we can
go in accepting additional outside research money which does not carry
the full cost of research.... The Institute of Science and Technology
rose from the considerations of a research committee appointed by
President Hatcher two years ago and its acceptance by the Governor
and the legislature. It seems to me to be a heart-warming indication of
the interest of the state government in the development of research
and research-based industry in the State of Michigan."
The President reminded the Regents that the University of Michigan Symphony Band, under the direction of Dr. Revelli, would be

APPENDIX A
REGENTS' CITATION OF HONOR
Characterization by Erich A. Walter
Conferred January 25, 1961
M. FREDERIK      SMITH, student at this University, 1924-26, business
executive, pamphleteer, expert in public relations. At nineteen he was President
of the General Health Foods Corporation, of Dayton, Ohio; at twenty-three,
Director of Public Relations for the advertising firm of Batten, Barton, Durstine
and Osborn, in New York. Among the many important posts that have tested his
abilities are these: directing the preconvention campaign for Wendell Willkie,
working with Henry Morgenthau as Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury,
becoming Vice-President of the Blue Network of the American Broadcasting
Company, and serving under President Truman as chairman of the Public Relations Committee of the National Labor-Management Conference. He is the
co-founder of the United Nations World magazine and of the International United
Nations Citizens Movement. He now is Vice-President of the Prudential Life
Insurance Company of America.
In 1946 Fred Smith reacted with enthusiasm to the appeal that he serve as
consultant to the University's planning committee for a war memorial. His ideas
implemented the hope of the student body that the University create a functional
war memorial that would concern itself with the application of atomic energy for
constructive rather than for destructive ends. He was deeply moved by the student
appeal that the memorial be a sign-a light high in the sky for all men to see
that would burn and never be extinguished. He responded with the University of
Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project, a symbol of life born from the ashes of
death, a memorial acclaimed as unique and which from its beginning has functioned for the beneficent use of the world's most awful power.
The Regents now salute Fred Smith and gratefully tender him their Citation
of Honor.

MARCH MEETING, 1961


269


The Attorney for the University reported that the will of Mary             M. M. Harper:
McKibben     Harper was recently      offered  for probate    in  Allegheny
County, Pennsylvania.
The Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, executor named in the will,
has furnished the University a copy of the will and advised that a nephew of the
decedent has given notice of appeal from the order of the Probate Court allowing
the will for probate.
After two small specific bequests, the will gives one-third of the residue of the
estate to the University of Michigan Medical School and the remainder of the
estate to two other medical institutions. It is believed that it will not be necessary
at this time for the University to retain counsel in the appeal, as the executor has
retained the firm of Reding, Blackstone, Phillips and Sell to represent the estate.
The gross amount of the estate is reported to be $155,000.00.
After hearing a letter of intent from    Cora Peck Buhl, President of       c. P. Buhl:
the Lawrence De Long and Cora Peck Buhl Fund, proposing to give to             Gift Proposal
the University under stipulated conditions as set forth in the letter a
sum of $250,000 toward the building of a research laboratory building
for the study of human genetics, such a gift to be contingent upon
securing from other sources matching funds of $250,000, the Regents
approved the conditions of the proposed gift and authorized the executive officers to proceed in an application to the federal government for
such matching-fund monies.
Routine appointments, all within the budget, were approved as Appointments:

Deree Awarded of Graduate Studies, Murray A. Milne was awarded the degree of

delay in transferring a credit to Mr. Milne's record.




MARCH MEETING, 1961


275


The Regents granted the request of the Director of the Office of
Registration and Records for the following changes in the degree list of
February 4, 1961:
Mrs. Enid Lappin Grauer, from "Bachelor of Arts" to "Bachelor of Arts with
Distinction."
Mrs. Linda Kayes Davis, from "Bachelor of Arts" to "Bachelor of Arts with
Honors in Philosophy."
After very careful and repeated consideration of the University's
heating-plant expansion, the Regents authorized the installation of a
new boiler in the Washington Street plant, to be fired with gas fuel.
In view of the far-reaching significance of this action, Regent
Thurber requested annual reports comparing the cost of coal-fired with
gas-fired boilers.
Regent Eckert voted for the resolution only because funds cannot
be got to undertake the immediate development of an entirely new
coal-fired heating plant located near the Huron River and adjacent to
the New York Central Railroad.
Regent McInally, in voting for the resolution, pointed out that the
expedient measure as opposed to a desirable long-run solution was
dictated by the financial exigencies that face the state legislature.
There was consensus among the Regents on the provisos expressed
above.
On recommendation of the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance, the Regents amended their action taken at the May meeting
in 1960 (R.P., 1957-60, p. 1251) concerning convenience deductions.
The proviso that authorization be renewed annually was dropped.
On recommendation of the Dean of the School of Public Health
and of the Vice-President and Dean of Faculties, the Regents approved
the establishment of a Department of Community Health Services,
comprising the present units of the Department of Public Health
Practice that deal with public health administration, medical care
administration, chronic diseases, and public health nursing. They
further approved the establishment of a Department of Public Health
Development, comprising the present units of the Department of
Public Health Practice that deal with nutrition, dental health, health
education, mental health, and maternal and child health. These changes
were made effective immediately. Dr. Vlado A. Getting was appointed
Chairman of the Department of Community Health Services for a term
of four years ending June 30, 1965. Dr. Kenneth A. Easlick was
appointed Chairman of the Department of Public Health Development.
Dr. Easlick's appointment will terminate with the beginning of his
retirement furlough on July 1, 1962. Both of these appointments were
made effective immediately.
It was agreed that with the establishment of these two new departments the Department of Public Health Practice is discontinued.
On recommendation of the Dean and the Executive Committee of
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and of the Vice-President and Dean of Faculties, the Phillips Scholarships were reestablished
as the Phillips Classical Prizes. These will consist of six prizes awarded
each year to outstanding underclass students of Greek and Latin in the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. The basis for award will

be by special examination to be set by the Department of Classical
Studies. Competition will be open to freshman and sophomore students
enrolled in the appropriate elementary and intermediate courses in
Greek and Latin. The prizes will consist of one or more handsome and
expensive books on classical subjects. Each book will carry a specially
designed bookplate inscribed with the student's name, the year of the
award, and the name of the prize.
It is expected that the first set of awards may be made in the
spring of 1961.
On recommendation of the Dean of State-wide Education and of
the Vice-President and Dean of Faculties, the Regents approved the
following agreement on dual elections at The University of Michigan
and Wayne State University.
It was further understood that the following procedures would be
observed in making the agreement effective:
1. The agreement will become operationally effective as understandings are
reached at the level of the several schools and colleges.
2. The definition of circumstances in which such elections will be permitted
and the formulation of the specific rules governing such elections will be the
responsibility of the deans and directors of the respective and corresponding
instructional units at the two universities.
3. The privilege will be restricted to advanced and specialized students who
have been admitted to a degree program and paid an appropriate fee at the home
institution and who have been advised and certified as students who can profit
from the experience.
4. Registration and admission to classes will be as informal as the circumstances will permit.
5. Credits, grades, and other evidences of progress and performance will be
reported to the home institution.
6. An accounting of services and costs will be exchanged between the two
institutions annually.
AGREEMENT
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN-WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY
DUAL ELECTIONS
To ensure the fullest utilization of their combined educational resources,
especially in graduate, professional, and highly specialized areas; to provide
broader learning opportunities for their advanced students; and to avoid unnecessary overlapping of educational services and the duplication of facilities, the
Regents of The University of Michigan and the Governing Board of Wayne State
University hereby agree that students duly enrolled in either one of the two universities, who can profit from the arrangement and who are fully qualified and
appropriately certified, will be permitted to elect courses offered by the other
institution without formal institutional admission or the payment of an additional fee.
The two universities enter into this agreement subject to the following procedural understandings:
1. Because of the breadth of offerings and the range and diversity of educational problems inherent in the educational sweep of the two universities, and
because of fluctuating and varied demands on staff and other facilities as well as
the problems peculiar to each of the several units, this agreement shall become
effective between the several schools and colleges of the two institutions subject to
such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the objectives of this agreement,
as are mutually acceptable to the deans and directors of the respective and corresponding instructional units.
2. No person claiming residence in one institution shall be permitted to elect
courses offered by the other institution unless (a) he has been admitted to a degree
program in one institution, (b) he is at the time a registered student in possession
of evidence certifying that he has paid an appropriate fee, and (c) he is certified

and approved by the chairmen of the corresponding departments as fully qualified
and competent to pursue the proposed courses.
3. When such elections are made in expectation of the fulfillment of specified
degree requirements, approval prior to election shall have been had from the committee chairman or other appropriately designated adviser. Credits, grades, and
other evidences of progress and performance shall not be recorded in the permanent
records of the university in which the elections are made, but shall be reported
directly to a designated officer at the institution in which the student is registered.
4. A simplified registration form identifying the student, his academic status,
the course, and the time of election and carrying the signatures of the corresponding department chairmen and other academic advisers shall be completed for each
election. These forms shall be accumulated in a designated office and an interinstitutional accounting shall be made once each calendar year. Thereafter one university shall remit to the other, in lieu of student fees, such amounts as are
determined to be fair and equitable considering the number of students, the level
of instruction, and other factors which are usually recognized in determining
instructional costs.
5. This agreement shall be effective immediately on approval by the Regents
of The University of Michigan and the Governing Board of Wayne State University.
The annual report of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, including the financial report covering the period from July 1,
1959, to June 30, 1960, was accepted and placed on file, with the
understanding that in other matters the report is not limited to the
fiscal year (R.P., 1957-60, p. 1199). Two questions were raised with
reference to the report: (1) could the report not be published earlier,
and (2) would it not be more helpful if the report gave comparative
financial statements for the preceding year on receipts and disbursements.
The Secretary read the following letter from Professor Marcus L.
Plant, Secretary of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics
(p. 215):

Mr. Erich A. Walter
Secretary of The University of Michigan
2552 Administration Building
Ann Arbor, Michigan


DEAR MR. WALTER:
This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of February 21, advising
that the Regents of the University deferred action on the report from the Board in
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics on a multipurpose building, pending receipt of
a five-year projection of the Board's expenses and revenues. Your letter was
presented to the Board at a meeting held March 9, 1961. Pursuant thereto the
Director of Athletics and the special committee that prepared the preliminary
report will undertake promptly the preparation of the financial projection and
the compilation of related data. This information will be forwarded to the Board
of Regents in the near future.
Sincerely yours,
MARCUS L. PLANT, Secretary
Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics
The Secretary    read  the following letter from    John   Feldkamp,
President of the Student Government Council:


Conference on
the University:
Letter from
Student Government Council, re


March 14, 1961


Mr. Erich A. Walter
Secretary of the University
2552 Administration


DEAR MR. WALTER:
At its meeting of March 8, 1961, Student Government Council enthusiastically
endorsed the idea of a Conference on the University and made known its willing



278


2MlARCH MEETING, 1961


ness to assist in the planning and organization of such a conference. This action
followed earlier action taken at the meeting of December 7, 1960, where preliminary planning was set up by the Council.
Attached please find an article from the Michigan Daily written by two members of Student Government Council. Although the views it contains are not
necessarily those of the entire Council, it does outline the ideas of two individual
members of the Council whose ideas have motivated the Council to make its
endorsement.
At the present time the Council is contacting the faculty through the Senate
Advisory Committee. In consultation with them and others, plans will be further
formulated.
The Council requests that the Board of Regents consider endorsement of this
conference to give further impetus to its formulation.
Sincerely yours,
JOHN FELDKAMP, President
The Regents took the following action in response to the Council's
request: "The Regents acknowledge receipt of the letter of March 14
from the Student Government Council. We wish to express our interest in the general concept of this proposal, but we have not had the
opportunity to give it the careful consideration which would be necessary for final action. We are therefore referring the matter to the
Office of Student Affairs for assistance and for further information and
for a report on the development of these plans."
Mr. George Averill, Editor of the Birmingham      Eccentric, and Mr.
Arthur Gallagher, Editor of the Ann Arbor News, attended the meeting
as members of the Michigan Press Association.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the Regents
of The University of Michigan for the month of January, 1961, totaled
$631.65.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Regents adjourned to meet on April 21 at the Dearborn Center.
The meeting will be held at Fair Lane.

APRIL MEETING, 1961


Ann Arbor was referred to the Committee on Finance and Property for
report at the next meeting of the Regents.
Centers for    Approval was given to the establishment of the following four
Area Studies:
Established centers for the purposes and under the conditions described below:
CENTER FOR SOUTHERN ASIAN STUDIES
CENTER FOR CHINESE STUDIES
CENTER FOR RUSSIAN STUDIES
CENTER FOR NEAR AND MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
1. These Centers will be within the administrative jurisdiction of the College
of Literature, Science, and the Arts and responsible to the Dean and Executive
Committee of that College.
2. Each of the Centers will be under the immediate direction of an executive
committee consisting of five members of the University Senate representing fields
of interest related to the Center. Committee members will be appointed by the
Dean and Executive Committee of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
and each member shall serve for a five-year term.
3. A Director of each Center shall be appointed from the Senate members of
the executive committee by the Board of Regents on recommendation of the
President.
4. The purposes of the Centers are to support research, publication, and training in the areas indicated by their title. In this effort they will work closely with
the departments with relevant interests.
5. Whenever possible, support for these area Centers will be secured from outside sources. It is recognized, however, that these Centers constitute an important
part of the University's commitment to research, training, and publication in the
field of non-Western studies, and that support from the general funds for their
basic administrative costs, space, and instructional requirements, and the salaries of
their Directors will provide stability for their activities, increase the likelihood of
outside assistance, and render such aid more effective. Such basic Center costs as
these will be met by the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, contingent, of
course, on the availability of funds.
Appointment of the directors of the respective centers was postponed until the May meeting so that the Regents might have before
them biographical sketches of the proposed directors.
Kresge Hearing     On recommendation of the Dean and Executive Committee of the
Research Institute:

APRIL MEETING, 1961


295


Exception in the four-day waiting period may be made for routine activities
approved by the President of Student Government Council or upon delegation by
the Executive Vice-President. Such action will become effective within twenty-four
hours after publication in the "Daily Official Bulletin" unless referred back to the
Council by the Vice-President for Student Affairs.
The Regents heard a letter addressed by the President to W. Weldon
Alien, Budget Examiner of the Budget Division of the Department of
Administration in Lansing, the letter being an answer to a request from
the Governor for information on the possible effects upon The University of Michigan of certain wholly inadequate increases to the University for operations in the coming fiscal year. The Regents strongly
endorsed the President's letter.
Authorization, including a sum     of $5,000, was granted    for an
exploratory investigation of House Bill, Public Act No. 77, 1960,
an act creating the Michigan Higher Education Assistance Authority,
the investigation to determine the feasibility of making the bill a
meaningful source of student loan funds.
The Regents accepted Regent Power's invitation to hold their May
meeting in Traverse City at the Park Place Hotel May 18, 19, and 20.
Regent McInally declared his opposition to holding meetings of the
Regents away from the University.
The Secretary announced that the Honors Convocation would be
held May 12 and that Dr. Arnold Toynbee would be the speaker. He
also announced that the June meeting would fall on June 16, with
Commencement being held the following day, June 17.
Vice-President Stirton invited the Regents to a special luncheon at
the Dearborn Center, Monday, May 15.
On motion of Regent Power, seconded by Regent Thurber, it was
decided to issue six numbers of a new University publication "Regents'
Report." Regents McInally and Eckert voted against issuing the
publication.
It was agreed that all Regents should review copy for the publication.
The Regents voted that Dr. Edwin Leeson Thirlby, of Traverse
City, be awarded a Regents' Citation of Honor when the Regents visit
Traverse City in May.
The Regents passed the following resolution:
April 21, 1961
The Regents of The University of Michigan realize that a final decision has
not yet been reached on the 1961-62 appropriation for higher education in this
state. They also are cognizant of the continuing efforts of many persons, both in
the executive and legislative branches of government, to provide more adequate
support for the state's universities and colleges.
Nevertheless, the level of appropriations now being considered would pose
serious consequences without precedent to the University. They require a toughminded appraisal of the various alternatives facing the institution. The Regents are
determined first and foremost that the high quality of the University's faculty and
educational program be maintained. Sound educational policy also requires that
additional student fee increases be avoided as certain to restrict the educational
opportunities of well-qualified and deserving young men and women.
Accordingly, the Regents instruct the administrative officers to make a study
of the following courses of action if the proposed austerity budget is adopted:
(1) the elimination of any over-all increase in enrollment and actual reduction
therein, (2) the feasibility of incurring an operating deficit, and (3) the continuing
cutback of services, maintenance, equipment purchases, and other similar items.

APRIL MEETING, 1961


While these are emergency measures necessary to protect the University's
educational standards, the Regents reaffirm their intention of pressing for a more
constructive long-range solution to the accumulating needs of higher education.
It is essential to the welfare of the state, we believe, that the perennial anxiety
about the future of higher education be removed and that a sustained basis of
operation be found for the critical decade ahead.
Regents Power and Murphy commended Regent Thurber, who had
drawn the resolution.
Regent Brablec complimented the administrative officers, including
Robert Cross, for their excellent presentation of the University's needs
at Lansing. He was joined enthusiastically in his observation by the
Board as a whole.
Regent Power read an invitation from the Institute for College and
University Administrators and the Association of Governing Boards of
State Universities and Allied Institutions for the Regents to attend a
conference at Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, Aspen, Colorado,
on May 27, 28, and 29, 1961.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the Regents
of The University of Michigan for the month of February, 1961,
totaled $627.52; and for the month of March, 1961, totaled $711.31.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
otherwise expressly stated.
The Regents adjourned to meet May 18, 19, and 20 at Traverse City.

JOINT CITATION OF HONOR WITH TRUSTEES OF
MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY
Characterization by Alexander W. Allison and Erich A. Walter
Voted December 16, 1960 (p. 192)                  Conferred January 6, 1961
ALICE WESSELS BURLINGAME has commended to our sometimes distraught age the beauty and order of plant life and the salutary virtues of the
gardener's craft. Having studied psychology in the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts of The University of Michigan and occupational therapy in the
University Hospital, she later pursued her interest in gardening as a graduate
student at Michigan State University. These several concerns she then united in a
novel and rewarding career. At the invitation of the Visiting Nurse Association of
Detroit and of the Chicago Horticultural Society, she has initiated programs of
gardening for homebound patients and handicapped school children. For women
confined in the Detroit House of Correction, she has instituted projects in horticultural research. At Michigan State University, she has taught a course on the
uses of horticulture in institutions for the physically and mentally ill, and has
co-authored with Professor Donald Pickett Watson the recent pioneering volume
Therapy through Horticulture. These. and her many other services in her unique
calling she has informed with profound personal devotion at once to the cultivation
of plants and to the well-being of persons. In tendering to this generous and
creative woman a joint Citation of Honor, the Trustees of Michigan State University and the Regents of The University of Michigan express the depth and
community of their esteem.

Regents of the University of Michigan
GENTLEMEN:
In June 1960, alumni of the University in the City of Chicago established
there the "University of Michigan Alumni Office" for the purpose of serving all
interests of the University and its various organized activities.
To start this office, the Chicago Alumni were fortunate in securing free office
space for several months as well as free office furnishings. The office has been
staffed by volunteers.




VMAY MEETING, 1961

We knew that funds would be needed for continued operation. The Alumni
Fund at our request authorized a separate account for funds directed to be used
for this purpose. A contribution of $500, so directed, has been in the Alumni Fund
for several months. Other contributions are in process.
Our free rental time expired April 30, 1961, and we have been invoiced for
May rental in the amount of $75. As this is our first invoice from the building,
it is advisable that prompt payment be made.
Will you please make such authorization and take such action as may be
appropriate for the proper operation of this fund.
Sincerely yours,
University of Michigan Alumni Office
By: S/WILBUR C. BACON
Exectuive Director
Permission was granted to establish the Phoenix Project Aid Fund
in accord with the stipulations outlined by Neil A. Moore in his offer
to give to the University stock of a present market value of approximately $5,000 to establish the fund.
On recommendation of the Gomberg House Alumni Committee,
permission was granted to establish the Edith L. Lynch Fund in accord
with the stipulations outlined in the letter quoted below:


Phoenix Project
Aid Fund:
Established
E. L. Lynch Fund:
Established


Mr. Erich A. Walter
Secretary of the University of Michigan
2552 Administration Building
DEAR SIR:
The Gomberg House Council has transferred $50.00 to the Michigan Alumni
Fund. This sum is submitted to the Regents of the University of Michigan with
the request that it be the first installment toward the establishment of the Edith
L. Lynch Fund. It is planned that letters of solicitation be sent out to Alumni,
friends, and members of Gomberg House in an effort to reach a goal of $5,000.00.
It is the intention of the Gomberg Alumni Committee that this Fund be
established to honor Edith L. Lynch upon the occasion of her retirement from the
position of Associate Adviser of Gomberg House. She has held this position since
the House was organized in 1951 and has provided the base upon which this
House has been built. She has been an energetic and very important supporter of
our House and has helped to provide for the needs of the men who have lived
here over the past ten years. Through this Fund we hope to carry on the spirit
which she has demonstrated in helping these men.
The intention of the Committee is that grants be given to students based upon
need and interest in Gomberg House up to a total of $500.00 in any one year.
The Fund is to be expendable as to its earnings and principal.
In the event that the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan should
decide that the purpose of this Fund is permanently frustrated, then the Gomberg
Alumni Committee asks that this Fund be turned over to and administered by the
Dean of Men's office as part of their Grant-in-Aid Fund.
WILLIAM W. SCHULTZ
President, Gomberg House
For the Gomberg Alumni Committee

W. S. Preston:    The Secretary reported with regret the death of William        Samuel
Memoir Preston, Assistant Professor of Bacteriology, April 30, 1961. The following memoir was adopted:
The sudden death of WILLIAM SAMUEL PRESTON on last April thirtieth
was a source of profound sorrow to his friends throughout the University community. Among his colleagues in the Department of Bacteriology, it was the source
also of a deep sense of professional loss.
Professor Preston earned baccalaureate and master's degrees at Brown University in his native Rhode Island, whence he proceeded to the University of Wisconsin
to continue his graduate study and to assist in teaching bacteriology in the medical
school. Upon receiving his doctorate in 1937, he served for a year as a bacteriologist in the laboratories of the New York State Department of Health, and then
came to Ann Arbor as Instructor in Bacteriology and Research Associate in the
Horace H. Rackham Arthritis Research Unit. The University elevated him to an
assistant professorship in 1946, upon his return from a three-year term at the
University of Cincinnati. From 1950 until 1959, when that agency was transferred
to the State Department of Health, he also directed the Pasteur Institute, which
was devoted to the diagnosis of rabies and to research on that dread affliction.
During the last decade of his service on the Medical School faculty, he was
counselor to graduate students and Secretary of the Division of Biological Sciences.
He devoted his primary energies to teaching, winning the grateful esteem of successive generations of students.
The Regents of the University take this occasion to express their own grateful
consciousness of the loyalty and devotion which were peculiar to him and cannot be
replaced. They mourn his loss and tender their heartfelt sympathy to his wife and
to his children.

at 86 Eliot Street, Detroit (R.P., 1923-26, p. 783), and to pay the
University a net amount of $300 a year. The Club will pay one-half
of the cost of the electrical repairs and agrees to release its rights in
the property in the event that the Club disbands or moves to another
location. Regent Thurber abstained from voting on this motion.
The Regents directed that student loans to a total of $9,714.77 be
charged to the Reserve for Loss on Student Notes (R.P., 1957-60, p.
1248), with the understanding that should any collections be made at
a future date on the loans written off, such amounts will be credited
to the Reserve.
After hearing a report by the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance on the joint use with the Michigan State Highway Department of Dock No. 3 facilities at St. Ignace, Michigan (R.P.,
1957-60, p. 1162), the Regents adopted the following resolution:
WHEREAS, The University of Michigan is desirous of obtaining use of a
portion of the Highway Department facility known as Dock 3, St. Ignace, and
WHEREAS, The State Highway Department, which has been given jurisdiction
and control of the entire facility, has tendered a permit to The University of
Michigan for use of a portion of the said facility,
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, That the Regents of The University of
Michigan hereby accepts the permit for the use of that portion of the facility
more particularly described in the said permit, dated March 16, 1961, and agrees
to be bound by all the terms and conditions of the said permit.
The President, in speaking of the problems which the University
faces in preparing a budget for its operation for the next fiscal year,
said that the nine institutions of higher learning in the state of Michigan differ widely in the scope of their curriculums and in the preparation that they offer to the students who are enrolled.
This University began several years ago to institute a carefully
controlled growth. It has grown where we could satisfy our potential
strength. We have followed a carefully controlled pattern of limitation
of enrollment as determined by the capabilities of each individual
college within the University. Our growth has been within the limits
of our present staff and of our present budget. Where we could, within
the limitations of this plan, add a few students, we have. Such an
example, for instance, is the College of Pharmacy. We have been able,
from time to time, to add a few more graduate students in selected
fields.
For the last half century this University has had a high fee structure. Since 1917 it has charged the highest out-of-state fees. In the
last decade it has moved several times toward increasing its fees. The
funds so collected were used for faculty salaries, which in turn kept
our salary scale competitive. We find today no place to turn for new
money. Although other institutions may find such fees in their operations, we do not. The President said, "I cannot think of any program
now in effect within this University which was not begun with the
most careful planning. We do not have adjunct enterprises that we
consider temporary." Our critical priorities are how to continue our
programs which stand as frontiers of research. This University trains
men and women for the professions. It teaches a very high proportion
of all the graduate students in higher educational institutions in this
state.

318MAY MEETING, 1961


The President, in continuing, said we are now very hard put to
holding the position we have gained. Ironically enough, all about us in
this state and throughout the nation it is obvious that our economy is
in the process of growth, that it is moving forward on a generally
accepted improvement factor of about 3 per cent each year. As citizens
of our state we must all find ways of building into our economy the
needs of education, including those of higher education.
We have strained every resource to keep this great University of
ours moving forward. We have no further resource to turn to now
for an increase in faculty salaries. We will honor the commitments we
have already made to some members of our faculty, and for promotions in rank with the salary increases which accompany them. We
will have no money for faculty increases in the budget we must plan.
We face a peculiar paradox. On the one hand we are told to carry
forward and to prepare further opportunities for our young people
who are clamoring for higher education. In the face of this tremendous
pressure we are told not to expand. We are told to hold the line. This
state of affairs we have faced over a period of time, until it has
developed into a complete stalemate. As a consequence we must deny
admission to many qualified students.
Next year our University will not be able to create any new
faculty positions, this at a time when we ought to be thriving, when
we should be adding new staff members who in turn, through their
researches, will have a most significant impact on the industry of this
state.
The rehabilitation of our laboratories and of plant must continue
to wait as it has been waiting. This emphasizes still another paradox.
Many of these laboratories were wired for the 1920's. They have not
been rehabilitated to undertake the experiments that reflect the tremendous changes in technology that have occurred in the last forty
years. We might just as well ask the Ford Motor Company to go back
to its Model T days at the Highland Park plant as to expect the University to operate in the 1960's in the buildings and with the equipment that we now have. We face a most difficult task of trying to
build a budget which will be static in an expanding society.
Regent Power echoed the words of the President and said the
University is failing to foster the resources that mean national strength.
Regent Thurber said a great many young people who are highly
qualified to come to this University would now go out of state. They
are literally being forced away from the state to seek the higher education which they so desperately need. A greater inconsistency could
not be imagined.
Budget Prepara-  The Regents authorized the administrative officers to proceed with
tin: Authorized building a budget within expected revenues, as may be certified by the
Vice-President in charge of business and finance, on the general principles as outlined by the President.
Medical School:  A report from the Dean of the Medical School on development of
Curriculum AdjustmentsReported  adjustments within the school curriculum recently endorsed by the
Executive Committee and the Executive Faculty of the Medical School,
was accepted and placed on file. The Regents were highly pleased with




MAY MEETING, 1961

the report and complimented the Dean and his faculty upon their
good work.
On recommendation of the Director of the University Library,
Rolland Clifford Stewart, Assistant Director of the University Library,
was granted membership in the University Senate.
On recommendation of the Vice-President and Dean of Faculties
and of the Dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
the Department of Geology and the Department of Mineralogy were
combined into one department to be known as the Department of
Geology and Mineralogy. Professor Donald F. Eschman was appointed
Chairman of this department (p. 271).
The Regents approved A Uniform Honor System and Code of
Ethics for the Students of The University of Michigan Medical School,
a revision of an earlier statement (R.P., 1923-26, pp. 330-31), as prepared by the students who comprise the Honor Council of the Medical
School and as approved by the Executive Committee and the Executive
Faculty of the Medical School. In accepting this publication the Regents congratulated the students who had written it.
A five-year projection of expenses and revenues of the Board in
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, as prepared by that Board in
answer to a request by the Regents (p. 215), was accepted and placed
on file. It was decided to invite Director H. O. Crisler to an early
meeting of the Board so that he might explain the tabulation of
expenses and revenues.
On recommendation of the Finance Committee, the Vice-President
in charge of business and finance was authorized to publish as parcels
for public bids the remaining area of land known formerly as the
University Botanical Gardens, the Regents reserving the right to
accept or reject any or all of the bids (p. 293).
On recommendation of Regent Murphy, seconded by Regent Power,
the Regents voted an honorary degree for Mrs. Eleanor Clay Ford, this
degree to be awarded at a time next fall which would be agreeable
to the recipient. It was also hoped that the occasion might be combined
with a convocation of the student body at the Dearborn Center.
The Regents sent the following telegram to Dr. Cyrus C. Sturgis
and to Dr. Frederick A. Coller:
The Regents of The University of Michigan, its alumni from the Traverse
City area, and the many friends from this community gathered to honor Dr.
Edwin Leeson Thirlby, send you greetings and best wishes.
HARLAN HATCHER, President, The University of Michigan
The Regents, by a rising vote, expressed to Regent Eugene B. Power
their thanks for his gracious hospitality, extended by him to the Regents
and to the University executive officers while they were holding their
meetings at the Park Place Hotel in Traverse City, May 18, 19, and
20, 1961.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
otherwise expressly stated.
The Regents adjourned to meet on June 16.

APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREES
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison and Erich A. Walter
Conferred May 12, 1961                      Voted February 17, 1961 (p. 224)
DOCTOR OF LAWS
FREDERIC GARRETT DONNER, Chairman of the Board of General Motors
Corporation. Frederic Donner's colleagues in the business world regard him as the
mirror of an industrial executive. His former professors, who have followed his
career with affectionate esteem, represent him as the mirror of a scholar and
humanist. His University takes this occasion to celebrate the diversity and happy
combination of his gifts.
As a student in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, he forecast
his later distinction by his diligence and by the precision and poise of his thought
and utterance. As he has risen in the executive hierarchy, he has exhibited a
secure and disciplined grasp of economic principles. His analyses of particular
problems have been both exact and imaginative, his decisions resourceful and just.
And all the while he has evinced a breadth of interest and a grace and modesty of
life such as are the traditional ornaments chiefly of philosophic leisure. Respectful
of his attainments and qualities, the University confers upon this worthy son the
degree Doctor of Laws.
ARNOLD JOSEPH TOYNBEE, historian. As those readers well know who
have followed the labyrinthine turnings of his great Study of History, Professor
Toynbee's knowledge of the human past is remarkable alike for breadth and for
particularity. And from his several careers in journalism, public service, and the
scholarly survey of contemporary affairs-each sufficient to sustain an eminent
reputation —he has gained as full and versatile an acquaintance with the present as
with the past. Still more impressive than the diversity of his knowledge are the
poise and authority of his mind. A modern in his painstaking attention to detail,
he is, in his confidence that history is a moral and philosophic science, heir to the
Hellenic wisdom in which he was early steeped; he is the principal exemplar in our
time of the poet-historian who sees through the sequence of events to unalterable
obligation and universal law. Upon this greatly gifted man, the University is proud
to confer the degree Doctor of Laws.
REGENTS' CITATIONS OF HONOR
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison and Erich A. Walter
Conferred May 12, 1961                       Voted January 20, 1961 (p. 206)
CHARLES ELLIOT FRAZER CLARK, Principal of Mumford High School,
Detroit. From the time he earned the A.B. degree in 1914, he has devoted his
energies to three fields of activity, to teaching, to counseling students, and to the
military service of his country. He began his teaching career in Detroit in 1915,
interrupted it for military service, and returned to it as head of the Department of
Social Science in the Cass Technical High School, an assignment in school administration which led to a series of high school principalships in which he exerted the
qualities of leadership that are reflected in the life and character of the thousands
of students whom he has counseled. His military career began in 1917, when he
entered the American Field Service with the French Army and then enlisted as a
private in the United States Army. He rose quickly to a captaincy and then became
Aide de Camp to Major General C. S. Farnsworth, Chief of Infantry, United States
Army. After serving in the United States Reserves, he returned to active service in
World War II, retiring in 1952 as a Colonel. He is the recipient of many military
decorations, including the Croix de Guerre from France and from Belgium, the
American Victory Medal with eleven battle stars, and the Foreign Legion Medal.
Today, as in 1917, C. E. Frazer Clark again is concerned in offering his help
abroad. This time to foreign students, and particularly those from France, living
in the United States on exchange programs. In 1958, in recognition of this contribution, he was decorated by the French government and awarded the Legion of
Honor.
The Regents of The University of Michigan present their Citation of Honor to
C. E. Frazer Clark and extend to him their felicitations.

of Honor


JAMES FREDERICK LAWTON, A.B., 1911, song writer, insurance agent,
friend of boys in trouble, known by Michigan alumni everywhere as "Mr. Michigan." Among the many songs he wrote for Michigan Union operas, he titled one
"My Dear," and dedicated it to Miss Marjorie C. Newton, a fellow student he
married in 1912. Fifty years ago, in 1911, he and Earl V. Moore wrote "Varsity";
in 1959 at the Honors Convocation, their "Voices of Michigan" had its first performance. His love of writing verse is also reflected in his home-town newspaper,
in periodicals, and in the volume, published in 1959, Roses That Bloomed in the
Snow. Fred Lawton played end for Fielding H. Yost, whom he idolized, about
whom he developed the "imitations" that now are famous, and for whom in 1947
he wrote the biographical account Hurry Up Yost in Story and Song. His service
record as juvenile court probation officer in Detroit and his wide participation in
the Boy Scout programs show to the full his understanding and his love of his
fellow man. The remarkable success he achieved in his work with the Connecticut
Mutual Life Insurance Company made it possible for him to retire after only
twenty-five years of active duty and to give more of himself to his town of
Berkley, Michigan, and to his University. When Fred Lawton became an alumnus
he said, "A student should feel himself enrolled in the University for life," a
judgment he has himself put to most persuasive proof.
The Regents of The University of Michigan salute this loyal son and proudly
tender him their Citation of Honor.
Conferred May 18, 1961                        Voted April 21, 1961 (p. 295)
EDWIN    LEESON   THIRLBY, M.D., 1903, devoted physician, exemplary
citizen, faithful alumnus of The University of Michigan, now enjoys an affection
and esteem which are the fitting meed of a well-spent life. During the nearly sixty
years since he earned his medical degree, Dr. Thirlby has remained in general
practice. It was as "Michigan's Foremost Family Physician" that his colleagues in
the Michigan State Medical Society appropriately honored him last year. He has
nevertheless continued to apprise himself of even the most highly specialized medical advances, serving as a model and example of steady professional growth. For
over thirty-five years he has been a principal sponsor of postgraduate medical
education in the Traverse City area. In the meanwhile he has somehow found
time also for a civic career as mayor of Traverse City and as a founder of its
Chamber of Commerce. In 1933 the community named him Citizen of the Year.
The University of Michigan, being appreciative of his loyal sentiments toward her,
respectful of his personal and professional attainments, and proud of having given
an early impetus to so fruitful a career, happily tenders him a Regents' Citation
of Honor.

Honorary Degree


WHEREAS, The many gifts which Robert R. McMath has presented to the
University have added great stature and genuine character to the University's program in astronomy; and
WHEREAS, Robert R. McMath, the amateur astronomer of the early thirties
was eclipsed by the professional astronomer and authority of today who has

WHEREAS, This Association has been responsible for the building of the
National Observatory at Kitt Peak near Tucson, Arizona; now therefore
Be It Resolved, That the Regents of The University of Michigan extend to
Dr. McMath their profound gratitude and wish him continued success in his latest
undertaking.
The following resolution commending the University of Michigan
Symphony Band, its Director, William D. Revelli, and its Assistant
Director, George Cavender, was adopted (pp. 229 and 169):
It is with both pleasure and pride that the Regents of The University of
Michigan extend congratulations to the University's Symphony Band upon its
return from a fourteen-week tour of the Soviet Union, the Middle East, and other
European nations.
We are pleased and proud to learn that the United States State Department has
called the band's extended tour "the most successful cultural program that we have
ever sponsored."
As one State Department official has written: "Never before have we received
such glowing reports from our posts on members of another touring company. Our
people in the field were all surprised by the professionalism of your concerts, and
this was gain enough; but the way you conducted yourselves, the excellent impression that you made upon the nationals of many countries you visited, was a
source of very special gratification. Every single member should indeed be proud
of this accomplishment, and I hope that every one of you realizes our deep
appreciation."
The Regents wish to convey their gratitude to the members of the Symphony
Band, to their parents, to Director William D. Revelli and Assistant Director
George Cavender, and the many others who made possible such a successful tour.
We rejoice in their magnificent achievement.
The Secretary read a letter from Mrs. Eleanor Clay Ford declining
the invitation to her to receive an honorary degree (p. 319).
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the Regents
of The University of Michigan for the month of April, 1961, totaled
$521.84.
The Regents adjourned to meet July 28. They accepted Regent
Matthaei's invitation to hold their meeting at "Radrick."

APPENDIX A


HONORARY DEGREES, JUNE 1961
DOCTOR OF LAWS
MARCOLINO GOMES CANDAU, Director-General of the World Health
Organization. In these times, when rapidly contracting communications seem almost daily to increase the number of hostile collisions
among men, the ministry of Dr. Candau is a heartening testimony to
the potentiality for good in close human interdependence. Under his
leadership the nations of the world, new and old, have notably extended and diversified their collaboration in the health sciences. Most
recently, he has helped to stem the deterioration of health and medical
services occasioned in the Congo by sudden political change: calling
upon his superior administrative gifts, his almost legendary charm, and
his extraordinary personal reserves of poise and courage, he won
general acceptance for himself and his staff in a land rife with
animosities. This achievement, differing from his daily accomplishments only in its heightened dramatic quality, fittingly represents the
public life of the wise and good man upon whom the University now
confers the degree Doctor of Laws.
EDWARD R. MURROW, newscaster and public servant. It is inevitable
that a man whose daily work is the dissemination of news, yet whose
sense of values is stabler and saner than the popular consensus, should
himself want to influence public policy at times; and, if he possesses
the abilities and the sound judgment of an Edward R. Murrow, it is
right and fitting that he should do so. Distinguished for his taste and
acumen as a newscaster, designer of some of the most vivid and pertinent documentary programs ever to appear on the medium of television, Mr. Murrow has steadfastly espoused the cause of moderation
and restraint against excesses of whatever hue. To the duties which
he has lately assumed as Director of the United States Information
Agency, he brings both a necessary subtlety and a welcome candor.
In conferring upon him the degree Doctor of Laws, the University
expresses its admiration for his past accomplishments and its grateful
anticipation of distinguished public service yet to come.
DOCTOR OF LITERATURE
ELMER RICE, playwright, director of plays, and novelist. We honor this
literary artist as well for his humane convictions as for the skill with
which he has given them substance. He has, in the Jeffersonian phrase,
sworn eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of
man. His love of his craft has nevertheless preserved him from literary
preachment. In his narrative and dramatic fictions, he has called into
being accents and images vividly responsive to those of life. To the
plays which he has directed, he has given much of the freshness of
his own invention. Prolific to a marvel in a number of fields, he has
continued to experiment freely and fruitfully in each. Mr. Rice's remarkable personal balance and his unassuming grace have won him
the affectionate admiration of a wide acquaintance in both theatrical
circles and academic. The University of Michigan, which has lately
enjoyed the privilege of his association, expresses its esteem for him
as man and as artist in tendering him the degree Doctor of Literature.

JUNE MEETING, 1961


DOCTOR OF SCIENCE
JOHN MACHLIN BUCHANAN, biochemist, Master of Science of the
Class of 1939. It is a source of pride to the University that Professor
Buchanan received an initial impetus toward his scientific career
while a student here under the late Howard Bishop Lewis. Since leaving Ann Arbor, he has taught or undertaken research at Harvard
University, the University of Pennsylvania, the Medical Nobel Institute of Stockholm, and finally at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where he now heads the Division of Biochemistry. His
research on the biosynthesis of purines and on isolating and purifying
enzymes has won him international acclaim. His synthesis of the purine
nucleotides, in particular, was executed with that deftness and flair
which approximates the ablest scientific research to the practice of
the fine arts. Only second to these accomplishments have been his
generous and imaginative direction of students and junior associates,
and his wise supervision of biochemical studies at the institution
which he now serves. Upon this dedicated servant of science, the
University fittingly confers a Doctor of Science degree.
CLAUDE ELWOOD SHANNON, applied mathematician; B.S.E.(Math.),
1936, B.S.E.(E.E.), 1936. Two symbolic happenings in the academic
life of Claude Shannon were his graduation from this University with
baccalaureate degrees in both mathematics and electrical engineering,
and his graduation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
four years later with advanced degrees in the same disciplines. He
has brought mathematical ideas, new and old, to bear on problems of
analyzing, storing, and transmitting information, and has thereby
exercised a profound influence on modern electronics technology. His
master's thesis formalized procedures underlying the entire subsequent development of high-speed computers. In his later research at
the Bell Telephone Laboratories, he set down principles enabling the
quantitive analysis of any information susceptible of impersonal
record. The technological revolution to which Dr. Shannon has contributed is doing for labors of the mind what the first such revolution
did for human physical labor. Upon him, as scientist and as an agent
of momentous technical advance, we confer the degree Doctor of
Science.

JULY MEETING, 2002


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, July 18, 2002
The Regents convened at 1:40 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were Interim
President White and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Homing, Maynard, Newman, Taylor,
and White. Also present were Interim Provost Courant, Vice President Harper, Vice
President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President
Omenn, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow, Vice
President and Secretary Tedesco, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent McGowan was
absent, as was Vice President Ulaby.
President's Opening Remarks
Interim President White called the meeting to order. He welcomed the family of
Jim Gartenberg, '87: his wife, Jill Gartenberg, '89; their two children, Nicol and Jamie;
his mother, Lois; and a friend, Jill Posnick, '89.
Septeber 11 Memorial Scholarship Program. Interim President White noted
that Jill Gartenberg and her family represent the families of the 18 known alumni who
lost their lives during the September 11 terrorist attacks. He announced that to
remember and honor these alumni the University of Michigan is establishing a
scholarship program that will provide scholarship support for their children. Interim
President White commented that the eligible children will need to be admissible under
the conditions and procedures in effect at the time they apply, and that the scholarship
will cover full undergraduate tuition and fees in any undergraduate program at the
University for as long as the student maintains satisfactory progress toward his or her
degree. Both first-year college students and transfer students will be eligible. He noted
that the scholarship has been registered with the September 11 Scholarship Alliance and
that there are 11 known descendants of UM alumni victims.
Interim President White commented that Jim Gartenberg had served "with
tremendous enthusiasm, dedication, and effectiveness for 12 years as president of the
UM Alumni Club of New York," and that "he was a quality man in every way."
Interim President White expressed the hope that many of the eligible children will take
advantage of the opportunity provided by the scholarship.
He called on Jill Gartenberg, who commented that she was honored to be here.
She thanked Regents and others who had made it possible for her family to be present
on this occasion, as well as Interim President White for initiating the scholarship
program. She noted that as president of the UM Alumni Club of New York, her
husband had become the spokesperson for alumni in the New York area. She
commented that "My husband's dedication and commitment to the University of
Michigan was unparalleled. Since he's no longer with us, I feel it is only appropriate
that I become that spokesperson and that voice for the fellow alumni who we lost on
September 11th in the terrorist attacks. We thank you for reaching out to us and to the

July Meeting, 2002


future generation of Michigan. It gives us such a warm feeling knowing that the
Michigan family has truly extended themselves, and we're proud as ever to bleed maize
and blue. Thank you, and Go Blue."
Applause followed. Interim President White thanked staff who had help set up
this project and the Regents for their support of it.
Interim President White called on Regent White, who read the following
resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of zjichigan salute and express
their appreciation to Gilbert S. Omenn, executive vice president for
medical cfairs, as he completes his administrative duties July 31, 2002,
to focus full-time on scholarly pursuits.
Dr. Omenn has provided strong, efkective leadership fbr the
Universitv of Michigan Health System, which consistently ranks in the
top tier of the nation's hospitals, medical schools, and health plans.
Strongly committed to the ideal of integrated health care, academic
medicine, and education, Dr. Omenn maintained the Health System's
financial well-being during a challenging period in academic medicine.
He championed Michigan's expansion in the life sciences and
creation of the Lie Sciences Institute. Dr. Omenn launched programs to
expand biomedical research and centers for gene therapy and
organogenesis research and enhanced the iedical School's academic
core through faculty hiring and support, as well as initiatives such as the
Biological Sciences Scholars Program.  He broke ground for the
Biomedical Sciences Research Building and laid the foundation fbr
future capital projects, including the cardiovascular and depression
centers, new women's and children's hospitals, and additions to the
Kellogg Eye Center and ambulatory care services.  He has forged
partnerships to bring the University's world-class health care to
residents throughout the state and has been extensively and meaningfilly
engaged with the community. As chair of the Institute of Medicine panel
on quality oversight in federal health care, Dr. Omenn continues to make
significant contributions to our nation 's public health.
With respect and gratitude, the Regents commend Gilbert S.
Omen jfor his distinguished service as the University 's first executive
vice president for medical affairs and look forward to his continued
friendship and contributions as a scholar and adviser.
Regent White noted that "Gilbert Omenn is one of my best friends in the world,"
and expressed her personal thanks, as well as that of the Regents, for his service.
A round of applause followed. Executive Vice President Omenn commented that
"this is a very meaningful recognition of the five years we've been at this together." He
commented that he is proud to have been the first person to have filled this position, and
he said that the Health System has significantly advanced over the past five years. He
pointed out that there are significant challenges ahead, and he strongly endorses the


2




July Meeting, 2002


increased involvement of the Regents in Health System affairs that is likely to result
from the Board's new organizational structure. He thanked the Regents and executive
officers for their support.
Interim President White noted that Executive Vice President Omenn and Regent
White share the distinction of having served as White House Fellows.
He called on Regent Brandon, who read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents qf the University of Michigan commend and express
their deep appreciation to B. Joseph White, the Wilbur K. Pierpont
Collegiate Prof ssor of Leadership in Management Education, as he
completes his term as interim president July 31, 2002, and returns to the
School of Business Administration.
Dr. White, who dedicated his service to the eighteen University
alumni lost during the September 11 terrorist attacks, instilled confidence
while providing continuity.  He appointed talented interim leaders,
advanced the Life Sciences Initiative, defended the University's
commitment to diversity, and represented the University admirably, in
Lansing and nationally.
Interim President White brought the same dedication, integrity,
and personal warmth to the President's Office that marked his ten years
as dean of the School of Business Administration. In a short time, he
reached many members of our community-students, faculty, and
staf- with his sincerity and openness. He considered it a great privilege
to serve the people of the University of Michigan.
Together, Mary and Joe White hosted many ceremonial and
social events and enlivened our community with their graciousness and
hospitality.
With deep gratitude fbr their numerous contributions to the
University, particularly fobr the clear, confident leadership they provided
during a time of administrative transition, the Regents congratulate and
extend their best wishes to two of the University's most loyal and
distinguished citizens, Joe and Mary White.
A round of applause followed.
Interim President White responded that he and his wife, Mary, "both feel it's been
an extraordinary privilege to serve during this transition. We had a great love of the
University prior to this experience; we leave with an even greater love and equally, a
greater appreciation for our University. It's really a magnificent institution, comprised
of thousands and thousands of extraordinary, outstanding people." He pointed out that
the job has been a tremendous reward in itself and has been an experience he and Mary
would not have missed.
Interim President White called on Representative Christopher Kolb, who presented
Interim President White with a resolution from the Michigan House of Representatives
honoring his tenure as interim president. Representative Kolb noted that Interim


3




July Meeting, 2002


President White had accomplished the three goals he'd set forth upon assuming the
position: assuring that the University moved forward; that it would be left in the best
shape possible for the next president; and that his service would be dedicated to
Michigan alumni who perished on September 11. Representative Kolb observed that
Interim President White had done an outstanding job of representing the University to
the legislative leaders in Lansing and thanked him for his service on behalf of the entire
House of Representatives.
Interim President White thanked Representative Kolb for the resolution and for his
service.
Introductory Comments - 2002-2003 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow commented that maintaining the
University's financial health involves four sets of activities: effectively tracking and
managing financial performance; protecting and strengthening the balance sheet;
evaluating proposed operating budgets; and identifying long-term financial challenges
and developing alternative strategies.
Mr. Slottow further detailed the actions involved in carrying out each of these
activities. These include continuing to focus on financial controls and compliance;
continuing to gain benefits from administrative system investments; increasing the use
of web-based business procedures; continuing to focus on assets, including renewal of
the physical plant and aggressive management of financial assets; implementing cash
management best practices; and adhering to prudent debt management and aggressive
interest expense policies.
Eight key financial challenges for the future were emphasized: 1) meet the
continuing demand for new space while maintaining the quality of existing facilities
and infrastructure; 2) understand and make strategic information technology
investments; 3) respond to uncertainty and volatility in capital markets over time; 4)
cope with rising costs of employee health benefits, including retiree dependent benefits;
5) meet the growing demands of research administration and compliance in a more
complex regulatory environment; 6) maintain focus on environmental stewardship; 7)
maintain the ongoing focus on medium- and long-term community and regional
infrastructure planning; 8) deliver first-class patient care and research while maintaining
excellent financial health of the Hospitals and Health System.
Mr. Slottow concluded that the annual operating budget is only one indicator of
the University's financial condition and that the proposed budget is consistent with
maintaining the University's overall financial health.
Proposed Ann Arbor FY 2002-03 General Fund Operating Budget and Student
Tuition and Fee Rates
Interim Provost Courant commented that the proposed Ann Arbor FY 2002-03
General Fund Operating Budget has the full support of President Elect Coleman. He
noted that the total current funds budget for 2002-03 (General Fund, Designated Fund,
Auxiliary Activities Fund, and Expendable Restricted Fund) for all three campuses calls
for revenues of $3.959 billion and expenditures of $3.955 billion.


4




July Meeting, 2002


Interim Provost Courant described the budget building process and thanked
everyone involved in it. He noted that among Interim President White's goals when he
assumed his position were to maintain the University's momentum and continuity and
to assure that the University would be in the best possible health when a new president
was named. This budget, Interim Provost Courant noted, achieves those goals by
continuing momentum in the life sciences, in an improved undergraduate experience, in
information technology, and in the quality and strength of the institution in terms of
research and scholarship. It supports the infrastructure of physical capital, programs,
and outstanding faculty and staff that are requisites to providing a superb education.
The 2002-03 General Fund Ann Arbor Campus Operating Budget equals
$1,100,600,000.
Interim Provost Courant displayed a chart illustrating the percentage change in the
tuition increase compared with the percentage increase in state appropriation over time.
He noted that the proposed 7.9% tuition increase in undergraduate tuition equals $550
per year per student for a lower division LS&A student with in-state residency.
Interim Provost Courant noted that with many public institutions nation-wide
facing budget cuts, the University is grateful for the zero percent appropriations
increase being provided by the state, and he pointed out that the 7.9% tuition increase
being requested is within the 8.5% limit requested by the state. Compared with tuition
and fee increases both at other Big Ten universities and at other Michigan public
universities, the University is next to last in both categories. He said that the University
is unique in guaranteeing sufficient financial aid to cover the need of all resident
undergraduate students.
Interim Provost Courant gave examples of how the budget will sustain momentum
in the areas of continuing priority, which include the life sciences, undergraduate
initiatives, information technology, and maintaining the strength of the faculty through
a competitive faculty salary program and improved physical facilities.
Interim Provost Courant commented on the factors that continue to create
budgetary pressures. These include benefits costs, administrative information systems,
changes in the student mix or in the programs in which students enroll, insurance
premiums, physical infrastructure, and conservation and innovation. He described the
budget-building process, which every year requires the University to retain faculty and
staff, cover benefits increases, increase financial aid to cover tuition increases, cover
library acquisition cost increases, meet the year's special challenges, cover inflation on
the rest of the expenditures, and then fund new initiatives.
He noted that at least $10 million in cost reduction is incorporated into this budget
prior to undertaking new initiatives, and he provided specific examples, such as
requiring units to mount salary programs and cover inflationary cost increases with
budget increases of one percent or less; freezing searches for faculty and staff positions;
filling vacancies at the senior level with junior faculty instead; and not replacing
retiring staff.  He then presented the recommended General Fund budget of
$1,100,600,000 for FY 2003. Revenues include state appropriation of $363.6 million
(0.0% increase); tuition and fees of $593.5 million ($52.1 million increase); indirect
cost recovery of $131.8 million ($6.9 million increase); and other revenue of $11.8
million ($1.2 million decrease). Expenditures include $629.3 million for Schools and


5




July Meeting, 2002


Colleges ($41.7 million increase); $47.9 million for University academic units ($1.3
million increase); $7.8 million for research units ($0.2 million increase); $34.4 million
for academic program support ($6.5 million increase); $212.9 million for executive
officer and service units ($5.8 million increase); and $168.3 million for University
items ($2.2 million increase).  Detailed charts are included in the Regents
Communication.
Interim Provost Courant concluded that the budget was developed to articulate a
vision of the modem public research university and the roles it can play in the education
of undergraduates, the development of knowledge, service to society, and the
interactions among these activities.
Proposed Dearborn Campus FY 2002-03 General Fund Operating Budget and
Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Chancellor Little announced that the recommended tuition and fee increase for
University of Michigan-Dearborn undergraduate and graduate students is 8.5%. This
yields total revenues of $73,458,941 (an increase of $3,869,000). He expressed
gratitude to the governor for his continued commitment to higher education. He noted
that universities are very people-intensive and that the budget calls for a modest 3.5%
salary program, along with continuation of a program to increase compensation for
adjunct faculty. He also highlighted the need for the campus to be responsive to the
community it serves by offering programs of interest to that community. The current
budget incorporates these needs by providing funding for expansion in certain programs
that have experienced enrollment growth and curriculum balance. Chancellor Little
also commented that to ensure accessibility, the Dearborn Campus is committed to
increasing financial aid by an amount commensurate with the tuition and fee increase.
Proposed Flint Campus FY 2002-03 General Fund Operating Budget and Student
Tuition and Fee Rates
Chancellor Mestas noted that the Flint Campus operating budget was the result of
an open, consultative process. He expressed regret that as financial support from the
state diminishes, the burden on students increases, leading to the increasing
privatization of public education. He announced a proposed tuition and fee increase of
$425 for FY 2002-03. This would be mitigated by a 9.4% increase in financial aid, the
same percentage increase as tuition and fees. The proposed overall budget for the Flint
campus will be increased by $2,573,310, with the total going from $49,704,091 to
$52,277,401.
Chancellor Mestas observed that the Flint campus regrets it does not have
additional resources that could be used to reduce the financial burden on students.
However, the current budget enables the campus to provide a rich and supportive
academic environment; to enhance the competitiveness of faculty and staff
compensation; to maintain the campus's physical plant; and to fulfill its civic
responsibilities to the city of Flint and the region it serves.
Interim President White commented that he would be leaving the interim
presidency with a much enhanced view of the University of Michigan campuses at
Dearborn and Flint, and he praised the leadership provided by the chancellors.

July Meeting, 2002


Michigan Student Assembly (MSA) Financial Report
Vice President Harper noted that the staff of the Division of Student Affairs works
with the leadership of Michigan Student Assembly to insure that there is sound
financial management of the resources provided by student fees. She called attention to
the financial report included with the agenda, which highlights expenditures of MSA
fees as of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001.
2002-03 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MISA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
For the 2002-03 fiscal year, Vice President Harper commented that she is
supporting an increase of $1.00 in the fee assessment for MSA (from $5.69 per student
per term to $6.69 per student per term). This will allow MSA to improve its ability to
provide support to student organizations, allowing them to strengthen the leadership
capabilities across campus. The recommendation of $5.50 per student per term for
Student Legal Services and $1.50 per student per term for school and college
governments remains unchanged from the previous year.
2002-2003 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Harper presented the recommendation for a 4.8% increase ($5.65)
in the UHS fee, which will yield $124.15 per student per term. The additional funds
will cover inflation plus a variety of educational and preventive campus-wide
initiatives. She also introduced Dr. Robert Winfield, director of University Health
Service (UHS).
Proposed FY   2003 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers
Operating Budget
Executive Vice President Omenn referred to the operating budget assumptions
included in the Regents Communication.  They include a 4.1% growth in adult
discharges and a growth of nearly 8% in outpatient charges. The salary program
includes a 5.2% salary program for nursing staff and a 3.0% program for other staff.
The cost per adjusted case is expected to increase by only 2.2%, which indicates that
productivity gains have been achieved. The operating margin target is 2.0%.
Executive Vice President Omenn stated that the proposed FY 2003 budget of
$1,002,900,000 represents a 7.70 increase over the previous year and includes a
projected $21.2 million operating margin.
FY 2003 University of Michigan Department of Athletics Operating Budgets
Mr. William C. Martin, Donald R. Shepherd Director of Athletics, presented for
information the FY 2003 Department of Athletics operating budgets. He observed that
the Athletic Department aspires to be the best academically, ethically, athletically, and
financially. He pointed out that the fundamental financial principles which undergird
the Athletic Department are that it has historically been self-supporting; that it provides
adequate funding for all varsity sports to compete nationally, which results in
significant grant-in-aid costs; that it fully meets equity goals; and that it has historically
relied on limited commercialization.


7




July Meeting, 2002


Mr. Martin reported that due to a 7-game home football schedule in 2002 and
2003, there will be a projected operating surplus for the next two fiscal years, as each
extra home game adds $4 million to the budget. He announced that a deferred
maintenance fund will be established in FY 2003 with initial funding of $2.2 million.
In addition, the department has a relatively modest level of debt ($13 million), a $20
million endowment fund, and a $15 million quasi-endowment fund. For FY 2002 the
operating surplus of $5.5 million was $4.4 million over budget.
Mr. Martin then discussed the less favorable aspects of the department's financial
situation. These include the fact that $10 million to $40 million is required for facility
renewal, and there is a heavy reliance on football attendance and a seventh home game
in FY 2003 and FY 2004. In addition, the department's fundraising results lag those of
its peers, expenses within collegiate athletics overall continue to accelerate, and if there
are no changes in the status quo, it will be difficult to achieve a balanced budget in the
future.
With respect to fundraising, Mr. Martin pointed out that Michigan lags
significantly behind peer institutions, and it is crucial that this situation be improved.
The University also has the highest expenses for grant-in-aid among its peers. The first
priority for a capital campaign will be construction of an academic success center; the
goal is to have this project underway by this time next year. Additional capital
campaign priorities include a new fieldhouse, new baseball and softball stadiums, a
basketball and wrestling practice facility, and Crisler Arena infrastructure
improvements.
Mr. Martin noted that the Fiscal Year 2003 budget of $56,059,000 includes an
operating surplus of $1,825,000. He reviewed facilities needs and projected operating
results for the next few years, noting that the lack of stable funding sources make it
difficult to make such projections. Financial challenges include no projected surpluses
beyond FY 2004 and the need for significant investment in the physical plant. The
latter will require continuing development efforts and continuing exploration of revenue
generating opportunities, such as voluntary seat donations, enclosed seating in
Michigan Stadium, and expanded sponsorship.  Regarding revenue generating
opportunities, Mr. Martin observed that fan surveys had argued against mandatory
licenses.
In conclusion, Mr. Martin stated that within the next several months, the
department would be developing a strategic plan that will create a stabilized annual
budget model and provides for continuous facility renewal or replacement. The
department's overall work plan also calls for developing a response to the operating
challenge created by the return to a 6-game home football schedule in FY 2005, raising
a scholarship endowment of between $120 and $200 million, and raising between $150
and $300 million for facilities.
Observing that no one had signed up to speak at Public Comments about budget
issues, Interim President White suggested voting on the budget items at this time.
2002-2003 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
Regent Deitch moved approval of the FY 2002-2003 revenue and expenditure
operating budgets; Regent Homing seconded the motion. Regent Newman thanked


8




July Meeting, 2002


everyone who had worked so hard at putting the budget together, but stated she would
be voting against it, due to her belief that it is important to keep each campus
affordable. Although the proposed tuition increase may be the lowest in the state in
percentage terms, the University is also starting from the highest base tuition rate. "We
have to do better for our students," she commented. "We can't make access to the
institution over cost an issue."  Therefore she urged administrators to make even
tougher choices in an effort to keep tuition down.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved on a vote of six to one,
with Regent Newman opposed.

Regents Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate the
Compulsive Lyres for winning first place in the 2002 International
Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, held Sunday, Ail 28, at
Lincoln Center in New York City.
A choral form of singing without musical ac companiment, a
cappella is one of the most popular artfobrms on college campuses today.
The Compulsive Lvres' national title - and their subsequent televised
perfrgmance on The Today Show - underscores Michigan's distinction
as an a cappella epicenter.
The Regents also applaud the Lyres' music director, Mark
Surprenant, who won top honors at the compeition bto r musical
arrangement, and Jesse Nager, who won the best soloist prize. Made up
of sixteen men and women, freshmen to seniors of all majors, the
Compulsive Lyres are a driving fbrce for a cappella activity on campus.
This fill, they will host the second annual Michigan A Cappella Festival,
a sellout showcase for the University's many talented groups.
The Regents salute the Compulsive Lyres for their vocal
accomplishmzents, for bringing distinction to their school, and fbr
enriching the artistic life of the University of Michigan.

he is "honored by this exciting challenge and especially thrilled about the core faculty
group" that has been assembled. He thanked President Coleman for her "extraordinary
support," both for him and for the core faculty group. A round of applause followed.
College of Engineering Presentation
Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow commented that three College of
Engineering projects would be presented for the first step of formal approval in October
involving project approval and appointment of architects. He noted that construction
will not be initiated until funding is in hand.
Interim Provost Courant noted that the College of Engineering is the second
largest college in the University and has the second largest volume of sponsored
research. He also pointed out that the college collaborates with the other schools and


42




Septe 1ber Meeting, 2002


colleges and across the full spectrum of activities at the University. He called on
Stephen Director, dean of the College of Engineering.
Dean Director commented that the College of Engineering has rigorously pursued
excellence in both its educational and research activities over the past decade, and it has
solidified its position as one of the nation's finest colleges of engineering, with
undergraduate and graduate programs consistently being ranked among the top ten
nationally. He noted that the college has the third largest number of faculty (3 10) in the
University and the second largest research program. Its undergraduate enrollment is
nearly 4,800 students, and it has the University's largest graduate program, with nearly
one-third of all Ph.D.s being awarded to engineering students.
Dean Director noted that the demand for engineering degrees will continue to
grow for a number of reasons, including its burgeoning status as "the liberal arts degree
of the twenty-first century." Several years ago, he reported, the college began a
planning process to ensure that it would be in a position to seize the opportunities
created by the growth in demand for its programs, and the decision was made to focus
research and education efforts in three emerging areas:  computer science and
information technology, nanotechnology and Microsystems, and cellular and molecular
biotechnology. These areas were chosen because of their importance to society, their
strategic relevance to national needs, because they build on a foundation of already
established expertise, and because they mesh with the broader intellectual directions of
the University as a whole, such as the life sciences initiatives and the recommendations
of the President's Information Revolution Commission.
Dean Director observed that the college has been actively pursuing this plan
through faculty recruiting, restructuring of degree programs, and renovation of
facilities. It has also worked on developing concepts for the additional space necessary
for support of these activities, which has resulted in a proposal for three, tightly-linked,
capital projects: a new computer science and engineering building, a new building for
cellular and molecular biotechnology, and a renovated and expanded solid state
electronics laboratory. Dean Director noted that the three projects are interdependent;
as each is completed, it will create space for housing departments that need to be
vacated for construction of the other space.
Dean Director commented that when viewed in its entirety, the plan achieves
important benefits from physical adjacency of related activities. By creating space for
faculty and student groups to work together, synergies will be realized that cannot be
captured when groups in related areas are dispersed among multiple locations. The plan
also will result in greatly improved and modernized laboratory facilities that will allow
the pursuit of the next generation of engineering research in the three critical areas
highlighted by the college. The estimated cost of the capital improvement plan is $88
million, to be funded by a variety of sources within the College of Engineering,
including external gifts. He displayed a diagram of the proposed building and parking
sites for the new facilities and noted that a more detailed proposal will be presented for
approval at the October meeting. Interim CFO Slottow noted that care is being taken to
ensure that the facilities will fit into the overall master plan for the North Campus.
Regent McGowan asked what plans are being made with respect to parking. Mr.
Slottow noted that the net incremental parking need will be 50 additional spaces;


43




Septe 1ber Meeting, 2002


however, the overarching issue of parking will be addressed in conjunction with the
master plan. It was noted that the goal for completion of all three building projects is
2006.
With respect to Dean Director's statement that engineering degrees are the liberal
arts degrees of the twenty-first century, Regent Deitch asked if collaboration was
occurring with the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.  Dean Director
responded that there are a number of ongoing collaborations between the two colleges.
He also commented that the engineering degree is the most liberal in terms of breadth of
any of the degree programs, due to its technology, humanities, and social sciences
components. He pointed out that students increasingly are enrolling in engineering
degree programs to pursue a number of career opportunities in addition to engineering.
The college also needs to explore opportunities for technology literacy programs with
the College of LS&A.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the
special meeting of July 15, 2002, and the regular meeting of July 18, 2002.
Reports. Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow submitted reports of investment
and plant extension.
Interim Provost Courant submitted the Human Resources and Affirmative Action
Report.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Repor t.  Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established, July 1 - August 31, 2002. He announced that research expenditures in FY
2002 were the highest on record, both in terms of total expenditures and percentage of
increase over previous years. Vice President Ulaby noted that the research funding
allows the University to have first-rate facilities and attract top-notch graduate students
and faculty, and this combination of factors allows for the creation of new knowledge
and new discoveries. He highlighted the areas of endeavor that received the largest
awards:  funding from the Highway Safety Administration to the University of
Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) for the development of intelligent
vehicle systems ($27 million); funding from the National Science Foundation to the
physics department in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts for development
of laser technology; funding from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation
for proteomics and bioinformatics ($24 million); funding from the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) for a number of projects, primarily in the Medical School, in lung disease,
genomics, brain tumor therapy, and other areas; and funding from NIH to the School of
Dentistry.
University of Michigan Health System. No additional report was submitted.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper noted that the Division of
Student Affairs is "off to an invigorating start of the new year," with 100% occupancy
in the residence halls. Staff are providing a wealth of experiences to new students to
help integrate them into the University. She thanked MSA president Sarah Boot and
her team for their leadership in these areas as well. Finally, Vice President Harper


44




Septe 1ber Meeting, 2002


called attention to the appointments of Edward Willis as dean of students and Stephanie
Pender-Amaker as associate dean of students.
Regent Maynard asked for an update on residence hall safety and security
initiatives that were undertaken in the spring. Vice President Harper responded that the
installation of new door locks and video monitors is expected to begin in mid-October.
It was noted that the time lag was due to the time-consuming bidding and ordering
processes and that a funding source had to be identified for the new systems. Vice
President Harper said that additional staff would be hired to shorten the installation time
for the new equipment.
Mr. Bill Bess, director of the Department of Public Safety, commented that an
implementation team had been working on residence hall safety and security issues
throughout the summer, and there will be changes in procedures in addition to
installation of new equipment. He noted that the housing security and police personnel
had been making extra patrols in the residence halls, which have already led to
significant reductions in criminal activity in the halls.
University y f Michigan-Deairbor.  Chancellor Little commented that the
Dearborn campus has a record number of students. Of the over 8,600 students, about
23% are graduate students. He described the accomplishments of Professor Sidney
Bolkosky, notably his Holocaust Archive Project and associated publications. He also
gave an update on the Greenways Initiative and noted that the details have been
finalized and implementation will soon get underway. Lastly, he noted that the
September 11 commemoration on the Dearborn campus, located in the midst of a
prominent Arab-American community, had been conducted in an extremely civil,
peaceful, and moving fashion.
University of MI cigan-flint. Chancellor Mestas called attention to a gift
included with the Report of Voluntary Support for August 2002 from the Frances
Frazier estate for the Frances A. Frazier Student Travel Fund at the University of
Michigan-Flint. He noted that Ms. Frazier had been a secretary on the Flint campus for
30 years. She had no children, husband, or other family and considered the students to
be her family. After she died, it was learned that she had left nearly her entire estate to
the University and had created a student travel fund. He reported that a flower garden
on the Flint campus was to be created in her memory.
Chancellor Mestas also noted that President Coleman had recently visited the Flint
campus and had been extremely well-received.
Michigan Studeat Assembly Report. MSA President Sarah Boot reported on
some of the activities of the Michigan Student Assembly since the beginning of the
school year, including the September 11 vigil, student organization funding allocations,
establishment of an on-line book exchange, and voter registration. Other on-going
work involves implementing recommendations of the GSI task force. She observed that
students are very excited to have President Coleman on board. She noted that MSA has
joined a coalition of other groups to advocate against the state-wide ballot initiative that
would result in the dissolution of the Michigan Merit Awards scholarship program.
Voluntary Support. Interim Vice President Wilbanks submitted reports of
voluntary support for July and August, 2002, as well as a year-end summary of


45




September Meeting, 2002


voluntary support for FY 2002. She commented that during the interim period that she
has been serving in the Office of Development, the focus has been primarily on
maintaining momentum. The message being stressed is that the work of development is
an every day activity, and this every day work provides an important opportunity to
continue to build capacity on campus so as to be prepared for the launch of a public
campaign in the future.
Interim Vice President Wilbanks noted that a volunteer convocation was currently
underway on campus to give volunteers an opportunity to meet President Coleman and
to become more involved and meaningfully engaged in the upcoming campaign.
She referred to graphs contained in a handout illustrating the current year-end gifts
total of $166,107,250, which is less than that of the previous year. Reasons for this
include the national economic situation, the events of September 11, and the transitional
year in the University's leadership. She pointed out that during the years of the last
campaign, average annual gifts totaled $118 million, as opposed to an average of $195
million per year since 1998. She also referred to graphs illustrating the growth in
giving by source; growth in number of donors; and new planned giving options that are
attracting donors, including bequests and charitable gift annuities. Finally, she reported
that the University of Michigan ranked 17th overall and 7th among private institutions
in fundraising for 2000-01 and ranked first among public universities in terms of alumni
giving for the past two years.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for 5 retiring
faculty members. She highlighted the retirement of Patricia Y. Gurin, the Nancy Cantor
Distinguished University Professor of Psychology and Women's Studies. Regent
McGowan observed that "Pat Gurin is one of the giants of the story of the University of
Michigan," as demonstrated by her repeat service as chair of the Department of
Psychology, service as interim dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
service on the last Presidential Search Advisory Committee, and her status as a person
whose research and commitment has been central to the University's defense of the
affirmative action lawsuits. She noted that scores of Professor Gurin's former graduate
students had returned to Ann Arbor for her retirement dinner to demonstrate their
enormous regard and affection for her.
Interim Provost Courant also commented on the impact that Professor Gurin has
had on his career at the University over the course of 30 years.
Duane F. Alwin, Ph.D., professor of sociology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, and senior research scientist in the Survey Research Center,
Institute for Social Research, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2002.


68




Septe 1ber Meeting, 2002


Professor Alwin earned his A.B. degree from Indiana University in 1966 and his
M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Wisconsin in 1970 and 1972,
respectively. Professor Alwin joined the University of Michigan faculty as associate
professor of sociology and associate research scientist in 1979. He was promoted to
professor of sociology and research scientist in 1985 and senior research scientist in
1997.
A highly respected teacher and scholar, Professor Alwin is known for his
methodological rigor, inventiveness, and wide-ranging intellectual interests, as reflected
in the two books and more than one hundred articles and book chapters he has authored
or co-authored. He has served as a mentor to several cohorts of graduate students and
has played an active role in academic governance and administration in both the
Department of Sociology and the Institute for Social Research. His efforts as associate
chair (1997-98) and chair (1998-2002) of the sociology department were instrumental in
revising the graduate curriculum and guiding the department through a major period of
organizational change. At the Institute for Social Research, Professor Alwin served as
the first director of the Survey Research Center's Summer Institute in Survey Research
Techniques in 1983 and remained in that position until 1996.
Professor Alwin has been a highly visible member of the sociology community.
He was elected to office in the American Sociological Association and the International
Sociological Association, and he has held visiting positions at the National Institute of
Mental Health and in institutions in Germany, England, and the Czech Republic.
Professor Alwin was awarded a Fulbright Research Fellowship in 1995 and a Fulbright
Lectureship in 1996, and he received an Excellence in Research Award from the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in 1998.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar, teacher, and colleague by
naming Duane F. Alwin professor emeritus of sociology and senior research scientist
emeritus.
Peter R. Gluck, Ph.D., professor of political science in the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on May
31, 2002.
Professor Gluck received his B.A. degree from Hobart College in 1964 and his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1966 and
1970, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty in 1972 as an
assistant professor of political science and was promoted to associate professor in 1975
and professor in 1982.
During his tenure Professor Gluck served in numerous leadership roles on the Flint
campus. He was director of the Metropolitan Research Consortium (1980-82), director
of the Master of Public Administration Program (1980-82), acting provost and vice
chancellor for academic affairs (1983-85), assistant to the chancellor (1985-89), director
of strategic planning (1987-89), interim director of the Department of Health Care in
the School of Health Sciences (1988-89), and chair of the Department of Political
Science (1979-82 and 1995-2001).
Professor Gluck' s main areas of interest are urban politics and public
administration. He worked closely with public programs and voluntary organizations in
the Flint and Genesee County areas to assess social and economic needs, monitor and
evaluate programs, and design new programs. He has published scholarly articles,
research monographs, and reports on human service delivery, crime prevention, and


69




Septe 1ber Meeting, 2002


public sector organizations. He has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to
high standards of public policy and policy implementation through his teaching,
research, scholarly conversations, and work in the community, especially in urban
areas.
The Regents now recognize this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Peter R. Gluck professor emeritus of political science.
Patricia Y. Gurin, Ph.D., Nancy Cantor Distinguished University Professor of
Psychology and Women's Studies and professor of psychology and women's studies in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; and faculty associate in the Research
Center for Group Dynamics in the Institute for Social Research, retired from active
faculty status on August 31, 2002.
Professor Gurin received her B.S. degree from Northwestern University in 1954,
her M.S.W. degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1958, and her Ph.D. degree from
the University of Michigan in 1964. She joined the University of Michigan faculty in
1966 as a lecturer and was promoted to assistant professor in 1967, associate professor in
1970, and professor in 1974. Professor Gurin served as interim dean of the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts from 1998-99 and chair of the Department of
Psychology from 1991-1998, and 1999-2002.
Professor Gurin's scholarship (reflected in her eight books and many articles) has
played a crucial role in defining and developing several important fields of inquiry
within psychology and at the intersection of psychology, women's studies, and ethnic
studies. These include the educational and occupational achievement of women and
African Americans, social identity theorizing and research, and psychological
antecedents of political behavior.  Her most recent contributions focus on the
achievement and political consequences of intergroup relations and social identities
within educational contexts.  Her development of a theoretical rationale for the
educational benefits of racial/ethnic diversity, and empirical analysis supporting this
rationale, played a pivotal role in the University's legal defense of its admission
policies.
Professor Gurin has mentored some of the most innovative and creative minds of
the next generation of scholars. An outstanding teacher, she has received the Amoco
Award for Outstanding Teaching and an Arthur F. Thurnau professorship. Within the
University, she played a major role in the development of the Women's Studies
Program and in the creation of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender.
Nationally, she served on numerous boards and committees, including the National
Commission for Working Women, the Rockefeller Foundation Advisory Committee on
Minority Single-Headed Households, and the American Institute for Research Board of
Directors where she has served as chair of the board since 1997.
The Regents now salute this distinguished psychologist by naming Patricia Y.
Gurin the Nancy Cantor Distinguished University Professor Emerita of Psychology and
Women's Studies and professor emerita of psychology and women's studies.

September Meeting, 2002


of Orthodontics at Lucknow University. In 1963 he went to West Virginia University,
where he was an instructor (1963-65) and assistant professor (1965-68). Dr. Nanda was
associate professor and director of the graduate clinic at the University of Pittsburgh
from 1968-74. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1974 as professor
of dentistry.
Dr. Nanda was an active participant in teaching and clinical activity in the
specialty of orthodontics. He served as interim chair of the department of orthodontics
from 1982-83, and from 1974-86 he also served as clinic director in the department. He
created three teaching manuals, published several journal articles related to craniofacial
growth as well as two textbooks, and presented several invited lectures during his
tenure. His professional memberships included the International Association of Dental
Research, the American Association of Orthodontics, the Great Lakes Society of
Orthodontics, and the Michigan Society of Orthodontics.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health sciences educator by naming
Surender K. Nanda professor emeritus of dentistry.
Victor J. Streeter, Ph.D., associate professor of management information systems
in the School of Management at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, retired from
active faculty status on August 31, 2002.
Professor Streeter earned his B.A. degree in Russian language and literature
(1961) and his M.A. (1962) and Ph.D. (1969) degrees in linguistics, all from the
University of Michigan. Professor Streeter joined the University of Michigan-Dearborn
faculty as an instructor in 1964. He was promoted to lecturer in 1965, assistant
professor in 1969, and associate professor in 1973.
Professor Streeter served as the first director of computing services for the
Dearborn campus, and he also served as chair of the Department of Information
Systems, Decision Sciences, and Operations Management.    Professor Streeter
developed and taught approximately a dozen courses in information systems and
additional courses in decision sciences and linguistics.
As a faculty member and administrator, Professor Streeter played a pivotal role in
the growth and development of the School of Management.      The School of
Management and the University have tremendously benefited from his expertise, and
his influence will continue to be felt in the years to come. Professor Streeter will be
remembered by hundreds of his students, to whom he was always an intellectual
inspiration.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming Victor J. Streeter associate professor emeritus of management
information systems.
Meemorials. Vice President Tedesco submitted memorial statements for four
active faculty members.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the sudden death on August 13, 2002, of Linda E. Fisher, associate professor of
biology and microbiology and chair of the biology discipline in the Department of
Natural Sciences, University of Michigan-Dearborn.
A native of Kansas, Professor Fisher earned her B.S. degree in 1969 and her Ph.D.
degree in 1974, both from the University of Kansas. She was a postdoctoral fellow at
the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in New Jersey and at the Pennsylvania State


71




September Meeting, 2002


University College of Medicine before joining the UM-Dearborn faculty in 1978 as
assistant professor of biology. She was promoted to associate professor with tenure in
1984. She also served in visiting positions at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
in Memphis and Spelman College in Atlanta.
Professor Fisher's teaching and research activities focused on virology and
microbiology with special interest in emerging infectious diseases, including measles,
West Nile virus, and HIV. She was one of the founders of the B.S. degree program in
microbiology at the Dearborn campus and served as advisor for and director of that
program, which has graduated 150 students since 1979. In addition to her teaching and
research, she was advisor to the biological students' honor society, Beta Beta Beta, and
volunteered several summers as an instructor in Labcoats and Microscopes, a program
designed to introduce girls to the world of science.
Professor Fisher was active in the American Society for Microbiology at both the
state and national levels. In 2001, she received a two-year appointment in the Waksman
Foundation for Microbiology lecturers program. She lectured widely to professional
groups on ways to improve science teaching at the secondary and college levels, and on
how to encourage women and minorities to pursue careers in science. Professor Fisher
was also a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. She served on numerous
campus committees, including the Chancellor Search Committee in 1999-2000, the
College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters executive committee, the Faculty Senate, the
Disability Resources Advisory Committee and a diversity taskforce. For her efforts on
behalf of women's issues on campus and in the community, Professor Fisher was
awarded the UM-Dearborn Susan B. Anthony Award in 1988. She also was recognized
for her mentoring activities by an award from the Detroit Chapter of the Association for
Women in Science.
As we mourn the loss of this valued colleague, our sincere condolences go to her
husband, Louis, and her son, Jason.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death on July 28, 2002, of Anna Regula Herzog, senior research scientist at the
Survey Research Center of the Institute for Social Research and at the Institute for
Gerontology, and adjunct professor in the Department of Psychology.
Born in Zurich, Switzerland, in  1941, Professor Herzog received her
undergraduate education at the Swiss Technical University. She taught elementary
school and worked at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology before coming to Ann
Arbor in 1972. She received her Ph.D. degree in psychology from the University of
Michigan in 1976, at which time she joined the Survey Research Center as an assistant
research scientist.
Professor Herzog was recognized as the leading expert on the application of
survey research methods to the study of older populations. She introduced the notion of
productive aging to a field focused on decline and dependence in late life. She
highlighted the positive and modifiable aspects of aging such as productive activities,
exercises to prevent urinary incontinence, and volunteering. She played a pioneering
and vital role in the Health and Retirement Study, which was launched in 1990 and for
which she served as co-principal investigator. This longitudinal study of more than
25,000 Americans over 50 years of age is the largest social science project funded by
the National Institute on Aging and is expected to be used by generations of researchers
and policymakers to understand and improve the lives of older people. She published


72




September Meeting, 2002


more than 100 papers in some of the most prominent social science and medical
journals. She is remembered by colleagues and students for her integrity, judgment,
and collegiality, as well as for her intellectual accomplishments.
Dr. Herzog was a respected teacher and mentor. She taught by example, by
accepting and giving criticism productively, and by reminding students of the
theoretical underpinnings of their research.  She maintained  long-standing
collaborations with researchers from a range of disciplines. She served on numerous
editorial and advisory boards and was a Fellow of the Gerontological Society of
America. Her accomplishments and contributions were recognized by the University of
Michigan when it honored her with the Distinguished Scientist Award this year.
Through the continuation of the research projects that yield essential information
about the health and well-being of the elderly population to which she contributed so
much, through the worldwide use of data from those studies by policy-makers and
scholars, and through the careers of those she taught and mentored, Dr. Herzog's legacy
is assured. As we mourn the loss of this distinguished scientist and teacher, we also
extend our condolences to her husband, Michael Sivak; her children, David and Andrea;
her mother, Nora Herzog; her sister, Eva Wagner; and her brother, Hans Peter Herzog.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Vincent Massey, the J. Lawrence Oncley Distinguished University
Professor of Biological Chemistry and professor of biological chemistry in the Medical
School. Professor Massey died in his sleep at the age of 75 on August 26, 2002.
One of the campus's most active and distinguished scientists, Professor Massey
was born in rural Australia to a family of fishermen and was the first person in his
family to attend college. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry at
the University of Sydney in 1947. There, he developed a passion for sailing and
classical music which continued all his life. During his time in Sydney, he met his wife,
Margot, a survivor of the Holocaust. They traveled to England, where Professor
Massey earned his Ph.D. degree at Cambridge University in 1953. After completing his
doctorate, Professor Massey started his work on flavoprotein research at Henry Ford
Hospital in Detroit and then moved to the University of Sheffield in England, where he
established his research laboratory. In 1963 he was recruited to the University of
Michigan as professor of biological chemistry.
Professor Massey was probably the world's foremost authority on the chemistry of
enzymes that use the vitamin riboflavin as a co-factor and he published more than 400
papers during his career. His accomplishments were recognized by election as a fellow
of the Royal Society of London in 1977 and membership in the U.S. National Academy
of Sciences in 1995. He was the University's Henry Russel Lecturer in 1995 and in
1999 won the Harden Medal and Jubilee Lecture of the Biochemical Society of London.
In further recognition of his important contributions, the Vincent Massey Endowed
Professorship is being developed through the Department of Biological Chemistry.
Professor Massey had a great zest for life and was beloved by his family,
colleagues, and friends. For his 70th birthday in 1996, more than 200 colleagues
gathered from all over the world to celebrate the occasion. His home was always a
center of hospitality, with visitors from every continent dropping in for a gourmet meal
or staying for a week or two.  An accomplished gardner, he developed a beautiful
garden from which many of his colleagues received cherished cuttings.

As we mourn the loss of this distinguished scientist, our condolences go to his
wife, Margot; his brother, Sonny; his children, Rachel, Charlotte, and Andrew; and four
grandchildren.
Uma Anand Pandit, M.D., associate professor of anesthesiology, died Friday, June
21, 2002, after battling pancreatic cancer for ten months. Uma was born September 15,
1942, in India, the daughter of Mrs. Indra Mohini Anand and the late Professor Vidya
Bhushan Anand. She graduated from Government Medical College, Patiala, India in
1964. She practiced as a pediatric surgeon at the Postgraduate Institute for Medical
Education and Research in Chandigarh, India for seven years. She married Dr. Sujit
Pandit in 1971 prior to immigrating to the United States in 1973. In the U.S. she pursued
additional training in anesthesiology at the University of Michigan, and dedicated the rest
of her life to the care of children undergoing surgery at C. S. Mott Children's Hospital as
an associate professor in the Department of (Pediatric) Anesthesiology.
Dr. Pandit joined the faculty of the Department of Anesthesiology as an instructor
in 1978 and rose through the ranks to become clinical associate professor in 1988. She
was chief of anesthesiology services at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in
Ann Arbor in 1980-81, but chose to relinquish this position to pursue an opportunity to
work with pediatric patients. Through her clinical research and publications, Dr. Pandit
made significant contributions to the existing knowledge in the field of pediatric
anesthesiology. Her field of research involved clinical investigations of pre-operative
medications, intra-operative management, and post-operative pain control in pediatric
patients. She was recognized as an outstanding teacher by generations of trainees in
pediatric anesthesiology. Dr. Pandit had been invited to present her research work at
international conferences in Italy, India, and Bangladesh.  As an expression of
appreciation and recognition of her contributions, the University of Michigan
Department of Anesthesiology has established the Pandit Lectureship, which will enrich
the teaching program in anesthesiology by bringing outstanding pediatric
anesthesiologists to the campus as an annual event.
Uma Anand Pandit was a loving daughter, sister, wife, and mother; a compassionate
physician, a revered colleague, and a respected teacher. She is survived by her husband,
Dr. Sujit K. Pandit, an emeritus professor of anesthesiology; and two daughters, Dr. Anita
Pandit (a family practice physician), and Anjali Pandit, (a sophomore at Emory
University). Uma Anand Pandit will be remembered by her family, friends, colleagues, and
co-workers as a kind, compassionate, person, an effective, efficient, and dedicated
physician, and an excellent teacher.

projections for the next ten years indicate growth in outpatient and inpatient activity


82




Septe 1ber Meeting, 2002


areas in the range of 5000 to 80%, with the largest growth occurring in invasive
procedures.
Program objectives for the CVC call for bringing together all of the disciplines
currently involved in this type of patient care, which will improve patient care while
enhancing teaching and training experiences and research. The vacated space in
various Health System facilities will be used to accommodate future growth.
Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield noted that the Cardiovascular Center
Project will be done in two phases: a clinical care facility (Phase I) and a research
facility (Phase II). He displayed a chart summarizing the components of the project and
noting the gross square feet to be allotted to by each component. Seventy-one percent
of the total space will be devoted to the patient care component, with clinical faculty
and support offices requiring 18%. Building support will require 6%, education
(classrooms and an auditorium) will use 3%, and building connectors will consume 2%
of the space.
A 400-space parking deck is incorporated into the project proposal. This will
replace the 250-space existing surface parking lot on the site of the new facility and
provide an additional 150 spaces, which exceeds the anticipated requirements for the
Cardiovascular Center. Opportunities for expanded parking capability will also be
examined during the architectural design phase of the project to coincide with
development of a long-term parking strategy for future Health System and University
requirements.
Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield displayed a photograph of the
proposed site, which is the site of the former University ("Old Main") Hospital, on the
corner of Observatory and Ann Streets. He also displayed a diagram of the facility
concept for the project, noting that the entrance would create a new gateway to the
medical center with high visibility and attractiveness. He noted that the total cost
estimate for the Cardiovascular Center Project is $196 million, comprised of $168
million for the clinical facility and moveable equipment, $16 million for the parking
facility, $2 million for demolition and roadway improvement costs, and $10 million for
the floor of the unfinished shell.
He noted that the proposed architectural firm of Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and
Abbott was selected on the basis of competitive bidding. Dr. Greenfield noted that the
Health System has worked with this firm previously, and that it had assisted with
programming for the project during the past year.
Regent Horning moved approval of the University of Michigan Hospitals and
Health Centers' Cardiovascular Center Project as described and authorization for
commissioning Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and Abbott for its design, with the proviso
that at the time of schematic design approval a revised budget would be provided to
accommodate additional parking capability if feasible. Regent White seconded the
motion.
Regent Newman asked whether the design would be driven by programming or
budget. Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield responded that the designing
would be primarily driven by the program, but that budget projections are believed to be
realistic and the project is expected to come in under budget. President Coleman


83




September Meeting, 2002


commented that she and Health System officials will be asking hard questions about the
budget and will ensure that it remains within reasonable constraints.
Interim CFO Slottow noted that the budget estimate does not include needed
utility infrastructure work because this will also benefit the rest of the medical center
and central campus. A separate project will be brought forth for a substation that will
support the CVC and the rest of the campus. Regent Newman said that she wants to
make it clear that the approvals for appointment of the architect imply that funding is in
place for the figures that have been presented. Interim CFO Slottow noted that the
budget does not include the substation, but does include an estimate for the necessary
known infrastructure and site work. He noted that the design firm will evaluate whether
additional parking can be accommodated in addition to the spaces that have already
been identified.
It was noted that the project is expected to be completed by 2006. Regent Deitch
commented that the sooner the facility is activated, the better. The vote was then taken,
and the motion was approved unanimously. Regent McGowan was absent for this and
the succeeding votes.
Creation of a Subsidiary Corporation to M-Care
Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield requested approval of creation of a
subsidiary corporation to M-Care devoted to Medicaid patients, as described in detail in
the Regents Communication. He noted that the state has determined that additional
federal funding could be obtained by providing local funds on the basis of taxation of
the revenue that comes into the M-Care organization.  This situation would be
disadvantageous if the taxation is spread across the entire M-Care organization.
However, separating the Medicare business into a separate corporation would generate
approximately $1.7 million in additional revenue.
Regent Homing moved approval to create a wholly owned, not for profit,
subsidiary corporation to M-Care to contract with the state of Michigan to provide
Medicaid services, and that the subsidiary be activated as needed for the Quality
Assurance Assessment program and remain in effect for the duration of the program.
Additionally, he moved that M-Care be authorized to provide startup funding for the
new corporation in the form of an equity transfer, up to an amount of $1.7 million.
Regent Taylor seconded the motion.
Regent Maynard commented that although she intended to vote in favor of the
proposal, she was troubled by it, due to the risks it creates. Interim Executive Vice
President Greenfield noted that the corporation would have a life only for the duration
of the availability of these funds. Should it prove not to have future relevance, it would
be dissolved.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved.
Change in Credit Load Structure at University of Michigan-Flint
On a motion by Regent Homing, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved a change in the credit-load structure for full-time undergraduate
students at the University of Michigan-Flint, as described in the Regents
Communication.

OCTOBER MEETING, 2002


The Univers.ity 'of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thurscday, October 1 7, 2002
The Regents convened at 1:50 p.m. in the Michigan Rooms, Harding Mott
University Center, on the campus of the University of Michigan-Flint. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Homing, Maynard, McGowan,
Newman, Taylor, and White. Also present were Interim Provost Courant, Interim
Executive Vice President Greenfield, Vice President Harper, Vice President and
General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Little, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President
Rudgers, Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow, Vice President and Secretary
Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She cited a number of noteworthy
faculty and staff accomplishments and recognition received by faculty and staff during the
past month, including the award of a MacArthur Foundation "Genius" grant to Associate
Professor Eric Mueggler. She noted that the Michigan Journalism Fellows Program has
been renamed the "Knight-Wallace Fellows at Michigan" program, in recognition of gifts
that have been received from the Knight Foundation and Mike Wallace. She also noted
that a National Poverty Research Center has been established at the University of
Michigan by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Finally, she reported
that the University had been named "Corporation of the Year" by the Michigan Minority
Business Development Council and that Louis Green, manager of the University's
Supplier Diversity Program, had received a "Corporate Champion Award" from the
Michigan Women's Business Council.
Appointment of Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs.
President Coleman announced her recommendation of Paul Courant as provost and
executive vice president for academic affairs. She noted that Professor Courant had
been a faculty member for nearly 30 years and that she had found him to be an excellent
person to work with in his role as interim provost.
Regent Deitch moved approval of the appointment of Paul Courant as provost and
executive vice president for academic affairs, effective October 1, 2002, to continue
through July 31, 2005, with a review following the second year of the term and possible
reappointment for a term of five years. Regent Brandon seconded the motion, and it
was approved unanimously. A round of applause followed.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Presentation and Discussion
Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow introduced Jack McCarthy, executive
partner, and Darrell Burks, overall engagement partner, for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
("PWC"). Mr. McCarthy named the employees from the firm who were responsible for
overseeing the various facets of the University's audit. He noted that George Johnson and
Company was a partner in the audit. He listed the audits that had been completed, which


87




October Meeting, 2002


include the University and its sub-units, the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, the
Hospitals and Health Centers, Veritas Insurance Corporation, and separate audits of the
Alumni Association, the William Davidson Institute, and the University Musical Society.
Reviews had also been conducted of the control environments for the Property
Disposition and Printing Services departments. Several other audits are in process,
including those for the Michigan Health Corporation and M-Care.
Mr. Burks described the four phases of the audit: "scoping" to focus the work on
areas management has identified; understanding the business risk and how it is
managed; evaluating how well the business is managed; and validating the assessment
to be satisfied that the audit conclusions can be supported. He reviewed the audit
approach in detail by noting some of the questions that are asked to gain an
understanding of the institution. He also noted the various processes and systems that
are reviewed to evaluate the internal control structure. The next step is to evaluate
information from a third-party environment, going outside of the University to gain
corroborating evidence to support the previous conclusions.
Mr. Burks summarized the audit results and noted that "No material misstatements
or illegal acts were noted." He also stated that "Our audits did not disclose any material
deficiencies in the University's internal control structure." He pointed out that the
financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2002, are reported on a consolidated
basis.
Mr. Burks reviewed the required communications between an auditor and its client
and noted the auditor's response to each. He stated that it was noteworthy that there
were no significant audit adjustments resulting from the audit.
Mr. Burks noted that PWC had identified "observations and recommendations" to
improve controls and reduce risk and have conveyed these to management. He reported
that comments presented last year regarding the University of Michigan Press have
been satisfactorily addressed. Due to turnover in management at the Office for Student
Publications, last year's comments regarding the Office of Student Publications are still
in the process of being addressed; therefore, progress will be evaluated in fiscal 2003.
Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow observed that the status of all observations
made by the auditors in FY 2002 will be brought to the Board for review within six
months time. He also noted that an area of focus planned for the FY 2002 audit that
was not done included an internal control review at the Hospitals and Health Centers.
Mr. Slottow noted that the audit included extensive review and testing of all
components of the Hospitals' revenue cycle with no material concerns. However, the
expense cycles had less focus due to staffing issues at PWC. He added that the internal
control review for the Hospitals and Health Centers would begin in the next several
weeks.
Finally, Mr. Burks commented on emerging issues, such as passage of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which will change drastically how audits are conducted in
the public environment. He noted that GASB is considering a requirement for
recording of the estimated present value of post-retirement benefits as a liability in
financial statements and that the University currently does disclose this information in
the footnotes to the financial statements. It was noted that current discussion is


88




"etober Meeting, 2002


focusing on whether there will be a requirement to fund some portion of post-retirement
benefits in conjunction with the requirement that it be accrued.
Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow commented that as adoption of these
requirements gets closer, there will be discussions with the Regents about how it will
affect both the audited financial statements and the University's financial situation.
Mr. Slottow called attention to the University of Michigan Financial Report for the
year ended June 30, 2002, which had been distributed at the meeting. Regent Deitch
commented that the book was "best in class."
Mr. Slottow introduced Cheryl Soper, University controller, and Russ Fleming,
manager of financial reporting and noted that they and their staffs are largely
responsible for the audit's outstanding results and unqualified opinion.
Annual Report of Investments
Mr. Slottow introduced Mr. Erik Lundberg, chief investment officer, who gave a
presentation on the University's investments for Fiscal Year 2002. He noted that the
University has $5.2 billion in investments, divided into four categories: Endowment
funds, University Investment Pool (working capital), Veritas (the University's insurance
company), and M-Care (health maintenance organization).
He noted that the endowment had grown from about $0.2 billion in 1983 to $3.4
billion in 2002, and that the University's $5.2 billion in financial assets consists of the
Long Term Portfolio (65%) and other investments (350 o). The strategic framework for
investment of the endowment, which was established by the Regents, includes
diversified investment management, a long-term horizon with equity orientation,
commitment to alternative assets, insulation of University operations from volatility
through a spending rate of 50o of the 3-year average market value of the endowment,
and total return investing.
Mr. Lundberg reviewed the asset allocation of the Long Term Portfolio and noted
that currently 770o is invested in marketable securities and 23% is in alternative assets.
He described the asset allocation, which consists of about 1/4 in fixed income
investments, 1/4 in alternative assets, 1/4 in domestic equities, and the remainder divided
among international equities and absolute return investments (with 1% in cash); and
also described the asset allocation within the alternative assets class. Finally, he
compared the allocation on June 30, 2002, with the model portfolio.
Mr. Lundberg noted that market returns in general were down for fiscal year 2002,
and compared the performance of the Long Term Portfolio with the one-year
benchmarks in each category. The returns for domestic equities, international equities,
and total marketable securities performed better than their respective benchmarks, while
fixed income and absolute return investments underperformed their benchmarks.
Compared with the benchmark for returns for the 3-year period ending June 30, 2002,
the Long Term Portfolio exceeded the benchmark in most categories and total
marketable securities returned 4.7% compared to the return rate for the benchmarks of
-1.0%. For the category of alternative assets, total alternative assets lost less than the
benchmark for one year and outperformed the marketable securities significantly from
inception to June 30, 2002 (24.1 % compared to 9.90 0 overall).


89




October Meeting, 2002


Finally, Mr. Lundberg displayed a chart illustrating the performance of the Long
Term Portfolio from a long-term perspective. This indicates a return of 10.8% over a
five-year period. During the same period, institutions in the top quartile returned more
than 8.4%, while the median during that time period was 6.5%.
He concluded by describing the University Investment Pool, which totals $1.5
billion and has virtually matched its benchmark in terms of performance for one year
(8.7%) and 3 years (7.8%). The outlook is for continued volatility in the markets with a
promise for increase in assets over the long term. The approach will be to pursue a
coherent and diversified investment strategy, focus on taking appropriate risks, maintain
a long-term perspective, and generate positive relative and absolute returns.
Regent Newman inquired as to whether the University has any risk in terms of
pension funding. President Coleman responded that the University has a defined
contribution plan which is held by another entity and has no obligation beyond these
contributions, the investment of which is the responsibility of individual employees.

Retirement Memoirs.      Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for four
retiring faculty members.
Donald W. Boys, Ph.D., associate professor of physics in the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on June
30, 2002.
Professor Boys obtained his B.S. degree from Case Institute of Technology (now
Case Western Reserve University) in 1962 and his Ph.D. degree from Iowa State
University in 1967. He joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty in 1967 as an
assistant professor and was promoted to associate professor in 1972. He also served as
acting chair (1970-71) and chair (1981-83 and 1989-92) of the physics department.
Professor Boys taught courses in introductory physics, electronic measurements,
medical physics, solid state physics, quantum mechanics, advanced mechanics, atomic
and nuclear physics, and advanced physics lab. He was responsible for introducing
computer-based instruction on the Flint campus. His early work includes electronics,
instrumentation, and medical applications, particularly those related to air ion
dosimetry. More recently, he worked with colleagues in psychology, mathematics, and
education to design novel teaching     approaches.    These interdisciplinary teams
developed inquiry-based science courses for elementary and middle school teachers,
funded by a grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education
(FIPSE).
Integrating his professional and teaching expertise, Professor Boys served as
advisor to the FIRST ("For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology")
Lego League and the FIRST Robotics teams in Flint. The Lego project involved
teachers, pre-service teachers, and middle school students with the goal of motivating
students to learn about engineering and programming. The FIRST Robotics teams
helped high school students and pre-service teachers gain a better understanding of how
teaching and learning can take place in an experimental and exciting environment.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physics educator for his dedicated
service by naming Donald W. Boys associate professor emeritus of physics.
Elizabeth A. Duell, Ph.D., assistant professor of dermatology in the Medical
School, retired from active faculty status on July 31, 2000.
Professor Duell received her B.S. degree from the University of Dayton in 1958
and her Ph.D. degree in biological chemistry from Case Western Reserve University in
1967. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as an instructor in 1970 and was
promoted to assistant professor in 1972.
Professor Duell's research focused on defining the normal control mechanisms in
the epidermis to determine what abnormalities occur in various diseases, such as
psoriasis. The goal was to provide specific, improved treatment of diseases of the skin.
Professor Duell initially investigated the second messenger systems in the epidermis;
more recently, she studied the metabolism of retinoid and vitamin D, the effects of UV


106




"etober Meeting, 2002


light on the antioxidant enzyme systems, and generation of free radicals on these
systems. Her research resulted in numerous publications, chapters in books, and
presentations at international meetings. She received the Taub Award for Psoriasis
Research in 1973.
Professor Duell taught undergraduate biochemistry courses and served on
departmental committees in biological chemistry and dermatology. She was active in
various faculty governance committees, served as an officer in the University of
Michigan chapter of Sigma Xi, and contributed to the Academic Women's Caucus.
Professor Duell participated on a number of thesis committees and was a research
advisor to students and resident physicians. She has been a role model for women in
science, a mentor for post-doctoral students, and a champion for the development of
individuals interested in careers in science.
The Regents salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming Elizabeth
A. Duell assistant professor emerita of dermatology.
Daniel G. Green, Ph.D., professor of physiological optics in the Medical School,
professor of electrical engineering and computer science and professor of biomedical
engineering in the College of Engineering, and professor of psychology in the College
of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on September 30,
2002.
Professor Green received his B.S.E.E. degree from the University of Illinois in
1959 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Northwestern University in 1961 and 1964,
respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor of
ophthalmology in 1966, and he received additional appointments as assistant professor
of electrical engineering in 1970 and associate professor of psychology in 1971.
Professor Green was promoted to associate professor of ophthalmology and associate
professor of electrical and computer engineering in 1971 and to professor of
physiological optics, professor of psychology, and professor of electrical and computer
engineering in 1976. In 1977, he was also appointed professor of biomedical engineering.
While still a postdoctoral student, Professor Green published a paper that laid the
foundation for three distinct areas of visual research: contrast sensitivity, optical
transfer function, and laser interference visual acuity, and he has continued to publish
regularly in these areas. More recently, Professor Green expanded his scientific focus
to include investigations of retinal adaptation and sensitivities, which is how light
captured by only a few photoreceptors can alter the response threshold and range of the
entire retina. His electrophysiological studies are critical to understanding how humans
see at night, during the day, and in very bright light. Professor Green is now using
transgenic mouse models to study physiological consequences of controlled mutations,
and he has been tenacious in his efforts to elucidate the mechanisms by which
photoreceptors undergo adaptation and affect vision.  Professor Green's unusual
background in neurophysiology, engineering, and optics has formed the basis for a
remarkably fruitful career that will provide further research opportunities for decades to
come.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Daniel G. Green
professor emeritus of physiological optics, professor emeritus of electrical engineering
and computer science, professor emeritus of biomedical engineering, and professor
emeritus of psychology.

"etober Meeting, 2002


Roger F. Meyer, M.D., professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences in the
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2002.
Dr. Meyer received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Michigan in
1961 and 1971, respectively, and his M.D. degree from The Ohio State University in
1965. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an instructor in 1971. In
1973-74 Dr. Meyer was a fellow in ocular microbiology and immunology at the
University of California at San Francisco and the following year he pursued advanced
training in corneal and external ocular disease at the University of Florida. He was
promoted to assistant professor in 1975, associate professor in 1978, and professor in
1983.
Dr. Meyer's search for improved methods of corneal transplants and longer-lasting
and safer cornea tissue preservation media was funded for almost 20 years by the
National Eye Institute.  His research into more efficacious treatment for corneal
diseases and ocular surface disorders has improved the quality of life and vision for
people who are plagued with pain and vision loss due to corneal injury, infection, and
cellular deterioration. Dr. Meyer's clinical acumen and personal warmth characterized
his interactions with residents, fellows, medical students, and clinicians. He has left a
significant trail of splendid practitioners who will treat their patients with the same
respect, compassion, and attention to detail exhibited by their mentor. His legacy will
continue as those who followed him into academic medicine pass along those traits to
yet another generation of physician-scientists.
Throughout his career, Dr. Meyer has consistently exemplified the attributes most
sought after in medical school faculty members: fine clinical judgment and an
unswerving commitment to his patients, high expectations for and careful training of his
students, and intellectual curiosity blended with steadfast execution in carrying out his
research.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Roger F.
Meyer professor emeritus of ophthalmology and visual sciences.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported to the Regents
this month. Regent Maynard called attention to the recent death of Eugene Feingold,
professor emeritus of health services management and policy, and she noted that he had
been active in public policy and public health issues, including having served on the
Tobacco Divestment Advisory Committee. It was noted that he also served on the
board of directors of M-Care.
Degrees. Provost Courant submitted for approval the August 2002 Doctoral
Degree List, final degree lists for the May and August 2002 commencements, and
changes to previously approved degree lists.
Approval of Consent Agenda On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by
Regent White, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.

NOVEMBER MEETING, 2002


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, November 14, 2002
The Regents convened at 2:10 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Taylor, and White.
Also present were Provost Courant, Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield, Vice
President Harper, Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Little,
Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow,
Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regents Deitch and Homing were absent.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She cited a number of noteworthy
faculty accomplishments, national recognition received by the University of Michigan
Health System and other units, and large grants received by University units during the
past month. She noted that the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching is
celebrating its 40th anniversary and was the first teaching center of its kind in the country.
President Coleman introduced two new staff members: Sue Gott, University
planner, and Deanna Mabry, assistant director-plant extension.
Annual Operating Request to the State, Ann Arbor Campus
Provost Courant presented an overview of the request to the state and of the
budgetary outlook for the coming fiscal year. He noted that the University has more
students and a larger research volume than ever before.  This reflects widespread
recognition that education and knowledge are the most productive investments available;
but just when it is most difficult to find resources necessary to sustain investment in
higher education, the payoff for those investments is highest.
Provost Courant noted that budgetary stringency does not change the University's
mission but changes its practices, accelerating the process of innovation by substitution
and slowing the rate at which faculty can be replaced. In addition, there is deferral of
some maintenance and curtailing of staff training and travel. Budgetary stringency also
places pressure on other revenue sources, including tuition.  He noted that the
University's obligation to be prudent stewards of its resources and to take the long-term
view causes it to continually reallocate funds from administration to its core academic
mission through cost savings.
He highlighted several examples where significant cost savings have been
achieved, including $7.5 million per year saved through reforms in the purchasing
system; nearly $6 million per year saved through energy conservation programs ($10
million per yearillll eventually be saved when all energy-saving programs are in
place); and a new prescription drug program that is predicted to save between $1-2


115




November Meeting, 2002


million per year. Numerous other small cost savings are being achieved throughout the
more than 2000 University units, which taken together add up to significant sums.
Provost Courant commented that should there be cuts in the state budget
allocation, a planning process is in place to reduce the rate of expenditures. However,
implementing those plans will cause reductions in what the University is able to
accomplish. He noted that the budget request reflects three possible scenarios. If this
were an "ordinary" year, an increase of 4% in state appropriation would be requested.
But as a practical matter, the University understands that an increase will not be
possible, so the amount being requested is the same as last year. This will mean that the
University will be less able to carry on as before without putting pressure on tuition.
However, he noted that plans are also in place to deal with the likelihood of a decrease
in the University's appropriation. The consequences would be increased pressure on
tuition and reduction in programs, in some combination.
Provost Courant observed that the University is grateful for K-12 and higher
education having been exempted from the budget cuts of the past year, which indicates
that legislative leaders recognize the value of higher education, especially during times
of weak economic conditions.   The economic returns to education and to the
development of new knowledge, he noted, are as high as they have ever been, and few
investments yield a higher private and social return, such as will be provided, for
example, by the investment in the Life Sciences Corridor. A flat or reduced state
appropriation, he observed, will lead to slowing of progress in undergraduate education
and increased pressure on tuition.
Annual Operating Request to the State, University of Michigan-Dearborn
Chancellor Little commented that preparation of the annual operating request
presents an opportunity for the campus to formulate and express its priorities and needs,
around which a budget can be built. Although an increase of about 2.5% is requested, the
campus recognizes that no increase is likely to be received, and plans are in place to deal
with that reality. Nevertheless, the expression of educational priorities is a valuable
exercise; all of these priorities involve undergraduate education. He noted that the
campus excels at providing undergraduate education to commuting students, and a lot of
planning is undertaken to make liberal arts oriented core education as effective as
possible. Half of the request is intended to enhance faculty resources required to carry out
the campus's mission; the other half is aimed at increasing institutional funding available
for student financial aid to keep education as affordable as possible.
Annual Operating Request to the State, University of Michigan-Flint
Chancellor Mestas commented that preparing the annual budget request presents a
difficult challenge of balancing the realities of decreasing resources, from the state and
from the limited amount by which tuition can be increased, with the increasing needs of
the campus.  These needs and expectations remain regardless of diminished state
resources. Thus, he observed, the challenge is to "give nothing less in terms of education
while receiving much less in terms of resources." In addition to maintaining the
University's educational mission, the Flint campus also must continue its responsibility to
the community it serves.


116




November Meeting, 2002


The current budget request attempts to minimize the impact of diminished
resources while leaving the campus in a position to resume its plans as soon as budget
pressures are eased. The campus's top priority is technology, because it impacts almost
every core function of the University, and because it is indispensable to achievement of
the campus's mission and goals. The remainder of the request is directed toward
maintaining and improving the quality of education. He noted that it is somewhat early
in the process to prepare a realistic budget that is adjusted to the resources it is assumed
will be available, while also considering the institution's needs.
Regent McGowan commented that Chancellor Mestas had done a good job in
expressing the campus's approach to the budget preparation process.
Annual Report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA)
Professor Charles Koopmann, Jr., chair of the Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs (SACUA), presented the committee's annual report. He noted that
during his tenure as chair, relationships with administration leaders have been excellent
and supportive. He reviewed the group's activities during the past year and noted that the
chairs of the CESF committees from each campus are planning to coordinate their annual
reports so as to make them easier to compare and evaluate.
Dr. Koopmann also described some of the projects SACUA is currently engaged
in. These include adoption of documents regarding faculty governance and tenure
guidelines, evaluation of the proposed new copyright policy and of Grievance Review
Board procedures, evaluation and monitoring of the new prescription drug benefit plan
and other benefits issues, and the Regents' Bylaws regarding the Advisory Board of
Intercollegiate Athletics, among other concerns.
He noted that SACUA is looking forward to continuing its positive relationship
with President Coleman and her administration, and to improving communications with
the Board of Regents.

November Meeting, 2002


CORRECTION TO
TERMINATION OF REGULAR INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF
O'Keefe, N. Thomas, resigned, Clinical Instructor in Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences,
August 31, 2002 (previously reported as retired)
Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for three
retiring faculty members.
Theresa Mary Allor, assistant professor of nursing in the School of Nursing,
retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2002.
Professor Allor obtained her B.S.N. degree from Mercy College in Detroit in 1968
and her M.P.H. degree from the University of Michigan in 1975. Between 1968 and
1978, she served in increasingly responsible roles as a public health nurse for the
Visiting Nurses Association of Metropolitan Detroit and the Oakland County Health
Department. She joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1978 as an assistant
professor.
As a public health nurse, Professor Allor originated the concept for Expectant
Adoptive Parent Classes.  She also developed the instruction course, piloted the
program, and taught a series of classes for the program.
One of Professor Allor's major concerns at the University has been developing
cultural diversity awareness among students. She has worked hard to integrate issues of
diversity into nursing courses and to help students explore their feelings about how
these issues influence the health care profession. In response to her students' ideas,
Professor Allor established a learning site at the Capuchin Soup Kitchen in Detroit so
that participants in the Community Health Nursing program could experience different
cultures of the various guests and gain an understanding of the relationship between
culture and health. She also worked with a group of students to produce "Listen to
Me," a forty-five minute cultural awareness video created with a grant from the Center
for Research on Learning and Teaching. This video is used in classes across campus to
help enlighten students and bring about open discussion on cultural diversity.
As a teacher in the undergraduate and RN studies programs, Professor Allor worked
hard to exemplify the characteristics of a successful caregiver. By fostering collaboration
among her classes, clinical groups, and the School of Nursing, Professor Allor helped
countless students provide quality care to their patients.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Theresa Mary Allor
assistant professor emerita of nursing.
William R. Anderson, Ph.D., professor of botany and curator of vascular plants in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on
August 31, 2002.
Professor Anderson received his B.S. degree from Duke University in 1964 and
his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1965 and 1971,
respectively. From 1971-74 he was associate curator at the New York Botanical
Garden. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1974 as assistant professor
and associate curator; he was promoted to associate professor in 1979 and professor and
curator in 1986. Professor Anderson also served as director of the Herbarium from
1986-99.
Professor Anderson's research on evolution within the family Malpighiaceae
yielded publications on floral morphology, breeding systems, phylogeny, and cytology,
as well as monographs of particular genera and floristic treatments. He has named and


129




November Meeting2 2002


described five genera and over 200 species new to science, and has been acclaimed as
contributor to and editor of the series "Flora Novo-Galiciana" by Rogers McVaugh,
which is the first authoritative study of vascular plants of western Mexico. As a curator
of vascular plants at the University, Professor Anderson oversaw the growth of the
collections of one of the major herbaria in the world. During his distinguished service
as director of the University Herbarium, he secured funding for a complete renovation
of the physical facility and oversaw the growth of endowment funds.
An engaging and enthusiastic lecturer, Professor Anderson taught a diverse array
of courses and supervised the doctoral dissertations of 16 graduate students. A botanist
of international renown and an expert on botanical nomenclature, Professor Anderson
was elected president of the American Society of Plant Taxonomists (1993-94). He
served on the Committee for Spermatophyta of the International Association for Plant
Taxonomy (1987-2001) and on the steering committee for the Species Plantarum
Project of the International Organization for Plant Information (1994-2000).
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming William R. Anderson
professor emeritus of botany and curator emeritus of vascular plants.
Larry S. Matthews, M.D., professor of orthopaedic surgery in the Medical
School, retired from active faculty status on October 8, 2002, following a most
productive career as a clinician, teacher and researcher.
Dr. Matthews received his A.B. and M.D. degrees from Harvard College in 1959
and 1963, respectively, and completed his internship at the University of Michigan in
1964. From 1964-66, he served in Vietnam as a captain in the United States Army.
Following his discharge from the military, he returned to the University of Michigan,
where he was a resident in orthopaedic surgery from 1966-70. From 1970-71, Dr.
Matthews served as a special research fellow with Dr. Carl Hirsch in biomechanics at
the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1971 as an instructor and was promoted to assistant professor in 1972,
associate professor in 1976, and professor in 1980.
Dr. Matthews' special area of interest is adult reconstruction and joint
replacement, and he has published over 85 articles and numerous chapters and abstracts
on this and other subjects in orthopaedic surgery. Early in his career, Dr. Matthews,
together with Dr. Herbert Kaufer, developed the spherocentric knee, an innovative knee
joint replacement that appeared on the cover of Scientific American in January 1978.
Dr. Matthews also served as head of the Section of Orthopaedic Surgery from 1986-95.
He was a co-founder of the Orthopaedic Research Laboratories in 1981 and served as
co-director of the laboratories with Dr. Steven Goldstein. Together, they brought the
lab to its present level as one of the premier orthopaedic research laboratories in the
United States.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated service
by naming Larry S. Matthews professor emeritus of orthopaedic surgery.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported to the Regents

Degrees. President Coleman submitted recommendations for approval of three
honorary degree recipients: Roy Hamlin Johnson, Carilloneur and composer for the
carillon (Doctor of Music); Philip Levine, poet (Doctor of Humane Letters); and Nellie
McKay (Doctor of Humane Letters).

131




November Meeting, 2002


that the department is working on a long-range plan that will integrate the functional
obsolescence of its facilities with plans for budgeting for and funding new and renovated
facilities.
Regent Brandon moved approval of the Athletic Department Football Stadium
Team Locker Room Expansion Project as described in the revised Regents
Communication and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding construction
contracts providing that bids are within the approved budget. Regent Maynard
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Mr. Martin observed that this project is being funded through private donations
from donors who would not otherwise contribute to the planned academic support
facility, which is the department's number one priority. He said that department
personnel will be touring academic support facilities around the country. Regent
Newman recommended that the tour also include an examination of the academic
support programs themselves, in addition to the physical facilities, and that the
programmatic aspect of the facility be included at the time it is brought forward for
consideration.
Purchasing Contract with Weadock Software, LLC
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Taylor, all six Regents present
unanimously approved a purchasing contract with Weadock Software, LLC. Because the
owner of Weadock Software, William Weadock, is also a University of Michigan
employee, this contract falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and its
Department of Radiology, and Weadock Software, LLC.
2.   The product to be provided is a software site license and upgrades, at a total cost of
$20,000.00.
3.   The pecuniary interest arises from the fact the William Weadock, a University of
Michigan employee, is primary owner of Weadock Software, LLC.

Research and Engineering (IM:R:E)
On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent White, all six Regents present
unanimously approved modification of an agreement between the University of Michigan
and the Institute for Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), for a project that
involves collaboration with Dr. Albert Yee at IMRE. Because Dr. Albert Yee is director
of IMRE and is also a University of Michigan faculty member on unpaid personal leave,
this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements.
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and IMRE.
2.   Prior to this modification, IMRE has approved funding of $165,770. It is anticipated
that the total performance period of this project will be from August 1, 2001 to July
31, 2004 at an estimated funding of $317,402. This modification is an addendum to a
current University negotiated agreement with IMRE.
3.   Dr. Yee's pecuniary interest arises from his position as director of IMRE.


132




November Meeting, 2002

Corporation
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent White, all six Regents present
unanimously approved research agreements between the University of Michigan and
IntraLase Corporation ("Company") for the purpose of providing additional funding for a
previously approved project. Because Ronald Kurtz and Tibor Juhasz are University of
Michigan employees and owners of the Company, this agreement falls under the State of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.  The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and IntraLase Corporation.
2.   The terms of the proposed agreements conform to University policy. The extended
period of performance for the project is two (2) years at an additional cost of $50,000
(mathematical models) and $40,000 (laser-tissue interaction) respectively. With this
additional funding, total funding for the Project will be $185,000. The University's
effort in this project will be directed by Dr. Matthew O'Donnell in the Department of
Bioengineering of the College of Engineering.
3.   Ronald Kurtz's and Tibor Juhasz's pecuniary interest arises from their ownership of
the Company.

unanimously approved the annual operating request to the state for the University of
Michigan-Flint Campus for FY 2004.
Copyright Ownership Policy
Provost Courant reviewed the history of development of the proposed copyright
ownership policy, noting that the initial Copyright Ownership Committee had been
formed two years ago. It was charged with reviewing the University's intellectual
property policies, specifically as they apply to ownership of copyrighted works in light of
recent changes in law and technology. He described the major features of the policy,
which sets the default presumption for works of this kind to individual ownership. It also
establishes that for work that is specifically commissioned, has to do with administration,
or involves unusual University resources, the University will retain ownership interest. It
also introduces the idea that individuals should not use copyrighted work to compete with
the University ("conflict of commitment").


133




November Meeting, 2002


On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved the proposed policy, "Ownership of Copyrighted Works Created
at or in Affiliation with the University of Michigan." (See Appendix B on page 137.)
Approval of Academic Calendars for Summer 2003; 2003-2004; 2004-2005; and
2005-2006 for the University of Michigan-Dearborn Campus

unanimously approved academic calendars for Summer 2003; 2003-2004; 2004-2005; and
2005-2006 for the University of Michigan-Dearborn Campus, as described in the Regents
Communication.
The meeting recessed for 35 minutes and reconvened at 4:00 p.m. for Public
Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Terrence T. Griffin, student, on the University's commitment to community;
Amer Zahr and Salah Dean Husseini, students, in favor of divestment from Israel; and
David Wolkinson, Richard Dorfman, Brad Sugar, Danny Aghion, and Rachel Roth,

NOVEMBER MEETING, 2002
APPENDIX B
OWNERSHIP OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS CREATED AT OR IN
AFFILIATION       WITHE   UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
Preamble
The University of Michigan's central mission is the creation, preservation, and dissemination of
knowledge through teaching, research, and public service. Changes in information technology
and copyright law require clarification of the rights and responsibilities that accrue from the
creation of works of authorship (hereinafter "works") (1) in the University context in order for
individuals who create, use, and disseminate intellectual property to fulfill their respective
functions in and outside the academy.
Copyright includes a bundle of rights-including rights to ownership, reproduction or copying,
preparation of derivative works, distribution, public display, and public performance. General
principles regarding this bundle of rights in the University context are set forth below. In
particular instances, written agreements may be necessary to modify the rights outlined below,
or to clarify the rights and responsibilities of interested parties to a greater level of specificity.
This policy applies to works produced by University faculty, staff, students, other members of
the University community, and contractors.
POLICY
Ownership principles and other interests applicable to general categories of works (based on the
context of the creation of works and the identity of their creators) are identified below (section
I). The policy also sets forth other relevant considerations involving use of the University's
name, seal, or marks (section II); administration and implementation (section III); and policy
interpretation and dispute resolution (section IV).
I.  Categories of Works
A. Faculty Works
1. Ownership Principles
Consistent with academic freedom and tradition, all faculty (2) (including full-time,
part-time, adjunct, and emeritus faculty) own and control instructional materials and
scholarly works created at their own initiative with usual University resources.
"Usual University resources" are those resources commonly provided or made
available to similarly situated faculty. They include, for example, ordinary use of
resources such as the libraries; one's office, computer and University computer
facilities; secretarial and administrative support staff; and supplies. For any given
department, unit, or individual, what constitutes a usual resource will depend upon
the functions and responsibilities of that department, unit, or individual. For
example, access to a chemistry laboratory may be a usual resource in chemistry, but
would probably be considered an unusual resource in English literature.
Examples of faculty-owned works created at faculty members' own initiative with
usual University resources may include, but are not limited to: lecture notes,
transparencies, case examples, textbooks, interactive textbooks, other works of
nonfiction or novels, software, CD-ROMs, articles, books, literary works, poems,
musical compositions, visual works of art, and other artistic creations regardless of
the media in which the works are produced or the forms of dissemination (e.g., print
or electronic).


138




November Meeting, 2002 - Appenudix B


2. University Community Interests
Even though individual faculty own the works described in (I)(A)(1) above, the
University community as a whole has interests in being able to use such works for
educational and administrative purposes, consistent with the University's
educational mission and academic norms. Faculty members should keep these
purposes in mind in creating and disseminating instructional materials and scholarly
works.
The University shall be permitted to use materials created for ordinary teaching use
in the classroom and in department programs (such as syllabi, assignments, and
tests) for administrative purposes, including satisfying requests of accreditation
agencies for faculty-authored syllabi and course descriptions.
Faculty members are encouraged to share their instructional materials and
courseware with their University colleagues for internal instructional, educational,
and administrative purposes. When publishing scholarly works, faculty creators are
encouraged to provide rights for use for the University community.
The University also has an interest in ensuring that works created by its own faculty
are not used to compete with or undermine the University's educational mission or
activities. Consistent with conflict of interest and commitment principles, faculty
with full-time appointments at the University should not use (or permit others to use)
their works in ways that compete with the University's courses, or its educational
programs or activities-unless prior written permission is obtained from the
appropriate dean, unit director, or executive officer, or their designee(s). This
provision applies to works developed for compensation at other educational
institutions, including for-profit and online institutions. It does not apply to works
created in conjunction with professional activities in conformance with University
norms such as, but not limited to: sharing syllabi or other course materials with
colleagues at other non-profit educational institutions; ordinary outside consulting;
participation in professional or scholarly organizations; scholarly presentations and
publications; pursuit of future employment opportunities; and public service.
B. Staff Works
1. Ownership Principles
Although the University owns works created by staff within the scope of their
employment duties or with unusual University resources (as discussed in section
I(C) below), the University does not claim ownership of works created by staff
members at their own initiative, outside the scope of their employment, and without
unusual University resources (e.g., scholarly or artistic works).
C. University Works
1. Ownership Principles
Consistent with its legal and fiduciary responsibilities, the University owns
particular works that are:
a.   created in whole or in part by faculty members, when creation of those works
is dependent upon the provision of unusual University resources as specially
authorized by University administrators such as deans, department chairs, unit
directors, or their designees. "Unusual University resources" are resources
such as financial, technical, personnel, or other forms of support beyond the
type or level of resources commonly provided to similarly situated faculty.
Unusual University resources may include, for example, an extraordinary
quantity or quality of media development, significant research assistance, or
access to or use of other special, limited University facilities or resources.


139




November Meeting, 2002 - Appenudix B


Pursuant to agreements with the creators, the University may decide to forego
or modify its rights to such works.
b.   created as a specific requirement of employment or pursuant to an assigned
institutional duty that may, for example, be included in a written job
description or an employment agreement so as to qualify as works made for
hire. Such works may include those whose creation is instigated or facilitated
by a unit of the University for the express purpose of making such works
available to individuals or entities other than, or in addition to, the creator(s)
for use in teaching, research, patient care, public information, or other
University activities.
The University does not, however, claim ownership of faculty-created
instructional materials or courseware merely because it requires faculty
members to teach courses as part of their regular responsibilities. The
University may claim ownership of certain instructional materials or
courseware, including online course materials, when the University has
specifically requested such materials and either invested unusual University
resources in them as described in (a) above, or specifically compensated
faculty-creators (e.g., with additional financial compensation, release time,
etc.) for the development of the materials.
Similarly, the University does not claim ownership of faculty-initiated
scholarly works based merely on general expectations that faculty members
will publish such works.
c.   created in the course of an administrative assignment (e.g., a report for a
university committee).
d.   created as part of sponsored projects, pursuant to the terms of the governing
contracts (see IF).
The University retains the rights to commercialize such works, as well as all other
rights under copyright law.
2. Faculty and Staff Interests
Even though the University owns the works described in (I)(C)(1) above, individual
faculty and staff may have interests in using them or receiving credit for their
participation in such works, particularly works which they created or to which they
contributed.
In the absence of contractual or other legal restrictions to the contrary, the
University  grants  faculty  non-exclusive  rights  to  use  and  distribute
University-owned works they created for non-commercial purposes. Accordingly,
faculty members who leave the University may continue to use at another nonprofit
institution or organization for teaching, research, and other non-commercial
purposes, all University-owned works they created.
Faculty creators of University-owned instructional materials who are still employed
by the University have the right of "first refusal" in making new versions. The
creators of University-owned instructional materials who have left the University
have the right to be consulted in good faith on reuse and revisions (e.g., for online
instructional materials or courseware). In order to protect academic integrity, the
creators may request that such works be withdrawn from use in University activities
if they become obsolete or are otherwise deemed inappropriate for further
educational use. Creators also have the right to have their names removed from such
works if they so desire.


140




November Meeting, 2002 - Appenudix B


In accordance with academic tradition and any applicable legal considerations, the
University will acknowledge creators and developers (including faculty, staff, and
students) who have made a substantial contribution to University-owned
works-unless those individuals request otherwise. For example, the members of a
University committee would ordinarily be acknowledged in a committee report.
Creators and developers of University-owned works shall not undermine the
University's efforts to commercialize those works.
Creators and developers of University-owned works may, however, share in the
revenues in appropriate circumstances pursuant to written agreements with the
University.
D. Student Works
1. Ownership Principles
Students who create academic works while at the University (e.g., dissertations,
theses, student projects) own the copyright to such works, unless: (1) the works
qualify as works made for hire in the course of employment at the University; or (2)
a written transfer of copyright is obtained.
2. University Community Interests
Students are frequently involved in the creation of works in consultation with, or
under the supervision of, University faculty and staff. Such works may be related to
coursework, research, extracurricular activities, or other University projects. In
some circumstances, it is difficult to determine whether and to what extent students
are acting as agents or employees of the institution. Accordingly, written agreements
with students regarding copyright should be executed whenever the University or its
representatives have any doubt about copyright ownership of student-created works
in which the University believes it has ownership or other interests.
E. Collaborative Works
Works created collaboratively by students, staff, faculty, and/or others present
special challenges with regard to copyright. Such works may be owned in whole or
in part by the University if they fall within one of the categories described in (I)(B)
above. When works are created collaboratively with other entities or institutions, the
University's interests and rights in such works shall be recognized and protected as
consistent with this policy. If the parties intend for a work to be jointly owned for
purposes of copyright, such an intent should be set forth clearly in writing at the
beginning stages of such a project.
Even if ownership is held by a single entity (such as the University), the rights to
use such works can often be divided and shared so as to meet the needs of each
party. For example, multiple parties may have non-exclusive rights to copy, display,
or distribute a particular work.
In the case of some collaborative works, especially those involving members of
different categories within the University community (e.g., faculty and students;
staff and students), the parties involved may decide to assign copyright to the
University in order to coordinate distribution, use, and (when appropriate) revenue
sharing.
F. Sponsored Works
Works created in the course of sponsored projects are governed by the terms of the
sponsor agreements, when applicable.
G. Works by Non-Employees/Contractors


141




Novembeir Meeting, 2002 - Appenudix B


Generally, the University requires copyright as well as physical ownership of works
prepared expressly for the University by non-employees, such as consultants or
contractors retained by the University, or students who are compensated for such
work. In order to claim copyright ownership, a written agreement should be
executed in which the non-employee and the University both acknowledge
University copyright ownership.
II. Use of the University's Name, Seal, or Marks
Use of the University's name, seal, or marks in connection with works, other than by way
of identification of the creators as faculty members, researchers, other employees or
students at the University, is itself use of a significant University resource, thus triggering
an interest on the part of the University. Additionally, use of the University's name, seal, or
marks can affect the reputation and academic standing of the institution. Faculty members,
researchers, other employees, and students (as well as their respective departments and
schools) may not participate in the creation or use of works that might give the impression
of University sponsorship when there is none. Any use of the University name, seal, or
marks (other than to identify creators by their titles or affiliations with the University) in
connection with works created by faculty members, researchers, other employees, or
students must be approved in advance by the University in accordance with University
policies.
Similarly, the University must approve in advance the use of its name, seal, or marks in
connection with any works created under collaborative agreements with outside entities
(other than to identify creators by their titles or affiliations with the University).
III. Administration and Implementation
Copyright to all University-owned works shall be held (and registered, when appropriate)
in the name of the Regents of the University of Michigan.
Within the University, the individual departments, schools, or units in which works are
created will ordinarily have primary responsibilities for the administration of copyright
rights and permissions. Any commercial sale or licensing of University-owned,
copyrightable works shall follow normal University procedures.
Copyrights may also be held separately by entities that are affiliated with the University,
but legally independent or autonomous.
IV. Policy Interpretation and Dispute Resolution
This copyright policy and its implementation may require interpretation and review. Every
attempt should be made to resolve disputes informally, with the assistance of one or more
of the support services provided by the University as discussed below.
Policy Information: Information about this policy and its application is available from the
following sources: the Offices of the Provost at the Ann Arbor, Dearborn, or Flint
campuses (for policy clarification), the Office of the General Counsel (for legal
clarification), and the Office of Technology Transfer (for matters regarding patents and
commercialization of intellectual property).
Informal Resolution: If an issue arises with regard to the interpretation of this policy and
cannot be resolved by the parties themselves, one or more of the parties may go to the
appropriate supervisor, department chair or unit head (or his or her designee(s)). If the
matter cannot be resolved at the departmental or unit level, or if the parties involved are
from different departments or units, it may be necessary to bring the matter to the attention
of a dean or director. At any time during this process, informal consultation regarding
interpretation of this policy is available from the offices listed above under "Policy
Information."


142




November Meeting, 2002 - Appendix B


Formal Resolution: If informal procedures and consultation do not provide resolution of a
dispute or policy issue, it may be necessary to resort to formal procedures for policy
interpretation and dispute resolution. Any member of the University community may file a
request for formal dispute resolution or policy interpretation with the Offices of the
Provost at the Ann Arbor, Dearborn, or Flint campuses. The Provost will appoint an ad hoc
committee and designate a chair. The committee will consist of a combination of
administrators, faculty, staff and/or students as appropriate given the nature of the
complaint and the respective roles of the parties involved. Members of the committee will
be selected from a pool of candidates nominated by the Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs (SACUA) and by other appropriate governing and administrative
bodies.
The decisions of the committee may be appealed to the President (or his or her designee).
The decisions of the President (or designee) shall be final.

SPECIAL MEETING, DECEMBER 2002


The Univers.ity 'of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Monday, December 2, 2002
The meeting convened at 11:35 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman, Chancellor Little, Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow, and Vice
President Tedesco. Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, Maynard, Newman, Taylor, and
White, and Vice President Wilbanks participated by telephone.
University of Michigan Dearborn Phase One and Phase Two of the Science and
Engineering Expansion and Renovation Project
President Coleman called the meeting to order and announced that the purpose of the
meeting was to approve a revised project scope and budget for the University of Michigan
Dearborn Phase One and Phase Two of the Science and Engineering Expansion and
Renovation Project. She called on Interim CFO Slottow.
Mr. Slottow noted that the potential opportunity for purchase of the Fairlane
Training and Development Center had been announced at the May Regents' Meeting.
Acquisition of this facility would meet the facility needs of the Dearborn campus for the
next ten years. In June of this year, the 2002 state capital outlay budget was modified to
include a reconfiguration and reduced scope of the previously approved UM-Dearborn
Science and Engineering projects, along with funds for possible purchase of the
Fairlane Training and Development Center.
The two action requests being brought forward at this time are the first of a series
of steps necessary to allow the purchase of the Fairlane Training and Development
Center, which would meet UM-Dearborn's growth needs over the next ten years.
Approval of the revised scope and budget of the previously approved science and
engineering expansion and renovation projects will signify to the state that the Regents
are supportive of both the reconfigured science and engineering projects as well as
moving forward with the next steps toward the potential purchase of the Fairlane
Training and Development Center (FTDC). Mr. Slottow noted that it is likely that the
specific action requests for purchase and financing of the FTDC would be presented at
the regular December 2002 Regents' Meeting.
Chancellor Little offered to respond to questions.
Regent Deitch commented that he would be recusing himself from all matters
related to the Fairlane Training and Development Center project, due to the conflict of
interest created by the fact that his firm represents the controlling shareholders of the
Ford Motor Company.
Regent Maynard inquired whether the Capital Outlay budget would be impacted
by plans to cut budgets generally in the state. President Coleman and Vice President
Wilbanks both responded that no information has yet been received about this
possibility. However, it was pointed out that the Joint Capital Outlay Committee will


145




Special Meeting, December 2002


be holding a meeting on December 4, which necessitated the actions being requested at
this time.
Vice President Wilbanks noted that the state legislature had already approved a
modified request to include the Fairlane Training and Development Center in the
Capital Outlay budget, along with the reduced scope of the UM-Dearborn science and
engineering projects.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Science Building Renovation and Addition
Phase One of the Science and Engineerin  Expansion and Renovation Project.
There being no further discussion, Regent Brandon moved approval of the revised
scope and $9,600,000 budget for the University of Michigan-Dearborn Science
Building Renovation and Addition, Phase One of the Science and Engineering
Expansion and Renovation Project, as described in the Regents Communication.
Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved, with Regents Brandon,
Horning, Maynard, Newman, Taylor, and White in favor and Regent Deitch abstaining.
University  of Michigan-Dearborn   Engineering   Laboratory  Building
Expansion and Renovation Phase Two of the cience and Engineerig Expansi
and Reovation Project. Regent Brandon moved approval of the revised project scope
and $12,600,000 budget for the University of Michigan-Dearborn Engineering
Laboratory Building Expansion and Renovation, Phase Two of the Science and
Engineering Expansion and Renovation Project, as described in the Regents
Communication. Regent White seconded the motion, and it was approved, with
Regents Brandon, Horning, Maynard, Newman, Taylor, and White in favor and Regent
Deitch abstaining.
Affirmative Action Lawsuits
President Coleman reported that the U.S. Supreme Court had just that morning
announced that it would hear both the undergraduate and Law School admissions cases.
She noted that the University was not surprised that the court had agreed to consider the
cases, as this is an issue of enormous national importance. She said that the University
believes its cases are very strong, and it has an excellent legal team that is prepared to
mount a vigorous defense.
President Coleman observed that the University has conducted groundbreaking
research on the educational benefits of a diverse student body for all students,
regardless of race, and it is looking forward to the presentation of the cases in Spring
2003.
University of Michigan Dearborn Phase One and Phase Two of the Science and
Engineering Expansion and Renovation Project
Regent Brandon commented that Chancellor Little had done an extraordinary job of
advocating for this project, obtaining community support and guiding it through the many
steps necessary to get it to this point. President Coleman also complimented Chancellor
Little for his work on this project, as well as Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow and
Vice President Krislov and their staffs.

DECEMBER MEETING, 2002


The University of Michigan
Ann Arhor
Thursday, December 12, 2002
The Regents convened at 2:40 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Homing, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Interim Executive Vice
President Greenfield, Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Little,
Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow,
Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, and Vice President Ulaby. Vice President
Harper and Vice President Wilbanks were absent.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She noted that she had attended a
performance of the opera, "Da Organizer," which had until its recent discovery by
University of Michigan professor James Dapogny been thought lost to history. She
cited a number of noteworthy faculty and student accomplishments, national
recognition received by the University of Michigan Health System and other units, and
large grants received by University units during the past month. She noted that the Life
Sciences, Values and Society Program is collaborating with the Ann Arbor District
Library, Ann Arbor News, and other businesses and community organizations on "Ann
Arbor Reads," the city's first community reading project. The book to be read is
Abraham Lincoln's DNA and Other Adventures in Genetics, by Philip Reilly, and the
goal is to encourage the entire Ann Arbor community to read one book that raises
ethical issues posed by advances in the life sciences.
Resolution in Honor of Regent Horning
President Coleman recognized Amey Horning, wife of Regent Daniel Homing.
She called on Regent Deitch, who read the following resolution:
Regents 'Resolution
The Regents of the University qf Michigan extend their
appreciation and best regards to their colleague and friend cDaniel D.
Horning as he concludes eight years of dedicated service on the Board
of Regents.
A 1982 graduate of the University of Michigan and a resident of
Grand Haven, Regent Horning is an executive benefit- and
estate-planning specialist and a partner in the Grand Haven Group of
the Northwestern Miutual Financial Network. Well before he wacs elected
to the Board of Regents in 1994, Regent Horning showed his devotion to
the University in a number of way, beginning with service as student
manager of the football team as an undergraduate student. Later, he
served as president of the University of Michigan Alumni Club of Grand


149




DUecember Meeting, 2002


Rapids, and he is a member of the University of 'ichigan "M" Club, the
Victors Club, and the President's Club.
Throughout his eight years on the Board of Regents, Regent
Horning has been a conscientious and persistent advocate for students,
parents, and alumni and a voice for citizens of iMichigan, especially
those residing in the western part of the state. During his tenure, he
played active roles in two presidential searches, including service as
co-chair qf the search that culminated in the selection of President Mary
Sue Coleman.
The Regents salute Regent Horning for his generous service and
ongoing loyalty and commitment to the University and acknowledge the
equal dedication of his wife, Anmey. With gratitude and esteem for his
many contributions to an institution he cherishes, and with the
expectation that he and his family will continue to be involved actively in
University life, the Regents name Daniel D. Horning Regent Emeritus of
the University of Michigan.
Regent Deitch commented that of the 14 Regents he has worked with over the past
10 years, "none has been more devoted to Michigan than Dan." He noted that Regent
Horning has always based his stances on issues on what was best for the University of

and noted that Regent Horning's father, Dr. David Homing, is also a prominent
alumnus. Regent Deitch concluded that "you always made me, and all of us, laugh at
least once, usually more, and we'll all miss you."
A round of applause followed.
Regent Homing responded that "it's been a wonderful eight years," and that his
commitment from the outset was to try to make a University of Michigan degree more
valuable for those who possess it and more meaningful for those who aspire to attain it.
He noted that his decision not to seek another term on the Board was based on a desire
to focus more on his family, and he was looking forward to the next phase of his life.
A standing ovation followed.

Division of Student Affirs. In Vice President Harper's absence, President
Coleman complimented individuals from across the University involved in a six-year

MSA activities and accomplishments during the past month. She noted that the bus
transportation system to the airport for Thanksgiving vacation had been a huge success
and would be repeated for the winter break.

Student Assembly. The statement thanked Regent Brandon for arranging to have
Domino's Pizza sponsor a tailgate organized by MSA earlier in the semester, thereby
contributing to the overwhelming success of the event.
Voluntary Support. The report of voluntary support for November 2002 was
submitted.
Regent Maynard thanked Vice President Wilbanks for having done "a tremendous

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for nine
retiring faculty members.
Mary E. Cox, Ph.D., professor of physics and engineering in the College of
Arts and Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, will retire from active faculty
status on December 31, 2002.
Professor Cox obtained her A.B. degree from Albion College in 1959, her M.S.
degree from the University of Michigan in 1961, and her Ph.D. degree from the
University of California-Los Angeles in 1984.    She joined the University of
Michigan-Flint faculty as a lecturer in 1966 and was promoted to assistant professor in
1971, associate professor in 1976, and professor in 1988.
In 1968, Professor Cox received a substantial grant from the U.S. Navy to develop
theory and practical devices associated with holographic microscopy.  Both the
American and Soviet space programs have employed the types of holographic
microscopy she developed. In collaboration with scientists from the National Naval
Medical Center, she helped to develop and install a cineholomicroscopy system, used to
study decompression sickness, at the Naval Medical Research Center in Bethesda,
Maryland. Professor Cox also developed a novel fiber optic sensor using fluorescence
quenching. Her work in this area was an important contribution to the field of
microsensors. Originally developed to measure oxygen concentration in fluids, the
sensors are now being used with any soluble analyte that consumes oxygen, such as
glucose. The quantitative technique is also used to measure diffusion coefficients for
analytes in polymer hosts. The complexity and breadth of Professor Cox's research
utilized her talents and knowledge in optics, materials, engineering, and analysis.
Professor Cox served as chair of the Physics and Astronomy Department
(1976-78), associate dean in College of Arts and Science (1980-83), acting dean of the
College of Arts and Science (1981-82), and chair of the Department of Physics and

Committee Charters
Vice President Tedesco commented that in February 2002, the Regents Bylaws
were amended to establish a committee structure and to name a chair and vice chair of
the board. Two standing committees were created: The Finance, Audit and Investment
Committee and the Compensation and Personnel Committee. At the June 2002 meeting
Regent Maynard became chair of the Compensation and Personnel Committee and
Regent Brandon was named chair of the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee.
Since that time each standing committee has been working to develop a committee
charter, and the proposed charters are now being presented for approval.
Regent Brandon moved, and Regent Maynard seconded, approval of the following
proposed committee charters:
Proposed charter: Compensation and Personnel Committee
The Compensation and Personnel Committee will review all policy matters
regarding the evaluation and compensation of the president of the University
and make recommendations to the Board of Regents regarding all such matters.
Periodically, the committee will review with the i president the procedures and
methods used in the evaluation of the executive officers.
Proposed charter: Finance, Audit and Investment Committee
The Finance, Audit and Investment Committee will review and make
recommendations to the Board on the following matters:
Finance: Including but not limited to the University 's financing plans, financial
condition, borrowing and investment policies, annual operating budgets,
insurance and risk management programs, capital investment criteria and
financial reporting practices.
Audit: Including but not limited to the University's annual external audit,
internal audit plan and reports, internal controls and the selection of an

IUecember Meeting, 2002


Investment: The University's investment performance and investment reporting
practices.
("University" includes the Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint campuses, the
University of Michigan Health System, and the Department of Intercollegiate
Athletics.)
Regent Maynard commented that the Compensation and Personnel Committee
charter enables the Regents, in a systematic and positive way, to evaluate and determine
the compensation of the president on a yearly basis. It also enables the board to assist
the president in her evaluation process of the executive officers.
Regarding the proposed charter for the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee,
Regent Brandon observed that the charter is straightforward and is an outgrowth of
benchmarking that the committee did comparing charters and responsibilities for this
committee at peer institutions. The president, provost, chief financial officer, and
Regents all collaborated to arrive at this charter, which they believe is very appropriate.
The vote was then taken and the committee charters were approved unanimously.
The meeting recessed for 20 minutes and reconvened at 3:50 p.m. for Public
Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Matt Petering, student, on stabilizing tuition; Jim Mogensen, citizen, on the
town-gown relationship; Salah Dean Husseini, student and member of S.A.F.E., on
divestment from firms doing business in Israel; David Boyle, alumnus, on "Terrific
Taubman and the Two Towers;" Marva Hudson, student, on obtaining assistance in
completing her degree program.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 4:20 p.m. The next
meeting will take place January 16, 2003.

JANUARY MEETING, 2003


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
T hursday, January 16, 2003
The Regents convened at 2:35 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Interim Executive Vice
President Greenfield, Vice President Harper, Chancellor Little, Chancellor Mestas, Vice
President Rudgers, Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow, Vice President and
Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Vice President
and General Counsel Krislov was absent.
Announcements from President Coleman
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She introduced newly-elected
Regent Andrew Richner, who is attending his first Regents' Meeting, and welcomed
him to the Board.
President Coleman then read the following statement in response to comments
made by President Bush on January 15, 2003, regarding the lawsuits against the
University's admissions policies.
Response to White House Statement of January 15, 2003
On behalf of the University, I want to talk fbr a e;w minutes about the
admissions lawsuits and yesterday 's news that the White House will file a
briefin opposition.
First, I was happy to hear the President strongly support the importance
of diversity in America's colleges and universities.
He recognized that racial prejudice is a reality in America.
Race still matters.
He said, and we know this to be true from our research, that the values
of respect, understanding and goodwill are engthened  en steudtend  he  u ts live
and learn ufom people from many backgrounds
And we agree wholeheartedly that universities have a responsibility to
seek out diversity and consider a broad range of fiactors in admissions,
including a student s potential and life experiences.
In fact, we do just that in our admissions policies. We consider the
whole student. Our admissions policies here at the University of Michigan
look at a broad range of factors and a student's entire background.
And let 's set the record straight: We do not have -nor have we ever
had- quotas or numerical targets in either the undergraduate or the law


177




January Meeting, 2003


school admissions system.  By fir the overwhelming consideration is
academic qualification.
Here s important data to share about our undergraduate selection index
and its point system. 110 points out of a possible 150 are given for academic
factors including grades, test scores and the strength of the high school
curriculum. It is true that a perfect SAT score yields just 12 points in that
system. That is because we feel the GPA is a much better indicator of a
student's potential and performance than tanadardized tests. A perfect GPPA
yields 80 points on its own.
Grades matter.
Every student we admit is qualified and prepared to do the work.
We consider many other factors in addition to academics, including
race.  Geographic diversity is important, too; so if you come from.ichigan's upper peninsula you earn 16 points.   A student who is
socioeconomically disadvantaged earns 20 points. We look at leadership, at
service and extra-curricular activities, at life experiences, among others.
Overall, we strive for a student body that is richly diverse in many ways
because it enriches each student's learning environment.
In making decisions at the Law School, we also carefully review
individual experiences and interests in a highly competitive process. Every
applicant competes fiirly fJ)r every seat. There are no numerical targets, and
the actual enrollment of underrepresen'ted minorities at the Law School over
the past 10 years has ranged fiom 12.5 to 20 percent. (Our enrollment of
students from Ca/lifbornia has ranged from 11 to 15 percent during that same
time, but I don't imagine anyone would think we had a numerical target fbr
Califbrnians!)
Also, I want to talk a bit about the percentage plans now in place in a
couple of states. They are not a panacea, and I firmly believe they would not
work at all here at Michigan and for most other highly selective universities
across the country.  These programs have hardly been an unqualified
success. In Jact, yesterday I read an Associated Press story citing that
minority enrollment at the University of Texas flagship Austin campus is still
lower than it was before the court barred consideration of race. And the
most selective graduate schools seem to be particularly hard hit.
For Michigan it would be especially problematic. We are an individual
institution, not part of a system, and we simply wouldn't be able to guarantee
admission to a certain percentage of students from every high school in the
State. We have over 25, 000 applications br about 5, 000 seats.
In Texas, this sort of plan might -work to some degree br undergraduate
schools because it is a system and becaause many K-12 schools in Texas are
racially segregated. So, admitting the top ten percent guarantees some
number of minority students. But if the nation's goal is to end segregation as
identified in Brown v. Board of Education, how can we be in the business of
relying on it for college diversity?

January Meeting, 2003


Also, the percent plans select high school students solely on the basis of
their high school grades - not on their leadership abilities, activities,
teacher recommendations, nothing. It is a one-dimensional approach that
fails to see students as whole people. It doesn't allow for an evaluation of
their full capabilities or their potential contributions.
Finally, I want to underscore just how critical this Supreme Court
review is -not just for Michigan but fbr all of higher education. Although
critics of affirmative action have painted Michigan's admissions processes as
extreme over these past few years, in fact ours is a moderate approach,
carefidllv considered under the guidelines of the 1978 Bakke decision. Our
policies are similar to most other selective colleges and universities across
the country -public and private.
Bakke said that universities could not use quotas but could consider
race as one of many factors in order to achieve real diversity. And in fact,
we conform to that decision. The Sixth Circuit, in our law school case, said
Michigan's admissions policy is indistinguishable friom the Harvard plan that
the court held up as the model to fbllow.
So the Supreme Court decision from our cases has the potential to qfRect
all of higher education -in everything from admissions policies to financial
aid to mentoring and enrichment programs. As the Justices review the Bakke
decision, the Court will determine whether or not colleges and universities
can take any consideration of race into account when recruiting and
nurturing its student body.
I believe Bakke is good law. It has formed the basis for governmental
guidelines that higher education has relied on over these years. It has been
implemented fairly and effectively since 1978; and it has worked to create
real diversity in our classrooms and on our campuses.
We look forward to filing our briefs with the Supreme Court in
February. We will be joined by institutions representing a broad spectrum of
American society as they file "friend of the court" briefs articulating the
value of diversity in education, religious and corporate environments, among
others.
The debate will be important and robust, and in the end, we believe the
Supreme Court will find our admissions policies to be fair and legal under
the Constitution of the United States of America.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman highlighted several newsworthy items regarding University of
Michigan faculty and students and noted that C.S. Mott Children's Hospital had been
ranked 5th on a list of the nation's top 10 children's hospitals.
Annual Report on Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity
Vice President Ulaby thanked all of the individuals who had helped prepare the
report and introduced key colleagues in the Office of the Vice President for Research.


179




January Meeting, 2003


He noted that the report would be divided into two parts: a profile of activities in
research for the past year and a report on the transformation of the University's
technology transfer operations.
Report on Research Activities. Vice President Ulaby noted that total research
expenditures for FY 2002 reached $656.0 million, an increase of almost 11% over the
previous year (6.9% adjusted for inflation). This increase was observed across all
major disciplines. Federal sources accounted for 69.5% of the total, and University
sources accounted for 15.8% of the funding. The remainder of the funding was derived
from industry, foundations, state and local governments, and other sources. Nationally,
the University ranked first in research expenditures in 1999 and second in 2000, the
latest year for which data are available.
Research awards in FY 2002 increased by 8.3%, to a total of $741 million. For the
past three years, while the average annual growthve in federal research spending was
4.5%, federal research expenditures at the University of Michigan had an average
annual growth of 10.7%. Vice President Ulaby noted that even in smaller units, such as
the School of Nursing and School of Natural Resources and Environment, research
expenditures had increased dramatically, by over 28% each, over the past 10 years, and
he explained the factors that had led to this improvement.
Comparing 1980 with 2002, Vice President Ulaby noted that in 1980, the total
University budget was $407.6 million, and research expenditures comprised 26.7% of
that total ($108.8 million). In 2002, with a total University budget of $1.95 billion,
research expenditures had risen to $656.0 million, 33.6% of the total budget.
Vice President Ulaby explained that the reason so much emphasis is placed on
research is that research quality affects the University reputation, which affects faculty
quality and student quality. He noted that the University of Michigan is among the top
ten "highest impact" universities in the United States based on frequency of citations in
academic journals.
Vice President Ulaby pointed out some of the consequences to the University of
rapid research growth, which include the need to provide additional administrative
support services and increased regulatory oversight. This, in turn, requires more staff
and resources, better coordination across units, and extensive staff training.
Vice President Ulaby called attention to the Undergraduate Research Opportunity
Program (UROP) and the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program, both of
which have received Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and
Engineering Mentoring. He announced that the Office of the Vice President for
Research will be funding a new, refereed, research journal devoted exclusively to
research conducted by undergraduate students. The first edition will be published in
Fall 2003.
Report on Technology Trasfr rnsfr   formation. Vice President Ulaby noted
that the Office of Technology Transfer had undergone a five-year transformation
process. He reviewed the history of technology transfer at the University of Michigan
and noted that from its beginning in 1980 until 1995, technology transfer was regarded
as peripheral and unimportant. In 1996 the Regents approved a policy on technology
transfer, stating that "the University recognizes and supports technology transfer and


180




January Meeting, 2003


intellectual property development activities as an integral component of its mission."
Since that time, there has been a radical transformation in technology transfer activities
at the University of Michigan. Support for technology transfer has grown from $1.5
million to $3.9 million, and staffing has increased from 14 to 24 people. He introduced
the leaders of the University's technology transfer initiatives, including Ken Nisbet,
executive director of the Office of Technology Transfer, Elaine Brock, director of
technology transfer involving the Medical School, Tim Faley, director of technology
transfer in the College of Engineering, and Robin Rasor, the director of licensing for the
Office of Technology Transfer.
Vice President Ulaby explained the steps taken that have resulted in the successful
transformation of the University's technology transfer operations and displayed charts
indicating increases in the number of disclosures, patents, licensing, and revenues over
the past three years as compared to the three year period preceding that. He noted that
this year's revenue is up 470 o over the same period last year and discussed the
University's relative rankings according to a number of indices.  He noted that
technology transfer activities on the Flint and Dearborn campuses are also coordinated
through the Office of the Vice President for Research.
Vice President Ulaby noted that a number of start-up companies with Michigan
headquarters had been created and described three of them:  Arbor Networks,
HandyLab, and IntraLase. He noted that the OVPR holds an annual "Celebrate
Invention Day," which last year had over 500 participants.
He reported that a 12-person UM Technology Transfer National Advisory Board
was established in 2002, consisting of people from the west coast as well as Michigan
and the Midwest. He introduced Rick Snyder, chair of the national advisory board, who
noted that the purpose of the board is to demonstrate the partnership that exists between
the University and the private sector by providing counsel and connections. The board
plans to hold two meetings per year and has established four working committees to
address key strategic issues.
Regent White complimented Vice President Ulaby on the excellent presentation.
Regent Richner observed that technology transfer is important to the future of the state
and said he appreciates the efforts being made to promote these activities.
Relation of Current Capital Projects to North Campus Master Planning
Interim CFO Slottow noted that in October 2002 three projects had been approved
for the College of Engineering on North Campus. At that time, it was requested that the
Regents be briefed about how these projects fit into the existing North Campus Master
Plan. He commented that this presentation was in response to that request but that it
would also provide an overview of the common themes that have been prevalent in
North Campus master planning over the past 50 years and how these themes have
continued to serve as a guide for the development of North Campus. He introduced Sue
Gott, University planner.
Ms. Gott gave a presentation that included a historical overview of North Campus
master planning, covering the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s. Common themes among all of
these planning efforts include respecting the natural environment, increasing density in
the campus core, and remaining flexible to accommodate future programmatic


181




January Meeting, 2003


requirements. Guiding planning principles common to all plans include development
patterns, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, open spaces, and utilities.
Ms. Gott displayed maps showing the location of already approved North Campus
projects, as well as some tentative sites for proposed projects and a storm water
retention pond. She noted that these are all compatible with earlier master plans and
with the goals of respecting the natural environment, increasing density in the campus
core, and remaining flexible to accommodate future programmatic requirements.
Regent Deitch inquired about a proposed student housing project that is being
planned by a private developer near North Campus. Associate Vice President Hank
Baier noted that the project will consist of 700 units (900 beds), and he indicated the
location with respect to North Campus on a map. It was noted that the students who
live in this complex will have access to the University bus system.
Regent Deitch commented that he believes there is growing frustration with the
University's current housing options, and this is coupled with a growing trend toward
increased amenities in student housing. He noted that the last residence hall built by the
University was completed in the 1 960s, and it is time for the issue of new residence hall
construction to be brought to the fore. The fact that there is a demand in this area that
has yet to be met, whether through private or University resources, needs to be fully
considered in light of the University's value system.
Consent Agenda
Minu tes, Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the
December 2, 2002, special meeting and the December 12, 2002, regular meeting.
Reports.  Interim  Chief Financial Officer Slottow  submitted reports on
investment, plant extension, and the Regents Report on Non-Competitive Purchases
over $5,000 from Single Sources, September 16 through December 15, 2002.
iiuman Resources and Afifrmative Action Report. Provost Courant noted that
the Lecturers Employee Organization (LEO) had filed a petition with the Michigan
Employment Relations Commission (MERC) on December 20, 2002, asking for
certification as the exclusive bargaining agent for most non-tenured instructional staff
on all three campuses. He noted that the LEO had defined the unit as including "all
non-tenure track instructional staff excluding the Medical School, Law School, dental
school, and Ann Arbor business school." The approximate size of this unit would be
1,500 people. A meeting has been set between the parties to come to agreement on a
bargaining unit.
Litigtion Report Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established, November 25 - December 18, 2002.
Universitv ov  Michigan Health System. Interim Executive Vice President
Greenfield noted that the Health System had received a gift for the study of childhood
anxiety disorders from a couple whose son had died as a result of the attack on the
World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.


182




January Meeting 2003


Division   of Student Affairs.       Vice President Harper noted that the student
housing complex being developed by a private developer is being folded into the overall
comprehensive     plan   for University    housing.     Regent Deitch     reiterated  that the
University should consider whether to take a more active role in this area or whether the
private plan represents an acceptable solution. Interim CFO Slottow commented that
there are important trade-offs involved in taking care of existing stock as opposed to
adding new facilities.
University     of  Michigan-Dearborn.           Chancellor    Little  reported    on   the
accomplishments of faculty and students on the Dearborn campus. He also noted that a
Women's Resource Center has been established on the campus, whose purpose is to
provide a        receptive, nurturing, and responsive environment for women students and to
address the needs and concerns of women faculty and staff.
University of Michigan-Fliint. Chancellor Mestas introduced Mr. George Wendt,
newly appointed vice chancellor for institutional advancement. He also introduced Mr.
Carlos Alvas, an ACE (American Council on Education) fellow placed at the University
of   Michigan-Flint     during    the   current   academic     year.     He    noted    that   a
Nobel-Prize-winning playwright will be visiting the campus during African American
History Month.
Michigan Studet    Assembly Report.    MSA    President Sarah Boot reported on
MSA activities and accomplishments during the past month and described some
upcoming activities. She noted that the bus transportation system to the airport for the
winter break had been a huge success and would be repeated for the spring break. MSA
will be working to ensure that this program becomes institutionalized.
Ms. Boot also described the MSA online book exchange and reviewed MSA's
initiatives in improving tenant counseling services.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Wilbanks submitted the report of voluntary
support for December 2002.

Retirement Memoirs.       Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for three
retiring faculty members.
Dennis F. Ellis, Ph.D., professor of business economics in the School of
Management at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 2002.
A native of Michigan, Professor Ellis received his B.S. degree from Alma College
in 1962, his M.A. degree (mathematics) from the University of Detroit in 1964, and his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees (economics) from Wayne State University in 1969 and 1972,
respectively. From 1976-77, he served as an AACSB-Sears Roebuck Foundation Fellow
with the Comptroller of the Air Force at the Pentagon. He joined the University of
Michigan-Flint faculty as associate professor in 1977 and was promoted to professor in
1980.
Professor Ellis' research interests are in the fields of mathematical economics and
economic forecasting, and he had numerous publications on these subjects in national
journals of varying disciplines. Professor Ellis also was editor and contributing editor for
two forecasting publications, and he co-authored two textbooks: one on forecasting and
another on business cycles. The University of Michigan-Flint recognized Professor Ellis'
teaching and scholarly contributions by awarding him the Faculty Achievement Award for
Excellence in Teaching, the Faculty Achievement Award for Distinguished Service, and
the prestigious David M. French Professorship Award.
Through his participation in University and community activities, Professor Ellis has
made major contributions to his field and to the School of Management. He served as
executive assistant to the chancellor and was a member of the Graduate Board,
Chancellor's Advisory Committee, Undergraduate Committee, and Academic Review


199




January Meeting, 2003


Committee. Professor Ellis is also well known in the Flint community for having served
two terms on the board of the Flint Area Chamber of Commerce. He is often called upon
by the media and service clubs to discuss current economic matters.
The Regents now salute this distinguished business economics scholar for his
dedicated service by naming Dennis F. Ellis professor emeritus of business economics.
Tom Hickey, Dr.P.H., professor of health behavior and health education in the
School of Public Health and faculty associate in the Institute of Gerontology, retired
from active faculty status on December 31, 2002.
Professor Hickey received his B.A. degree from Gonzaga University (1963), his
M.A. degree from California State University-Los Angeles (1967), and his M.P.H.
(1968) and Dr.P.H. (1970) degrees from the University of California-Los Angeles.
From  1970-76, he taught at The Pennsylvania State University.  He joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1976 as associate professor and associate research
scientist, and was promoted to professor and research scientist in 1981. He was
appointed faculty associate in the Institute of Gerontology in 1987.
Within the School of Public Health, Professor Hickey directed the Health
Gerontology Program. He taught courses on aging and management of chronic illness
in addition to health ethics classes that were widely attended by students from across
the campus. Professor Hickey's research addressed the problems of chronic impairment
in the elderly, and he tested a low-intensity exercise intervention designed to help older
people maintain their basic functional abilities and delay the need for long-term care.
He published 2 textbooks and more than 200 articles and other publications. His
research findings were also developed into videotape programs for professional
practitioners.
Professor Hickey has long been an active advocate for research and education in
aging and public health. He has testified before Congress and served as a consultant and
advisor to many government agencies. In 1992, he was elected president of the
Gerontological Society of America. He was a founding member and early president of
the Association for Gerontology in Higher Education, and was the first chair of the
American Public Health Association's gerontological health section. Professor Hickey
received distinguished research awards from the Association for Gerontology in Higher
Education and the National University Extension Association.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Tom Hickey professor
emeritus of health behavior and health education.
Arunajallam Nadasen, Ph.D., professor of physics in the College of Arts,
Sciences, and Letters at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 2002.
A native of South Africa, Professor Nadasen received his B.Sc.Hon. degree from
the University of Fort Hare in 1960, his M.Sc. degree from Rhodes University in 1967,
and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Indiana University in 1971 and 1977, respectively.
After five years as a research associate and lecturer at the University of Maryland,
Professor Nadasen joined the University of Michigan-Dearborn faculty as assistant
professor in 1982. He was promoted to associate professor in 1987 and professor in
1992.
Professor Nadasen's research in nuclear physics, which for 20 years has been
supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, has been conducted at the
cyclotron at Indiana University and at the heavy-ion facility at Michigan State


200




January Meeting, 2003


University. During his career, Professor Nadasen collaborated with fellow physicists in
Ann Arbor, East Lansing, Bloomington, College Park, and Oberlin, and with many
undergraduate students.  Under his guidance, Professor Nadasen's students were
exposed to all aspects of physics research. They made presentations at conferences and
at meetings of the American Physical Society, and several students co-authored
publications with Professor Nadasen. In 1991, the University of Michigan-Dearborn
honored him with the Distinguished Faculty Research Award.
Professor Nadasen served as the chair of the physics discipline, the campus
affirmative action committee, and the campus scholarship committee. He taught the full
range of courses in the physics curriculum as well as the advanced laboratory. For
almost a decade he was a member of the organizing committee for the annual statewide
minority equity conference, and he also led the University of Michigan-Dearborn's
delegation to this event.
The Regents now salute this distinguished nuclear physicist for his dedicated
service by naming Arunajallam Nadasen professor emeritus of physics.

offer of the Underwriter to purchase the Bonds, all within the limitations set forth herein;
and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has full power under its constitutional authority for

to pledge General Revenues (as hereinafter defined) for payment of the Bonds;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1.   Any Authorized Officer is authorized to determine (i) the portion (which may be
the entire amount of any series of the Senior Lien Indebtedness) of the Senior Lien
Indebtedness to be refunded from the proceeds of the Bonds (the "Bonds to be Refunded")
and (ii) the portion (which may be the entire amount) of the Series D Notes to be refunded
from the proceeds of the Bonds (the "Notes to be Refunded"), and to provide for the call for
redemption or payment at maturity of the portion so determined to be refunded.
2.   The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Bonds
in one or more series to be designated GENERAL REVENUE BONDS, with appropriate
series designations, if any, in the aggregate original principal amount to be established by an
Authorized Officer, but not to exceed the principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of
sixty seven million Dollars ($67,000,000). The Bonds shall be dated as of the date or dates
established by an Authorized Officer, and shall be issued for the purpose of providing funds
which, together with other available funds, will be used to pay the costs of refunding the
Bonds to be Refunded and the Notes to be Refunded and the costs related to the issuance of
the Bonds and the refunding, including bond insurance premiums, if appropriate. The Bonds
shall be serial Bonds or term Bonds, which may be subject to redemption requirements, or
both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first maturity shall be no
earlier than October 1, 2003 and the last maturity shall be no later than December 31, 2020.
The Bonds may bear no interest or may bear interest at stated fixed rates for the respective
maturities thereof as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the highest yield
(computed using the stated coupon and the stated original offering price) for any maturity
shall not exceed 7.0% per annum, and the Bonds may be issued in whole or in part as capital
appreciation bonds, which for their term or any part thereof bear no interest but appreciate in
principal amount over time at compounded rates (not in excess of 7.0% per annum) to be
determined by an Authorized Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds may bear
interest at a variable rate of interest for all or a portion of their term, and the variable rate of
interest shall not exceed the lesser of the maximum rate permitted by law or the maximum
rate, if any, to be specified in the Trust Indenture. In addition, all or part of the Bonds may
be issued in related series, one of which bears interest at a variable rate and one of which
bears interest at a residual rate determined by subtracting the variable rate from the fixed rate
paid by the Issuer, but the combined rate on such Bonds, taking the two related series
together, which shall be determined by an Authorized Officer, shall not exceed 7.0% per
annum. The Bonds may be subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the
times and prices and in the manner as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but no
redemption premium shall exceed 3% of the principal amount being redeemed. Interest on
the Bonds shall be payable at such times as shall be specified by an Authorized Officer. The
Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form in denominations, shall be payable as to
principal and interest in the manner, shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be
executed and authenticated, all as shall be provided in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds shall
be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement for a price to be
established by an Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of original
issue discount, shall not exceed 0.8% of the principal amount thereof) plus accrued interest,
if any, from the dated date of the Bonds to the date of delivery thereof. The Bond Purchase
Agreement may provide for a deferred delivery of all or a portion of the Bonds, in which
event the Issuer may be required to pay certain penalties if it fails to deliver the Bonds when
required.
In relation to the debt service on the Bonds any of the Authorized Officers may, at any
time, on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into an interest rate swap, cap or similar
agreement or agreements (collectively, the "Swap Agreement") with a counter-party or
counter-parties to be selected by the Authorized Officer. Such Swap Agreement shall


208




January Meeting, 2003 - Appendix A


provide for payments between the Issuer and the counter-party related to interest on all or a
portion of the Bonds, or to indexed or market established rates. If the Swap Agreement is
entered into in connection with the issuance of the Bonds, the expected effective interest
rates on the Bonds, taking into account the effect of the Swap Agreement, shall be within the
limitations set forth herein.
Any or all of the Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the option of
the holder thereof. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any Bonds subject to tender
options may be made payable from General Revenues, from available cash reserves of the
University, subject to such limitations as may be specified in the Trust Indenture, or from a
letter of credit, line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity device, or
one or more of the same, or any combination thereof (collectively, the "Liquidity Device"),
all as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer. The Liquidity Device, or any part
thereof, may also be used to provide liquidity for any other indebtedness or obligations of
the Issuer, including the Notes, any variable rate Senior Lien Indebtedness and any variable
rate Hospital Revenue Bonds. Any reimbursement obligation for draws under the Liquidity
Device shall be a limited and not a general obligation of the Issuer, payable from and
secured by a pledge of General Revenues. Any portion of the Liquidity Device which
provides liquidity for any Senior Lien Indebtedness or Hospital Revenue Bonds may, but
shall not be required to, be additionally payable from and secured by a lien on any revenue
stream securing the obligations for which the liquidity is provided. Any Authorized Officer
is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any agreements or
instruments necessary to obtain, maintain, renew or replace, and provide for repayments
under, any Liquidity Device deemed by such officer to be required for the purposes of this
Resolution. In the alternative, any or all of the Bonds may be subject to rights on behalf of
the holders thereof to tender their Bonds for purchase by the market through a dutch auction
procedure, subject to a specified maximum interest rate not in excess of the lesser of the
maximum rate specified by law or the rate specified in the Trust Indenture.
3. The Bonds, and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement and the
Liquidity Device, if any (except as specifically provided otherwise in Section 2 hereof), shall
be limited and not general obligations of the Issuer payable from and secured, by a lien on
the General Revenues (as shall be defined in the Trust Indenture in a manner generally
consistent with the definition thereof contained in the Trust Agreement Authorizing the
issuance of the Series 2002 Bonds), subject only to the senior liens on portions of General
Revenues securing the respective series of Senior Lien Indebtedness (until each respective
series of such Senior Lien Indebtedness is paid or defeased in accordance with its terms).
The lien on General Revenues securing the Bonds shall be on a parity basis with the lien
securing the Series 2002 Bonds, other obligations secured by a parity lien on General
Revenues and the Notes. The Bonds and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap
Agreement and the Liquidity Device, if any may also be payable from and secured by a lien
on moneys, securities or other investments from time to time on deposit in certain funds
created pursuant to the Trust Indenture or agreements entered into in connection with the
Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount of or interest or
premium on the Bonds, the Swap Agreement or the Liquidity Device, or any claim based
thereon against the State of Michigan, or any officer or agent thereof or of the Issuer or the
University, as individuals, either directly or indirectly, nor, except as specifically provided in
the Trust Indenture or the instruments entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement
or the Liquidity Device, if any, against the Issuer, nor shall the Bonds and interest with
respect thereto, or any obligations of the Issuer in connection with the Swap agreement or
Liquidity Device, if any (except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 2 hereof),
become a lien on or be secured by any property, real, personal or mixed of the State of
Michigan or the Issuer, other than the General Revenues and the moneys from time to time
on deposit in all or part of the funds established by the Trust Indenture or the agreements
entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device, if any.
Any pledge of General Revenues, and funds specified in the Trust Indenture or
agreements entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device, if any,
shall be valid and binding from the date of the issuance and delivery of the Bonds or such
agreements, and all moneys or properties subject thereto which are thereafter received shall
immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further act. The
lien of said pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties (other than the holders of any

FEBRUARY MEETING, 2003


Tne Univers ity 'oft ichigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, February 20, 2003
The Regents convened at 1:30 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Interim Executive Vice
President Greenfield, Vice President Harper, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little,
Vice President May, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow,
Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, and Vice President Ulaby. Vice President
Wilbanks and Chancellor Mestas were absent; Provost McLaughlin participated on
behalf of Chancellor Mestas.
President Coleman called the meeting to order and announced that Public
Comments would be the first order of business.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Barry Borgerson, citizen, and Stephanie Steele and Tom Flynn, alumni, in
support of the ReachOut! program; Jonathan Prokup and Chris Ongena, students, on the
real estate development at Washington and State Streets; Audrey L. Jackson, alumna,
on affirmative action policies at the University of Michigan; Ian Robinson, faculty, on
the Lecturer Employees Organization; and David Boyle, alumnus, on affirmative action.
A five minute break followed. Regent Richner left the meeting at this point.
President's Opening Remarks
The meeting reconvened at 2:15 p.m. President Coleman reported on a number of
faculty achievements and on recognition received by the University during the past
month. She also recognized the efforts of Vice President Rudgers and her team for their
extraordinary efforts in setting up a satellite transmission on very short notice for a
speech delivered to the annual meeting of the American Council on Education that had
to be delivered from Ann Arbor due to a snowstorm that prevented travel to
Washington, D.C. President Coleman also commended Vice President Wilbanks for
her efforts in working with the state legislature to minimize funding cuts for the Life
Sciences Corridor.
President Coleman called on Regent Brandon to comment on recent reports from
bonding agencies.
Universitv of Michigan Bond Ratings. Regent Brandon commented that within
the past week, both major financial credit agencies in New York had issued press
releases that were extremely favorable to the University, particularly considering
today's economic situation and outlook. He noted that Standard & Poor's had assigned
a long-term rating of AA+ to the University's revenue bonds and reaffirmed the
University's commercial paper rating. Quoting from the press release, he stated, "The


217




February Meeting, 2003


ratings on the bonds and commercial paper reflect the University's premiere standing in
Michigan's ("AAA") higher education funding hierarchy, strong financial operations,
substantial liquidity, revenue diversity, and impressive student-demand trends."
Concurrent with that announcement, Regent Brandon noted that Moody's
Investors Service had reaffirmed its very strong rating of the University's credit and
noted that their reaffirmation of the University's strong credit position was based on its
"superior financial resources, strong market position, excellent operating results derived
from a well-diversified revenue base, manageable plans for additional borrowing, and
ample liquid investments and capable management team providing strong liquidity
support for variable rate demand bonds and commercial paper." Given today's
environment, Regent Brandon commented that this is a "very, very significant, positive
outcome for the University that will clearly have a positive impact on our borrowing
capacity and rates going forward." On behalf of the Finance, Audit and Investment
Committee and of the entire Board of Regents, he commended President Coleman and
Interim CFO Slottow and their teams for continuing to position the University very well
in the financial marketplace.
President Coleman echoed Regent Brandon's sentiments and noted that these
ratings make it less expensive for the University to do business, which is very important
during these times of limited resources.
President Coleman concluded her remarks by calling attention to several
upcoming events, including the residency of the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Remarks on the University's Response to the State's Budget Shortfall
President Coleman made the following comments:
We're planning not only Jbr the cuts this year, but fori next year's state
budget shortfall that we 've been hearing a lot about, and that you've read
about in the nevwspapers. We have a lot of work to do in the upcoming
months. We are going to work closely with the governor and the legislature
to tmanage our share of the cuts to University General Fund appropriations.
We will do our fair share. We know it won't be easy but wve are going to
have to make the tough choices —and we will —that will enable us to
accomplish the goals this state expects of us.
We must preserve the core quality of the classroom experience and the
academic environment for our students - both the current students and fiture
generations of students. We have to strike the right balance to guarantee the
quality that we have always had here, while we minimize the tuition burden
for our students and fnmilies as much as possible —and to continue the
special commitment we make to the demnonstrated financial need (of all
resident undergraduate students.
We have another very big challenge in front of us. We nmust do a better
job of demon strating to the residents of this state that our universities
allocate our state funding efficiently and just as important, that the money the
state invests in its public universities is crucial to Michigan's long-term
economic recovery and well-being. We educate the state's workforce, our
faculty discoveries turn into new products and businesses, and our hospitals


218




February Meeting, 2003


and medical staff care for many, many thousands of Michiganfamilies every
year.
I have asked Paul to talk about how we will guide the budgeting process
during this very challenging time. I have asked him, and have told our
University community, that we must do our best to make judicious budgeting
decisions and preserve our highest priorities.  We will reduce costs
everywhere we can -- from big-ticket items such as the energy bill and
program dollars to smaller areas like cell phone use -- becaluse ever thing
counts as we 're going forward.
And at the end of the day we must keep our long-term strength, and our
state's long-term strength, at the top of our priority list.
Provost Courant noted that there have been two executive orders reducing the state
appropriation. The first, in December 2002, was a 2% cut, and the second, announced
yesterday, was for a 1.5% cut. The two cuts total $12.7 million for the Ann Arbor
campus General Fund appropriation.
Provost Courant noted that these cuts had been expected and that $7.2 million in
centrally-held funds have been applied to mitigate them. The remaining $5.5 million in
cuts would come from General Fund reductions of 1.0% in administrative units and.5%
in academic units. Tuition will not be increased during the current academic year.
Provost Courant commented that for fiscal year 2004, the state appropriation could
be as low as 85% of the FY 2002 appropriation, which would amount to a reduction of
$54.5 million. Therefore, administrative units are being asked to plan for cuts of 6.5%
and academic units, 6.0%. Financial aid will be protected from any cuts. He noted that
the first priority will be to protect the quality of students' learning environment while
maintaining the accessibility.
He highlighted some of the areas in which expenditure reductions can be sought,
including travel, equipment replacement, energy use, and in personnel areas. He
pointed out that at the same time, the demands on the University ("volume of
business"), in terms of numbers of students, sponsored research volume, and such
measures as salaries, utility costs, and health benefits, are increasing so that reductions
must take place in the range of activities without sacrificing quality.
Provost Courant concluded by noting that the University is continually engaged in
examining its activities in an effort to increase the most important activities at the
expense of the less important ones. The current fiscal situation will lead to an
acceleration of this practice, with the end result that some activities will be cut.
Opportunities will also continue to be sought in areas where savings have already been
made, such as purchasing and utilities management. He said that he will continue to
update the Board on these issues in the coming months.
Regent Deitch expressed his "high degree of confidence in the president, provost,
and the rest of our leadership team as we face these challenges." He noted that "this
will not be a time of easy choices" but will be "a time of serious, thoughtful work" that
will constitute one of the greatest challenges of his tenure on the board. He continued
that "we are going to do the best we can to make the best decisions we can to maintain
the quality and excellence and accessibility of our University."


219




February Meeting, 2003


President Coleman observed that she had received excellent cooperation from
Chancellor Little and Chancellor Mestas, and they are also informing their respective
communities of the implications of the budget situation. Chancellor Little commented
that his campus is very mindful of it, having already dealt with the first budget cut and
anticipating how to incorporate the next one. He pointed out that the Dearborn and
Flint campuses have traditionally "done a lot with not very much," as they do not have
large reserves and expendable program activities. Reductions of the magnitude being
contemplated are going to be "very, very hard to achieve while keeping our
commitment to maintaining our academic quality." He noted that he is committed to
preserving the academic quality that is a "tremendous economic driver and civic life
driver" to the region served by the Dearborn campus.
Provost McLaughlin commented that the Flint campus had accommodated the 2%
cut for the current fiscal year and is working on how to cut the additional 1.5%. For
next year, she noted that every unit will have a plan for how to accommodate a cut of up
to 6%, and these plans will involve layoffs.
Environmental Stewardship Update
Terry Alexander, director of the Office of Safety and Environmental Health
(OSEH) gave a report on the current status of the University's efforts in environmental
stewardship. He noted that there are currently 200 environmental stewardship projects
underway. He gave examples of projects in four areas —energy, transportation, water,
and green purchasing —and provided data indicating the progress that has been made.
He pointed out that for the most part, environmental stewardship not only protects the
environment, but also saves money.
Mr. Alexander introduced Ms. Sara Archer, the University's recycling coordinator,
whose efforts resulted in the University's being awarded the "2001 Outstanding School
Program Award" by the National Recycling Coalition.
Interim CFO Slottow commented that making progress in this area is the result of
a great deal of work by many individuals from across the campus, and he thanked
everyone for their efforts.
President Coleman welcomed Vice President Jerry May to his first Regents'
Meeting.

Michigan Student Assembly Report.            MSA    President Sarah Boot reported on
MSA activities and accomplishments during the past month and described some
upcoming activities. She noted that the bus transportation system to the airport for
spring break is so popular that it is being offered at a reduced rate and that MSA plans
to institutionalize this program.
Ms. Boot also described a "viewpoint neutral" campus-wide event organized by
the MSA Peace and Justice Commission, to educate students about affirmative action at
the University. She noted that the MSA External Relations Committee is coordinating a
student-led effort to lobby the state legislature to oppose a decrease in higher education
funding. Finally, she reported that the annual MSA elections will take place in March.
Voluntary Support.        Vice President May submitted the report of voluntary

Mann, Ronald J., J.D., Louis and Myrtle Moskowitz Research Professor of Business and Law, January
1-June 30, 2003
Retirement Memoirs.        Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for five
retiring faculty members.
Mel L. Barclay, M.D., associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology in the
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on January 31, 2003.
Dr. Barclay received his B.S. (1965) and M.D. (1967) degrees from Wayne State
University. He completed his residency training at Sinai Hospital in Detroit from
1968-71 and served in the U.S. Air Force from 1971-73. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an instructor in 1973 and was promoted to assistant professor in
1977 and associate professor in 1982.
Dr. Barclay has been responsible for rotational activities and curricular
development in the Medical School, and he organized the longitudinal primary care


236




February Meeting, 2003


rotation for fourth-year medical students. For his efforts, he received the 1999 Kaiser
Permanente Award for Excellence in Teaching in the Clinical Phase. Dr. Barclay has
also been involved in institutional medical student activities and served on numerous
committees, including the Comprehensive Clinical Assessment Committee, the Medical
School Curriculum Evaluation Advisory Committee, and the Medical School's Primary
Care Medical Student Education Committee. His teaching efforts have led to the
establishment of a website with images of gross pathology and a mock medical
malpractice suit to help medical students understand the impact of legal issues on the
practice of medicine.
For the past 13 years, Dr. Barclay has directed the MedNet Conference system.
He has twice received the Excellence in Teaching Award from the Association of
Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics (APGO) (1992 and 1995); and he served on
the APGO Committee on Undergraduate Education, the Task Force on Ethics in
Undergraduate Medical Education, and the Testing and Technology Project. Dr.
Barclay maintained an active clinical practice and provided outstanding resident
teaching, which earned him the department's prestigious Silver Speculum Award three
times.
The Regents now salute this accomplished faculty member by naming Mel L.
Barclay associate professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology.
Eugene F. Krause, Ph.D., professor of mathematics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2002.
Professor Krause received his B.S. (1959), M.S. (1960), and Ph.D. (1963) degrees
from the University of Wisconsin. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
instructor in 1963 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1965, associate professor in
1969, and professor in 1977.
For the past 20 years, Professor Krause managed the mathematics department's
education program. He taught a majority of the department's teacher education courses,
counseled myriad students who went on to teach in elementary and high schools, and
demonstrated that it was possible to communicate the complexities and beauty of
mathematics to young students. Professor Krause conveyed the art of teaching both in
the classroom and through his writing. He wrote eight books, two for middle school
(with C. Brumfiel) and six for college, including Introduction to Linear Algebra and
Mathematics for Elementary Teachers. He also contributed a number of articles to
math-education journals and was considered a top expositor. Professor Krause's
monograph, Taxicab Geometry, remains popular with both students and teachers.
Professor Krause's commitment to his own teaching and to the teaching profession
are evident in the recognition he has received for his work, including the AMOCO
Foundation Good Teaching Award (1979), the Ruth M. Sinclair Award in LS&A

February Meeting, 2003


Hunein F. Maassab, Ph.D., professor of epidemiology in the School of Public
Health, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2002, after a most productive
career as a distinguished researcher and teacher.
A native of Damascus, Syria, Professor Maassab received his B.A. (1950) and
M.A. (1952) degrees from the University of Missouri and his M.P.H. (1954) and Ph.D.
(1956) degrees from the University of Michigan. Professor Maassab joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1956 as a research assistant in epidemiology and was
promoted to research associate in 1958, assistant professor in 1960, associate professor
in 1965, and professor in 1973.
In 1983, Professor Maassab was a visiting fellow at Wolfson College at the
University of Cambridge, England, and in 1986 he was a visiting scientist at the
U.S.-U.S.S.R. Biomedical Research Collaboration Program Institute of Experimental
Medicine in Leningrad, U.S.S.R. From 1991-97, Professor Maassab served as chair of
the Department of Epidemiology.
Professor Maassab is a world-renowned scientist recognized for his extensive
research into the creation and development of influenza vaccines. In 1960, he isolated
the Influenza Type-A-Ann Arbor virus and by 1967 had developed a cold-adapted
virus. After more than four decades of research building on one finding after another,
Professor Maassab invented FluMist, a cold-adapted, live-attenuated, trivalent influenza
virus vaccine. On December 18, 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's
Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee deemed FluMist to be
safe and effective for healthy people aged 5 to 49, and it now awaits licensing by the
FDA. If licensed, FluMist would be the first influenza vaccine delivered as a nasal mist
to be commercially available in the United States.
The Regents now salute this distinguished public health researcher and educator
for his dedicated service by naming Hunein F. Maassab professor emeritus of
epidemiology.
Michael A. Savageau, Ph.D., the Nicolas Rashevsky Distinguished University
Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, professor of microbiology and
immunology, and chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology in the
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2002.
Professor Savageau received his B.S. degree from the University of Minnesota in
1962, his M.S. degree from the University of Iowa in 1963, and his Ph.D. degree from
Stanford University in 1967. After completing postdoctoral work at the University of
California-Los Angeles and Stanford University, he joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1970 as an assistant professor and was promoted to associate professor in
1974 and professor in 1978. From 1989-93 he held an additional appointment as
professor of chemical engineering.
In addition to serving as chair of the department since 1993, Professor Savageau
initiated the interdisciplinary training program in cellular biotechnology and served as
the organizing director of the Medical School's Bioinformatics Program (1998-2001).
His research focused on the function, design, and evolution of gene circuitry in living
systems, and he has published two books and more than 100 scientific articles. He is
the editor-in-chief of Mathematical Biosciences and serves on the board of directors of
the Society for Mathematical Biology and the International Federation of Nonlinear
Analysts and on advisory panels for the National Institutes of Health, the National
Science Foundation, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.


238




February Meeting, 2003


Professor Savageau's honors include Guggenheim and Fulbright Senior Research
Fellowships and selection as Fellow of the John Curtin School of Medical Research,
Fellow of the Michigan Society of Fellows, Foundation for Microbiology Lecturer, and
Fellow of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. He was
named the Nicolas Rashevsky Distinguished University Professor of Microbiology and
Immunology in 2002.
The Regents now salute this accomplished researcher, teacher, and administrator
for his dedicated service by naming Michael A. Savageau the Nicolas Rashevsky
Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of Microbiology and Immunology and
professor emeritus of microbiology and immunology.
Margaret C. Woodbury, M.D., assistant professor of internal medicine in the
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on October 31, 2002.
Dr. Woodbury received her A.B. degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1958 and
her M.D. degree from Meharry Medical College in 1962. She completed her residency
training in internal medicine at the United States Public Health Service Hospital in
Staten Island, New York, and was awarded a fellowship in endocrinology at the New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in 1967. Dr. Woodbury joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an instructor in internal medicine in 1969 and was promoted to
assistant professor in 1980. She also served as assistant dean for student and minority
affairs (1983-89) and project director of the Health Careers Opportunity Program at the
Medical School.
Dr. Woodbury provided superb support and counseling to a generation of medical
students and was particularly effective as a role model, supporter, and advocate for
minority students. Dr. Woodbury took personal responsibility for ensuring that the
Medical School provided a welcoming atmosphere, but at the same time, she was
uncompromising in her insistence on high performance levels and standards for all
students.
Dr. Woodbury was a highly knowledgeable and competent physician who
provided outstanding care to her patients in a compassionate, dedicated manner.
Although her active service in the Medical School and the Division of Endocrinology
was cut short by the development of a disabling medical condition, her contributions
were significant and have had a lasting impact.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for her dedicated service by naming
Margaret C. Woodbury assistant professor emerita of internal medicine.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported to the Regents

MARCH MEETING, 2003


Tne Univers ity 'oft ichigan
Ann Arbor
Thmrsday~, MAarch 20, 2003
The Regents convened at 10:30 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Interim Executive
Vice President Greenfield, Vice President Harper, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor
Little, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Chief Financial Officer
Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice
President Wilbanks.
President Coleman called the meeting to order and announced that Public
Comments would be the first order of business.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from David Boyle, alumnus, on lack of University
support for student intervenors, and from Daniel Shoup (student), Inigo G. de la Cerda
(faculty), and Lauren Heidtke (student), in support of non-tenure track faculty
unionization efforts. Regent Taylor observed that Mr. Boyle's comments were
extremely inappropriate.
A five minute break followed.
President's Opening Remarks
The meeting reconvened at 10:50 a.m. President Coleman noted that there is
concern among faculty, staff, and students about the engagement in Iraq. She stressed
the importance of the fundamental principle of freedom of expression and expressed the
hope that the University would become a national model for debate and respectful
civility. She noted that work is being done to ensure the safety and security of the
campus and that a website is being introduced to provide updates and information about
campus preparedness. President Coleman then reported on faculty achievements and on
recognition received by the University during the past month.
Regent Deitch noted that there was a recent incident at Duke University Medical
Center in which incompatible heart and lungs were transplanted into an adolescent
patient who subsequently died. He asked Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield
to comment on whether there are safeguards in place at the University of Michigan that
would reduce the chances of a similar incident occurring here. He also asked him to
comment on issues of emergency preparedness within the Health System.
Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield stated that two recent incidents of
patients receiving mismatched organ transplants had prompted the University to do an
internal review of its own policies and procedures. He described the procedures used
by the University to check and confirm that individual donors and recipients have
compatible blood types, and he noted that the procedures vary as to whether the organs


245




March Meeting, 2003


to be transplanted come from deceased or living donors. He also pointed out that a
national system for organ procurement ("UNOS") exists which has built-in safety
checks, and this system was likely to have been compromised at Duke University. He
said that with the University of Michigan, a careful analysis has revealed that despite
the safeguards currently in place, several potential sources of error remain. A task force
is being appointed to examine where opportunities exist to improve current practices
and ensure the maximum possible safety for patients.
Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield then turned to the issue of emergency
preparedness at the University of Michigan Health System. He noted that there are
well-structured plans in place for dealing with bioterrorism. Training exercises and
mock drills have been undertaken to test the system, which is part of the state system of
emergency preparedness.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of February 20, 2003.
Reports. Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow submitted reports on investment
and plant extension. Provost Courant submitted the Human Resources and Affirmative
Action Report.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established, February 1 - February 28, 2003.
University of Michigan Health System. No additional report was submitted.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper reported that the annual
student-sponsored dance marathon had raised $197,000 for C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital.
University of Michigan-Dearborn.    Chancellor Little endorsed President
Coleman's comments about issues of war and peace, civility, freedom of expression,
and safety, and he noted that the Dearborn campus is paying close attention to each of
these issues.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas observed that the Flint campus
has been engaged in normal activities. However, uncertainty about the future has the
potential to be a source of tension. He reported that the Flint campus is scheduling
forums, panel discussions, and other events to allow members of the campus
community to share their views and concerns. Efforts are also being made to assure the
safety of the campus and preparedness of the community to deal with any emergencies
that may arise.
Report of the Senate Advisory Committees on University Affairs. President
Coleman called attention to the re-election of Charles Koopman, Jr., to a second term as
chair of SACUA.
Mich~igan Student Assembly Report, President Coleman announced that this
would be the last meeting at which MSA President Sarah Boot would be reporting to


246




March M~eetin~g, 2003


the Regents as MSA president. Ms. Boot noted that MSA elections were underway,
over 11,000 votes had been cast, and that the new president and assembly would take
office the next day. She noted that MSA had allocated funds for hiring buses to take
any students wishing to attend events in Washington for the Supreme Court hearing on
April 1, and that all available seats have been reserved.
Ms. Boot commented that an important project still being pursued by MSA is the
proposal to move Spring Break one week later in the academic calendar, from the last
week in February to the first week in March. She noted that the proposal has been
reviewed by the provost's office and the faculty senate, and that the faculty senate had
voted to support it. As a next step, Provost Courant has agreed to present it to the deans
for consideration by the school and college executive committees. She urged the
Regents to support this proposal due to the overwhelming support is has among the
student body.
In response to a question from Regent Newman, Ms. Boot stated that the main
reason students want to change the date of Spring Break is to make it coincide with that
of other schools within the state and nationally. It was noted that currently Spring
Break occurs exactly at the midpoint of the semester, but if this proposal is adopted,
there would be 8 weeks of classes prior to Spring Break, and 6 weeks after. Provost
Courant commented that for this reason, there needs to be a full discussion of the issue
among the faculty.
Ms. Boot thanked the executive officers and President Coleman for working
collaboratively with her on so many projects during the past year. A round of applause
followed.

Education and Human Services at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 2002.


254




March Meeting, 2003


Professor Jones received his B.A. degree from the College of the Ozarks in 1958,
his M.S.W. degree from Fordham University in 1964, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Michigan in 1977. From 1969-71, he served as associate director of
social work at Antioch College, and he was an assistant professor at the University of
Michigan from  1971-79.  Professor Jones was appointed associate professor and
program director of social work at the University of Texas at Arlington from 1979-88,
and he joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty in 1991 as associate professor.
Early in his career, Professor Jones was one of a handful of individuals who
formed an association for undergraduate social work educators.  The resulting
Baccalaureate Program Directors group had over 500 in attendance at their 2002 annual
meeting. In addition, Professor Jones was a founder of the National Association of Black
Social Workers, and he worked to document the history of this organization. He also
assisted in the creation of residential facilities for adjudicated adolescents.
Professor Jones' efforts have been consistently student-centered and marked by
high standards and demands for superior performance, and he has made numerous
contributions to the University. He was instrumental in establishing the School of
Education and Human Services, and he served on the University of Michigan-Flint
School of Education and Human Services Executive Committee. Professor Jones
served as chair of the Department of Social Work, special assistant to the provost, and
interim dean of the School of Education and Human Services.
The Regents now salute this distinguished social work educator for his dedicated
service by naming Charles A. Jones associate professor emeritus of sociology.
William J. Lockwood, Ph.D., professor of English in the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 2002, after 33 years of extraordinary service.
Professor Lockwood received his A.B. degree from Williams College in 1959, his
M.A. degree from Claremont Graduate School in 1961, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Pennsylvania in 1969. He joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty
in 1969 as an assistant professor and was promoted to associate professor in 1974 and
professor in 1985.
Building upon his interest in poetics and in the relationship between landscape and
literature, Professor Lockwood was instrumental in the development of courses in British
classics, British landscapes, and western American literary landscapes. Much of his
sabbatical research evolved around his strong interest in the poet and priest Thomas
Merton, and this led to an exploration of western American literary landscapes,
especially in Colorado and Utah.  Professor Lockwood was responsible for the
department's graduate course in American poetry, and he established and directed the
University of Michigan-Flint Visiting Writers Series, which brought leading figures in
American and British poetry to Flint. He had a long association with the School of
Criticism and Theory, which was held annually at Dartmouth College. Active in faculty
affairs, Professor Lockwood chaired the University of Michigan-Flint Faculty Assembly
and was secretary, vice president, and president of the Flint chapter of the American
Association of University Professors.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated service
by naming William J. Lockwood professor emeritus of English.
A. Rees Midgley, Jr., M.D., professor of pathology in the Medical School, retired
from active faculty status on December 31, 2002, after a productive career.


255




March Meeting, 2003


Dr. Midgley received his B.S. and M.D. degrees from the University of Vermont
in 1955 and 1958, respectively. During his residency training at the University of
Michigan, he was named the Sarah Mellon Scaife Fellow in Pathology. Dr. Midgley
joined the University of Michigan faculty as an instructor in 1963 and was promoted to
assistant professor in 1964, associate professor in 1967, and professor in 1970.
Dr. Midgley's research interests led to the development of the Reproductive
Endocrinology Program in the Department of Pathology. He was named director of this
program in 1968, and when it was transferred to the Center for Human Growth and
Development in 1980, Dr. Midgley was appointed director of the center. He also served
as director of the Consortium for Research in Developmental Reproductive Biology
from 1983-88 and director of the Reproductive Sciences Program from 1989-2000. Dr.
Midgley's commitment to education is reflected in his continued participation in
departmental and Medical School programs and in the mentoring of countless graduate
students.
Recognized as an expert in the field of reproductive endocrinology, Dr. Midgley
has more than 150 publications in peer-reviewed journals and has been invited to
present his work at conferences all over the world. He served on numerous University
committees, including the Cancer Research and Cancer Center Planning Committees,
the Biomedical Research Council, and the Planning Committee for the Medical
Scientists Training Program. He was a member of a number of professional societies,
including the American Society for Experimental Pathology (now the American Society
for Investigative Pathology), the Society for the Study of Reproduction, the Endocrine
Society, the International Society for Research in the Biology of Reproduction, and the
International Organization for the Study of Human Development.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming A. Rees
Midgley, Jr., professor emeritus of pathology.
Peter P. Pronko, Ph.D., research scientist in the College of Engineering, retired from
active faculty status on December 31, 2002.
Dr. Pronko received his B.S. degree from the University of Scranton in 1960, his
M.S. degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1962, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Alberta in 1966. He served as assistant professor of physics at the University
of Scranton (1967-68), research associate at McMaster University (1968-72), physicist
with Argonne National Labs (1972-80), and senior physicist, chief scientist, and director at
University Energy Systems, Inc. (1980-92). Dr. Pronko joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1992 as a research scientist, and he served as the associate director for industrial
liaisons in the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science.
Throughout his career, Dr. Pronko pursued an interdisciplinary approach in his
research in physics and materials. He made seminal contributions in the study of the
response of materials to ultrafast laser pulses in solids, which led to new insights into
plasma formation and ion dynamics. These accomplishments have led, through widely
disseminated publications, to Dr. Pronko's international reputation in the application of
laser and ion beams to technology and engineering. He has lectured and published widely
and is a recognized leader in these subject areas.
Dr. Pronko has also been very involved in technology transfer and commercialization
of new discoveries emanating from research at the University, and his efforts have led to
the formation of several start-up companies. It is unusual for a research scientist to have as
broad an array of accomplishments as Dr. Pronko does. His mentorship of students,


256




March Meeting, 2003


interaction with colleagues, and relentless pursuit of new knowledge is noteworthy and
deserving of recognition.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Peter P. Pronko research
scientist emeritus.
Claude J. Summers, Ph.D., professor of English language and literature in the
College of Arts, Science, and Letters at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, retired
from active faculty status on December 31, 2002.
Professor Summers received his B.A. degree from Louisiana State University in
1966 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago in 1967 and 1970,
respectively. During his graduate studies at the University of Chicago, Professor
Summers received a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, a University of Chicago Teaching
Fellowship, a Danforth Foundation Teaching Fellowship, and a Ford Foundation
Dissertation  Fellowship.  Professor  Summers joined   the   University  of
Michigan-Dearborn faculty as an assistant professor in 1970 and was promoted to

March Meeting, 2003


Alternative Asset Commitment
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of $10.0 million from the Long Term Portfolio to
Mineral Acquisition Partners 2003, L.P., (MAP), an energy fund.
Literature, Science, and the Arts (LS&A) Building Renovation Project
Interim CFO Slottow commented that this project involves an upgrade of all of the
major infrastructure elements of the LS&A Building, in addition to adding air
conditioning and fire detection and suppression systems. Of the total budget of $26
million, approximately $15 million will be provided by the state, $2 million from the
College of LS&A, and the balance from central administration capital reserves. He said
that Paul Urbanek, vice president of design at SmithGroup, would present an overview
of the project and respond to questions.
Regent Newman asked President Coleman to address the relevance of undertaking
this type of project in light of the current budget situation.  President Coleman
responded that this project was one of a number of building renovation projects for
which funding was made available by the state in 1996. She observed that this
particular building is in the worst shape of any she's seen, and it is critical that the
project be undertaken. Other renovation projects are being funded either by private
fundraising or debt. President Coleman commented that it would be shortsighted to
delay undertaking capital projects at this time, as many are providing additional space
or upgrades for research, which is a high-growth area. She pointed out that in addition
to addressing critical needs, construction projects help the economy of the state by
providing much needed employment in the construction industry. Finally, she noted
that no projects are being undertaken without a secure funding stream being in place.
Regent Richner commented that the LS&A Building is one of the more
unattractive buildings on the campus and wondered if replacement, as opposed to
renovation, had been considered. Interim CFO Slottow responded that our practice is
always to look at the economics of new construction as opposed to infrastructure
renovation. However, this project will allow the building to continue to serve important
academic functions, and it will be less expensive to renovate it than replace it.
Vice President Wilbanks commented that the state has a clear preference for
renovation of existing facilities for capital outlay projects.
Regent Newman expressed her concern that the University remain vigilant in
balancing the budget situation with the academic mission and that a process is in place
for evaluating every potential project in this light.
Regent Deitch concurred and commented that the infrastructure renovation
program begun under President Duderstadt was farsighted. He noted that although
current economic conditions require that projects be viewed with "enhanced scrutiny,"
it is important that capital expenditure be maintained as part of the overall budget.
Mr. Slottow commented that the state has been a great partner in all aspects of
planning for this renovation project and that the final step is for the state to approve the
minor change in the overall budget.


258




March Meeting, 2003


Mr. Urbanek then gave a presentation describing the LS&A Renovation Project,
including a site plan, schematic designs for each floor, and renderings of the building
exterior. It was noted that Michigan Radio has been relocated from the LS&A Building
to the Argus Building, and its former space will be used by the LS&A Development
Office. There was also discussion about the unsightliness of the proposed new
mechanical penthouses being added to the roof. Mr. Slottow and Mr. Baier responded
that the option of locating the mechanical items in the basement instead of the roof is
being evaluated, and it is possible that this option would also be less expensive.
Regent Deitch moved approval of the revised budget and schematic design for the
Literature, Science, and the Arts Building, with a request that consideration be given to
relocating the mechanical penthouses from the roof to the basement if it can be done
within the project budget. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Athletic Department Academic Success Center
Interim CFO Slottow noted that the Academic Success Center is the highest
priority in the Athletic Department strategic capital plan. Regent Brandon moved
approval of the Academic Success Center Project as described and authorization for
commissioning Jickling Lyman Powell Associates for its design. Regent Newman
seconded the motion.
It was noted that funding for the facility is to be derived from gifts to the Athletic
Department. Regent White pointed out that the budget appears to be high for this type
of facility; President Coleman responded that she has asked that this figure be very
carefully evaluated. Vice President May commented that if the department is not able
to raise the entire amount, it is assumed the building could be scaled back to meet the
available budget while still serving its required purpose.
There was discussion about design guidelines in place for the athletic campus. Mr.
Slottow suggested that these issues are addressed by the master plan, and this will be
brought to the Regents for review.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Central Campus and Medical Center Electrical Substation and Underground
Distribution System
It was noted that this system is designed to meet the electrical supply needs for
both the Biomedical Science Research Building and the Cardiovascular Center. On a
motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents unanimously
approved the Central Campus and Medical Center Electrical Substation and
Underground Distribution System Project as described and authorized issuing the
project for bids and awarding construction contracts providing that bids are within the
approved budget.

263




March Meeting, 2003


Regent Newman inquired as to whether conflict-of-interest contracts are audited
following approval by the Board. Vice President Ulaby explained that for simple
agreements there is no need to do any followup. However, as part of its oversight
responsibility, for complicated arrangements the Conflict of Interest Committee
requires either annual or semi-annual reports from the person assigned to oversee the
agreement.
Interim CFO Slottow pointed out that the Conflict of Interest Committee was
recently restructured to create tighter linkages between the Purchasing Department, the
Office of the Vice President for Research, the Medical School, and the other schools
and colleges involved in research. Vice President Ulaby noted that these agreements
are taken very seriously.
Regent White commented that she has met with members of the Conflict of
Interest Committee and is confident that they are doing an extremely good job. Regent
Newman said that her concern is that the proper controls are in place to prevent any
abuses from occurring. Regent White noted that the controls are in place and are
currently being reviewed.
Vice President Ulaby also noted that a "Conflict of Interest Manual" has been
developed that is used as part of the training for each member of the Conflict of Interest
Committee.
Report ofFinance, Audit and Investment Committee
Regent Brandon commended Interim CFO Slottow and his team for their having
recently refinanced $63 million worth of fixed-rate bonds with a "locked-in" interest
rate of 2.8%. This will yield $6.6 million in savings.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 12:00 noon. The
next meeting will take place April 17, 2003.

APRIL MEETING, 2003


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thurrsday, April 7, 2003
The Regents convened at 1:40 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and
White.   Also present were Provost Courant, Interim  Executive Vice President
Greenfield, Vice President Harper, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Chief Financial
Officer Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent Taylor was absent.
President Coleman called the meeting to order and announced that Public
Comments would be the first order of business.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Ebonee Griffin, citizen, on her experience with
patient clinics at the School of Dentistry; David Boyle, alumnus, on settling a lawsuit with
Maureen Johnson; and Jim Mogensen, citizen, on the town-gown relationship.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman commented that Athletic Director Bill Martin, who has been
serving as interim president of the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC), will likely be
elected president of the USOC. If elected, his tenure would end no later than next
summer following the USOC's restructuring. She noted that Bill Martin had been
keeping her apprised of his activities at the USOC, and this activity comes under the
rubric of volunteer board service. President Coleman stated that she is satisfied that Mr.
Martin's service with the Olympics does not present any conflicts with his role as the
University's athletic director, and she noted that in both individual discussions and public
statements he always stresses that his first and primary commitment is to Michigan.
She commented on notable achievements of students, faculty, and staff, and made
note of the Supreme Court hearing regarding the affirmative action admissions lawsuits
that had occurred on April 1, 2003. She observed that "It was an amazing moment, an
important milestone for U of M, as well as for all colleges and universities in the
country."
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of March 20, 2003.
Investment  nd Plnt d P  tension Reports. Interim Chief Financial Officer
Slottow submitted the Investment Report and Plant Extension Report. He reported that
the University had recently made it possible for student housing and tuition payments to
be made electronically, and 4,400 such payments have been made since November


265




April Meeting, 2003


2002.  This has resulted in improved cash flow and better customer service, as
evidenced by the fact that 35,000 fewer complaint calls have been received and the
1-800 telephone bill has been reduced by 65 percent.
Regarding the Plant Extension Report, Mr. Slottow reported that construction
budgets for all projects include building components that are fixed equipment and
required to perform the building functions. Over the last six months, a group has been
working to change the purchasing process for such equipment. The increase in
competitive bidding has yielded a cost reduction of $6.00 per square foot for a savings
of $2 million on building control systems for the Life Sciences Institute and $6.50 per
square foot ($3 million) in the cost of sterilization equipment for the Biomedical
Sciences Research Building. Future maintenance and replacement costs for these
components have been reduced by $1 million. These are examples of the efforts that
are being made to keep construction costs down.
Report on Non-Competitive Purchases over $5,000 from    Single Sources,
December 16, 2002 through March 15, 2003, This report was submitted by Interim
Chief Financial Officer Slottow.
Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report. Provost Courant submitted
the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report. He noted that an agreement had
been reached with the residence hall librarians who have joined the Graduate
Employees Organization.
Health nlnsurapnce Expenditures. Provost Courant noted that the University faces
a reduction of over $36 million between the initial FY 2003 budget and the 2004 budget
and over $40 million in cost increases for the coming year. Coupled with these
challenges are the rapid growth of health and pharmacy benefit expenditures. He said
that a number of changes have already been made in an attempt to mitigate these cost
increases and that a process had begun at the start of the current fiscal year to
recommend changes that would take effect beginning in January 2004.
Provost Courant noted that total expenditures on health and drug coverage for the
current year are twice what they were five years ago. In addition, he pointed out that
the University contribution to premiums for health and drug insurance covers 94% of
the total premium, whereas in general, 85% is viewed as being at the high end of
employer shares for health insurance premiums.  He noted that almost 70% of
University employees make no contribution for health and drug coverage premiums and
that last year University contributions for benefits rose by an amount that equals over
1% of the total salary pool.
Provost Courant explained that the formulas currently used for determining
University and employee contributions to health and drug benefits were determined
before 1988, and the formulas have not been adjusted in response to major changes in
health care trends or in light of actuarial and usage data. In response to this situation,
Provost Courant is appointing a faculty and staff committee that will be charged with
examining and making recommendations regarding a number of specific issues related
to the University's share of insurance premiums and the employee co-premiums.
Specific goals for cost savings will be set to guide the committee's work; the current
thinking is that the University contributio to health insurance premiums, in the
aggregate, should not exceed 85% of the total cost, compared to 94% today.


266




April Meeting, 2003


The charge to the committee requests that it examine and make recommendations
in the following areas:
1.    How do we set the appropriate target for the University's share of total premiums?
2.    Should we change to a four-tier structure of insurance coverage: single, single adult
with children, two adults, two adults with children? Currently we have a three-tier
structure; however, it is actually more expensive to insure two adults or two adults with
children than it is to insure a single adult with children, and that should be considered.
3.    What should determine the rate ratios, that is, the premium relationships among tiers
for each plan? (We currently use a pre-set formula; the norm is to use actual
experience.)
4.    Should the algorithm we use to determine the University's contribution to premiums
apply equally for active employees and retirees? Or should retirees be treated
differently?
5.    What algorithm should be used to determine the University's contribution for any given
tier of coverage?
6.    For retirees who are covered by Medicare, how should the Medicare Part B premium
be integrated into our algorithm?
7.    Should we make any distinctions in the level of the University's contribution for
families of differing income levels?
8.    How can we make costs more apparent, and more transparent, to employees so that
costs for both the employee and the University are minimized?
Provost Courant said that the committee will consult widely and will report its
progress to the executive officers and the Regents. Once the recommendations are
issued, a discussion and comment period will be provided for the University community
before final decisions are made during the fall term of 2003. Implementation will be as
soon as practicable, but not later than January 2005. Meanwhile, effective in January
2004, some short-term changes will be made in the current co-premium structure to
help alleviate the budget pressure created by rapid cost increases in this area. This
change is for one year only and will be superseded by decisions made as a result of the
committee's work. It will result in almost all employees paying some share of the
premiums for their health and drug coverage ($15-$30/month for most employees), and
it will yield a savings of about $6 million for the University. Provost Courant pointed
out that despite the increase in employee contributions under this new plan (totaling
about $9 million), the University's costs for health insurance premiums will still
increase by about $25 million.
Provost Courant noted that the committee's work will lead to even greater savings
for the University budget, due to employee cost-sharing and because the premium
structure will encourage employees to take cost into account in choosing their coverage.
He said that the short-term change will not affect staff covered by existing collective
bargaining agreements. He also pointed out that there is no intention to diminish the
number, quality, or range of health insurance plans offered by the University; the work
of the committee focuses on premium and co-premium structures, not employee choice
or benefit options.


267




AApril Meeting, 2003


Another change that will occur is the elimination of the $6.00 "flex benefits
credit," which will save approximately $1.9 million per year. Finally, Provost Courant
noted that the administration is concerned about the effects of these changes on the
lowest-paid staff, a situation that will be addressed by the advisory committee.
However, as a general matter, for the coming year, the percentage increases in the
salary program will be largest for the lowest paid. In addition, the administration will
add $ 100 per year to the salary of all staff earning less than $25,000, over and above the
annual merit program for those staff.
Regent McGowan commented that "the Board of Regents takes responsibility for
encouraging the change in this area, and has urged that the change take place carefully
but as soon as possible, and as always, with an eye towards equity."
Regent Deitch, noting that the benefits structure was last reviewed in the mid
1980s, commented that although American medical care is the best in the world, costs
for that care are spiraling out of control.  "Across the country," he observed,
'individuals are being asked to shoulder a greater portion of the burden." He reiterated
Regent McGowan's comments that this should be done quickly and equitably, noting
that for every day implementation of the decision is postponed, there is a tradeoff in
dollars not saved, which will have a direct impact on programs and tuition. He
requested that the committee work as quickly as possible so that the entire change could
be done closer to January 1, 2004 than to January 1, 2005.
President Coleman stated that these comments will be taken very seriously.
Lititigon Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established, March 1 - March 31, 2003. He reported on the work of David Mooney,
professor of dentistry, professor of chemical engineering, professor of biomedical
engineering, and associate professor of macromolecular science and engineering, who
specializes in tissue engineering. He also announced that three faculty members from
the College of Engineering had been elected to the National Academy of Engineering,
among only 34 selected nationwide.
University of Michigan Health System. Interim Executive Vice President
Greenfield noted that April 24 had been declared by the governor and legislature
"Michigan Bone Marrow and Blood Stem Cell Transplant Day," at the instigation of a
UMHS patient.
Division of Student Affairs.  Vice President Harper reported on several
developments in the housing system.  She noted that the division is working
concurrently on a planned approach to the renewal and revitalization of campus
residential facilities on the one hand, and on life safety improvements to the facilities
infrastructure on the other.
The renewal and revitalization efforts are referred to as the "residential life
initiative." The initiative involves two key objectives: 1) to conduct a detailed analysis
of the facilities, programs, and services that make up the current inventory, and 2) to
take the knowledge gained from this analysis and apply it to the development of a
comprehensive planning system that can guide the major renewal of existing halls and
identify new facility needs. This strategy is replacing previous discussions regarding

construction of a new residence hall, and it is seen as the most productive approach for
understanding the market and market needs.
Market research is also being conducted to compare on-campus housing and
dining services to housing and dining services available off-campus, and consultants are
being employed to help identify best practices at other institutions. These data will be
used to guide decision making with respect to a large-scale facility. This review will be
followed by the development of flexible recommendations for renewal and new
construction that can be adapted based on available funding levels and institutional
priorities. She said that during the fall term, a set of options will be provided for
Regental consideration.
Regarding capital renewal projects related to life safety, Vice President Harper
commented that a comprehensive facility conditions audit has been completed for all
residence hall and family housing properties. Nearly $50 million in fire and life safety
improvements have been planned for the residence halls, in addition to $4 million in
security upgrades. Funds expended so far have been generated from room and board
rates and savings from cost containment. The improvements are currently being
implemented in a phased approach across campus. Vice President Harper noted that in
May of 2002 the University committed to pursuing a three-pronged initiative that
focused on reducing the occurrence of crime and improving overall safety and security
in the residence halls. Significant progress has been made in the ensuing months,
including installation of video monitoring systems in some residence hall entrances and
automatic electronic locks for student rooms and community bathrooms. Installation of
the video monitoring systems in all residence hall entrances will be completed this fall.
She also described educational efforts that have been undertaken in the residence halls
to provide specific and tangible steps residents can take to enhance their safety and
security. She noted that crime statistics reflect the positive impact of the security
enhancements implemented so far, with home invasions having been reduced from 99
this time last year to 35 at the current time. She thanked staff, students, and the Board
of Regents for their support in keeping safety and security of students a primary focus.
Regent Deitch commented that he looks forward to receiving the report of the
residential life initiative as early as possible in the fall, and he expressed the view that it
should include a thorough examination of whether partnerships should be formed with
the private sector to address the question of adding to the aging housing stock. Regent
Newman agreed and noted that the University is at a competitive disadvantage with
other institutions in the area of residence halls. Vice President Harper responded that
these ideas will be incorporated into the report being presented in the fall.
University of michigan.-Dearborn. Chancellor Little reported that Dr. Suzanne
Baker had begun her position as the first director of the Women's Resource Center. He
also called attention to a virtual learning tool developed by a UM-Dearborn faculty
member that has received national recognition.  Chancellor Little also reported that a
student, Mahmoud Michael Shirazi, had been killed in a motorcycle accident on campus
in the presence of hundreds of people. Campus officials are providing the appropriate
services to members of the campus community and will work to minimize the chances
of such an accident occurring again.

'April Meeting 2g003


Universi y of       i ch'gan- lint. Chancellor Mestas observed that the Women's
Educational Center on the Flint Campus, although just over a year old, has been an
extraordinary   success.     He   commented     that the   speaker for the     Flint Campus
commencement exercises is Billy Taylor, distinguished jazz composer, pianist, and
educator, and Chancellor Mestas noted that Mr. Taylor will be receiving an honorary
doctoral degree.     Chancellor Mestas reported that the results of a recent student
satisfaction inventory indicate significantly higher satisfaction than the average for
students nationally, and the category with the largest positive difference from the
national average is the perception of safety, belying the reputation of the city of Flint as
an unsafe environment.
Michigan Student Assembly R.eport President Coleman introduced Angela
Galardi, newly-elected president of Michigan Student Assembly. Ms. Galardi described
some of the projects planned for the coming year, including off-campus housing issues
and helping students utilize University resources to obtain jobs and internships. She
reported that MSA had sent six "viewpoint-neutral" buses of students to Washington for
the Supreme Court hearing, and this generated a great deal of enthusiasm among the
student body.
Voluntary Support.        Vice President May submitted the report of voluntary
support for March 2003. He noted that he's been meeting with deans and development
officers across the campus and with volunteers and donors across the country in
preparation for the upcoming capital campaign. He is also undertaking other activities
to prepare for the campaign, including recruiting individuals for key roles, developing a
campaign timeline, and assessing campaign goals and objectives.

Wylie, E. Benjamin, Professor Emeritus of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of
Engineering, December 31, 2001
Retirement Memoirs.    Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for two
retiring faculty members.
Warren G. Holmes, Ph.D., professor of psychology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2002.
Professor Holmes received his B.S. degree from Willamette University in 1970,
and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1973 and
1979, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
professor in 1979 and was promoted to associate professor in 1985 and professor in
2000.
Professor Holmes conducted ground-breaking research on kin recognition and
nepotism in non-human animals. Using several species of ground squirrels as models,
he showed that kin recognition could be based on sharing an early rearing environment
and on a "phenotypic matching" rule that led squirrels to treat others differently
depending on their phenotypic similarity to self, even when they had never met. He
also demonstrated that adult preferential treatment of close kin was mediated both by
maternal behavior and by play behavior among juveniles during a narrow window of
time. These are the only mammalian data specifying when during development the
crucial experiences underlying kin favoritism occur. Professor Holmes' discoveries on
kin recognition and kin favoritism provided the foundation for subsequent research in
these areas and are considered to be general principles in the field of animal behavior.
Professor Holmes is well known for his outstanding teaching and mentoring of
students at all levels. For many years he taught the highly popular introduction to
animal behavior course as well as upper level courses in behavioral ecology and
reproductive behavior. He twice received the University of Michigan's Excellence in
Education Award from the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and he served
on the dissertation committees of students in anthropology, biology, natural resources,
and psychology. Professor Holmes' dedication to his graduate students was widely
admired, and his teaching and research did much to promote the study of the evolution
of behavior.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Warren G. Holmes
professor emeritus of psychology.
Wei Ying Wan, head of the Asia Library and librarian in the University Library,
retired on March 31, 2003.
A native of Taiwan, Mr. Wan received his B.A. degree from Taiwan Normal
University in 1952, his M.A.L.S. degree from the University of Minnesota in 1956, and
his M.A. degree from Wayne State University in 1959. After two years as a librarian at
the Detroit Public Library, he returned to Taipei as director of acquisitions for the
National Central Library and professor of library science. He was a librarian at the
University of Michigan from 1964-66, and served as head of the East Asia collections at
Yale University from 1966-69. He returned to the University of Michigan in 1969 as a
librarian and was appointed head of the Asia Library in 1981.
Throughout his career, Mr. Wan sustained a premier Asian materials collection
while guiding significant changes in the Asia Library, including the creation of


279




April Meeting, 2003


thousands of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean records and the development and
integration of electronic resources and tools within the library. He maintained excellent
relationships with the University's Asian centers and departments, from which the Asia
Library received valuable intellectual and financial support. Mr. Wan has been active in
the Association for Asian Studies, the Council on East Asian Libraries, and the
International Federation of Library Associations, and he served as a consultant to
numerous organizations, including the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations
and the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission.
Mr. Wan ably and graciously represented the library through his travels in China,
his engagement in professional associations, and by welcoming hundreds of visiting
scholars, officials, and delegations to the University. In 1981, at the invitation of the
Chinese Ministry of Education, he explored an exchange of publications with major
Chinese libraries, and in 1998, Mr. Wan was invited by the Chinese Ministry of Culture
to lead a delegation of East Asian Studies librarians to visit major Chinese libraries,
archives, and publishers.
The Regents now salute this librarian for his dedicated service by naming
Wei-Ying Wan librarian emeritus.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported to the Regents
this month.
Degrees. Provost Courant submitted for approval the doctoral degree list for the
April 2003 commencement, along with changes to previously approved degree lists.

University of Michigan for the Year Ended June 30, 2002.
Alternative Asset Commitments
Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow informed the Regents of the University's
recent commitment to the two follow-on funds of previously approved alternative asset
partnerships: Natural Gas Partners VII, L.P. ($20 million) and OCM Real Estate
Opportunities Fund III ($15.0 million). In addition, he informed the Regents that the
University had acquired a portion of the interests of a defaulting limited partner in Avanti

Interim  Chief  Financial  Officer  Slottow  submitted  WFUM-TV   and
WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM Statements of Support, Revenue and Expenditures for the
Year Ended June 30, 2002. Vice President Rudgers commented that WFUM-TV and the
stations encompassing Michigan Radio have been operating much more closely as sister
stations in the past year. She noted that Michigan Radio fundraising was up 14% for the
past year, and the television station had had record-breaking fund drives for the last three
drives. Corporate support had increased by 30%.
Regent Maynard observed that Vice President Rudgers and Chancellor Mestas had
done a superb job in working to assure that the television and radio stations would work
together in a positive way. Regent White commented that she had really enjoyed the
television programming over the past year.

the third floor, drawings of evening and daytime views of the exterior of the building, and
a view of the courtyard created by the building's design.


281




AApril Meeting, 2003


He pointed out existing parking spaces and stated that as part of the project,
parking capacity will be increased. It was noted that the facility is fully accessible.
There was discussion of the mechanical components of this and other buildings, with
the observation that some mechanical systems are exposed and obvious and some are
not. It was noted that there are cost issues and functional considerations that affect the
number, type, appearance, and location of mechanical components, but aesthetic issues
are also taken into account. The placement of the mechanical systems on this and other
buildings under construction is building-specific.
Regent McGowan moved approval of the schematic design for the College of
Engineering Computer Science and Engineering Building project, as presented. Regent
Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

AApril Meeting, 2003


Organization: Ms. Peggy A. Ball (new appointment) and Mrs. Diane Davidson
(reappointment).
2003-2004 University Housing Residence Hall and Family Housing Rates
Vice President Harper commented that the Division of Student Affairs is constantly
looking for ways to save costs, and it diligently pursues its stewardship responsibility for
costs associated with attending the University. The proposed rate increases will not be
funding any new programs; they are meant only to cover increased costs associated with
utilities, insurance, and life-safety renewal projects.
Regent Richner questioned whether the University has compared its housing rates
with those for the private, off-campus housing market.  Vice President Harper
responded that in general, off-campus rates would be higher, but said that figures would
be provided.
Regent Maynard stated that she will support the proposed housing rates, but that
she is "truly concerned about the pressure on students and their families" in terms of the
number of price hikes that they will be confronted with. She encouraged staff to
continue to look at ways to increase efficiency and reduce costs.
Regent Newman noted that there is a perception that facilities tend to deteriorate
as rates increase. She encouraged the division to address the deterioration of facilities,
especially in family housing.
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved average rate increases of 5.3o for residence hall room and board
and 4.3%O for Family Housing apartment rentals for FY 2004, as described in the
Regents Communication.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 3:36 p.m. The next

MAY MEETING, 2003


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Th ursday, May 15, 2003
The Regents convened at 1:40 p.m. in the Music Room, Henry Ford
Estate-Fairlane, on the campus of the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Interim Executive
Vice President Greenfield, Vice President Harper, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor
Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Chief
Financial Officer Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby,
and Vice President Wilbanks.
President Coleman called the meeting to order and announced that Public
Comments would be the first order of business.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Sarah Bates, student, on problems with student
health insurance policies; David Boyle, alumnus, on "Bhopal vs. the Beatles."
Recent Developments in Undergraduate Education at the University of
Michigan-Dearborn
President Coleman called on Chancellor Little. He noted that the quality of
undergraduate education has been a hallmark of the Dearborn Campus since it's
founding, but it has received increased attention during the past several years. He
called on Kathryn Anderson-Levitt, associate dean, College of Arts, Sciences, and
Letters, to give a brief report on the status of current and future initiatives underway in
this area.
Professor Anderson-Levitt described two current initiatives for nurturing
communities of learners at the University of Michigan-Dearborn as a commuter
campus: the Honors Program, which admits 50 students per year and consists of a
specific curriculum extending through all four undergraduate years, and the annual
"Meeting of Minds" program, a collaborative effort with the University of
Michigan-Flint and Oakland University. She also described a new program to begin in
fall 2003, First Year Seminars.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) Cardiovascular
Center Project - Phase I
Interim CFO Slottow noted that the architect for the Cardiovascular Center
Project, Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and Abbott, had been approved by the Regents in
September 2002. Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield commented that this
project is a very high priority for the Health System, as it will bring together all of the
specialties involved in cardiovascular care, to the benefit of patient care, teaching, and
clinical research.


287




Interim CFO Slottow commented that the original financial model has been
revised so that it is now stronger than it was when the project first came before the
board. The budget has been revised to accommodate 65 additional parking spaces and
to incorporate additional scope refinements, as described in the Regents
Communication.   He introduced Ms. Elizabeth Erickson, of Shepley Bulfinch
Richardson and Abbott.
Ms. Erickson noted that this is a visionary project located in the center of the
medical campus. She displayed a site plan, noted that cues from areas surrounding the
site were incorporated into the design, and illustrated how these themes come into play
for various elements of the proposed new structure. She displayed elevations of each of
the building's four facades that illustrate how each fits with the various building
functions and relationships with adjacent structures.  The project includes an
underground parking garage.
Ms. Erickson commented that the building meets the Master Plan goal for
permeability, allowing easy access to and from the site, and it also allows light into the
building and views into the building from the outside to maintain a feeling of
accessibility. She described the winter garden, which will be a year-round facility that
will serve as a place for reflection and repose for patients, staff, and family members.
In addition, because the garden spans all five floors of the building, it will integrate the
entire facility into one visual landmark.
She displayed plans for each level of the building, describing the activities that
will occur there and noted that the inpatient zones will match the inpatient zones of the
existing hospital. Finally, she presented a model which illustrates the building in the
context of the entire site and demonstrated the transition between the nearby high rise
and low rise structures and how the building serves as a source of light and
permeability. She noted that the project symbolizes the excitement, optimism, and
compassion of physicians and staff which leads to the hope for improving patient
outcomes and preventing or curing heart disease.
The Regents praised the excellent presentation given by Ms. Erickson. President
Coleman pointed out the ingenuity of the camouflaged placement of the parking garage.
Regent Deitch commented that a facility of this scope and attractiveness will result in
great patient care and will make significant, positive contributions to the operation of
the hospital.
Regent Deitch moved approval of the schematic design and revised budget for the
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) Cardiovascular Center
Project-Phase I as presented. Regent McGowan seconded the motion and it was
approved unanimously.
School of Public Health Buildings Renovation
Interim CFO Slottow introduced Mr. Jeff Riley, of Centerbrook Architects and
Planners.
Mr. Riley noted that this project involves demolition, renovation, and an addition.
He displayed maps showing the location of the School of Public Health and the existing
site plan. He noted that the School of Public Health consists of two buildings: one built
in the 1940s ("SPH I") and one built in the 1970s ("SPH II"), and pointed out that the


288




two-building configuration provides little opportunity for interaction among faculty and
students. The other deficiencies in the current configuration are the lack of any sense of
welcome and connection to the community and no cohesive image. The school also
lacks human scale, which is antithetical to the purpose and goals of the school.
Mr. Riley stated that following a series of workshops with faculty, staff, and
students at the School of Public Health, the concept that emerged was elimination of the
south wing of SPH I, its connector, and the bridge, to make way for what will be known
as the "community crossroads."  The community crossroads will bridge over
Washington Heights Boulevard to unite the two buildings and serve as the center for
community outreach programs.
There is a five-story tower over the two-story community crossroads bridge. The
tower will contain laboratories and offices and each floor will connect to SPH II. He
described plans for the interior of the community crossroads and noted that it will
include a cafe and outdoor terrace. He then described the proposed interior of the
five-story tower. Mr. Riley displayed a photo of a currently underutilized courtyard in
Mary Markley Residence Hall and noted that the cafe and outdoor terrace will overlook
it and connect visually with the new SPH courtyard, enhancing the accessibility and
sense of welcome of the residence hall courtyard. He also displayed drawings of the
other facades of the new buildings and photographs of the existing structures and
pointed out which portions of the existing structure are to be demolished.
Mr. Riley noted that the facade of the buildings will take cues from other campus
and community buildings and pointed out other exterior features of the project. There
will be a solarium that will become the symbolic landmark for the school.
Mr. Riley then responded to questions and comments from the Regents.
Regarding parking, Mr. Slottow observed that several new buildings and parking decks
will be coming on line. These include the Palmer Drive parking deck, which will
provide 400 new spaces this fall, and another 575 spaces early in 2006. The new
Cardiovascular Center deck will provide an incremental 65 spaces for faculty and staff,
and recently purchased property in proximity to these buildings provides an opportunity
for additional spaces. He suggested that a review of the parking plan for this area could
be scheduled for the October Regents' Meeting.
Regent Newman commented that the proposed SPH facility appears to block the
sun from Mary Markley Residence Hall, thereby disconnecting it from the rest of
campus. Mr. Riley noted that a number of sun angle studies had been conducted, and
he indicated that only a small portion of the residence hall will be affected, and not until
about 4:00 in the afternoon. He predicted that the pedestrian experience for students
from the residence hall will be enhanced by the inviting passageway and courtyard.
Regent Newman pointed out that Mary Markley houses freshmen students who are not
involved in the School of Public Health, and they will be disconnected and more
isolated from the rest of the campus. Mr. Riley responded that the first-year students
housed at Mary Markley will undoubtedly use the cafe and public spaces.
It was noted that a BSL III laboratory will be housed in the new structure. Mr.
Riley indicated that the new facility will provide a net increase of 79,000 square feet,
for a total of 365,000 square feet.


289




It was noted that Observatory Lodge, adjacent to the School of Public Health, is a
University-owned building that has housed graduate students and others and it requires
renovation. Mr. Baier pointed out that it is a historic structure that is not readily
adaptable to the needs of the School of Public Health.
Interim CFO Slottow commented that the School of Public Health building
renovation project has been the highest academic priority for the state capital outlay
request for the past four years. However, this project will now be funded by internal
sources, as it is not expected that capital outlay funding will be made available.
It was noted that the original project budget of $40 million, for renovation only, is
being increased to $70 million, encompassing a demolition, a renovation, and an
addition, due to the extra space requirements resulting from the rapid growth in funding
for public health research. Regent Deitch commented that renovations can be more
costly than new construction, and that the School of Public Health is one of the
University's true "centers of excellence." Interim CFO Slottow observed that the cost
per square foot for this project ($300 - $350) is consistent with that for other high-end
laboratory buildings; involves safety features, co-location and interdisciplinary space;
and is meeting the look and feel for the site denoted by the Master Plan. Although the
project could be completed on a smaller budget, it would not meet the functional needs
or design criteria and requirements.
Regent Maynard moved approval of the schematic design and revised budget for
the School of Public Health Buildings Renovation Project as presented at the meeting.
Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Law School Addition and Renovation Conceptual Design
President Coleman commented that this presentation would be conceptual only,
and that no vote would be taken. She noted that the project was being presented in
honor of Dean Jeffrey Lehman, who is leaving to become president of Cornell
University, in recognition of his efforts in bringing this project to fruition.
Interim CFO Slottow commented that the presentation involves only a conceptual
design, as the schematic design is not yet complete. It was decided to present the
conceptual design at this time because of the importance of the law quadrangle and
because the density is being increased in a manner requiring a high degree of
imagination, creativity, and skill. Provost Courant commented that due to his intense
involvement with this project, it was fitting for Dean Lehman to be provided an
opportunity to have the project presented even though schematic design has not been
completed.
Dean Lehman thanked the Regents for their support of him and the Law School
over the past nine years, especially with respect to the affirmative action litigation. He
noted that the Law Quadrangle was originally completed in 1934 and that there have
been two additions, both to house books, in 1955 and 1981. In the 1990s, Law School
officials learned from prospective students that while the Law School was a physically
attractive facility, peer institutions had far more desirable accommodations focused on
student life. A study was done, indicating that the school was about 110,000 square feet
shy of its competitors in terms of providing a modern campus for legal education.


290




It was decided that the new space should be built within the existing quadrangle
grounds but in a way that would not detract from or compete with the existing facility.
This led to the engagement of the Renzo Piano Building Workshop, because of their
expertise in this area. He introduced Mr. Renzo Piano to present the conceptual design
of the addition.
Mr. Piano noted that the goal of the project is to add space to the Law School for
educational activities, student services, and administrative activities. He said that the
goal was not only to add square footage, but to remove the incompatible 1955 addition.
He used a wooden model to illustrate how removing this addition reveals the south side
of the reading room, and how the remaining land over the 1981 underground library
addition can then be used to complete the quadrangle and make a more coherent
compound. The total addition would encompass about 80,000 gross square feet of new
construction over the library and an additional 80,000 gross square feet of new
construction in the existing "back pack" (stacks building) addition to create a new
student center with an entrance on the south side of the quadrangle. There will also be
38,000 square feet of renovated space in existing buildings (Hutchins Hall, Legal
Research Library, Smith Library).  The 60,000 square foot "back pack" (stacks
building) area will be removed to allow for new construction.
Following further conversation, the Regents commented on the extraordinarily
creative and innovative concept developed by the Renzo Piano Building Workshop.
They expressed enthusiastic support for the project and an eagerness to see it come to
fruition. Regent Deitch thanked Dean Lehman for his steadfast pursuit of this project,
and expressed the hope that he would return to campus for its dedication.
Annual Promotions to the Ranks of Professor and Associate Professor
Ann Arbor Campus. Provost Courant described the promotion review process and
noted that it is extremely rigorous and comprehensive. He highlighted the dossiers of
three individuals: Scott E. Page, being recommended for promotion to professor of
political science, with tenure, in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; Terry G.
Wilfong, being recommended for promotion to associate professor of Egyptology, with
tenure, in the Department of Near Eastern Studies and associate curator, Kelsey Museum
of Archaeology, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; and Rachel Goldman, being
recommended for promotion to associate professor of materials science and engineering,
with tenure, in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of
Engineering.
Medical School Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield highlighted the
promotion dossiers of three individuals in the Medical School: John V. Moran, being
recommended for promotion to associate professor of human genetics, with tenure, in
the Department of Human Genetics, and associate professor of internal medicine,
without tenure, in the Department of Internal Medicine; Juanita L. Merchant, being
recommended for promotion to professor of internal medicine, with tenure, in the
Department of Internal Medicine, and professor of molecular and integrative
physiology, without tenure, in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology;
and Ronald Bruce Hirschl, being recommended for promotion to professor of surgery,
with tenure, in the Department of Surgery.


291




Regent Newman commented that she has known Dr. Hirschl for many years,
dating back to their student days at Michigan, and he is truly a dedicated, remarkable
person and physician.
Regents' Committee Reports
President Coleman said that in deference to Regent Brandon's schedule, the
committee reports would be next on the agenda.
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee.  Regent Brandon stated that this
committee had met earlier in the day and was joined by Interim CFO Slottow and
President Coleman. Topics discussed included University Audits, the University of
Michigan Hospitals and Health System (UMHHS) budgets and financial performance,
developments in the state appropriations process, and the University's General Fund
budget. The committee also received a written report about the recent meeting of the
Investment Advisory Committee.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard reported that the
Compensation and Personnel Committee has been preparing for its June evaluation of
President Coleman's first year in office. She announced that the Board would meet in
executive session during the June meeting to conduct its annual evaluation of President
Coleman.
Regent Brandon left the meeting at this point, 3:45 p.m.
Annual Promotions to the Ranks of Professor and Associate Professor, Continued
Dearborn Campus. Chancellor Little noted that there is an unusually large and
high-quality cadre of promotions this year on the Dearborn campus. He highlighted the
cases of 2 of the 21 promotion recommendations, Cameron Michael Amin, being
recommended for promotion to associate professor of history, with tenure, in the
Department of Social Sciences, College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters; and Yi Lu
Murphey, recommended for promotion to professor of electrical and computer
engineering, with tenure, in the College of Engineering and Computer Science.
Fliint Campu.s Chancellor Mestas submitted seven candidates for promotion
from the Flint Campus. He highlighted the credentials of Stephen D. Bernstein, being
recommended for promotion to professor of English, with tenure, in the Department of
English, College of Arts and Sciences.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.
Consent Agenda
Mnu tes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of April 17, 2003.
Investment and Planlt Extension Reports. Interim Chief Financial Officer
Slottow submitted the Investment Report and Plant Extension Report.
iiuman Resources and Afirmative Action Report.   Provost Courant called
attention to the update on the University Policy on Sexual Harassment and
Faculty-Student Relationships.  A draft policy has been circulating on campus
stipulating that it will be the responsibility of a faculty member who is engaged in a


292




romantic or sexual liaison with a student to report that liaison to his or her supervisor,
and failure to report will be a violation of the policy. Should the relationship involve a
teaching and learning situation, either the situation will be changed or the relationship
will be terminated. The policy will be brought to the Board as an information item in
the fall.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research    Report.     Vice President Ulaby      submitted   the report of Projects
Established, April 1 - April 30, 2003.
University of Michigan       Health   System.       Interim  Executive Vice President
Greenfield commented that the Health System is featured prominently in the current
issue of Newsweek that focuses on pain management.
Division  of Student Affirs. There was no report from the Division of Student
Affairs.
University   of Michigan-Dearborn.          Chancellor Little    again  welcomed    the
Regents to the Dearborn Campus and noted that the annual meeting of the Regents on
the Dearborn campus is considered to be a very symbolic, important, and meaningful
tradition. Chancellor Little also thanked the executive officers for their collaboration
and the valuable assistance they consistently provide the Dearborn campus.
University of Michigan-Flint.        Chancellor Mestas reported that the Kennedy
Center American College Theatre recently honored a Flint faculty member, Caroline
Gillespie, with its John F. Kennedy Medallion for Excellence in University Theatre.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Ms. Angela Galardi, president of Michigan
Student Assembly, noted that the MSA monthly report includes a description of the
goals of and projects planned by the assembly's committees and commissions, along
with a set of themes and projects that MSA will emphasize for the coming year. She
said that MSA has begun planning a vigil to commemorate the September 11th terrorist
attacks.
Voluntary Support.        Vice President May submitted the report of voluntary
support for April 2003. He acknowledged the service of Kathy Okun, associate vice

faculty members.
Paul A. Adams, Ph.D., associate professor of biology in the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, will retire from active faculty status on
May 31, 2003.
Professor Adams received his B.A. degree from Calvin College in 1962 and his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1964 and 1969,
respectively. He joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty in 1970 as an assistant
professor and was promoted to associate professor in 1974.
Professor Adams took a particular interest in the education of introductory
students. In the mid-1970s he co-initiated the division of introductory biology courses
into major and non-major tracks and the development of the core curriculum within the
major track. Another of his special scholarly interests is the interrelation of science and
religion, especially the social conflict over evolution and creation, in which he sought to
defuse the conflict by defending the compatibility of evolution and Christian faith. He
has given numerous presentations on this subject to professional and community
groups, and he regularly taught a course, "Evolution Controversy," that incorporated
history, philosophy, theology, and the various natural sciences that impact this issue.
For his efforts in the field of science and religion, in 2000 he was awarded a Templeton
Course Prize by the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences in Berkeley,
California.
Throughout his career, Professor Adams has been a valued colleague and an
innovative and effective teacher. He was the driving force behind bringing the
department into the microcomputer age; his efforts resulted in the biology department
being the first academic department to be fully connected with e-mail, server-based
applications, and document sharing. He served as department chair from 1985-88,
during the period of the design and construction of the Murchie Science Building.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service by naming Paul A. Adams associate professor emeritus of biology.

Margo Halsted, associate professor of music (campanology) in the School of
Music and university carillonneur, will retire from active faculty status on May 31,
2003.
Professor Halsted received her B.A. (1960) and M.A. (1965) degrees from
Stanford University, an M.A. degree from the University of California-Riverside
(1973), and a practical diploma from the Netherlands Carillon School (1981). From
1967-77 she served as associate carillonneur at Stanford University, and from 1975-77
she was a teacher and chair of the music department at the Chadwick School. From
1977-87 she was a lecturer in music and carillonneur at the University of
California-Riverside. She joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1987 as an
assistant professor and University carillonneur and was promoted to associate professor
in 1998.
Professor Halsted holds a commanding position in the international carillon
world. Her performances are marked by an exemplary musical and expressive quality,
and her playing has brought acclaim from audiences throughout the world. She has
been featured numerous times at national meetings of the Guild of Carillonneurs in
North America, and has given recitals in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Copenhagen,
and Paris and at the Congress of the World Carillon Federation in France. She is also a
much sought-after consultant for carillon renovations and installations.  Professor
Halsted was awarded a certificate of exceptional service for editing the newsletter of the
Guild of Carillonneurs in North America for fifteen years.
Service figured prominently in Professor Halsted's career, from playing midday
recitals on the carillons at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Tower and Burton Memorial
Tower to performing at student convocations, graduation ceremonies, and other special
events. She served on numerous committees, presented at University seminars, and was
a guest speaker for alumni, civic, and service clubs. Professor Halsted has made
enormous strides in increasing the prestige and usefulness of Michigan's carillons and
is a valiant, indefatigable contributor to University cultural life. Few in the carillon
profession have accomplished as much as she has.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Margo Halsted
associate professor emerita of music (campanology).
Robert B. Helling, Ph.D., professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental
biology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 2003, after a distinguished career as a teacher and researcher.
Professor Helling earned his B.A. degree from St. Olaf College in 1954 and his
M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Pittsburgh in 1960 and 1963,
respectively. Following completion of postdoctoral studies at the Karolinska Institute
in Stockholm, he joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in
1965. He was promoted to associate professor in 1971 and professor in 1981.
Early in his career, Professor Helling conducted ground-breaking studies on the
regulation of uptake and metabolism of the sugar arabinose by the bacterium
Escherichia coli. In 1973 he participated in pioneering work to artificially propagate
("clone") DNA fragments. The resulting publications became some of the most widely
cited papers in microbiology. His work formed the basis for recombinant DNA
technology, and built the foundation of the biotechnology industry. Professor Helling
was also actively involved in the public debate on the safety and future of recombinant


311




DNA technology.   More recently, his research has focused on biochemical and
physiological bases for evolutionary change in microorganisms.
Professor Helling will be remembered as a warm and approachable member of
the department who gave freely of his time to students and colleagues alike. For years
he taught the core microbiology course for undergraduate majors, as well as many other
courses in the field of molecular biology. Professor Helling served as chair of the
cellular and molecular division of the Biology Department from 1982-84.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Robert B. Helling professor emeritus of molecular, cellular, and
developmental biology.
Stanley J. Jacobs, Ph.D., professor of atmospheric, oceanic, and space sciences
and professor of applied mechanics and engineering in the College of Engineering, will
retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2003.
A native of Wisconsin, Professor Jacobs received his B.S. degree from
Northwestern University in 1959, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard
University in 1960 and 1963, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1964 as an assistant professor in the Department of Meteorology and
Oceanography. In 1968 he was promoted to associate professor and received a joint
appointment as associate professor in the Department of Applied Mechanics and
Engineering Science. In 1974 he was promoted to professor in both departments.
Professor Jacobs began his career studying rotating flow as applied to laboratory
and geophysical phenomena on water waves and on hydrodynamic stability, resulting in
a seminal paper on the Taylor Column. While his primary research has been on
wave/turbulent interactions with application to oceanography, he has also published on
the problem of predictability in meteorology, and his work on the "slow manifold" set
the field on a sounder mathematical basis. Among his more important contributions are
his theoretical studies of progressive water waves, in particular, turbulent flow using
asymptotic theory and mass transport in viscous flow.
Professor Jacobs has been active in the department's educational program
throughout his career. He developed the physical oceanography curriculum, took the
lead in teaching the dynamics courses in both atmospheric science and oceanography,
and served on numerous doctoral committees. His contributions also included service
as associate department chair, graduate and undergraduate program advisor, and
program advisor for the Interdisciplinary Program.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Stanley J. Jacobs
professor emeritus of atmospheric, oceanic, and space sciences and professor emeritus
of applied mechanics and engineering.
Lawrence D. Kugler, Ph.D., professor of mathematics in the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, will retire from active faculty status on May
31, 2003, after an exceptionally productive career as a teacher, student advisor,
researcher, and administrator.
Professor Kugler earned his B.S. degree from the California Institute of
Technology in 1962, and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of
California-Los Angeles, in 1965 and 1966, respectively. He joined the University of
Michigan-Flint faculty in 1966 as an assistant professor of mathematics and was
promoted to associate professor in 1970 and professor in 1976.


312




Professor Kugler was the first director of the Math Field Day project and was
instrumental in bringing the event to Flint. This program, a state-wide mathematics
competition for high school students, is now in its 36th year of operation. He was also a
founding member and active participant in the University of Michigan-Flint
Mathematics Department Division Algebra Seminar, which continues to produce results
and publications. Professor Kugler is known for his extraordinary dedication to
students, and in recognition of his many years as a faculty counselor in the Academic
Advising Center, the University established the annual Larry Kugler Award for
Excellence in Student Advising.  Professor Kugler also has had a remarkable
administrative career, having served as chair of the Mathematics Department, dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences, interim chancellor, interim provost, and director of
the University's Honors Scholar Program.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Lawrence D. Kugler professor emeritus of mathematics.
Shirley A. Lockery, Ph.D., associate professor of social work in the School of
Social Work, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2003.
Professor Lockery received her B.A. degree (1971) from  California State
University-Los Angeles, and M.S.W. (1974), M.P.A. (1974), and Ph.D. (1982) degrees

Professor Nooden earned his B.S. degree from the University of Illinois in 1958,
his M.S. degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1959, and his Ph.D. degree from
Harvard University in 1963. Following completion of postdoctoral studies at the
University of Edinburgh, Scotland, he joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
assistant professor in 1965. He was promoted to associate professor in 1970 and
professor in 1976.
During his long career at the University of Michigan, Professor Nooden
investigated how the physiological processes of plant growth and aging are affected by
various plant hormones. He was one of the first researchers to identify the regulatory
effects of the DNA-binding proteins known as histones on the regulation of gene
expression, an area which has recently experienced renewed interest on the part of
molecular biologists. He conducted many important research projects on the role in
plant development of the plant hormones known as IAA and cytokinin, as well as other
hormones. Later in his career, Professor Nooden became a world authority on plant
senescence, and, together with Professor A.C. Leopold, he edited a major treatise,
Senescence and Aging in Plants, that has become a standard reference text in the field.
Professor Nooden taught courses in plant physiology and taught the major introductory
biology courses. He was particularly innovative in the development of teaching tools,
such as web-based tutorials.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service by naming Larry D. Nooden professor emeritus of botany,
Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, and professor emeritus
of botany, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.
Bruce Oakley, Ph.D., professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental
biology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 2003.
Professor Oakley earned his B.A. degree from Swarthmore College in 1958 and
his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Brown University in 1960 and 1962, respectively.
He was an assistant professor at Brown University from 1962-63, and completed
postdoctoral studies at the Royal School of Veterinary Medicine in Sweden and the
Department of Zoology at the University of California-Los Angeles. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1966 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1971 and professor in 1977.
Professor Oakley is noted for his dry wit and for his commitment to providing
opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in laboratory work. For many years
he taught a popular lab course in neurobiology; based on this course he developed and
published a lab manual that went through several printings and was used at a number of
universities. From 1990-2000 he directed a National Science Foundation training grant
that funded summer research fellowships for a large number of undergraduate students.
A neuroscientist, Professor Oakley is widely recognized for his contributions to
our understanding of the chemical senses, especially the sense of taste. A theme that
runs through his work is the reciprocal interaction between sensory axons that innervate
taste buds and the development and maturation of taste receptor cells; he pioneered the
use of new methods to gain an ever more sophisticated view of these interactions.
Professor Oakley was designated as a Jacob Javits Investigator by the National
Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in 1984 and received the Claude Pepper
Award of the National Institute of Deafness and Communication Disorders in 1990. He


314




was also elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science

JUNE MEETING, 2003


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, June 19, 2003
The Regents convened at 1:45 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and
Taylor.  Also present were Provost Courant, Interim  Executive Vice President
Greenfield, Vice President Harper, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Chief Financial
Officer Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent White was absent.
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She announced that Regent
White's absence was due to her service in the military reserves. President Coleman
announced that she had some comments on "an issue of considerable importance to our
community"
Comments by President Coleman
Sexual harassment and sexual assault are matters of great concern
to me. I've heard ifrom many in our campus community with renewed
concerns and want to make the University's commitment clear. Sexual
harassment and sexual assault are never acceptable.   Our campus
community must be a sakf and cotzmfrtabl plae e for students, faculty, and
staff  Each member of this community shares a responsibility to create an
atmosphere of respect and trust.
Our enfarcement efJbrts are extremely important, but enforcement
alone is not enough. A greater level of sensitivity and awareness is the key to
improvements in climate. Colleges and universities across the country must
continuously work to improve and invigorate their approaches to education
and prevention. I want the University of Michigan to be a national leader in
this educational effbrt.
The University will introduce a number of new and enhanced
educational programs and policy changes in the upcoming academic
year —activities designed to increase overall awareness of this issue As you
kno2w, we 've been hard at work on modifications to the University 's Standard
Practice  Guide policies on sexual harassment and on consensual
relationships between ficulty and students. This fall we will have discussions
about our recommended policy changes with campus leaders. In addition,
we will launch a series of' infrmational sessions on campus to communicate
about the changes, our leadership expectations, and the process by which our
community will enforc     e those standards.  I've also asked our Human
Resources and Affinrmative Action Division, along with the University of
Michigan's Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center to enhance the


321




June Meeting, 2003


University's annual sexual assault and sexual harassment education
programs for students, faculty, and staf beginning in the academic year
2003-2004. I will share more details about our plans in September, but I dlid
want to tell you about an anecdote that really brought this home to me that
mad me m realize we need to do much more work
0Some friends of mine, parents, are having their son come to the
University as a student this next fill, and they 've been involved in the
orientation process. Through the orientation process they heard about the
issues of sexual assault and how difficult that is on campuses nationwide, and
there were some training sessions that happened during orientation.
Through them, I learned that these mandatory training sessions are not
continued in the residence halls. The' can occur if a resident advisor
requests it, but they don't happen automatically. So one of the changes that
we 're going to 1make is to have mandatory training in the residence halls so
that all students will understand that this is really important. This will
extend to all of our students on the camps. So we're looking forward to
progress, and we're looking forward to high standards for all in our
community.
President Coleman then highlighted a number of University events and faculty and
student honors and accomplishments that had occurred during the past month.
President Coleman announced that Public Comments would be the next order of
business.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Donald Pacheco, staff, president of the UM
Skilled Trades Union, and Dave Dobbie, student, president of the Graduate Employees
Organization, on changes in University-provided health benefits; Raman Singh, citizen
and member of the Sikh Studies Association, on violation of the endowment agreement
between the Sikh Studies Association and the University of Michigan; David Boyle,
alumnus, on Bernard Robinson as a role model; Bradley Cambridge, alumnus, on
residency classification guidelines; and Chetly Zarko, alumnus, on modifying the
University's research openness policy.
Following a 15 minute break, the meeting continued at 2:45 p.m.
Report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) - Ann
Arbor Campus
Professor Fred Askari, chair of the Ann Arbor Campus CESF, presented the
committee's annual report.  He noted that economic compensation can be viewed in
several ways: publicly reported salary data, previously unpublished salary data in the
form of incentive and extra payments, and benefits. There are two components to the
benefits package: benefits for present active employees and deferred compensation in the
form of retiree health benefits. Changes in benefits have been a major issue of concern in
recent years. He noted that retiree health benefits are not funded through a set-aside; they
are paid for through a "tax" on active employee wages in the operating budget. He


322




June IMeeting, 2003


commented that this "tax" would be increasing dramatically over the next year, from 2.3%
of payroll ($24 million) to 3.2% of payroll ($39.5 million).
Professor Askari observed that a number of factors are combining to make the
current system of funding health care benefits from the operating budget more
problematic and noted that a number of efforts are underway to consider how to keep
the deferred compensation system secure. He pointed out that it is a long-term problem
that requires a long-term solution.
He reviewed the CESF report on faculty compensation and noted that it consists of
published and unpublished salary data from a number of sources. He credited the
Office of the Provost and SACUA staff for their assistance in compiling and analyzing
the data. He noted that in response to a request from a Regent following last year's
presentations, the reports from all three campuses have been coordinated to facilitate
comparison among the campuses.
Professor Askari stated that the goal is to present transparent salary data in order to
achieve optimal and equitable salaries, which will lead to improved job satisfaction and
productivity. He reviewed some of the study's conclusions and commented that major
concerns include the "loyalty tax" for long-term faculty; achieving transparent pay to
assist in understanding salary discrepancies and in learning how faculty can earn higher
incomes; understanding what is "optimal" pay and "equitable" pay; and adoption of
compensation guidelines. Future areas of study include tracking compensation by age,
year, and rank, and tracking compensation over time.
Regent Newman stated that the Regents would be interested in any insights
obtained by CESF on proposals for managing the unfunded deferred compensation.
Interim CFO Slottow commented that staff in financial operations are extremely
concerned about this future liability, and he noted that the University has established a
"best practice" of including the future liability in its audited financial statements each
year even though it is not required by the governmental accounting standards board. He
stated that he appreciates the focus that CESF has placed on this issue.
Report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) -
Dearborn Campus
Professor James Knight presented the CESF report from the Dearborn campus. He
noted that historically, the Dearborn campus has provided high-quality and high-value
education for which students have been willing to pay a somewhat high tuition. Growing
expenditures and a growing reliance on tuition create pressure to increase enrollment to
generate tuition income and a drifting away from the traditional themes of a
UM-Dearborn education. He warned against the consequences of increasing class size
and decreasing the quality of classwork.
Report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) - Flint
Campus
Professor Jami Anderson presented the CESF report from the Flint campus. She
noted that many of the concerns raised by the other two groups also pertain to the Flint
campus. Specific issues confronting the Flint campus include the failure of salaries to
keep up with inflation, salary compression, and low salaries for library faculty and


323




June Meeting, 2003


lecturers. She displayed charts containing data that illustrate these points and noted that
there is every reason that these trends will continue to get worse. Professor Anderson
concluded that in order for the Flint campus to remain competitive and hire excellent
faculty, these salary inequities need to be addressed.
Regent Maynard commented that she appreciated the efforts made by the three
campuses to make their reports more parallel to each other, as this makes them much
easier to compare and contrast. President Coleman thanked each of the committee
chairs for their reports.
South Campus Master Plan
Interim CFO Slottow stated that when the Regents approved appointment of the
architect for the Athletic Department's Academic Success Center, they also expressed
interest in receiving an overview of South Campus planning. As promised, the overall
master plan for South Campus was presented. This presentation is meant to illustrate the
planning that has been done to ensure that the Academic Success Center and other
proposed new facilities for the south campus area can all be accommodated in ways that
optimize the land use, maintain flexibility for the future, and respect the history and
environmental needs of the area. He introduced Sue Gott, University Planner.
Ms. Gott displayed maps of the current configuration of the South Campus area
and illustrated the evolution of the area with historical photos. She displayed the 1991
framework plan developed by Johnson Johnson & Roy and described the recent
program planning process undertaken by the Athletic Department which yielded the
most recent program plan, developed by the firm of HNTB (Howard Needles Tammen
& Bergendoff) in 2002. Concurrently, the firm of Andropogon conducted a study of
environmental issues faced on the South Campus. These studies provide a framework
for considering new facilities proposed by the Athletic Department in the Ferry Field
area.    Among these are the already-initiated Academic Success Center; a
multi-purpose, indoor fieldhouse; relocation of softball and baseball facilities; and
construction of a basketball and wrestling practice facility and recruiting lounge near
Crisler Arena.
Ms. Gott then turned to a discussion of the South State Street area and noted that it
includes the tennis and women's gymnastics facilities, some undeveloped property next
to Main Street, and a commuter parking lot. She displayed the HNTB plan illustrating
how baseball and softball fields could be arranged at the southern boundary of the
South State Street property. This was combined with the Andropogon environmental
plan to develop a framework plan demonstrating where baseball and softball fields
could be located. The proposed layout would accommodate the existing commuter
parking lot, additional commuter parking, and parking spaces for baseball and softball
games. Ms. Gott concluded by reiterating the University's guiding planning principles:
respect the historic context of existing architecture, enhance environmental systems,
and remain flexible to accommodate future programmatic requirements.
Regent Newman inquired about the current status of plans to update Crisler Arena.
Mr. Bill Martin, athletic director, noted that Crisler Arena is a University facility, not an
Athletic Department facility.  He said that although the men's and women's locker
rooms have been renovated, the remainder of the facility has not been touched since it
was built. He noted that the University and Athletics Department are working together


324




June Meeting, 2003


on solving this problem, but it will not be a high priority until a practice facility has
been constructed, which would make Crisler available for other uses on campus and for
income-generating use by outside groups.
Regents' Committee Reports
President Coleman called on Regent Brandon, chair of the Finance, Audit, and
Investment Committee.
Finance, Audit, and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and received information on two topics, Athletic
Department financial planning and the Life Sciences Institute.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard observed that one
of the major responsibilities of this committee is conducting periodic personnel
evaluations and that one of these evaluations would be conducted later that afternoon.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.

College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, retired
from active faculty status on April 30, 2003.


337




J une MIeeting, 2003


Professor Berkove received his B.A. degree from the University of Illinois in
1951, his M.A. degree from the University of Minnesota in 1953, and his Ph.D. degree
from the University of Pennsylvania in 1962. After receiving his Ph.D., he served as an
instructor at Skidmore College, DePaul University, and Colorado College. Professor
Berkove joined the University of Michigan-Dearborn faculty as an assistant professor in
1964 and was promoted to associate professor in 1967 and professor in 1974. He
served as chair of the Humanities Department from 1968-70 and director of the
American Studies Program from 1978-02.
Professor Berkove, whose major area of scholarship is 19th century American
writers, has published extensively on Mark Twain, Dan de Quill, Ambrose Bierce, and
Jack London. He edited five anthologies of essays and authored many other articles
that were published in prestigious journals and anthologies. In 1992, Professor Berkove
was awarded a Fulbright Distinguished Lectureship to South Korea where he taught for
a semester, and he is also the recipient of the Distinguished Faculty Research Award
from the University of Michigan-Dearborn (1992) and the Michigan Association of
Governing Boards of State Universities Distinguished Faculty Award (1993).
The Regents now salute this accomplished teacher and scholar for his dedicated
service by naming Lawrence I. Berkove professor emeritus of English language and
literature.
Harry K. Edwards, Ph.D., professor of computer science in the College of Arts
and Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, will retire from active faculty status on
June 30, 2003.
Professor Edwards received his B.S. degree from Youngstown State University
in 1962, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1964
and 1970, respectively. He began his teaching career in the Brookfield School District
in Ohio, and following completion of his master's degree, he worked as a
mathematician and statistician at the Detroit Diesel-Allison Division of General Motors
Corporation. From 1964-70 he taught at the University of Missouri-Rolla, and from
1970-72, he taught industrial and systems engineering at the General Motors Institute
(now Kettering University). Professor Edwards joined the University of Michigan-Flint
faculty as a professor in 1972.
Professor Edwards specializes in computerizing operations research and applied
mathematical models in industrial settings.  More recently, he has focused on
computing as applied and utilized by the community, thereby narrowing the gap
between professional development, community, and university service. His work
demonstrates his ability to integrate the theoretical and applied aspects of computer
science.
Among his honors, Professor Edwards has been inducted into Kappa Mu
Epsilon for mathematics, Alpha Pi Mu for industrial engineering, and Phi Kappa Phi.
In 1974 he was elected an Outstanding Educator of America, and he received several
distinguished teaching awards at the General Motors Institute. Professor Edwards also
served as chair of the University of Michigan-Flint computer science department from
1980-86 and 1995-98.
The Regents now salute this distinguished computer science educator for his
dedicated service by naming Harry K. Edwards professor emeritus of computer science.
Billy J. Evans, Ph.D., professor of chemistry in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2003.


338




June Meeting, 2003


Professor Evans received his B.S. degree from Morehouse College in 1963 and
his Ph.D. degree from the University of Chicago in 1968. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1969 and was promoted to associate
professor in 1973 and professor in 1979.
Professor Evans has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to helping American
youth develop their talents, work ethic, and sense of community responsibility. Upon
arriving at the University he noticed there was no place for students to socialize and
study in the chemistry department. In response to this need, he secured outside funding
to establish a resource and reading room that is still serving students today. He has also
made significant contributions at the pre-college level, most notably through his
collaboration with faculty from across the University on the Program in Scholarly
Research, which provided year-round opportunities for Detroit youth to conduct
authentic research. In the fifteen years of this program, there were more finalists in the
Westinghouse Science Talent Search from Detroit than in the previous forty, and all of
the Detroit finalists were program participants.
Professor Evans has been recognized numerous times for his scholarly
contributions. He was awarded a research fellowship in the basic sciences from the
Sloan Foundation for his work with magnetism and magnetic materials, and he was
chosen as a "sonderstipendiat" by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for his
research in high-pressure chemistry and physics of minerals, electronic and magnetic
materials. Professor Evans also received the Presidential Award for Excellence in
Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring, the National Catalyst Medal from
the Chemical Manufacturers Association, and national and regional awards from the
American Chemical Society.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Billy J. Evans
professor emeritus of chemistry.
Connie L. Greene, Ph.D., associate professor of nursing in the School of
Nursing, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2003.
Professor Greene received her B.S. and M.S. degrees from Indiana University in
1965 and 1966, respectively, and her Ph.D. degree from The Ohio State University in
1975. She taught nursing at Indianapolis Methodist Hospital School of Nursing from
1966-68 and medical surgical nursing at Ball State University from 1968-72. Professor
Greene joined the University of Michigan faculty as an associate professor in 1975.
While serving as director of the medical/surgical division, Professor Greene
introduced several new courses, including "Common Concepts for Developing Nursing
Care for Persons with Chronic Illness" and "Concepts and Theories of Nursing." She
was the primary advisor for graduate nursing students in their nursing and leadership
practica, and she co-developed the "Clinical Computer Assisted Simulated Exercise"
(Ccase). Professor Greene's most recent research was on hypotheses testing in the
context of clinical quality improvement. Continuous quality improvement program
evaluation has been a consistent part of her scholarly endeavors.
Professor Greene chaired several committees, and she represented the School of
Nursing on a number of interdisciplinary work groups that included representatives
from the Medical School, University of Michigan Hospitals, and St. Joseph Mercy
Hospital. She was one of two representatives from Michigan for the Nurse Faculty
Research Development Program in the Midwest (now the Midwest Nursing Research
Society). In 1997 she was honored as "Nurse of the Year" by the Washtenaw,

Livingston, and Monroe chapter of the Michigan Nurses' Association. She served as a
Michigan delegate to the American Nurses' Association national conventions in 1998,
2000, and 2002.

associate professor emerita of nursing.
Roland G. Hiss, M.D., professor of internal medicine, professor and chair of

Dr. Hsu excels in one-on-one interactions, and this quality has had a major impact
on his teaching and his clinical work. He served for more than ten years as the
nephrology division's coordinator of M-2 teaching, where he was always accessible and
available to medical students, house officers, and fellows. He also played a vital role as
a consultant in all areas of clinical nephrology, including chronic dialysis,
transplantation, general nephrology, and general medicine. In the mid-1980s Dr. Hsu's
interest in hypertension and calcium regulation led to a cohesive series of papers on


340




June IMeeting, 2003


abnormalities of calcium metabolism associated with the experimental hypertension.
These papers provided major insights into the mechanism of vitamin D resistance in
chronic renal failure and helped open up this area of investigation. Dr. Hsu was a
leading researcher in this area who made unique contributions to the field of
nephrology.
In 1998, Dr. Hsu was involved in an accident which nearly claimed his life. His
tenacious spirit and strong will helped carry him through this traumatic experience and

M.A. degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1963. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant curator in 1967 and was promoted to assistant archivist
in 1972 and associate archivist in 1973.
Mr. Scheffel's primary responsibility was to coordinate the identification and
acquisition of collections that document the history of the state of Michigan and the
activities of its people, organizations, and associations. He developed and researched


344




June Meeting, 2003


thousands of leads to locate material documenting the history of the state, and he
traveled to every county in Michigan to meet with potential donors, most of whom were
pleased to place their historical photographs, letters, diaries, and other documentation at
the University of Michigan.  Mr. Scheffel was patient yet resolute in forging
relationships over a period of several years until the leads became donors.
In the course of his work, Mr. Scheffel played a key role in developing a number
of core research areas at the Bentley Library, including politics and public policy,
ethnicity, religion, and education, and he consistently worked towards the library's goal
of developing a balanced acquisitions program that reflects all sides of public debate on
political, economic, and social issues. Because of Mr. Scheffel's efforts, students,
faculty, and scholars from across the nation and around the world have benefited greatly
from the availability of a broad range of historical records on the political process in
Michigan and the impact of individuals, institutions, and policies on Michigan's
citizens and society.
The Regents now salute this distinguished archivist for his dedicated service by

1978-83. She joined the faculty of the University of Michigan as an assistant professor
in 1984 and was promoted to associate professor in 1990 and professor in 1996.
Dr. Sedman is perhaps best known for two seminal observations in pediatric
nephrology. The first, recognition of aluminum as a potent neurotoxin in children with
end-stage renal disease, led to the complete discontinuation of the use of
aluminum-containing phosphate binders in children. Dr. Sedman also determined that
children born to women who took angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
during pregnancy had an increased incidence of hypoplastic kidneys. As a result of this
work, the Food and Drug Administration developed formal recommendations for the
avoidance of ACE inhibitors during pregnancy.
After being appointed chief of pediatric nephrology in 1992, Dr. Sedman built the
division from a small two-person group into an active and thriving team of five
physicians with an expanded research base and clinical practice and a fellowship
training program. In 1998, Dr. Sedman was appointed associate chief of the Office of
Clinical Affairs. In this role, she used her diverse skills and wisdom as an outstanding
clinician, mentor, administrator, and researcher to improve the quality of care and
patient safety at Mott Children's Hospital. Her cutting-edge work on the development
of the electronic patient navigation system, commonly known as CAREWEB, has been
a major advance for clinicians throughout the medical center.

Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy -Building Project
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that Preston Gumberich, principal with
Robert A.M. Stem Architects, would be presenting the proposed design for the Gerald R.
Ford School of Public Policy Building. Provost Courant commented that the new
building was necessary to house this school, due to the importance and visibility it had
gained in recent years. He introduced Dean Rebecca Blank.
Dean Blank commented that she had spoken with former president Ford that
morning and that he was very excited about this project. He had informed her that a
friend of his had decided to donate $500,000 in honor of President Ford's upcoming
90th birthday.
Mr. Gumberich introduced his associate, Jeffrey Provero. The architects noted
that the building would be located at the northeast comer of South State and Hill
Streets, a gateway to the central campus. They displayed a map of the site, a site plan,
and plans for each floor of the building, as well as a wooden site model. They noted
that due to the slope of the site, the building would have two entrances, one from the
north and one from the south, and this would encourage a good deal of traffic from


348




J une MIeeting, 2003


students. The building is designed so that the lower levels would be welcoming to the
University community and the upper levels would be more specific to the Ford School.
They reviewed plans for each floor of the building and noted that it includes a "great
hall" which would be used as a central meeting space or to hold large events. The
building includes classrooms, auditoriums, student services areas, a library and reading
room, computer room, lounge, office space for faculty and graduate students, and
research centers.
The architects concluded by displaying a rendering of the exterior and noted that it
contains elements of landmark campus buildings such as the Michigan Union, Michigan
League, the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library, and other structures, which make it
readily identifiable it as a University of Michigan building.
Mr. Slottow stated that the project budget of $32,000,000 would be funded by a
combination of investment proceeds and gifts. He noted that construction approval
would not be sought until the fundraising goal had been met.
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the schematic design for the Gerald R. Ford School of Public
Policy Building Project.
Perry Building Addition Project
Executive Vice President Slottow introduced Tom Birdsey, principal with Einhorn
Yaffee Prescott Architecture. Mr. Birdsey displayed a photo of the Perry Building and
noted that his firm had recently completed a renovation project for this building. He noted
that the addition would be a 4-story, L-shaped building to the south of the original,
historical structure. He commented that the floor plans were designed to accommodate
the flexible research teams used by the Institute for Social Research (ISR). He said that
the addition will be placed on the existing parking lot, which will displace about 45
parking spaces. The addition will be connected by a two-story entrance lobby to the
original Perry Building so as not to undermine the foundation of the original building and
to preserve its integrity.
Mr. Birdsey displayed a rendering of the exterior of the addition and noted that the
same materials would be used as in the existing building.  Regent McGowan
commented on the historical connection of the building and that her father-in-law used
to walk to the Perry School 90 years ago when it served as an elementary school.
Provost Courant observed that the Perry School Project, which was the original social
science research that established the efficacy of the Head Start Program over 30 years
ago, took place in this building.
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the schematic design and revised budget for the Perry Building
Addition project as presented at the meeting.

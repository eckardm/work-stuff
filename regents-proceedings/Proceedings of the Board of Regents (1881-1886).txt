AFTEIRNOON SESSION,

o'clock P. M.
Present, a full Board.
Professor Winchell appeared before the Board and made
a statement relative to the large and very valuable collection
of fossils now owned and in the possession of Dr. Rominger,
of this city. He asked the Board of Regents to appoint a committee to examine the collection with the view of a possible
purchase at some future time, should the financial condition of
the University permit. If no purchase could be made, he suggested the propriety of giving a place in the new museum building to the Rominger collection, provided that terms could be
made which would be satisfactory both to the Board and to the
owner of the collection.
At the close of the address of Professor Winchell, and of the
discussion of the question by the Board, Regent S. S. Walker
read the following report:
'The Committee on the Museum, School of Mines, and Astronomical Observatory, who have had in charge the con mmunllication of Professor Winchell, recommending the purchase of the geological collection of
Dr. Rominger at $3,500, would respectfully report tlhat they regret that
the condition of the finances of the University is such that at present
we can not recommend tihe expenditure. ''he smggestionl that the
collection could be deposited with the University, to be paid for at a
future time, does not meet our approval. We deeni the policy at least
a questionable one, aind though we hope tile collection may ultinmately
become the property of the University, and believe that it would be an

i


invaluable addition, we cannot at present see any method of securing
it.
The same committee have received a communication from Professor Steere, recommending the purchase from Mr. Covert of an interestino collection of archeological specimens at $80. We would state
that while the collection would be an interesting addition, we do not
feel that the expenditure of funds for its purchase would be at this
time advisable. We would recommend the appropriation of the
sum of $60, for the purchase of one microscope and accompaniments
for the use of the Professor of Zoology.
The interesting report of the Director of the Observatory on the
work of the past year, has been submitted to the committee and we
would recommend that it be published and that 400 copies be printed
for the use of the University.

bore the unmistakable stamp of genius. A mathematician of wonderful acuteness, an observer of almost unequalled keenness, an astronomer of profound and comprehensive knowledge, his untimely death

this opinion his colleagues who signed the call with him fully
concurred.

Cutcheon read the following paper, placed in his hands by the
Secretary of the Board:
DETROIT, MICE., March 5, 1881.
GENTLEMEN,-On the 27th day of January last a decree was rendered by the Supreme Court in favor of Dr. Douglas and against the
University, for $2045.80 and costs taxed at $1605.94; total, $3651.74.
I give you the date and amount of the decree, thinking it possible that you may not have them, as you were not represented by
counsel in the Supreme Court, and may desire to have them before
you at your approaching meeting, when some provision will be made
for payment.
Yours very respectfully,
SAMUEL T. DOUGLASS,
Solicitor for S. H. Douglas.
To Henry D. Bennett, Secretary of the Board of Regents.
The communication was accepted, and ordered printed in

enough to go round. I can get along with four more instruments,
with one eye-piece and objective each. Such instruments have been

to which your Honorable Body had referred back the matter of determining the amount of time to be required in the several branches of
study for the various degrees in the Department of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, have had the subject under consideration, and, at the
meeting of May 30th, adopted the following preamble and resolution:




34           SPECIAL MEETING, JUNE, 1881.
Whereas, The Honorable, the Board of Regents of this University, at a meeting in November last, referred to this Faculty a question
concerning the amount of time devoted to the study of Mathematics;
and
Whereas, The question so referred to the Faculty involves the
relative amount of time devoted to other studies in this Department;
and
Whereas, The subject in its different phases has been considered
with much care, not only by a special committee appointed for the
purpose, but also by the Faculty as a whole; therefore,
Resolved, That, in answer to the question referred to us by the
Board of Regents, we recommend the adoption of the following as
the studies hereafter to be required for the several degrees given in
this Department:
1st. In the Classical Course the "Required Studies" shall be
the following, viz:
Greek ----------     -----— __   -------— _ 16 hours.

But, after a student has completed seven hours each of Latin
alnd Mathematics, and eight hours of Greek, he may, at his option,
discontinue the study of either Greek, Latin, or Mathematics. Instruction is to be given in accordance with the following arrangement of
studies:
FIR.T YEAR,_ — f 1st Semester,  Greek _-___ — --  4 hours.

SECOND YEAR,    Any two of the three studies: Greek, Latin, and
Mathematios, 4 hours each for each Semester;

But the student, after having completed seven hours each of
Latin and Mathematics, and eight hours of the elementary course
in one of the Modern Languages, may, at his option, discontinue the

SPECIAL MEETING, JUNE, 1881.


NOTE.-The requirements for the Scientific Course have been referred to
a special committee; and as the Engineering Course has not been particularly affected by this question, no change in that has been recommended.
At the close of the discussion on the report, Regent E. C.
Walker moved that it be received, adopted, and printed in the
minutes. The motion prevailed.
Regent S. S. Walker read a report from the committee
which was appointed at the March meeting of the Board, to report a plan for the arrangement and care of the several museums.
On motion of Regent Climie, the report was referred to
the Committee on the Museum.
Regent Cutcheon read a report relative to the charges made

Microscopical Laboratories. At the close of the discussion, on
motion of Regent S. S. Walker, the report was referred to the
Committee on Finance, with instructions to report at the earliest
time practicable.
Regent E. C. Walker stated that he was in receipt of a
communication which might require some action of the Board
at some future time. He said the paper was of such a nature
that it would be proper to refer it to the Committee on the
Chemical Laboratory. Therefore he would move that it be so
referred. The motion prevailed.
Regent S. S. Walker presented a communication from Professor Pettee and Professor Prescott, and asked that it be referred
to the Committee on the Museum. There being no objection,
it took that course.
Acting President Frieze read the following:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, April 21, 1881. j
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN,-I hereby tender my resignation as Resident Physician and Surgeon of the University Hospital, to take effect April
30, 1881.              Very respectfully,
E. O. BENNETT.
On motion, the resignation of Dr. E. O. Bennett was accepted.

37


The Committee on the Department of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, through Regent Cutcheon, Chairman, reported
back the communication of Professor Moses Coit Tyler, and
moved the acceptance of his resignation, and recommended that
the letter containing his resignation be printed in the minutes.
The motion prevailed.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. 
June 2, 1881.  '
Dr. Henry S. Frieze, Acting President:
My Dear Sir:-It is known to you that several years aro I came
to the resolution of devoting my life to original researches in American
History and Literature, and to the composition of certain books upon
these subjects.  Since that time I have succeeded in accomplishing
some small part of the literary plan thus formned; but owing to the
meagreness of our University Library, and to our remoteness from
the great book-collections of the east, I have been compelled to do
my work hitherto in the face of most discouraging hindrances and
embarrassments. It was under these circumstances that I received during the past year a proposition for relief, through my removal to an
eastern university, at which I can prosecute my special labors with
the needed facilities-a large library of Americana, easy access to
other and still larger libraries of the same sort, as well as ampler
private means for the purchase of important books and documents
on my own account.
The proposition to which I refer has been carefully and anxiously
considered by me.  At first I was unwilling even to entertain it.  I
had no desire to leave the University of Michigan.  In its service my
labors have always been a delight to me; my official associates here
are my dear friends; in the long succession of classes that have here
come under my instruction, I have found multitudes of young men
and women who were to me as willing workfellows in noble tasks;
and in this happy sphere of robust and inspiring work, I had hoped
to spend the remainder of my life. In considering the problem before
me, however, I have been forced to regard as paramount the claims of
my literary vocation, and to sacrifice to it the immediate wishes of my
heart. After long reflection and with deep regret, I do, therefore, now
place in your hands my resignation of the Professorship of English
Language and Literature, to take effect at the end of the present
academic year.
I take the liberty of adding that the pain I feel in thus sundering
my connection with the University of Michigan, is in some measure
tempered by the thought that I am leaving the University, not in any




38


SPECIAL MEETING, JUNE, 1881.


hour of danger or of trouble, but in the full height of its great prosperity, and at the time when it can the most easily spare any one of its
members. Though I now go from it, I shall never cease to remember
it with affection and with gratitude, to be proud of my long connection with it, and to have faith in the greatness and splendor of its
future.
Faithfully yours,
MOSES COIT TYLER.

The following report was read by Regent Shearer, chairman of the Committee on-Buildings and Grounds:
JUNE 28, 1881.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN,-The Committee on Buildings and Grounds, to
whom, by resolution of March 23d last, was referred the matter of
advertising for designs and estimates for the proposed Litrary building, have to report: That they advertised as directed, and on the 15th
instant received three designs under the conditions of their instructions
to architects, and under the names, or mottoes, of "Owl," "Britannica," and " Library."
The committee met on the 15th and 16th of the present month and
carefully examined these designs. They find each to possess some advantages of convenience, or of safety, or of architectural detail, that
ar epeculiar to each. But neither of these designs seems to your conmmittee to embrace sufficient of these requirements to be recommended
for adoption entire.
They, therefore, in accordance with the advertised instructions to
architects, recommend: That the authors of the three designs be
awarded premiums as follows, viz: To the author of the design under
the motto " Owl," the sum of three hundred (300) dollars. To the author of that under "Britannica," the sum of two hundred (200) dollars. To the author of that under "Library," the sum of one hundred
(100) dollars.
This, in the opinion of your committee, is the order in which
these designs range for adaptability to the purposes required by the
University-the safety of book-rooms-and to proper architectural
detail.
The committee, under that portion of your resolution requiring
them to procure estimates of cost, have assumed —b fore making an
estimate-to so change the design named "Owl" as to embrace several
improvements they deemed necessary. They therefore employed an
expert for this purpose, and have to report that this design, changed

as shown by the accompanying plans f,r the basement and first floor,
and the section through the Reading and Library rooms, can be
erected and furnished complete within the sum of $90,000; leaving a
margin of $10,000 for unforeseen contingencies.
Your committee, in view of the change necessary to be made in
either of the designs submitted, have to report as within, without recommendation as to the adoption of either of the competing designs;
but ask that this report be accepted, and that the recommendation as
to awards of premiums be adopted.

Present-Regents E. C. Walker, Climie, Cutcheon, S. S.
Walker, Duffield, VanRiper, Grosvenor, and Shearer.
The plans for the contemplated Library building, in the
hands of the Committee on Buildings and Grounds, were now
submitted for the inspection of the Board. At the close of the
examination of the plans, Regent Shearer submitted his views
at length upon their adaptability to the needs of the University.
He concluded his remarks by saying: "He must admit that of
the several plans which had been received and presented to the
Board all possessed merit in a greater or less degree; still he
was of the opinion that neither of the plans as a whole would
be adopted, without making many and very important modifications."
Regent Grosvenor concurred in the views expressed by Regent Shearer, and suggested the importance of Regent Shearer's
visiting Boston for the purpose of carefully examining the matters under discussion.  He desired particularly that the plan




JUNE MIEETING, 181,


53


submitted by Messrs. Ware & VanBrunt should receive careful
consideration, believing it best adapted to the wants of the University at the present time. After further remarks by other
members of the Board, Regent Cutcheon announced the presence of Professor C. K. Adams, who had given careful attention
to the matter under discussion, and who was prepared to communicate valuable information to the Board, if desired to do so.
By request Professor Adams addressed the Board, stating
fully his views relative to the plans now under discussion.
He read an interesting communication of recent date, from
Messrs. Ware & VanBrunt, which contained much valuable information relative to the construction of library buildings.

the new Library building, be requested to go to Boston and arrange
with said architects for a modified plan of such building, wlich, if
satisfactory to him and the Committee on Buildings and Grounds,
shall be and become the accepted plan of said Library building.
Resolved, That Regent Shearer be authorized to employ such expert assistance as may be desirable in the above matter.
Ayes-Regents E. C. Walker, Climie, Cutcheon, S. S. Walker,
Duffield, Van Riper, Grosvenor, and Shearer.
Nays-None.
The following resolution, submitted by Regent Shearer, was
adopted:

viz: To Samuel J. Hall, the sum of $300; to M. E. Beebe, the sum of
$200; to E. S. Jennisoi, the sulm of $100.
Regent Cutcheon moved that the report of the Committee
on Finance be made the special order for to-morrow morning at

The motion prevailed.
MOI12ING SESSION,
WEDNESDAY, June 29, 1881.
The Board reassembled in the room of the President at 8'
o'clock A. M.
Present-A full Board.
Acting-President Frieze stated that the first business in
order was the consideration of the report of the Committee on
Finance, which was made the special order for this hour. The
report was taken up and read by Regent Climie. At the close
of the discussion on the report, it was received and ordered
placed on file.
Regent Cutcheon submitted the following resolution, which
was unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That the degree of Bachelor of Arts in course nunc pro
tune, be and the same is hereby conferred upon Hon. Aaron V. Mc
Alvay, LL. B., formerly of the class of 1868, in the Department of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, and that he be ranked with that
class.
The following report, relative to an increase of the annual
fees of students, was read by Regent Cutcheon:
The special committee, to which was referred the following resolution, viz.:
"Resolved, That a special committee of three be appointed to




JUNE MEETING, 1881.


55


consider and devise a plan for securing a permanent increase of revenue for tlhe University from fees, especially from persons not resident in the State of Michigan, and that said committee be instructed
to report at the regular June mneeting of the Board," would respectfully report that they have had the same under consideration,
and have given the subject that careful attention which its importance
merits.
That we require some permanent increase of revenue, not dependent upon special appropriations by the legislature, in order that
we may retain in our service our most valuable teachers,and carry on
the work of the Unive:'ity with a full measure of success, is too apparent to need to be enforced by any argument.
The only open question is from what source can such permanent
increase be derived, that shall be under the control of this Board.
The only source that seems to be available is an increase of fees
in some Departments, or a general increase to some class of students
in all Departments, as indicated in the language of the resolution.
When we examine the general statutes of this State relative to
the University, we find (Compiled Laws, page 1165) the following
provisions:
"(3492) Sec. 12. The fee of admission to the regular University
course in the department of Literature, Science, anu the Arts, shall
not exceed ten dollars. * * *
(3493) Sec. 13. The University shall be open to all persons resident of the State, without charge of tuition, under the regulations
presented by the Regents. And to all other persons under such regulations and restrictions as the Board may prescribe."
We perceive, tlerefore, that the policy of the State toward the
University has been, that as to resident students, that is to citizens of
the State, it should be as nearly free in its benefits as practicable, and
secondly, that a difference might be made between the Department of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, and those Departments whicn are
strictly technical and professional.
The reasons for this are obvious: Tlhe department of Literature,
Science, and the Arts is intended for those of comparatively youthful




56


JUNE AIEETING, 1881.


age, and more particularly as disciplinary in its purpose, while the
professional and technical sclools are designed for those mlore advanced in years, who have completed their disciplinary studies, and
are about fo enter on the actual work of life.
The ohe looks to the formation of mind andd character; the other
looks directly to the practical pursuits of life land the gaining of a livelihood.
It is presumable that when one has arrived at the age of professional study, he will be better able to pay something nearer an equivalent for the cost of instruction, than in his merely disciplinary stage.
We find, accordingly, that througthout the country higher rates
are cliarged for professional atnd technical instruction than for the
strictly academic, or what may be called gymnasial, studies.
To assist us in forming our conclusions in regardl to whether any
considerable increase might be made in the charge, or year tax, in this
University, we have investigated as to the charges in other leadino institutions, both east and west; and we append the results, in tabular
form, as follows:

It will be observed from the comparison that the cost of an Academic course at Michigan University is only about one-third of tiie
cost at any of the really first-class colleges and universities of the
country, and about the same as at the small colleges of this and the
adjacent states. But when the greater number of courses offered, and
the number of ilstructors employed, and the facilities and apparatus
for instruction are considered, it is believed that the disproportion is
really as great in the latter as in the former case.
We do not think, however, that so great a change is either
proper or desirable, as in the case of the Professional Schools.
In considering the fees to be charged in the Academic Department, it should not be forgotten that in nearly, if not quite all the
eastern institutions named there are usiually a large number of schol



JUNE iIEETING, 1881.


59


arships at the disposal of the institution and its friends, so that practically free tuition is furnished to a large number who are unable to pay
the regular fee charged, while we are deficient in any such scholarships,
and these charges will fall alike upon all.
The same state of facts does not obtain in the Professional
Schools.
The committee therefore recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:
1. Resolved, That the matriculation fee and graduation fee remain unchanged in all the Departments.
2. Resolved, That the yearly tax in the several Departments be
increased as follows, to take effect in the year 1882, to wit:
Resident students, Law Department..........................$30 00
Non-resident students, Law Department.................... 50 00
Resident students, Medical D partment....................... 25 00
Non-resident students, Medical Department................... 35 00

B. M. CUTCHEON, Chairman.
At the close of the discussion on the report, Regent E. C.
Walker submitted the following resolution:
Resolved, That the report submitted by Regent Cutcheon, relative
to an increase of fees, be and is hereby adopted.
Ayes-Regents E. C. Walker, Climie, S. S. Walker, Cutcheon,
Duffield, VanRiper, Grosvenor, and Shearer.

Regent Climie made a report relative to the mode of keeping the books and accounts of the University, suggesting some
changes which he thought were needed at the present time.

JUNE MEETING, 1881.


The following report was read by the Dean of the Department of Medicine and Surgery:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY, 
ANN ARBOR. June 2, 1881. 
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University:
In presenting the annual report of the College of Medicine and
Surgery, we are gratified in being able to say that the college year
just closed has been one of prosperity and success.
The lengthening of the course of instruction to three years, of
nine months each, has been more satisfactory as the transition stage
has become further advanced, and when it shall have been completely
passed, we now anticipate that the result will be more favorable even
than we had expected.
We are confident that an improvement in the professional scholarsiip and the practical accomplishments of those we have recommended for graduation has been made by the lengthening of the term
of study and the greater facilities of instruction now presented; and
we believe we are sending forth a class of practitioners of our art wlho
will aid in causing the profession of Medicine to take a higher position
of usefulness and of respect in the community.
The present Anatomical bill,passed at the late session of the Legislature, bids fair to relieve the lepartment of much embarrassment,
and to make this even more conspicuous than it has hitherto been as a
School of Anatomy.
As a School of Chemistry and Histology its reputation is already
established, and we are greatly desirous of making it equally conspicuous as a School of Physiology.
The work in the Hospital and Clinics has greatly increased during the past year. The number of patients examined, prescribed for,
and operated upon, before the class, is between eleven and twelve
hundred, between six and seven hundred of whom have been received
into the hospital.
Considering that these were nearly all cases of more than common interest, many of them having defied diagnosis and resisted treatment, it must be seen that a great amount of important information
has been imparted to the large numbers who have witnessed their
treatment.
It can no longer be said that the clinical advantages in our
School are inadequate to the wants of the students.  It is the genera1
impression that they see as great a variety of cases as can be fully profited by while pursuing their other studies.




JUNE MEETING, 1881.


61


The increase of labor which the lengthening of the term of
teaching, and the greater number of students, and the greater amount
of clinical and hospital work have imposed, calls for increased assistance and a slight increase of expenditure. This latter has in our requests been reduced to a minimum; as we have been able to secure
those who seek their chief compensation in the experience they will
obtain, and in their professional association with those whom they regard as masters in their art.
The specific requests we have to make are embraced in a series of
instructions to the Dean, which will be presented.
Respectfully submitted,
A. B. PALMER, Dean.
On motion of Regent Grosvenor, the report of the Dean of
the Department of Medicine and Surgery was received and ordered printed in the minutes.
Regent Grosvenor stated that the papers presented by Professor Palmer, contained recommendations and requests which
required further time of the Committee on the Medical Department for consideration.  He would therefore move that the papers be referred to that committee with instructions to report at
the earliest time practicable. The motion prevailed.
A report covering the work performed in the Physiological
Laboratory during the year just closed, was read by Dr. C. S.
Stowell, and, on motion, was referred to the Committee on the
Medical Department.
A report was read by Professor G. E. Frothingham, M. D.,
of the Department of Medicine and Surgery, which was received
and placed on file.
On motion, the Board took a recess to 2 o'clock P. ai.

received and, on motion of Regent Grosvenor, laid on the table
for the time.
On motion of Regent S. S. Walker, the Board took a recess
until 8 o'clock P. M.
EVENING SESSION,
The Board reconvened in the room of the President at 8

Present, a full Board.
Regent Grosvenor, Chairman of the Committee on Medical Department, read the following communication:
ANN ARBOR, June 28, 1881.
To the Medical Committee of the Honorable Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN,-In order to place myself in a proper position before you, allow me to say that it was through no fault of mine that I
did not finish the work required of me in the Chemical Laboratory.
I applied for a table, but, owing to the fact that the supply of tables
was not equal to the demand, I was obliged to remain out.
I remain, yours with respect,
C. C. HUFF.
The following paper was also read by Regent Grosvenor:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
CHEMICAL LABORATORY, ANN ARBOR, June 20, 1881. 
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
In the matter of the qualifications of Mr. Charles C. Huff in
Practical Chemistry, we recommend that the requirement be remitted
in his case, on the ground of his long experience as a practical pharmacist.                               A. B. PRESCOTT,
V. C. VAUGHAN,
P. B. ROSE.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan,
In behalf of the Faculty of the Horneopathic College I will state
that Mr. C. Cecil Huff has passed all his college examinations, ind

63


that passing in the above branches fairly entitles him to be presented
to your Honorable Body as a fit candidate for graduation.
Very respectfully,
E. C. FRANKLIN, Dean.
Regent Grosvenor submitted the following resolution, which
was adopted:
Resolved, That the degree of Doctor of Medicine be conferred
upon Charles C. Huff, in accordance with the recommendation of the
Faculty of the Homceopathic Medical College.
The annual report of the Demonstrator of Anatomy was

The following paper was read by Regent Grosvenor:
ANN ABBOR, Mich., June 30, 1881.
The Faculty of the Homceopathic Medical College hereby recommend Dr. I. N. Eldridge, to be appointed an examiner for this department for the next two years.
E. C. FRANKLIN, Dean.

On motion of Regent Grosvenor, Dr. I. N. Eldridge, of

The following communication from    the Dean of the Department of Medicine and Surgery was read by Regent Grosvenor:
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the Uniiversity of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN,-The Medical Faculty are under the necessity of
asking for a special appropriation for Dr. Hendricks, for special services rendered in the Department of Anatomy, during the session just
closed. These services were rendered on account of Dr. Ford's illness
and absence. They ask for $200.
A. B. PALAMER, Dean.

Resolved, That tlhe sum of $200 be appropriated and paid Dr.

The Committee on the Literary Department, to which was referred the resolution instructing them to consider and report on "' the
feasibility and advisability of establishing in that Department a
'School of Political Science,'" would report that they have had the
same under advisement, and have conferred with those upon whom
the duties of said school would principally fall.
1. The committee have no doubt as to the feasibility of such
a school.




JUNE MEETING, 1881.


67


It is believed that we have already in the University the means
of giving all the instruction that will be required for the establishment of the school.
The only additional expense involved will be, for the present at
least, a small salary for a Dean of the Faculty. The duties of this
office will be for a few years, in organizing and putting in operation
the new school, and in bringing it properly before the people of the
state and country, very onerous, and the Dean should receive a salary
equal to that of Dean of the Law School.
The inauguration of the school will also involve the transfer of
the principal part of the lecture duty of Professor Cooley from the
Law School to the "School of Political Science." Judge Cooley
would retain his position as Dean of the Law School, and would continue to give the Course in Constitutional Law in that school.
In accordance with our stipulation with Prof. Cooley, at the
time he withdrew his resignation, we are bound to relieve him of
such part of his duty as he shall request; and he now feels that the
time has come when he must claim the falfiilment of that stipulation,
by the omission of his routine lectures in the Law Course. le would,
however, be willing to assume the course in the new school upon Constitutional Law, the Government of Cities, and upon the Law of
Taxation.
This will necessitate the employment of a Lecturer to give his
other courses in the Law School. This change must be made soon, in
any event, and your committee believe that it will be wise to make it
now in connection with the establishment of tie new school, so tlat
the University will gain rather than lose in prestige by the change.
2. As to the advisability of establishing the school, the committee entertain no doubt.
It is demanded by the new movements of political thounlht
throughout the country. This demand is manifested by the organization of such schools at Columbia and Cornell.
Michigan University will be first in the field in the west, and we
believe that it will form a very attractive feature for the young men
of the great northwest.
We believe that it will draw to this University a considerable
number of additional students, sufficient, we hope, to more than compensate for the small additional expense.
We believe that this school can be inaugurated at the beginning
of the next Aclademnic year.




68


JUNE MEETING, Is 1.


According to the plan of your committee, the faculty of this
school would, for the present, be constituted as follows, to-wit:
JAMES B. ANGELL, President,

RICHARD HUDSON,

EDWARD S. DUNSTER,
Social Science.
VICTOR C. VAUGHAN,

VOLNEY M. SPALDING,
The Science of Forestry.
This list can perhaps be enlarged as the scheme is more fully
developed. Should tlhe Board decile to recall to the service of the
University Professor George S. Morris, a valuable course in Polit cal
Ethics could be added to this scheme.
During the absence of President Angell, your committee suggest that Mr. Henry C. Adams be substituted in the Course of
Political Economy; and should it be necessary to have the services of
Mr. Herbert Tuttle the conling year, a Course on Comparative
Politics could be added. That, however, is a question that is not
vital in considering the establishment of the sclhool.
The following courses of study would be offered, and requisite to
the degree in this school:
1. The Political History of Europe from the Renaissance to
the French Revolution.
2. History of Institutions in the Middle Ages.
3. History of Political Forms and Methods.
4. Political History of America before the adoption of the
Constitution.
5. Constitutional History of the United States from the adoption of the Constitution to the Civil War.

8. Political History of the United States since the Revolutionary War.

States.
19. Comparative Constitutional Law in Europe and the United
States.
20. Comparative Administrative Law in Europe and the United
States.
21. Theories of Taxation and Public Revenue.
To these courses (whicl are subject to modification in detail) can
be added others, as means, or the development of the school may
indicate.
The course of study in this school should cover a period of three
years.
The conditions of admission should be the completion of the
"required studies" in some one of the Courses of the Department of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, of this University, or the completion of the studies of the second year, of some other respectable
American College or University.
The degree to be given at the expiration and the completion of
the course is Doctor of Philosophy (PH. D.).
Graduates of this or any other respectable College or University,
may receive the degree on completing and passing an examination in
those studies in which they have not already made themselves proficient.  To such students the degree should not be given in less
than one year; and ordinarily two years will be requisite to complete
the necessarv work.
Residence in this University should in all cases be required of
candidates for the degree.
Your committee would recommend the establishment of the
"School of Political Science." in the Department of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, in accordance with the outline indicated in this report,
and that this scheme of courses of study be referred to a committee
consisting of Acting-President Friez,, Prof. Cooley, and Prof.
Adams, with power to perfect the details of the plan, and when so




70

completed to make the necessary public announcements thereof, and
that the school be organized so as to go into operation with the next
college year.
Your committee also recommend that said committee be authorized to name a Dean for said school, whose salary shall be three
hundred dollars, until otherwise ordered.
Respectfully submitted,
B. M. CUTCHEON, Chairman.

The Faculty of the Department of Literature, Science, and the

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1881.


89


to those recently established in the School of Political Science, as it
will be found impracticable and also unjust to confer the same advanced degrees on different terms in different departments or lines of
study. Therefore, as by the terms of the new School, the degree of
Ph. D. is to be conferred on candidates who shall have pursued certain prescribed courses for three years after completing what are called
required studies, (that is, in five years after entering the University),
it seems necessary that the Faculty should be authorized in like manner to offer the degree of Ph. D. to students in Philosophy, Philology,
Mathematics, and Natural Sciences, on completing courses of five
years; the first two being devoted to the so-called required studies. In
this way the terms on which the degree is received, will be made
equal and consistent in the whole Department.
Resolved, That the Faculty of the Department of Literature,
Science, and the Arts be authorized to adjust the terms or conditions
for advanced degrees, so that all students of the Department shall be
placed in this respect on a footing of equality.
Regent Cutcheon moved that the resolution just read be
adopted.
The motion prevailed.
The following resolutions, submitted by Regent Cutcheon,
were unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That Assistant Engineer Mortimer E. Cooley, of the

Regent Duffield read the following paper:
The Committee on the Library would recommend that the sum of
four hundred dollars be appropriated for the purchase of books now
needed by the new department, known as the " School of Political
Science," the said books to be purchased under the direction of the
Dean of the Faculty of the said school and the Acting President of
the University.
Regent Duffield moved that an appropriation of the sum
named be made for the purpose stated.   The motion prevailed
by the following vote:
Ayes-Regents E. C. Walker, Climie, Cutcheon, S. S. Walker,
Duffield, Van Riper, and Shearer.
Nays-None.

Very respectfully yours,
T. M. C(OOLEY.

Whereas. Since the last meeting of this Board tile Reverend
Erastus O. Haven, D.D., LL.D.,formerly President of the University,
and tile venerable (eo. P. Williams, D. D., LL. 1)., who for about
forty year s has served this University as a professor, and was at one

The testimonials adopted by the University Senate were as

At a meeting of the University Senate, held in the room of
the Acting President, August 5, I88I, the following testimonial
of respect for the memory of Dr. E, O. Haven, Ex-President of




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1881.


91


the University, was ordered to be placed on the records of the
Senate. It was also ordered that copies should be sent to the
family of the deceased and furnished to the press for publication:
Rev. Erastus 0. Haven, D. D., bishop in the Methodist Episcopal church, and an Ex-President of this University, died at Salem,
Oregon, on the second day of August, 1881.
Dr. Haven held the chair of the Iatin language and literature in
this University in 1852 and 1853, and that of history and English literature in 1854 and 1855, and the office of President of the University
from 1863 to 1869.
This Senate has received with profound grief the intelligence of
his death. Cut down suddenly, almost at the beginning of the sacred
duties of the high and responsible office to which he had been called
by the church of his choice, while still strong and vigorous, and, to
all appearance, capable of doing good service in the cause of his Master for many years to come, he has left a record of great and manifold
and fruitful labors to perpetuate his memory, and to console the multitude of friends, brethren, and associates who mourn his loss.
The uninterrupted successes of his life, from the day of his
graduation at Middletown to the day of his death in Oregon, were due
to his unwavering faith in Christ, his indomitable energy, his ready
adaptation to circumstances, his versatility of talent and breadth and
variety of attainment, his prudence and tact in administration, and,
not least, his remarkable facility and felicity of expression in writing,
and especially in public speaking.
He was elected to many and honorable positions, involving
either educational, ministerial, or literary labors, but among all the
high duties to which he was called, none did he discharge with more
distinguished ability than those of th. presidency of this University.
During the six years of his administration the attendance of undergraduates was constantly increasing, while the institution was steadily
progressing in its proper work and growing in popular favor. Nor
less was his administration distinguished for the internal harmony and
unity promoted by his large and kindly spirit, which at the same time
attached all members of the University heartily and firmly to his person.
This University will ever cherish and honor the memory of
President Haven, and while it mourns his death it is thankful for the
good which a kind Providence has permitted him to achieve not only
here but in many fields of beneficent enterprise.




92


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1881.


The Senate, while thus expressing its sense of the loss sustained
by education and religion in the death of Bishop Haven, desires most
sincerely and respectfully to extend its sympathies to the family so
suddenly visited by a mysterious but wise and merciful Providence
with this great sorrow and heaviest of earthly bereavements.
By order of the Senate.
HENRY S. FRIEZE,
Acting President.
CHARLES K. ADAMS, Secretary.
At a meeting of the University Senate, held September 5,
i88I, the following memorandum, relative to the death of Professor George P. Williams, was ordered to be placed in the minutes:
With profound emotions the Senate of the University has received intelligence of the death of its oldest member, Professor
George Palmer Williams. Yesterday, at sunrise, he expired without
a struggle, at the ripe age of seventy-nine years and four months.
By this death is severed the last of those living links that connect the present condition of the University with its earliest history.
Appointed to a professor's chliir in 1841, Dr. Williams welcomed the
first student that came to Ann Arbor for instruction; as President of
the Faculty, he gave diplomas to the first class that graduated; and
from the day of his appointment to the hour of his death his official
connection with the University was never broken.
During the whole of this long term of educational service many
qualities of a high order shone out with peculiar luster in the life of
Dr. Williams.
His loyalty and devotion to the University were without reserve;
his faith in the principles on which the institution is founded was un
flagging; and the interest with which he watched the various phases of
its development ended only with the approach of death. On the last
day of his life his conversation frequently turned upon its condition
and its interests.
In his intercourse with his colleagues he was remarkable for the
dignified courtesy of his bearing, the hearty warmth of his greetings,
and the radiant humor of his conversation. His wit was proverbial;
but it was so free from the bitterness of malice and the stings of sarcasm that it was always a source of pleasure, never a source ot pain."
To meet him was always a pleasure; to take his hand always a satisfaction.
But it was in his relations with his pupils that the peculiar qual



SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1s31,


93


ities of his nature were most marked. In extraordinary measure he
impressed upon them his own character. Of the hundreds that sat
under his instruction many, perhaps, have forgotten the science he
taught; but there is probably not one that does not feel that he was:made better by his friendly admonition or his fatherly advice. His
bearing was felt to be a rebuke of every mean act. His interest in all
his pupils had the gentle qualities of a personal and almost a paternal
fondness; and hence it was but the natural and spontaneous expression of his heart that even to the end of his life he spoke of them all
as "his boys." By his boundless sympathy and his fatherly interest
many a wayward youth was turned into the path of true advancement; and there are not a few who look to his words and his influence
-as the beginnings of a new life. There are some who, if they would,
might say with Samuel of old: "Thy gentleness hath made us great."
As the intelligence of the death of Dr. Williams goes over the
country, it will fall upon hundreds of hearts with the shock of a personal bereavement. Probably in every State in the Union there are
those who will mourn his loss; but there is not one of his pupils who
will not remember the lofty nobility of his character and the all-embracing charity of his affection, and who will not rejoice that it was
his privilege to sit under the instruction of so true a friend and so
good a man.
We extend our hearty sympathies to the family of our friend in
the hour of their bereavement; and we desire in a body to join with
them in the last sad tribute to his earthly remains.
The following resolution, presented by Regent S. S. Walker,
was adopted:
Resolved, That the legal representative of the late Rev. George
P. Williams, Emeritus Professor of Physics in the University, be and
is hereby authorized to sign the pay roll for the salary of the quarter
-ending September 30, 1881.

Present-A full Board, except Regent Cutcheon.
Acting President Frieze stated that his annual report had

The report was read, as follows:
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
In presenting the report for the academic year just closed, my
first words must be those of thanksgiving to the Author of all good
for the continued and increasing prosperity of this University. The
institution which in its first catalogue numbered fifty-three students,
enrolls in the calendar of its fortieth year fifteen hundred and thirtyfour. In the forty years of its existence it has met with many perils;
but it has been brought to the end of them all, not only in safety, but
with improved vitality and strength. We cannot hope that no storms
await us in the future; but we can trust with confidence that the University, having passed safely through the dangers of her infancy, will
now, in her mature strength and vigor, meet all perils unharmed. Yet
if there is one thing which more than any other animates the friends




ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 97


of the University with hope and confidence in its stability and advancement, it is the resolution, I may say the stern resolution, manifested by the people to elect to the regency none but men of eminent
dignity and worth; none but men of distinguished ability and of large
experience; men well known, not only to the State, but to the country; men nominated to this high office, not through any influences
of selfish ambition or personal interest, but with the sole and single
purpose of promoting the welfare of an institution that the State recognizes and cherishes as one of the vital parts of the commonwealth.
The last academic year has been fortunate on account of renewed
manifestations of the favor in which the University is held by the
State, on account of largely increased attendance, and on account of
internal progress accompanied with order and industry.
In my last report your attention was called to several pressing
needs of the University, the most urgent of which was a new building
for the accommodation of our General Library. You were already
too familiar with the inadequacy and unfitness of the apartment at
present employed, to require any proof from the Faculties of the
necessity of a change. But statements and arguments were needed
with which you might be able to convince the Legislature that a real
necessity existed, and that a large appropriation for this object could
be reasonably asked fior. Such statements were furnished by the
Committee on the Library, by the Dean of the Law Faculty, by the
Professor of History, and by the Librarian; and these in the hands of
the special committee of the Board, together with its own presentation
of the subject to the legislative committees, secured to us a favorable
hearing, and an appropriation of the whole amount asked for.
This appropriation, with the addition of others, some of which
were for special purposes, and others for the support of schools
already created by virtue of legislative enactments, made the munificent amount of $160,000. When the representatives of the people
respond thus generously to the appeals of the State institutions, we
feel that there was justice in tie remark of the lamented Governor
Bagley, that the University could safely rest on the bosom of the State.
Proper steps were immediately taken by the building committee
of the Regents to obtain plans and specifications for the proposed
Library Building; and the design which has been finally adopted, that
of Mr. Van Brunt, of Boston, an architect eminent for successful
experience in planning and constructing buildings of this kind, is
confidently believed by all who have examined it with care, to be admirably adapted to the peculiar wants of this University. It is grati.
fying to add that the proposition which has been accepted by the
Board from one of the most experienced and most trustworthy con



98 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 18831


tractors in the State, brings the cost of the building completely within
the amount appropriated; a result that is the more gratifying, as fears
have been frequently expressed that a building in every respect such
as was needed could not be erected within the limits of the appropriation. The foundations will be completed during the present season,
and it is hoped that the new building will be ready to receive the
library at the opening of the first semester of 1882.
Of the other improvements on the grounds of the University,
provided for by the minor appropriations above spoken of, the Eye
and Ear Ward, to be added to the University Hospital, will be in readiness for the work of the ensuing semester; and the sewer, designed
to give effectual dlainage to the campus by connecting it with the
river, is in rapid progress.
By another enactment of the Legislature, the University Hospitals are authorized to afford accommodations to sick and diseased
children brought for treatment from the State School at Coldwater.
Turning now to the internal operations of the University, I note
first the organization of the new School of Political Science. I regard
this step as one of great significance, on sev ral accounts. First, it
adds to the various courses of training in the University one that is
loudly called for by the circumstances of the State and country. Precisely where government touches us most nearly, where our personal
interests and conveniences are most affected by it, that is, in the subordinate and minor functions of administration, there we are contina
ually suffering from the ignorance and unfitness of officials. Proper
training for the duties of the public bureaus and of the civil service
in general, is a necessity the more deeply felt as the business of the
government becomes more extended and more vast and complicated.
In some European countries, particularly in France and Germany,
provision has long been made for this branch of education. One of
the earliest schools of this kind, if not the oldest, was organized in the
University of Tilbingen. I became well acquainted, when residing
in that city ten years ago, with the Dean of the Faculty of this school,
who was also in charge of the department of "Forest-culture," or
"Forestry," in the same school. And I observed that the work of
this Professor and of his Faculty had a more immediate and practical
bearing on the social interests of the kingdom in which it is situated,
than any other department of that University. From no other Faculty, at least, does the community derive more immediate and real
benefit. The successful experience of other lands assures us of the
advantages to be derived from the organization of such schools in
American universities, and encourages us to believe that in our own
case, we are taking a step in the right direction. It may turn out,




ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 99


indeed, that education and fitness will have no more to do with civil
appointments in the future than in the past, and that schools of Political Science, so far as they have a professional or technical character, in aiming to train men for the civil service, will secure a state of
things no better than that which already exists. Let us hope, however, that public opinion will at length demand a reform.
But, second, this School has another object in view quite as important as the improvement of the civil service, and of no less general interest. It would be a grave mistake to suppose that its purpose
is to educate exclusively and specifically for the public service. It
aims to give its students a large and thorough prelaration for the duties that will devolve upon them as citizens and members of society.
It opens to them a wide range of history, wherein they may learn to
estimate aright the conditions either of social good or of social evil,
the conditions of national prosperity or of national ruin. The courses
offered to them in jurisprudence, in constitutional law and history,
in legislative and parliamentary forms, and in administrative methods
and usages, are designed to fit them for those public duties to which
every citizen is liable to be called. There are also studies in political
economy and international law, and studies in sanitary science, all
combining with the rest to make up a course of advanced and practical education which can hardly fail to make of those who pursue it to
the end, intelligent and useful citizens and members of society.
Third, the condition which requires that those who enter upon
these studies shall have previously completed all the required studies
of some one of the Academic courses, in other words, shall have
reached the end of what is commonly termed " the Sophomore year,"
will have the effect to make that period, so far as relates to this School,
the point of separation between the secondary and the higher, or
university education. And, therefore, very properly, it seems to me,
the degree which the student receives on passing the final examination of this School, should be the distinctively university degree of Doctor of Philosophy.
Fourth, it necessarily follows that the same period should be
adopted as the point of separation between the required or secondary
work and the advanced or university work in all other branches or
departments of study; that is, in philosophy, in philology, in literature, and in the mathematical and natural sciences, not less than in the
political and economical sciences. The same point of departure has
already been established in the School of Engineering. It also follows
that all these other advanced courses of study, just as in the School ot
Political Science, should end in the higher degrees.




100 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


Fifth, as a logical consequence, these several classes of advanced
or university courses would be grouped or associated according to their
affinities, and conducted by special Faculties, organized, like that of
Political Science, in connection with the Department of Literature,
Science, and the Arts. The studies in Civil, Mining, and Mechanical
Engineering, are already grouped in this way, and the officers in
charge of them are virtually a Faculty of a School of Enginleering.
The other classes of studies would naturally be combined, according to
the usual university classification, under Faculties of Philosophy and
of Science. The Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts would
thus, without losing its unity, or changing its general organization, be
subdivided and organized for specific University work, so as to constitute four special Faculties; namely: a Philosophical Faculty, a Scientific Faculty, a Faculty of Engineering, and a Faculty of Political
Science. Such, in fact, is the division of studies and Faculties already
existing in some of the best universities of the world. Nothing, I believe, can better promote the proper work of the University, give more
efficiency to its teaching, and more rapidly secure to it the character
to which it aspires, than the completion of such an organization.
Is it wise and proper to terminate the secondary or gymnasial
training at the end of the second Aeademic year?  Is it right to confer an advanced or university degree after three years of university
work, or, as things now are, at the end of the fifth year of residence?
These questions must be answered with rejerence to the educational system
of Michigan.
If there existed in this country a national system  of education, the time and attainment necessary for the successive stages of
that education would be fixed by the laws of that system. But as
there is no national system, and    as very few   even of the
individual States  have  any  complete  system,  the State of
Michigan, which has aimed from the beginnillg to build up and
maintain a complete system of public instruction, must establish for
herself all the conditions of progress in that system through all the
successive stages from the first to the last. The question for us, then,
is,where and when in the State system of Michigan should secondary or
prescribed education terminate, and where should the special or higher
university work begin?  In France the secondary education ends
with the Lyceum,when the student has reached his eighteenth or nineteenth year; and it is then that he receives the Bachelor's diploma in
letters or science. For in France the title of Bachelor of Arts is not
employed. In Germany it is the Gymnasium which performs the
whole work of the secondary education. At the age of nearly nineteen the student proceeds from the Gymnasium to the University, and




ADJO URNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 101


immediately enters upon professional or special university studies. In
our State system the High School comes quite near to the French
Lyceum in its work of secondary instruction. It leaves the graduate
one year short, perhaps, of the attainment of the graduate of the Lyceum, and still farther behind the graduate of the German Gymnasium. If it were possible to add one year to the course in our High
Schools, the secondary work could be completed in these quite as perfectly as in the French Lyceum, though less perfectly than in the
Gymnasium. And if such an advancement could be made in the work
of our High Schools, the work of the University would be much more
effective, not to say much less expensive.  Also, the State system
would thus be made perfect; the High Schools assuming the whole of
their proper work, that is, the secondary education, and the University being relieved of all that is not strictly of a University character. Thus, the youth of our Stat, completing their prescribed studies
in the High School at the age of nineteen or twenty, would enter at
once upon the studies that lead to the higher degrees.
But it is not probable that our High Schools will add to their courses
that part of the secondary work which at present is done by the University. The prescribed or "required studies" for many years to come
will be completed in the first two years of residence at the University.
The answer, therefore, to the first question is this: in the Michigan system, for the present at least, the secondary education must be
completed, not in the High School, but in the University; and end
with the " required studies," or about two years after matriculation.
The age at which the youth of Michigan pass from the secondary
to the higher work in the University is a little upwards of twenty.
Thus they are about two years older than German students at the same
stage of education. There is, therefore, no reason to fear that in giving our students at this point perfect university privileges, that is,
perfect freedom of choice in studies and amount of work, we incur
any risk of lowering the standard of the higher education. Unless,
indeed, our American youth are supposed to have so much less capacity
forattainment, and so much less maturity of judgment, that they cannot
be trusted at twenty or twenty-one with the freedom accorded to
the German student at eighteen or nineteen.
And what an immense advantage would be secured to our public
instruction, if this same stage of advancement were established as the
line of separation, not only between the secondary and the higher
education in literature, science, and philosophy, but also between the
secondary education and that of the professional schools; if these latter were to require all candidates for professional degrees to complete
som e one of the four plans of required studies in the High School and




102 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


University, generally embracing the first two years of study in the
Literary Department, before entering upon the work of the technical
or professional school. Our system would then be complete and systematic.  The professional education would then stand where it
ought to have been placed at the first, on the same level of intellectual
attainment as that of the Literary Department. Whether prepared in
the classical or non-classical courses of study, the students of all Departments of the University would have passed through the same period in preliminary training, completing some form of secondary education, and, at the,nd of their university work, would have reached
a degree of attainment equal in amount, however different in kind.
If this amount of attainment, and this only, were required, no injustice or hardship could possibly be complained of on the part of
candidates for the professional degrees. Such a requirementwould be
entirely reasonable, if we consider the opportunities afforded by our
preparatory schools, and by the first two years of the Academic Department of the University. To demand more than this, that is, to
require of the professional student a preparation of four years in "college," after the work of the grammar and high schools, I think, would
be injustice and hardship.
And just here, no doubt, our traditional collegiate course of four
years was ill-adapted to the educational circumstances and wants of
the country; or, at least, to those of Michigan. Our youth could not
be expected, in a region but recently settled, and still imperfectly developed in resources and industries, where all the circumstances of
life stimulated the new population to intense activity, to devote more
years to scholarly preparation than are asked of the youth of Germany, England, and France. If long years of study can be properly
demanded anywhere, preliminary to the special training for the professions, certainly it would be of the youth of those older countries,
where men have abundant leisure, rather than in these western lands,
where "time is money." But the German youth regularly enter upon their professional studies in the University at the age of eighteen
or nineteen.* How, then, can our Michigan student be expected to
wait until he is twenty-four? But this would be the case, if he were
not permitted to take up the study of Law or Medicine before the
completion of the four years of college work preliminary to the Bachelor's degree. The American student, particularly the western student, of average means and opportunities, could not comply with such
a requirement, if it existed. Medical and Law Schools cannot justly


* See Matthew Arnold: Higher Schools and Universities in Germany,
page 9.




ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.                  103
demand it. It cannot be insisted upon even by Schools of Theology.
Hence, a large majority of the students in our professional schools,
and especially in our western schools, are admitted either with very
slight academic preparation or without any preparation whatever.
The professional schools cannot be excused for admitting students
without respectable preparation. They should insist, at least, upon
that afforded by the High School; but they cannot be censured for
not requiring a preparation of four years in addition to that of the
High School.
If we were just entering upon our history as a State, just laying
out the plan of our public education, in the light of past experience,
and with the prospect of unlimited means, we should probably agree
upon a system substantially as follows. There would be primary,
grammar, and high schools, with studies well systematized, uniform
in their grade, and logically progressive. As experience shows that
the secondary education, if left entirely to either local action or private enterprise, is always unstable and unequal, the State itself should
make provision in the constitution, just as in the case of primary
schools, so also for the aid of high schools, by contributing to every
city or combination of districts which will organize such a school, a
certain proportion of the expense from the public funds. These high
schools would embrace in their courses all the legitimate work of the
secondary education. They would do work of the same grade as that
of the French Lyceum or of the Germa!n Gymnasium; only somewhat more varied and comprehensive. If any Bachelors' degrees were
conferred, they would be conferred at the end of this secondary course,
as in France. If not conferred at this period, I would follow the
German schools in omitting them altogether. Our Michigan student
thus prepared in the high school work of six or seven years instead of
three or four, as at present, and with his certificate of proficiency,
either in classical or non-classical required studies, would enter with
equal advantage either of the Departments of the University. Tlhe
University, as now, would be the key-stone of the system; but it
would be no longer encumbered with any of the work of secondary
education. All its resources, all its labor, would be expended upon
the legitimate work of a genuine university. In general the minimum
of residence at the University required for a degree would be three
years, as at Oxford or at Leipzig, instead of four, as at Harvard and
at Yale; and the degrees conferred would be those that properly mark
the close of university studies and successful examinations: the Master's degree in Arts, the Doctor's degree in Philosophy, and those
which are called professional degrees. Of course, in the genei'al plan
of education for the State, provision should be made for Normal




104 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


Schools, and for Industrial Schools, unless such were to be embraced
in the University itself.
If some such comprehensive and harmonious scheme could have
been adopted at the beginning, especially if that part of it which relates to high school work and the University could have been adopted,
and if all Departments of the University could thus have been guarded
forever against the evils of inadequate preparation, we niight, indeed,
at least for a time, perhaps even to the present time, have seen much
smaller numbers entering our halls and bearing away our diplomas;
but the results of our work in all Departments, and as a whole, would
have been more uniformly solid and satisfactory, and have told mor,
effectually upon tie culture and intellectual advancement, as well as
upon the social well-being, of the large community which is reached
by the influences of the University. This is what might have been.
The failure to make such a cautious beginniing of work, so as to ad.
mit, at the very first opening of the professional schools, only such
students as could pass a reasonably severe examination, is, no doubt,
matter of regret in many institutions besides this; but few, however,
are taking such efficient steps to retrieve the error.
The University, while inheriting the large amount of work in secondary instruction, entailed upon it, not indeed so much by the fault
of the State pioneers, as by the habits of the times and the power of
existing traditions, not to say tie authority of old institutions, is gradually reducing this secondary work to a minimum, and enlarging her
higher wo'rk in the way of original research and production. And
not the least encouraging movement is that of the professional Faculties, not only in greatly extending the time, and elevating the requirements for their diplomas, but also in iistituting entrance examinations requiring at least some degree of school preparation for
admission. This examination will be more exacting from year to year,
and we hope the time will come when an amount of attainment will
be insisted upon here, such as we now propose as the condition of
entering upon the courses for all higher degrees; that is, the preliminary or secondary education attained by our students at the end of
the second year of the Literary and Scientific courses. I trust that all
the Faculties of the University and all who have any authority or influence in the institution, will recognize the wisdom and necessity of
this movenent, and heartily cooperate in raising the preparation for
admission, as well as that for graduation, in all Departments and
Schools throughout tie University, to one and the same level. It is a
great pleasure to see large numbers thronging our doors,-we cannot
deny it,-but we should endeavor to put a higher estimate upon good
work, and think less of numbers.




ADJOURNED lIEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 105


Is it proper and creditable to confer the higher degrees and the
degree of Doctor of Philosophy after a residence of five years at the
University? This was the second question suggested by the conditions of admission and graduation proposed by our new School. I
scarcely need remark, in the first place, that the answer to this question depends very much upon what is required and accomplished in
these five years; upon the amount of work exacted, and the attainment ascertained by stringent examinations. If the attainment made
is proved to the satisfaction of intelligent, competent, and faithful examiners to be sufficient, the degree can properly be conferred, not
only after five years' residence, but even after four, or less; if' these
conditions be not observed, if the attainment be not proved, the degree is good for nothing even at the end of ten years or of twenty.
What are degrees, and what do they signify? They were first
introduced into the medieeval universities, as titles, not of honor
merely, but in a quite literal sense. Master and Doctor both signified
teacher. The title bestowed indicated both the ability and the authority to teach. The original degree was that of Doctor of Laws, instituted at the University of Bologna in the twelfth century. The University of Paris soon adopted this, and also added the degrees of Doctor of Divinity, Doctor of Philosophy or Master of Arts, and Doctor
of Medicine. The universities of England and other countries followed the example of France and Italy, and made these degrees the
certificates of proficiency in the studies of the several Faculties. The
degree of Bachelor was introduced to mark the close of the education
preliminary to the special studies for tne degree of Master. The title
of Master was synonymous with that of Doctor.* In the course of
time, the universities of France and England ceased to use the title
of Doctor of Philosophy, retaining only that of Master of Arts, while
Germany either gave up the latter title, or embodied it in the diploma
of the Doctor of Philosophy. Meantime, the university degrees had
lost their original significance as certificates of ability and authority to
teach, and had come to certify only that the graduate had made the
required attainment and passed his examinations in the specific work
of the Faculty granting the diploma. In time, also, the practice was
introduced of conferring all these titles, excepting that of Doctor of
Medicine, upon persons of distinction, without examination, and as
tokens of esteem and honor. In Germany and England the degrees
in arts and philosophy, the "Bachelor  and "Master of Arts," and
the "Doctor of Philosophy," have had widely different histories. In
the English Universities the candidate for "Bachelor of Arts" goes
* Doctor Philosophise Liberalium Artium Magister.




106 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


through all the essential studies and examinations of the university
education, and obtains all the honors; leaving- the " Master of Arts"
almost an empty title, and without additional significance.* In Germany, on the contrary, and I think, fortunately, the "Bachelor of
Arts " long ago disappeared, and all successful examinations in letters,
science, and philosophy, are certified by the diploma of Doctor of
Philosophy.
Thus, at the English Universities the Master's degree has long
ceased to be conferred as the immediate reward of study and successful examination; it is given " in course," as we express it, three years
after the Bachelor's degree, and with the three conditions of not dying
in the meantime, of keeping one's name on some college register, and
of paying the regular fee.t But the degree at Oxford and Cambridge
has this value, that after it is paid for and received, the Master has the
right to vote in the University convocations.s  This practice of the
English Universities of conferring their highest literary degree without study and examination, three years after graduation with the
lower degree, was adopted by all the colleges of America, and is still
very generally retained. Here, however, it seldom confers, as at Oxford and Cambridge, any suffrage in college affiirs, and, except in those
few institutions which have ceased to bestow it on the mere conditions
of existence and the payment of the fee, and demand work and examination, it is a perfectly empty title.
* "Preparation for the degree of Bachelor in Arts is the principal end
of the present university studies." Hubera.nd Newman, English Universities, Vol. II., page 353.," These degrees [in Arts] are two, those of Bachelor
and Master. The former of these only is obtained by examination, the latter is a mere matter of time and money." Rogers: Education in Oxford,

ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 107


Two facts are quite evident: the Academic degrees both in England and in America have lost much of their significance and dignity;
and this loss or want of significance is not originally chargeable, as
many suppose, to the younger or western institutions of America, but
to the practices and the example of the older and more venerable
universities both of England and America.
The University of Michigan was one of the first to abandon the
giving of the second degree on the easy terms established by tradition. After reasonable notice to the Alurnhi we ceased to give the
degree of Master in course," and now make it the certificate of actual attainment.
I now think it would have been just and wise to have substituted
the title of Master for that of Bachelor at the end of the old established
four years' course, and to have given up altogether the title of Bachelor. This latter, as we have seen, carries with it in England and almost everywhere in America, the degree of Master * The very faet
that the Faculties have so universally regarded the conferring of the
Bachelor's diploma as a guarantee and pledge of the Master's, is an
acknowledgment on the part of the very highest authorities that the
Bachelor's attainments are all that can be demanded for the Master's
degree; in other words, an acknowledgment that the Bachelor's diploma has usurped the place of the Master's. If they have come to
be absolute equivalent, certainly one of them is superfluous. Only
one is genuine; the other is a sham.  Which of the two should
have been set aside? Undoubtedly that which has been thrust forward beyond its original and legitimate place. Undoubtedly, in justice, and even honesty, the candidate should have received, immediately on passing his final examination, that Master's certificate or
diploma, which three years later the authorities publicly acknowledged
he had fairly won.
About thirty-five  years  ago, that eminent educator and
college  president, Doctor Francis Wayland, after long   and
earnest study both of English and American colleges, and of their
present deficiencies, in considering the matter of academic degrees
came to this very conclusiol: that the Master's degree should be given
at the time when it was virtually acknowledged to be due; namely, at
the time when the candidate received that Bachelor's diploma which
was held as a kind of mortgage security for the second degree. If
no additional study and examinations were required for the Master's degree, certainly, said he, it must be that the Faculties had
found the Bachelor's qualifications all sufficient for both degrees.


* See Matthew Arnold, page 230.




108 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


Why, then, require him to wait three years for that which the
whole college world regarded as already justly due?  Why not
at once give him the distinction which  he had deserved, and
which could never be of so much significance and help to the
graduate as at the moment when lie launches from college into the
great world? And so D)r. Wayland promulgated his belief, and made
the proposed innovation in the University over which he presided.
B.tt the proposal to depart from the old tradition, and to get rid of an
absurd practice, met with' clamorous opposition from all conservative
collegians. The Master's degree, which was everywhere conferred for
the price of the parchment, would lose its importance and dignity.
What, cheapen the Master's degree! President Wayland, who devoted his life to the advancement of academic education, in proposing
to. make this degree mean something instead of absolutely nothing,
was lowering its value!  Unhappily he cast his good and great ideas
upon a rugged soil of prejudice, and they failed to bear fruit. He was
in advance of his time, and he died too early. One of his ideas, that
of establishing co-ordinate courses of study by the side of those fixed
by custom, made its way to this University in its early days, and was
embodied in its organization ii- 1852. Well would it have been if his
solution of the question of degrees had been adopted at the same time.
Then should we have had an incentive continually operating to bring
up our work to a university standard; to elevate the style and tone of
our teaching and scholarship towards the ideal held up before us by
the requirements of a genuine Master's degree. For that degree would
have been used no longer like some old ensign kept for show amidst
other antiquarian rubbish, but would have stood at the-summit of oui
pathway with the motto, " Come up higher."
And this is precisely what Germany has done. This is precisely
the position and influence of its academic degree.  Retaining the title
of Doctor of Philosophy in preference to that of Master of Arts, Germany has made it the symbol of the best and highest education in her
power to bestow, within the average period of life to which education
is necessarily, naturally, and historically limited. This symbol of the
highest attainment has not and cannot have any absolute value. A
hundred years ago it indicated a lower degree of acquirements than
that of which it is the exponent at the present day.*  Held up as the
standard of the most advanced education, it has advanced higher and
higher with the development and advancement of the whole educational work.


* Matthew Arnold, pages 46-47.




ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.                 109
And such is the proper and logical course for every country and
every state to pursue; and such a course, without the least doubt,
should be adopted by us in Michigan. We must fix tie right degree
in the riglt place. We must fix upon a highest degree, acndl make it
mean. as the German Universities did a hundred years ago, and as
they do now, the best and highest education in our power to bestow.
Then can we gradually build up the work, as they have done, to
higher levels, and the academic symbol or degree, which indicates the
excellence of that work, will always stand relatively in the same
place; will always be rising in worth and dignity with the character
of the education of which it is designed to be, not, indeed, the reward, but the true and trustworthy certificate.
The effort of two or three universities in America to give tne Master's degree a real significance, by awarding it only for "post-graduate"
studies, cannot avail to alter its general value and dignity determined
by the usages of Oxford and Cambridge and the multitude of colleges and universities in America. In short, what the Bachelor's degree is worth the Master's is worth.
And while the Master's degree is thus given almost everywhere
"( in course" and of course, it can hardly be expected that the offer of
the same degree as an inducement to severe post-graduate study, can
tempt ally considerable number of candidates to reside at the University. And, in fact, the success of this plan for building up university education, after a trial of twenty years, is by no means encouraging. Why should a graduate labor a year or two for a title which
the graduate of Oxford and of almost every college in America can
get on showing his Bachelor's diploma and paying his fees?
Far be it from me to disparage the value of the education of which
these now equivalent degrees are the exponent. I believe that the attainments necessary to pass the final examinations, not only ai the English
Universities, but at Yale, Harvard, Brown, and several other American institutions, fully justify the award of the Master's degree, and,
therefore. that that degree could properly be awarded, as Dr. Wayland
proposed, whenever those examinations are passed, and not three
years later with the show of some added worth and dignity whicr really
do not exist.
If, therefore, the more enterprising graduates, and those who have
time and means, could be induced by the hope of another degree, one
of real significance, to add another year or occasionally two years, to
their university residence, for the sake of still higher attainment and
culture, undoubtedly a great advance could be made in university
work.




110   ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.
It is to be regretted that the degree of Doctor of Philosophy has
been introduced into American institutions. Germany and the countries which adopted the German plan of university education, had
fairly won the right to hold that degree as peculiarly their own.
American universities should either have united in correcting the
wrong use of the Master's degree, and ill restoring its value, or else
in the adoption of some new and distinctive degree. But as they have
assumed the right to confer the German degree, and already for many
years have exercised that right, the only question that remains is, on
what terms can the degree be creditably and properly awar(ed?
In the German Universities the student can take his examination
for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy when he has attended lectures
three years; that is, at the end of the third year from the Gymnasium.*
At this time the years devoted to his education in the primary school,
the Gymnasium, and the University, will have amounted (as remarked
above) to sixteen or seventeen. Now if the American student takes
the same degree after a residence at the University offive years, as we
propose, he will have spent in his education, according to the average
age of our own, graduates at least eighteen or nineteen years. In
brief, we shall require in Michigan at the least eighteen years of preparation for the examination for which German Universities demand
a minimum of sixteen. We might reasonably ask, why should so
much longer preparation be demanded of the American than of the
German student?  Why should he not be allowed to offer himself for
this examination after a course of seventeen years; that is, after four
years' residence at the University, added to the time spent in his primary and high school training? Is he inferior in quickness and
power of attainment; less capable of scholarly research; less apt and
ready in expression? No one believes that the American youth, compared with the German, falls behind in any of these qualities. The
necessity, if there be any, for a longer term of preparation in the case
of the American student, must be due, therefore, to inferior teaching,
rather than to inferior gifts. But if our teaching be inadequate to
the proper training of our youth, let us give way to those who are
equal to the task. Let the State send to Germany or some other land
for instructors who will work our State system more effectively, and
do full justice to the talent and earnest spirit of our students. But
making all reasonable allowance for the disadvantages incident to institutions scarcely yet developed, and machinery hardly yet in run

ning order, we cannot seriously endanger the interests of the higher
education; or bring dishonor upon our diplomas, if we exact two
years, or even one year, of preparation more than is required in the
German Universities.
We should remember, too, that while the candidate is admitted to
examination at the end of five years' residence, it by no means follows that the degree will be awarded. The examination must. not be
a mere matter of routine, and the award of the degree a forecone conclusion, as is too often the case in the graduation of "college classes."
It must be emphatically an university examination, made by responsible committees or boards, and proving not how well the student remembers the.words of lectures, but how thoroughly he has investigated the subjects of instruction, and employed the sources of information pointed out by the lecturer. He is to be tested, not like a
school boy, or college classman, seeking for marks and standing, and
faithfully repeating the ideas or facts of a text-book, but like a fullgrown man and scholar, as to what he himself has found out and
thought out under the general guidance aid direction of those whom
he chooses for instructors.
To insist upoi' unreasonable periods of time, in dealing with
university students, to make time the more conspicuous and essential
condition, is to acknowledge that the examination, and the Faculty as
examiners, cannot be trusted; that they depend more upon what the
student may be supposed to have accomplished, than what they know
by inspection he has actually accomplished.
But it is assumed by those who object to our course in this matter,
that in foreign countries the degree in question, and, indeed, all other
degrees, have a kind of standard value, uniform and common to all.
The truth is that each country has a standard of its own, determined
by its own traditions, and by its own educational circumstances and
opportunities. ~England does not ask Germany what degree shall be
conferred at Oxford, nor on what terms. Neither does Germany in
this respect imitate the French, nor the French any other people.
But not only so; there is by no means that uniformity which we
might expect, even in the institutions of any one country, as to the
terms on which they bestow their honors. We might suppose that in
Germany, at least, there would be a common grade of attainment.
But it is notoriously the fact that the Doctorate has a widely different
value and significance in different German universities.*  Berlin is
known to hedge round this degree with much greater difficulties, with
much more thorny examinations, not to say with a much higher fee,
* See Matthew Arnold, page 75.

112 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


than most other German universities. Yet those, or most of those,
that are less stringent in their requirements, under the influence of
local circumstances, perhaps of less perfect schools of preparation, do
no discredit to themselves, bring no dishonor upon the degree, and
are everywhere in repute and esteem.  Now, as they are governed in
establishing the terms of graduation, in some measure, by the educational condition of the particular community, state, or kingdom
which they represent, and as the very first universities, from the same
necessity of ilferior opportunities. fifty or a hundred years ago, gave
their degrees at that time for a grade of preparation inferior to the
present; so, to some reasonable extent, is it right and necessary for us
to have reference, in the requirements of this University, to the educational circumstances and wants of Michigan. We have our own
graded system of education; the University is inseparable from this
system. We do not ask, therefore, whether certain provisions and
privileges granted here, are acceptable to other states, other commu -
nities, or other universities; but sitnlly whether they are in harmony
with our own educational plan. Do they meet our own necessities?
Do they promote our own best interests? These are the only questions
that are really important.
I believe that every step in the history of the University hitherto
has been a step in the right direction. Every movement has been
justified by its results. In every instance, indeed, our measures have
been criticised more or less severely, and some amongst our friends
and colleagues have viewed them with apprehension and timidity.
But this feeling has almost invariably had its origin and sole argument
in the fear of what would be thought of us abroad or "in the East."
Reputation is very important when based upon solid merit. When it
depends merely on the conforming of our action to that of others,
without regard to our own peculiar circumstances, and at the sacrifice
of our peculiar interests, our action should cease to be under its control.
In view of these several considerations, I think it is just and safe
and wise to offer to those students who have completed the required
work of our Literary Department, or the first two years of its courses,
the privilege of entering upon the special studies which lead to the
degree of Doctor of Philosophy, and of presenting themselves for
examination at the end of the fifth year of residence at the University.
The exact amount of university residence generally required for
the higher degrees, taken in England and America "in course "', and
in Germany on examination, is expressed in weeks as follows: at




ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 18S1. 113


Oxford and Cambridge, seventy-two weeks8 distributed over three years;*
in Germany, one hundred and twenty weeks, extending through the same
periodt; in America, usually one hundred and sixty weeks, extending
through four years. From this residence is deducted the time taken
for the Christmas and Easter holidays, usually longer in Europe than
in this country. The residence that we propose to require in the
University of Michigan for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy is two
hundred weeks.
It would be a farther safeguard against imperfect preparation to
require, previous to the special work for this degree, not only an examination in all the prescribed studies, but also that these studies shall
occupy the whole of the first two years of residece. Finally, the
"credit system," applicable to the other degrees, should have no connection with this. It should be made to depend entirely upon attendance throughout the courses of lectures, and upon successful examinaltiols; unless the candidate be already a graduate, and allowed on
that account to come to the final examination after a shorter period
of special study.
I believe:~lso thft it would best promote the interests of the
higher education and of the University, if the requirements for admission to the professional schools should gradually and:Is rapidly as
possible be advanced, so that not only the complete High School training, but that of the first two years of the Literary Department, or an
equivalent, be made a condition for admission to those schools. Of
course, this must be a work of time; but it should be the ultimate and
determined aim of the Board of Regents and the Faculties. Indeed,
such advanced preparation is already demanded by the School of Engineering. For, preliminary to the special work of this School, the
student is required to complete the first two years, or the prescribed
studies of the so-called Scientific Course. Is there any reason why an
engineer should have a more extended and more complete preliminary
training than a student in law or medicine? Does the profession of
the engineer call for a higher grade of education than that of the lawyer
or doctor? And is it any more difficult for the lawyer or doctor to
comply with rigid conditions of graduation, than for the engineer?

It will be perceived that the general plan of preparation for all
the higher and professional degrees, as here recommended, contemplates two distinct objects: one is the limitation of the requirements
for examination in the literary degrees to such a period as shall not
be extravagant nor incompatible with the educational circumstances
of the State, nor discouraging to the youth of the State who aspire to
the attainment of them; the other is, on the contrary, the raising of the
requirements for the professional degrees by following out the course
which the professional Faculties have already initiated, in exacting
more thorough preparation, until the training of the candidates, both
inthe preliminary courses, and in the professional courses, shall be equal
in extent and thoroughness to that of candidates for the higher degrees in the Literary Department.
Thus the education for the professions and for the higher literary
degrees will be built upon a common foundation, and will be reared
to a common height of attainment; and thus unity and symmetry will
be given to the education afforded by the University in all its departments and schools and courses of study.
The importance of these topics at the present moment must be
my apology for dwelling upon them so long.
In tie past history of the University, attention has been called not
infrequently to its character and influence as a Christian institution.
It has been criticised and assailed on diametrically opposite grounds.
One party has accused us of giving too much countenance to religion;
another has charged us with being unchristian and even infidel. The
one has petitioned the State Legislature to call us to account for teaching Christianity; the other, through denominational papers, and
through various other channels, has alleged that we discourage religion altogether. It has not been necessary, therefore, for us, when
smitten on the one cheek, to turn the other also. The parties have
stood ready to buffet us on either side. The University has received
with all meekness, and usually in silence, these assaults from both parties; yet she claims the right to assert with simplicity and plainness her
true position: her right, on the one hand, to cherish religion and to
maintain a Christian character; and, on the other, to do this without
exercising compulsion or forcing her students to any form of religious
observance. Accordingly, when the legislative committee inspected
our religious customs, in answer to the petition above mentioned,
they reported that in this matter we were not in;fringing upon the
freedom of any citizen; and those, on the other hand, who have inspected us in connection with the opposite charge, have found us
practically as true to Christianity as other academic institutions. As
I understand it, the University occupies in respect to religion the same




ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 115


ground with the State itself, and with all other institutions of the
State. The State of Michigan is a Christian State, and her institutions are founded and governed upon Christian principles. Christianity, therefore, is not merely tolerated in the University, not merely
not proscribed, but is unhesitatingly honored and cherished. Our
dependence upon God is acknowledged in the invocation of his blessing on the meetings of the Regents, and in the public exercises of
prayers in chapel throughout the academic year. But to these latter
students are not coerced. And for freedom here there are two good reasons. Young men and women of the average age of nearly twenty-two*
can hardly be elevated in their religious character by attendance on
religious worship which on their part is not voluntary; and, second,
to make such attendance a condition of enjoying the privileges of the
University, is a violation of the freedom of opinion and of conscience
inherited by every citizen. Religious worship, therefore, is voluntary;
but not on that account, we trust, any less acceptable and profitable.
The number in attendance under such liberty is indeed far less inposing, but the number of worshipers is quite as great.
It should be remarked that in accordance with the custom of older
institutions, the daily devotional exercises of this University have
hitherto been confined to the Literary Department alone. They were
established at the time of the organization of that Department, which
for several years constituted the whole University. The students of
the " Collegiate " or Literary Department at that time, also in accordance with old customs, were lodged in " dormitories" erected on the
campus for their accommodation. This semi-domestic arrangement
made it both natural and convenient to assemble the students for
daily devotions. Twenty-seven years ago the dormitories were fortunately abolished. The State and the Univeisity could.not reasonably have been expected to multiply buildings to furnish sleeping
apartments for a thousand or fifteen hundred students. On the other
hand, the citizens naturally and gradually, with the increasing demand, multiplied their private accommodations for students, and thus
have left the University in this respect entirely without embarrassment; at the same time securing to the student population in general
something more nearly approximating to the life of home. Meantime, the professional schools have sprung up by the side of the Literary Department, all conducted in buildings erected on the University


* The actual average age of students in the Literary Department at the
time of matriculation, for the last two years, has been nineteen years, eleven
months, and twenty-three days. Therefore the average age of students in
the Department, including the advanced classes, is nearly twenty-two
years.




116 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


campus; and their students, like those of the Literary Department,
find their homes in the families of the city. I can see no good reason,
therefore, why daily devotions should be conducted for the benefit of
the Literary Department alone. The latter class of students cannot
be supposed to have any greater need of them, and all members of the
University who desire the privilege should have an equal opportunity
to engage in them. It seems to me, therefore, desirable and proper
to provide a suitable place for public devotions (and for this purpose I
would have a chapel worthy of the name), in which, at an hour convenient for all, the students of every Department of the University
may have the opportunity to be present.
But, I think, those who have experience in college life will agree
with me that the religious condition of a university is not determined
by attendance on chapel exercises. It depends rather upon the voluntary religious organizations kept up and fostered amongst tile students themselves; upon the class bands or meetings for prayer and
mutual encouragement, and upon the general association of Christian
students in religious societies. Such organizations have existed in
this institution for many years, and have never been more vigorous
and active than at the present time. Every possible encouragement
has been extended to them by the Regents and the Faculties, in securing to them convenient apartments for their meetings, and in cou,;tenancing and aiding their efforts in the cause of religion and morality.
A nd besides this means of religious culture, the practice has been long
established of inviting the students of all Departments to assemble on
Sunday afternoon, generally twice a month, to listen to religious discourses, delivered sometimes by the President, sometimes by the
clergymen, and sometimes by the laymen, of the Faculties. The
Christian Association also occasionally invites eminent clergymen
from abroad to deliver discourses before the assembled students. Thus
the University lacks none of those voluntary means and appliances
which are anywhere deemed essential to the advancement of relioion
in universities and colleges.
Every one feels that the most important condition of the
Christian character of a university is to be sought in the Christian
character of the Faculties. Now, of the eighty officers of the University, enrolled in the Calendar of the last year unde:- the head of
"Members of the Faculties and other Officers," the latter including
the Librarian and Assistant Librarian, sixty are communicants in the
churches of the several Christian denominations, and seven, though
not communicants, are earnest co-workers with these churches in their
various benevolent operations. As a general thing, these members of
the Faculties are amongst the most active and useful members of the




ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 117


churches to which they belong, and many of them are prominent in
the conventions and associations of the various denomninations. Every
Sunday-school in the town, with one exception, is under the superintendency of some one of them, and several of them, both clergymen
and laymen, are often called upon, here and elsewhere, to preach
sermons or to take part in movements for moral improvement and
reform. It is impossible to see how a University in whose body of
teachers religions belief and practice so largely predominate, can be
accused of being unchristian. In fact, a Christian tone and sentiment
do pervade the teaching of the University. There is scarcely an important chair, especially in the Department of Literature, Science, and
the Arts, that is not held by an earnest Christian man.
Of the students, from thirty to thirty-three per cent. are members of churches. This has been the average ascertained by the census taken by the Christian Association for a series of years.
On the whole, if a comparison were made in respect to religion,
morals, and conduct between this;University and others containing the
same or nearly the samne nwmber of studenits, the result would not be
at all discreditable to this institution. Clergymen as well as others
who have come from the neighborhood of some other collegiate institutions, have expressed to me their surprise at the general quiet and
good order prevailing here, where there are fifteen hundred students,
as compared with the state of things in places, where there are less
than half that number. But, seldom or never, when suspicion or reproach is cast upon the University, is any reference made in the way
of comparison to other universities, either small or great. Nothing
whatever is said about Princeton, Yale, Brown, or Dartmouth. It
seems to be assumed that all others are above repro}ach, that their students are all perfect, that they are not subject to ebullitions, and that
they are entirely beyond the reach of all contaminating influences.
There can be no good reason for singling out the University of Michigan as the object of special investigation and criticism, and at the same
time leaving all others out of view.
Finally, if any effort to divert Christian students from this University on the charge that its sixty Christian teachers exert an unchristian influence, shall unhappily prove successful, and thus the
Christian element be taken away from among its undergraduates, the
responsibility of havi;ng thus given over this mighty educational
power to irreligion, will lie not with the opponents of Christianity,
but with those who profess Christianity.
Among the improvements of the year the introduction of courses
of study in music may be mentioned as one that has added value to
our educational work. Long recognized in European universities as




118 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


one of the legitimate branches of a liberal education, and as an art
which in its present development is one of the richest fruits of modern
civilization, it demands 'i place in any university that claims to represent the intellectual culture of the times. The work accomplished
in this study during the year has,fully justified our expectations, and
has proved the power of music when properly taught, not only to
improve the taste, but to discipline the mind.
-In the department of engineering, a chair has been established
which supplements the work already provided for, and no'w secures to
the University a complete School of Engineering. I refer to the
newly created professorship of Mechanical Engineerilg. Availing
ourselves of the law enacted by Congress in 1879, an enactment similar to that which authorizes the President to detail officers of the
army to give military instruction in schools and colleges, and empowering the government in like manner to designate officers of the corps
of naval engineers to act as professors of steam engineering and naval
architecture in such institutions as may ask for their services, we applied to the Secretary of the Navy for the appointment of a naval
engineer for such service in our engineering department. The officer
detailed in compliance with our request, is Mr. Mortimer E. Cooley,
a graduate of the Naval School at Annapolis, who has been in active
service for several years since his graduation, and who will immediately enter upon his duties here. With reference to the accomplishment of the object contemplated in the enactment of Congress above
mentioned, certainly no institution in the country is more favorably
located than the University of Michigan. Situated nearly in the
centre of the region of the great lakes, the School of Steam Engineering and Naval Architecture, opened here, will afford a convenient
resort for young men who desire to prepare themselves for a calling
which the interests of our increasing lake navigation will soon make
one of very great practical importance.
The operations of the several professional Departments and
>Schools have been conducted with efficiency, and attended with general good success. For details,I respectfully refer you to the reports
of the Deans of Faculties.
The collections which make up the Museum of Natural History
have been removed to the new building erected for their reception,
and are to a great extent ready for exhibition. That portion of the
north wing of University Hall which has thus been vacated, has been
remodeled and well arranged, under the direction of the Steward, for
the accommodation of large classes attending University lectures.
The equipment of the Observatory has been greatly improved by
the addition of instruments for the special use of students. The work




ADJOURNED MlEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 119
of this department is ably conducted, and is contributing its proper
share to the reputation of the University. Assistant Schaeberle has
recently received a premium as the discoverer of a new comet.
The General Library has been enlarged by purchases provided
for by the annual appropriation of the Board and by a special legislative appropriation. The following is a summary of the statistics
contained inl the report of the Librarian, presented herewith:
Number of volumes in the General Library, 31,203; Law Library,
4,100; Society Libraries, 2,100; Library of Young' Men's Christian
Association, 1,000; total number of volumes accessible to students,
38,403; number of unbound volumes and pamphlets, 8,423.
Additions to the General Library during the year, 1,858 volumes
and 268 p.mphlets; to the Law Library, 63 volumes.
The most important gifts of books are: from the Honorable Philo
Parsons, of Detroit, 300 volumes; from Professor George S. M1orris,
40 volumes; and from Mr. A. E. Richards, 20 volumes.
The following numerical summaries are furnished by the statistics
of the year.

The financial history oftlie year is embodied in the accoimpanying
report of the Committee on Finance.
The funds contributed by the Alumni for the Williams Professorship, and the fund which the undergraduates are endeavoring to raise
for the building of a Gymnrasium, are not strictly within the province
of the University. Yet, as real and important interests of the University, I append to this report statements of their present condition
furnished by their respective Treasurers.
While the history of the year gives us abunldant reasons for congratulation, on the successful progress of our work, and on the support,
countenance, and favor of the people and the State government, the
retrospect is saddened by the many occasions which have called us to
mourn the: death of friends and servants of the University.
Ill the early part of the year we were shocked by the announcement of the sudden death of Professor James C. Watson. He had
scarcely become established in his newly adopted home at Madison, and we had not yet ceased to think of him as one of our number,
and as still sharing in our labors. We received the remains of
our recent colleague at the University, and attended them to their last
resting place with every token of honor dole to one who is universally
acknowledged to have been the brightest and foremost of all our
Allumni.
And within the last few weeks, the University Senate has again
been called: together to give expression to sentiments of grief. We
mourn in common with all the people of the State the t!eath of exGovernol Bagley. Brought in his childhood to Michigan soon after
it had been organized as a State, he grew up with its growth and became thoroughly identified with its history and with all its great inter



122;ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


ests. No citizen had more at heart the welfare of those public institutions which are the pride of Michigan; and among these, none was
dearer to him than the University. Whether in his official capacity as
'Governor, or in the exercise of ilis influence as a private citizen, he
never lost al opportunity of advocating any measure which in his
judgment tended to its advancement. He was interested in all our
work, and was frequently present amongst us. Especially shall we miss
his familiar form at Commencements and on other public occasions.
The vast multitude of mourners assembled in the city of Detroit
and thronging its avenues on the day of the funeral obsequies, gazing
with sad faces on the passing hearse, represented and expressed the
profound sorrow and affectionate regret everywhere felt by the people of the State which he had loved and faithfully served.
And before we had yet paid the last honors to this lamented
friend and emineLt citizen, came the announcement of the deatl of
our ex-President, Erastus 0. Haven. He died while on an official
visit in Oregon as Bishop of the Methodist Church. He was long
associated with us here, first as Professor, and afterwards:s President of the University. We look back upon his period of service in
the latter offi(e as one of the most prosperous in the history of the institution. He possessed in an eminent degree that administrative talent, that readiness and felicity of speech, that liberal and kindly spirit,
that self-possession, calmness, and patience, and that judgment
and tact, which go to make up the qualifications of a successful president. His resignation of that office was received by all
of us with profound regret, and by none more than by the Board of
Regents. He has gone to his rest and to his reward suddenly, and quite
prematurely. Few men have left a record of life so filled with useful
and eminent services; a life full of activity in the cause of education,
of literature, science, and learning, and, above all, of religion.
And finally, he who has always held the first place in the affections of our Alumni, he who first opened the doors of this institution
and organized its first classes, and who from that day to this, a perIoa
of just forty years, has never ceased to cherish its interests with all
the solicitude and tenderness of a father, whose last thoughts and
words were of the University,-George P. Williains, In a good old age,
has passed away to his heavenly home. I need not dwell here upon
his merits, his good works, and his admirable personal qualities, so familiar to us all. That sad and pleasing duty will devolve upon one of
my colleagues who lhas known him long and intilmately,and who was associated with him in the affairs of the University in its early days.
-By my request he will publicly express the sentiments of love and reverence which we cherish for our departed brotler, and will present the




ADJOURNED AEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.                  123
history of his life and services, a history, indeed, which is that of the
University itself. For of all the events ot this history lie could justly
say: quorum pars magnafuz.
Letters from our absent President lead us to expect his return
about the first of February of the ensuing year. The diplomatic service which he has rendered to the country in the negotiation of important treaties with China has become matter of history. The whole
country was gratified as well as surprised at the promptness with
which the terms of the treaties were agreed u'lon by the commissioners of both countries, and the substantial unanimity of the Senate of
the United States in their ratification is sufficient proof that they are
entirely satisfactory to the country and creditable to the embassy.
But not less gratifying to the University is the account we have received from American missionaries in China, of the good work done
there by President Angell in behalf of Christianity. Hitherto privileges and immunities have been conceded by the Chinese government
to the representatives of other orders of Christians, particularly to
the Roman Catholics, which have been withheld from the Protestants.
This discrimination, through the earnest interposition of our Minister, has at length been removed, and thus a signal benefit has been
conferred upon the cause of Protestant Christianity. We look forward with hope and pleasure to his return; and all hearts will welcome him back to the duties which he regards as the true mission of
his life, and which he prefers to any position and any duties in the
public service.
In conclusion, I must express my personal gratification at the favorable circumstances which have made the burden of the presidential office
comparatively light and even a source of pleasure. For this I must
thank both the Board of Regents and the Faculties, who have extended to me every courtesy, and have on all occasions manifested a
kind and earnest disposition to aid in the successful performance of
my labors. I have also to record the fact, honorable to the students
of the University, that during the whole period of President Angell's
absence they have acted with the feeling that nothing should go
round the world and reach him in that distant land, but reports which
should at once contribute to cheer his temporary exile, and to increase
his desire to be on the campus once more.

The annual report of the Treasurer with a full list of all warrants
paid, is herewith submitted. This list of warrants has been compared
with the books of tie Secretary of the Regents of the University and
found correct.
Your Committee also submit a list of the professors, officials, and
employees of the University, with the amount of salary paid to each.
The receipts for students' fees and from Laboratory deposits have
been compared with tickets issued by the Secretary and found correct.
The vouchers for current expenses and special funds have been compared and examined, and agree with the report of the Treasurer.
Your Committee believe that the number of students will be
larger than during the past year, and consequently the amount received from students will be larger; but the increase in this direction
will not provide a sufficient increase of the funds of the University,
and thus the Regents have been compelled to increase the annual fees
of the students. Such increase, together with the amount of additional
income derived from the 1-20th of a mill tax consequent upon the in
creased valuation of the State. will, in the opinion of your Committee,
provide a sufficient fund for the successful carrying out of the largely
increased educational facilities of the University.
ANDREW     CLIMIE,
Chairman of the Finance Committee.
The following resolutions, submitted by Regent Climie,
were adopted:
Resolved, That the Treasurer of the University is hereby instructed to transfer the sum of six hundred eighty-nine and 8-100 dollars, which has been credited to the Special Dental Fund, to the General Fund.
Resolved. That the Treasurer of the University is hereby instructed to transfer to the General Fund the overdrawn balance,
$1403.07, on the Museum Building Fund.

Homoeopathic Hospital construction account to the General Fund.

Nays-None. Not voting-Regent S. S. Walker.
Regent Duffield, Chairman of the Library Committee, read
the following report:
The Library Committee would recommend the acceptance of the
Librarian's annual report, and its publication in the minutes. Much
of your Committee's special report was so ably anticipated yesterday
by Acting President Frieze, in his annual report, that it is unnecessary
here to repeat it.
The appropriations asked were mainly these two, viz.: 1st, $600
for the purchase of Poggendorff's Anialen der Physik und Chemie;
2d, $487.50 for Crelle's Journal of Mathematics.
There was also a petition signed by Acting President Frieze, Professors Dunster, Langley, and Demmon, and Mr. Davis, the Librarian,
asking that a regular annual appropriation be made for the School of
Pharmacy, as in the Departments of Law and Medicine-tile present
necessities of the Department of Pharmacy for books being $1,000.
The total amount thus asked was $2,087.50. Your Committee, unable to recommend so large an amount after the very oenerous appropriation already made for books during the current year, have
withheld their final report until the present time. They now find the
question much simplified, and the amount desired reduced from $2,087.50 to $475.
This haA been done
1. By the purchase of Poggendorff out of the regular appropriation, the mathematical department generously giving up their quota
toward said purchase.
2. By the virtual withdrawal for the present of the petition on
behalf of the School of Pharmacy.
3. By the reduction in price of Crelle from $487.50 to $475.
Your Comiittee recommend that the sum of $475 be appropriated
by the Board for the purchase of Crelle's Journal fur die reine und
angewandte Mathematik.
GEO. DUFFIELD,
SAMUEL S. WALKER,
B. M. CUTCHEON.
Sept. 28th, 1881,




140 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


Pending a vote on the adoption of the report, Regent S. S.
Walker moved the following amendment:
At the close of the last sentence of the report the Secretary shall
add the words " on condition that the amount be taken from the special appropriation made by the last legislature of the State."
The amendment of Regent S. S. Walker was accepted, and,
as amended, the report was adopted by the following vote:
Ayes-Regents E. C. Walker, Climie, Cutcheon, S. S. Walker,
Grosvenorl and Shearer.
Nays-None.
The Librarian's report referred to by Regent Duffield is as
follows:
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
LIBRARIAN'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1880-8I.
Since June 30, 1880, 920 books and 4 pamphlets have been purchased, 625 books and 264 pamphlets presented, and 313 books added
by binding.
Total accessions for the year, 1858 books and 268 pamphlets.
One hundred and forty-three periodicals have been received regularly; of these 119 wre paid for, and 24 were gratuitous.
In addition to the above, the students furnish for the readingroom 50 magazines and newspapers.
The books and pamphlets purchased cost $2,206.84.
The 119 periodicals for which subscriptions were paid cost $600.56.
For works issued in parts $161.65 have been paid.
Besides the 313 volumes bound, and constituting additions to the
number of volumes, 48 volumes have been rebound and 58 repaired.
The amount paid the binder for all this work was $381.41.
Other expenses have been for transportation, catalogue, cards,
printing, etc. The bills for these things are not in all cases rendered
to me, and any statement that I might make would necessarily be incomplete.
Tile library contains to-day 31,203 volumes and 8,523 pamphlets,
distributed as follows:
In the main collection,  29,865 vols., and 8,356 pamphlets.
At the Observatory,       552 "     "   167   "
At the Chemical Laboratory, 331  "
At the Botanical Rooms,   255 "




ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 141


At the Dental College,    200 vols.
The books are in good condition-a result of fiequent repairing
and rebinding.
Twenty-seven volumes of those subject to the most wear, were
sent to the bindery for repairs last week. When they are returned we
shall be entirely ready for readers again.
The conveniences for administration are deplorable, but as relief
is now assured we cheerfully submit to inconveniences.
At the several collections outside-at the Observatory and other
places named-there is for the present sufficient room. My impression
is, after a careful inspection of all these, that the books, while they
are used frequently, are well cared for. At the Observatory the shelving has been increased, and many of the unbound volumes bound.
Some strictly technical works have been removed thither from the
main collection. These things have combined to make the Astronomical Library a very respectable one in number of volumes and condi
tion.
We have missed two pamphlets and a single volume. I do not
consider them lost, but simply misplaced.
During the vacation, that is, from July 1 to Sept. 22, there
were drawn and read in the reading-room........... 1,200 vols.
During the remainder of the year........................77,293   i'
Loaned to members of the Faculty during the year...... 2,806 "
The recorded use of the library for the year, therefore, is 81,299
volumes, equal to using each book in the collection 22 times. This
does not include the use made of the library by the Professors as a
reference library, or by the post-graduate students and resident graduates, or the use made of the books at the Observatory, the Laboratory,
the Botanical Rooms, and the Dental College. It is proper to explain
also, in this connection, that loans of books varying in number from
50 to 100 volumes are made annually to the Physical Laboratory and
to the work-rooms of the Museum. These are used constantly while
they remain in those places.
I was on the ground here as a student in 1856, when the library
consisting of about 6,000 volumes, was first fairly shelved on the
lower floor of the (cld Museum. Its use, even then, was very creditable to the University.
In its removal to better quarters in 1863-in the construction of a
catalogue-in the opening of it for consultation more hours daily-in
the increased number of students-in the increased number of books
-in the new methods of instruction-in all these, we recognize causes
of its increased use.




142 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


Every institution-every community, indeed,-possesses what
may be called its distinguishing characteristics.  This characteristic
here, is, I believe, the reading habit. It permeates the atmosphere, and
is infectious in the highest degree. It lies back of all the causes I
have name(1 a(nd makes them potent.
The enthusiasm of the fresh, young investigator is something
wonderful, when he cuts loose from  compilations and the inferences
of compilers, and enters the great field spread out before him in a judicious citation of authorities.
A gentleman residing in Washington wrote me a while ago to
learn whlat the library contained on a certain subject, on which he
was at variance with the received authorities.
"Just set some of your young men on the track," he wrote,"and they
will run the game down, no matter what the nature of the ground."
He was right. Put an enterprising student on the track of a fact, or
a principle, and he will not fail to see what it was in the begi:.ning,
except for want of materials. I have watched with admiration this
search for truth go on from month to month, and from year to year,not always intelligently, or systematically, but always with faith and
enthusiasm in the manner, and with gleat gain in methods and available knowledge.
The books drawn and used in the reading-room      during the
year were distributed by subjects as follows:
Modern History............................................ 152 
Medicine (including bound periodicals)...................... 14  "
Bound periodicals (exclusive of medical).................... 14  "

ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 143


The low per cent of reading in Physics and Chemistry, Geology and
Zoology, and tile failure of Botany, PalMeontology, and some other
subjects, to appear at all, is rather misleading. These subjects are
read at the places where the technical works on them are permanently,
or temporarily, located,.and we cannot cast our statistical net so as to
inclose their use.
The most important gift that has been made to the library since
Mr. Parsons, in 1871, presented the collection bearing his name, was
received a few days' ago-and from Mr. Parsons this time, also. It
consists of 300 volumes from the library of the late Judge Cochrane,
of Detroit. The books divide quite sharply into treatises on Civil and
International Law, histories, and texts of the Greek and Roman classical writers.
A list of these books, and tie other gifts, accompanies this
report. I will name here, however, as,of special value, a reprint of
the " Moniteur" for the period of the French Revolution (M'ay, 1789,
to November, 1799,) in 32 large octavo volumes, illustrated. It is a
minute, contemporary 'account of a decade that has no parallel in history. I will name, also, 136 volumes of the Taucllnitz Classics, representing 41 Greek and 31 Roman writers.
From Professor Morris the library has received a valuable collection of German plays of the 18tl century.
The Massachusetts State Bo,:rd of Clharities, atnd the Bureau of
Statistics, lhave sent us their publications, which are very valuable in
the study of Political Economy.
Mr. A. E. Richards, whose collection of coins grows so rapidly in
interest aid value, has sent with nearly every parcel of coins from
Florence, one or two books. He las in this way increased materially
our stock of Italial literature, and also added to the number of our
Latin texts.
'There have been other gifts, of one or two volumes, many of which
are valuable. As already said, a list of these accompanies this ieport.
The regular course of lectures on Bibliography was delivered, at
the usual time.
The law for the protection of libraries, passed by the Legislature
last winter, originated hero; land though it was in effect the Wisconsin
law, it was not settled upon without consideration and study. In comImoni with others, [ l:abored for a successful termination of the effort
for a new library building. And, with others, I am profoundly grateful to the Legislature for responding so nobly to tlhe appeal, and especially to the individual members who had the interests of the University in charge,
4




144 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881.


Book catalogues have been studied faitllfully, to learn what was
in the market, and with a view to economy in purchases. Gifts of
books have been solicited where there was a reasonable prospect of
obtaining them. These things, with the regular and necessary duties
of every day, have kept us all busy.
For several years the need of certain sets of books has been
urgent. The amount of the joint appropriations last year enabled the
committee to order one of these, viz, Po'gendorff's Annalen der
Physik und Ohemie.  'The cost of this will be about $600.
Another set equally necessary is Crelle's Journal fiir die reineund
angewandte Mathematik. A copy of tills, the ruling price of which is
about 2,500 miarks, is offered for 1,950 marks, or $487.50. Tle amount
of money at the disposal of the committee will be insufficient to satisfy the current demands, and purchase this. Meantime the need
grows more crying, and the price higher.
I have here, and will read, a mlemorial of the Library Committee,
relating to the wants of tlhe School of Pharmlcy in the line of books.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
In view of the limited appropriation for the purchase of books for the
General Library, and in view of the demands of the School of Pharmacy for
special and expensive works for use in that Department, the Library (ommittee would respectfully ask your Honorable Body to make a regular annual appropriation to purchase books for the use of that School, as is now
done for maintaining the libraries of the Department of Law and of the
Department of Medicine and Surgery; such approp)riation to be expended
under the direction of the Librarian and the Dean of the School of Pharmacy. At the present moment upwards of a thousand dollars' worth of
books are greatly needed in order to the proper pursuit of investigations in
that School, and it has seemed to us fitting to mnemnorialize the Honorable
Board of Regents, and ask that they provide for the growth of this part of
the Library by a regular apprloplriation as above specified.
Signed, II. S. FRIEZE,
E. S. DUNSTER,
JOHN W. LANGLEY,
ISAAC N. DEMMON,
R. C. DAVIS.
If it shall seem to you proper to make a special appropriation for
Crelle's.lolrllal, and a regular annual appropriation for the School of
Pharmacy, as desired, I tlhinlk we call, in two or tlhree years, by careful tnallgement, secure other necessary and costly sets out of the
annual appropriations to the library.
The Medical books enter into the statistics already given. I give
a separate report, also:

Comparatively few books have been purchased for the use of tlic
students of the Homceopathic Medical College. There are nine journals of that School received, all of which are contributed by the publishers. By means of the small appropriation made by the Board at
the January meetinog I have been able to fill up ald bind 26 volumes
of these. There is, therefore, the nucleus of a Homceopathic collection, which should presently be swelled by purchases and gifts.
Very respectfully submitted,
R. C. DAVIS, Librarian.
Ann Arbor, June 28, 1881.
The following resolution, submitted by Regent Shearer,

146 ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEM~BER, 1881,


Resolved, That the communication of Professor C. K. Wead be
referred to the Finance Committee, with instructions to report at the
next-meeting of the Board what sum it is possible to appropriate for
apparatus for Professor Wead's department.
Regent E. C. Walker, chairman of the Special Committee
in the matter of the questions between Professor D. Maclean
and Professor E. C. Franklin, submitted the following report,
which was adopted; copies of the same to be furnished the
Deans of the Medical Faculties, with instructions to call the
attention of their respective Faculties to the same.
The report was accepted, and ordered printed in the minutes, by the following vote:
Ayes-Regents E. C. Walker, Climie, Cutcheon, S. S. Walker,
Duffield, Grosvenor, and- Shearer.
Nays-None.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
The Special Committee to whom were referred the charges made
by Professor Donald Mlaclean, of the Department of M!edicinie and
Surgery, against Professor E. C. Franklin, of the IHomceopathic Medical College, by a resolution of June 30, last, and to whom was also
referred, on July 1st, the general suibject of mutual criticism and detractionl between the two medical schools, respectfully report:
That the charges made by Dr. Maclean are three in number:
1st. That Dr. Franklin had industriously and publicly circullated a report that Dr. Maclean, in a certain difficult surgical operation, had caused the death of a patient by tying the pneumogastric
nerve.
2d. That in his printed report to a medical association he had
falsely stated that the clinic of the Homceopathic College was far more
extensive than that of the other Department.
3d. That in the same report he had in glowing, terms detailed
the particulars of a case of neuralgia in the foot which Dr. Maclean
declared incurable except by amputation, and which he had cured;
which particulars Dr. Maclean alleges to be false.
As to the first charge, Dr. Franklin stated to the Committee that
such a ligated nerve was in his possession, sent to him from Monroe,
and alleged to have been taken from the body of the patient mentioned; but he denied peremptorily that he had promulgated in any
public manner or place any such charge against Dr. Maclean.
As no tim'e or place is mentioned in the charge of Dr. Maclean,
we have not examined farther in this directionp, 1u!t give Dr. Franklin
the full bene'it of his diselaimer.




ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 147


The Committee, however, in justice to Dr. Maclean, halve satisfied themselves. by the testinmonyl of assistants in the operation, that
the charge of tying the pneumogastric nerve is utterly without foundation in fact; tl:hat on the contrary, it was proven t:hat in tvyilg the
artery the attention of tlle class and assistallts was publicly called to
tlle proximity of the pneulmogalstric nerve.
Professor Franklin admitted that he hIad made and publisled the
statements as alleged in the second and third cliarges.
The Colmmittee consider the statement lmade il the second charge
as destitute of truth, and upon a sullbjct witil wliich Professor Franklin must have been fully acquainted.
As to the third cllarge, in regard to the case of neuralg'ia, the
Committee have not thonught it their duty to go into the question of
determiing whethler the patient imade the statements ascriib(l to her
by Dr. Franklin, or whether ier letter to Dr. laclelian denying them,
are true. The Committee can only, in any case, condemn the publication of any such statements.
As to the general question of public criticism and personal detraction between the officers of the two Medical Faculties under care
of the Board, the Committee c;an not sufficiently express their condemnnation of the same. Both Schools are alike unlelr thle care of the
Board and supported by the State. No personal detractCtion or evidence of the p)esolnal unfitness or wanlt ot skill of an individual, call
have any effect in provinll or disproving the truth of rival medical
systemis. But such persolnl contests and virulent attacks injure the
while University and tlhe Dlepartment that in(lulg(es in them.
This Conmmittee believe tlat the Board shlould p)lace its stamp of
condemnation on every public personal attack, imade in print or by
parol, upon professors or officers of the Medical Schools; and any
violation of the rule already established by tile Board,-should subject
the guilty to prompt remloval from hlis offic;al position.
Regent Vanm Riper, a member of the Committee, was called away
by official business before drawing up the report, but iagreed substan"
tially with the views of the Committee.

Regent Grosvenor read the following communication:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,     |
ANN ARBOR, September 29, 1881. 
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN, —I have been asked, in behalf of the Faculty of
Medicine and Surgery, to call your attention to tile urgent necessity
of providing some meats for the ventilation of the lower lecture
room in the Medical building. The room is occupied by about 400
students, and is lighted by about 150 gas jets. The exhaustion of oxygen and contamination of the air in this room occurs therefore with
great rapidity; and it is demonstrable from sanitary data that for so
large an audience the air should be completely changed every ten
minutes. The present ventilating arrangements do not renew the air
once an hour; the result is that a fairly poisonous condition of the
room is attained in about fifteen minutes after the lecture bergis. It
is not unusual for students in the upper part of the room to be rendered seriously ill from;" air poisoning."
We believe that a hot air box can be laid from one of the heating coils in the Laboratory to the Medical lecture room, and that a
suitable supply of air can thus be forced into the building at a small
expense.
We therefore ask you to appropriate a sum, not exceeding two
hundred dollars,($200), and to appoint a committee for the purpose of




ADJOURNED MEETING, SEPTEMBER, 1881. 151


improving the ventilation of the lower lecture room of the Medical
building. It may be necessary to provide some small additional assistance to the engineer of the Laboratory to enable him to run the
engine at houris when he is not requitred to run it for Laboratory purposes.
Very respectfully,
JOHN W. LANGLEY,
Professor of General Chemistry.
On motion of Regent Grosvenor, the Auditing Board were
authorized to expend a sum, not to exceed $200, for the purpose of ventilating the lower lecture room of the Medical College, in accordance with the plan proposed by Professor J. W.
Langley.

At a meeting of the Library Committee of the Faculty, held

161


lution passed directing the Librarian to prepare a report on the subject, to be presented to the Board of Regents at their meeting Nov.
2d, with the view of securing from them, if possible, an appropriation to defray the expenses of subscriptions to periodicals, binding,
mending, and other necessary expenses, other than the purchase of
books.
In accordancewith the above resolution t have the honor to submit the following report:
You have never considered, I think, that the library has had all
the money that it needed, but only what you could spare it from the
General Fund, and what you could obtain for it from the several
Legislatures. The amount asked by you last year was $10,000, double
the amount received.
The committee, as related in the introduction to this report, have
had under consideration the needs of the library for the year upon
which we have entered, and their ability to meet them out of the legislative appropriation of $2,500.
There were last year nineteen departments of instruction to provide for; there are twenty-three this year. Two were established in
June, viz: Logic, Ethics, and the History of Philosophy, and Metallurgy.
Communications on the subject have been received from the
heads of these two departments.
Professor Morris writes, fiom Baltimore, as follows:
"The collection of books in the library of the University of
Michigan relating to the subject of instruction assigned to me by the
recent action of the Board of Regents, (Logic, Ethics, and History of
Philosophy) contains some lacunce which it is vitally important to fill
up, if possible, without any delay."
Professor Cheever writes:
"The following works, not now in the General Library, are absolutely necessary for the successful study of Metallurgy, and some
immediate provision should be made for obtaining the same. This is
an entirely separate and distinct, branch of study, and I ask, that the
usual allowance made to other departments, be made to this."
At the same time, Sanscrit, in the teaching of which Mr.'Thomas
had done volunteer work, was prescribed by you, and Mr. Thomas
now asks for the literature of his subject.
Later you established the chair of Mechanical Engineering. The
incumbent of that chair, Professor Cooley, has made an application
for books, and has so stated his needs that the committee made some
provision, which must be paid for out of the legislative appropriation.




162


NO:VEMBER MEETING, 1881.


The report of the Library Committee of the Board, il September, recommending the purchase of Crelle's Journal, was adopted on,condition that the amount called for, $475, should come out of the
legislative appropriation. That way of getting it had been considered
by the Library Committee of the Faculty, but it did not seem practicable.
I will show you briefly how the legislative appropriation for
1872 stands affected to-day.
The sum is.....................                        $2,500
The expenses that we can estimate are:
For annual subscriptions to periodicals.............$425
*"  binding  Iand  mending.......................... 250
reader's tickets, catalogues, cards, etc........... 5u
works issued in parts.......................  75
".transportatio..............................  50  $850
Debts alreldy incurred:
Bulletin de la Soc. Chimique de Paris..............$112
Percy Society Publications........................ 130
Memoirs of Royal Astronomical Society............. 1 5
Early Volumes of Botanische Zeitung.............. 60
For Professor Cooley's department.............  40
To complete the Fortnightly Review............. 15 $472 $1,322
$1,178.Crelle's Journal...................................     475
$ 703
This is all that is left to provide the special books for the departments, four of them new, and whatever may be required of a general
character.
It has become quite necessary to make additions to our periodical
list. Sets of important serials have been purchased to date, or nearly
to date, on the special lists. Provisions for their continuance, either
in the separate numbers as fast as they are issued, or in bound voliumes at the end of the year, should be made. To do this, and bind
such of them as come unbound, would require about $100.
In the hope that some fortunate turn in affairs would enable you
at this meeting to make provision out of the General Fund for sub-scriptions to periodicals, bindcing, mending, and other necessary cxpenses, and leiave the whole legislative appropriation to be applied, in
the language of the bill mnking it, "-for the purchase of books,"-in
this hope, and in order to have an expression of the wants of the de



NOVEMBER MEETING, 1881.


163


partments, the committee asked for department lists of books to the
amount of $40:00 to a department.
I wish, gentlemen of the Board, you could witness the pleparation of lists on the part of Professors; see them weigh one book
against another; see the scrutiny bestowed upon price lists; see the
careful calculations of discounts, and hear the fiequent inquiry made
of the Librarian, "Can we exceed the amount?" You would then understand, as you cannot now, how many, how varied, and.how importunate, are the wants of the library.
Now, in the spirit of my instruction from the committee, I respectfully and earnestly ask you to make provision out of the General
Fund for the subscriptions to periodicals, the binding, mending, and
other ordinary expenses, amounting, with the new subscriptions referred.to, to $935.
I would urge that, in this matter, the committee have strong
claims upon your consideration. They are charged by you with promoting.the interests of the library. They claim to have been watchful of those interests, and to have an intelligent conception of what is
needed.
Very respectfully submitted,
R. C. DAVIS,
Librarian.

Andrew Climie, relative to a claim for services as Superintendent, etc.

188


MA Y MEETING, 1852.


This Board has learned with profound regret of the decease
at Vevay, Switzerland, on the 15th day of November, 1881, of the
venerable Henry P. Tappan, D. D., LL. D., first President of
this University.
Dr. Tappan had long exceeded the assigned limit of three
score years and ten, and passed away after his life's work had
been honorably completed.
This Board desires here to place upon record its high appreciation of the learning of Ex-President Tappan as a scholar, his
ability as an educational organizer, and his virtues as a man.
We recognize the fact that Dr. Tappan, as first President of
this University, very largely contributed to lay its foundations
upon that broad and liberal plan which has resulted in rearing
its superstructure as a real University, as distinguished from the
College.
We believe that much of its success has been determined
by the large and wise ideal upon which it was modeled by President Tappan.
For the conspicuous part which he took in the organization
of the University; for the illustrious service which he rendered
to the cause of higher education in the new Northwest, his name
will be held in lasting remembrance in this scene of his labors.
While we thus testify to our appreciation of his worth and
services, we extend to his venerable consort and the other members of his family our condolence in their sorrow; a sorrow that
must be mitigated by the memory of his useful life, and the assurance of a blessed future.
The Board now went into executive session. After a
brief time spent therein, business in open session was resuned.
Regent Cutcheon presented the following resolution,
which was unanimously adopted.
Resolved, That the request of Professor Geo. S. Morris, for
leave of absence during the first semester of the next ensuing
year, for the purpose of delivering lectures at the Johns Hopkins University, and for other work at the East, be granted, upon the condition, as proposed by Professor Morris, that he
release to the University a half year's salary.
The following resolution was also presented by Regent
Cutcheon, and was adopted:




MA Y MEETING, 1382.


189


Resolved, That the matter of holding examinations in the
Department of Literature, Science and the Arts away from the
University, be referred to the Committee upon that Department,
with instructions to report at this meeting of the Board.
Regent W alker submitted the following resolution and
recommended its adoption:
Resolved, That the request of Mrs. Stowell for the use during the summer vacation of six microscopes, the property of
the University, at the proposed Summer School at Petoskey, be
granted, on condition that she receipt to the Steward for the
same, agreeing to become responsible for their safe and prompt
return before the beginning of the next academic year.
The resolution was adopted.
The following papers from the Secretary of the Department of Literature, Science, and the Xrts, and from     the
Dean of the School of Political Science were read by
Regent Cutcheon:
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
The Faculty of the Department of Literature, Science, and
the Arts beg leave to report the action they have taken under the
resolution adopted at the meeting of the Board, in September,
1881, in the matter of adjusting " the terms or conditions for advanced degrees." See page 89 of the printed minutes of Proceedings.
The Faculty have given a large amount of time to the consideration of the immediate question at issue, and of such other
questions as seemed to be intimately connected with it. As a result of such consideration they recommend that the relation of
the School of Political Science to the Department of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, be more precisely defined, and that the
requirements for degrees, both in that School, and in this Department, be fixed in accordance with the provisions of the following scheme:
(1) The School of Political Science, though still regarded as a part of
the Department of Literature. Science and the Arts, shall be practically an
independent organization, so fatr as relates to the general administration of
the work of the School, except as provided below.
(2) The members of the special Faculty of the School of Political Science shall also be members of the Faculty of the Department of Literature,
Science, and the Arts.
(3) All candidates for degrees in the Department of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, including those whose work has been done wholly or in part




190                 MA Y MEETING, 1882.
in the School of Political Science, must be recommended to the Board of Regents by the Faculty of the Department.
(4) The "credit system" as at present administered shall remain in
force for students that wish to obtain a Bachelor's degree under the provisions of that system.
(5) The present system of conferring a Master's degree on the completion of thirty Full Courses shall be discontinued.
(6) Students that have taken a Bachelor's degree on the "credit system" may be recommended by the Faculty for the corresponding Master's
degree after an additional year of residence at the University, provided they
pass a satisfactory examination on an approved course of study and present
a satisfactory thesis.
(7) Students that have completed their second year in the Department
of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and have also completed all the prescribed work offered in the first two years in some one of the several lines
of study leading to a Bachelor's degree, may be allowed to choose whether
they will continue their work on the " credit system" or on the so-called
"university system."
(8) Students working on the " university system" will not be held to
the completion of a fixed number of Courses, though they must take an
amount of work approved by the Faculty, or by a special committee of the
Faculty, and will be held subject to all the rules relating to attendance and
to examinations unless excused by the proper authority. Before they can
be recommended for a degree, however, they must have completed all the
Courses prescribed for the degree sought.
(9) Any student working on the " university system" may be admitted
to a special examination for a degree at a date not earlier than the end of
his fourth year of residence at the University, the examination to be conducted under the direction of those officers of instructien with whom such
student has pursued the major part of hi3 work. The degree conferred on
such student may be either a Bachelor's or Master's degree, and may be distinguished as conferred " with distinction," "Iwith high distinction," " with
the highest distinction," " curn laude," " magna curn laude," or " summa curn
laude," according to the merit of the student, it being understood that the
presentation of a thesis shall in all cases be necessary for the attainment of
a Master's degree. The title of the degree, whether in Arts, Philosophy,
Science, or Letters, shall be determined by:the character of the prescribed
work completed by the student.
(10) The Doctor's degree shall be conferred only on persons that have
previously received a Bachelor's or Master's degree.
(11) The Doctor's degrees shall be conferred only on persons that have
made special proficiency in some oue branch of study and good attainments
in two other branches, and upon presentation of a thesis that shall evince
power of research and of independent investigation.
(12) The degree of Doctor of Philosophy shall be open to persons that
have received the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Philosophy, Bachelor of Letters (Latin), or a corresponding Master's degree; the degree of
Doctor of Science to persons who have received the degree of Bachelor of
Science or Master of Science; and the degree of Doctor of Letters to persons
that have received the degree of Bachelor of Letters or ef Master of Letters.
(13) No person shall be admitted to the examination for a Doctor's degree in less than two years from the date of his first degree, whether that be




MA Y MEETING, 1882.


191


a Bachelor's or a Master's degree, except such persons as shall have received
a Master's degree with some special mark of distinction. Such persons may
present themselves for examination for a Doctor's degree in one year after
the attainment of the Master's degree.
Respectfully submitted,

REPORT ON THE USE OF MICROSCOPES IN                 THE
UNIVERSITY.
To the Honorable, the Board ot Regents:
The special committee appointed by your honorable body at
the meeting in May, " to take into consideration the relation
of instruction in microscopy to the various departments of the
University," and to report at the June meeting some "systematic plan for such instruction," embodying recommendations
touching the question of fees for the use of microscopes, "and
other matters pertaining to such instruction," beg leave to present the following report.
It is not necessary to conceal the fact that we have found the
duties imposed upon us, as exacting and delicate as they are
honorable and responsible. We have discovered complications
and conflicts which at first seemed hardly reconcilable with an
economical, efficient, and mutually satisfactory scheme of simplification. We are happy to state, however, that we have
finally agreed upon a plan of organization of microscopical work
in the University which seems to fulfill the most essential re



202


J UNE MEETING, 1882.


quirements, and secures, so far as we are informed, the approval
of all who are immediately concerned.
Few among us were aware of the magnitude to which the
microscopical work in the University has grown. The modern
methods of research in all the physical and biological sciences
have involved more and more an appeal to the microscope to resolve for us the last problems in the sciences of matter and of
life. It may be set down to the credit of the teachers of science
in the University, and thus to the credit of the University, that
we have not been left behind in the adoption of the improved
methods of research. Undoubtedly there may still be those outside the ranks of scientific investigators and teachers, who only
know the microscope as a toy which excites wonder by its revelation of the hairs on a fly's leg or the animalcules in a drop of
stagnant water. But such inadequate conceptions must exert no
influence in prescribing the limitations to be set to the researches
of a professor in the University.
The committee have held seven formal meetings, and have
had numerous individual interviews with each other and with
those interested in the use of microscopes. They have had a
separate and special consultation with each instructor having
microscopes in charge, and have obtained written statements
embodying desirable statistics, and the views of the several instructors respecting the proper demands of their respective chairs,
and the most practicable method of uniting all the operations
and all the interests in a single scheme.  We have been met by
a spirit of accommodation and even of self-sacrifice which deserves the expression of our thanks.
We find a total of 104 microscopes belonging to the University and employed in different branches of instruction. These
are distributed among makers as follows:
Bausch and Lomb _ --- —-----------------------     61
Zentmeyer ---------------------------             19

JUNE MEETING, 182.


'203


The total cost of these microscopes and the accessories used
with them is about $5,252. Omitting the first-class Grunow microscope purchased in 1856 for $500, including a complete outfit
of accessories, and an old Powell and Leland valued at $150, and
also an old inverted microscope set down at $50, the purchases
made in recent times, that is, since 1872, amount to about $4,568.
The present value of all these instruments and accessories may
be put at $4,618. The deterioration of microscopes and their accessories, when properly used and protected, is not rapid, except
when the brass-work is unavoidably exposed to corrosive fumes,
as in the investigations in a chemical laboratory. It is also true
that observations in connection with chemical work involve a
peculiar danger of the spilling of corrosive liquids on the stage
or other parts of the microscope, and a heedless manipulator will
increase the damage by neglecting to remove such liquids. Some
risks are always incurred in the use of microscopes by novices,
and at times the destruction from this cause is serious. Charges,
however, have been made by the University for the regular use
of microscopes by students as shown below:
In the histological laboratory, one dollar a student has
been charged, making an aggregate tax for two years, of $573.
(See appended tables.) Dr. Stowell states that the microscopes
on which this tax has been raised did not cost over $1,000, and
that the expense for reagents has not exceeded $173; so that at
$1.00 a student, the microscopes have brought a net revenue of
$200 a year, or 20 per cent. on the investment. If, however, as
your committee thinks must be the case, students have used the
19 Bausch and Lomb instruments, costing $1,270, the net revenue is 15| per cent. per annum.
In the laboratory for vegetable histology, according to the
statement of Acting Professor Spalding, the microscopes have
done a service which averages five years for each, have cost
$40.15 each, and have earned each, at $2.00 a student, $18.18,
which is 45 per cent. of the cost in 5 years, or 9 per cent. per annun-.
As a microscope with fair usage will last for twenty years, it
appears that the University, when receiving a fee of one or two
dollars a student, is more than reimbursed for the expenditure
-though this estimate, it should perhaps be said, does not embrace the larger expenditure for rooms, furniture, and warming,
incidental to the use of microscopes. So far as objectives, eyepieces, and other optical accessories are concerned, due care will




204


JUNE MEETING, 1882.


preserve them for 50 years, except when acrid fumes are unavoidable. The friction to which the microscopic stand is subject
creates a liability to more rapid deterioration; but this can be
prevented by careful attention to lubrication. Your committee
are convinced from observation and general report, that most of
the deterioration of microscopes results from unskilfulness and
carelessness of users; and they suggest the exercise of reserve in
entrusting these delicate instruments to the manipulation of inexpert hands.
Your committee have considered the practicability of concentrating into one central laboratory all the microscopic instruction and investigation undertaken in the University. A noment's consideration, however, suffices to show that this cannot
be done in an absolute sense; though we shall recommend an
approximation to it. There is a large demand for the use of microscopes in immediate connection with the materials to be investigated, and which are and must remain somewhat scattered.
The microscopes in the chemical laboratory, for instance, are
brought into requisition in connection with the reactions of manipulatory chemistry, and often in the progress of a manipulation. The instruments must be momentarily accessible to the
room for chemical operations. In botany and zoology the conduct of instruction in certain courses, which are generally given
to small classes, must rely on the use of the microscope in immediate connection with the instruction. Such are courses in the
fructification of algce, in the forms and structures of diatoms,
in the forms and structures of infusoria, and in the development
of the embryo. Entirely similar are the requirements in palaeontological courses, involving the study of the minute structures
of the shells of fossil brachiopods, or of the coral skeletons of
polyps. The same must be said in courses requiring the study
of the optical characters of minerals. Moreover all the advanced
courses in the subjects consist of researches through a wide range
ef specimens belonging to a given class, and which must be obtained from the museum collections. Finally, the methods of
preparing many of these specimens are quite unlike those eimployed in the simpler and more usual line of research, so that
some special appliances have to be provided which it would be a
useless expenditure to provide for ordinary microscopical work.
The following are the branches of science in which microscopical work is at present carried on in the University:
Human Histology,      Med., Dent., Lit.,  Dr. Stowell,
Comparative Histology,  Zoology,      Drs. Stowell and Steere.

As a rule, every student entering upon the use of the microscope in any one of these branches is under the necessity of acquiring in the University the skill requisite for successful
manipulation. Manifestly, therefore, some advantage would be
gained by sending students first to a central school of microscopic
manipulation. Here they might be at first restricted to the use
of cheap instruments, and thus, perhaps, some costly accidents
would be avoided.
But students learning to use the microscope must employ
some suitable objects for examination. These are preferably the
ordinary tissues of plants and animals. The study of the microscope involves, therefore, the study of general histology. By the
time adequate expertness has been acquired in the use of the instrument and its accessories, the student has made such progress
in either Vegetable or Animal Histology that the subject has been
pursued to all the length required by the University courses, or
at least to such length that good economy requires the completion of the study in the school of microscopy.
Now, in this view, the school of microscopy would provide
all the instruction needed in Human Histology, Comparative
Histology, and Vegetable Histology.
Next, it is ascertained that the same school could similarly furnish nearly all the instruction needed in the College of
Dentistry, and in Pathological Anatomy.
All that remains of the microscopical work first enumerated
is that in Physiological and Analytical Chemistry, and the researches in Botany, Zoology, and Paleontology. But to these
ought to be added Mineralogy. The microscopical work in
Physiology and Analytical Chemistry must remain, so far as
your committee can learn, very nearly as it is. Each of the
other four subjects named will need a certain number of microscopes for independent use. We are informed also, by the Assistant Professor of Pathological Anatomy, that while the great
body of his students could obtain the requisite instruction in a
preparatory school of the microscope, there are always a few




206


JUNE MfEETING, 1882.


who desire to do special and more advanced work; and for their
use a few instruments ought to be under his own control.
Your committee are therefore prepared to recommend as the
most practicable, efficient, and economical expedient, in the
present condition of microscopical work, the organization of a
central LABORATORY FOR MICROSCOPY AND GENERAL HISTOLOGY.
Instruction should be given in this Laboratory in the following subjects:
1. Microscopical technics, or the science and art ofmicroscopy, comprising:
(a) The theory and construction of the instrument and its various accessories;
(b) The methods of determining magnifications;
(c) The methods of microscopic drawing, microscopic photography,
and microscopic projections;
(d) The preparation of objects of various classes.
2. Human Histology.
3. Comparative Histology.
4. Vegetable Histology.
5. Dental Histology.
6. Pathological Anatomy.
7. Completion of microscopic study in such other subjects as may be desired by professors in charge.
The subject of Human Histology belongs to the medical
schools. Comparative Histology is embraced in the chair of Zoology, and it is probable that the course required of beginners in
the use of the microscope, if directed to the study of animal tissues, would complete all the Comparative Histology suited to
elementary courses in Zoology. There will always be a limited
number, however, desiring to pursue more advanced courses in
Comparative Histology and other zoological researches, who will
need to be provided for by the Professor of Zoology. The Professor, however, in writing, expresses his willingness to require
a course in microscopical technics and Animal Histology as prerequisite to these advanced courses.
The subject of Vegetable Histology has heretofore been embraced in the Chair of Botany, but a large part of the instruction
is given under the auspices of the School of Pharmacy. Your
Committee recommend, therefore, for this and other reasons,
that "Vegetable Histology " be detached from the Chair of
Botany, so that all students in this subject, from whatever Department or School, shall receive theirinstruction in it from the
instructors in the Microscopical Laboratory. In this recom



JUNE MEETING, 1882.


207


mendation your Committee have the full written concurrence of
the Acting Professor of Botany. The latter, however, reserves
all instruction of a biological nature, such as the life-histories of
plants, much of which involves research in minute forms and
structures. He expresses his willingness, under the plan here
proposed, to require all his advanced students to take a preliminary course in Vegetable Histology and the use of the microscope.
The subject of Dental Histology is under the auspices of the
College of Dental Surgery, and the Faculty of this College, your
Committee are informed, will be pleased to have their microscopical instruction given in the central Microscopical Laboratory.
Pathological Anatomy is under the auspices of the College
of Medicine and Surgery; but the Assistant Professor informs
us in writing that the demands of elementary instruction will
be answered by a central Microscopical Laboratory.
It is the belief of your committee that professors in charge
of special advanced instruction in some of the branches of science, may sometimes find it convenient to remand to the Microscopical Laboratory sonme of that grade and kind of instruction
which, ordinarily, professors of these subjects would find it desirable to retain under their personal direction.
The " Laboratory for Microscopy and General Histology"
should be specially constructed with a view to the proper admission of light. There ought to be separate apartments for the different classes of work, and supplied with separate sets of instruments, so that studies might be pursued simultaneously by
different classes of students. For the present, so far as your
committee can discern, different rooms must be located upon
different parts of the grounds; but the laboratory will still be
organically one. Moreover, Acting Professor Spalding desires
to retain as a Botanical Laboratory, the room hitherto used by
Mrs. Stowell. Should this be thought immediately advisable, it
would not be impracticable that the same room should constitute
an apartment of the Microscopical Laboratory during the forenoon, and be the Botanical Laboratory during the afternoon,
though the use of the same microscopes, if by any means possible, ought to be avoided.
This laboratory should receive: 1st, The microscopes and apparatus heretofore used in the Laboratory of Histology and




208


JUNE MEETING, 1882.


Microscopy under the direction of Dr. Stowell; 2d, The microscopes and accessories and other appurtenances heretofore used
by Mrs. Stowell, in giving instruction in Microscopical Botany, so-called; 3d, Such other microscopes and accessories as
may become necessary in carrying the present plan into effect.
In this connection it may be stated that six of the oldest microscopes heretofore used by Mrs. Stowell require new stands and
eye-pieces. These will involve an expense of $25 each; though
the old stands and eye-pieces may be made to realize something.
Your committee recommend. 1st, That a uniform charge at
the rate of three dollars a semester be imposed on each student
taking a first course either in the Microscopical Laboratory or
other laboratories in which the use of the microscope is regular
and continuous. 2d, That a fee of one dollar and a half be collected of each student in the Chemical Laboratory, where two
students have simultaneously the use of the same microscope.
3d, That for an advanced course the regular charge be at the rate
of five dollars a semester. 4th, That in all cases the student be
required to supply himself with the requisite glass slides and
thin covers; and 5th, That every student be held strictly responsible for extraordinary damage or deterioration resulting to instruments or apparatus while in use by him. It is not recommended that any fee be charged when the use of the microscope
is casual and occasional.
Your committee further recommend that Dr. Charles H.
Stowell be appointed Assistant Professor of Histology and lMicroscopy and Director of the Microscopical Laboratory. They also
recommend that Mrs. Louise Reed Stowell be appointed Assistant Professor of Vegetable Histology and Microscopy.
Dr. Stowell will thus sustain functional relations to the
Medical, Dental, and Academic Faculties; and Mrs. Stowell to
the Academic and Pharmaceutical Faculties.
Under the plan here proposed, the instruction of the students
in Dentistry and Pathological Anatomy will augment considerably the demands on the Microscopical Laboratory, and it will
become imperatively necessary to employ an assistant at an expense of about $500. We have information that one of the professors in the Department of Medicine and Surgery is willing to
relinquish his assistant, now paid $200, for the purpose of facilitating the plan here recommended. Such assistant for the in



JUNE MEETTING, 18S2.


209


creased compensation, would;erve in the Microscopical Laboratory, and in addition, would render the professor referred to, all
assistance essential to him.
Should the " Laboratory for Microscopy and General Histology" be organized as above recommended, the microscopes
belonging to the University, and not included in the outfit for
this laboratory, as also the total number desired by the several
professors in charge, would be distributed as shown below:
Provided. Wanted.
Physiological and Analytical Chemistry -----  41    41
Botanical Laboratory           -----------------  0  15
Zoological Laboratory ---------------         4     13
Palueontological Laboratory -- -------------- 2      2
Mineralogical Laboratory ------------------   0      1
Pathological Laboratory --- —---—. --- —---    0      4
It thus appears that the several laboratories ask for an aggregate increase of 29 instruments, which would cost about $1,100.
Your committee do not deem it necessary to make aly recommendation on this point. They think it proper, however, to
state their conviction, that the chairs making the largest requisitions would be content to begin with small outfits; and to direct
attention to the special claim of a chair like that of Mineralogy,
which at present is not provided with a single microscope, and
would not be able hereafter to avail itself of the Microscopical
Laboratory.  The cost of a microscope suited to the modern
methods of mineralogical research would be about $125.
The scheme thus set forth is not one which, in its completeness, reduces the actual expenditures on account of mricroscopical work. If it possesses any merits as an economical plan,
they consist in providing for increased revenues, and in forestalling impending demands for largely increased expenditures,
which were about to be received from the College of Dental Surgery and from the chairs of Pathological Anatomy and Zoology.
In fact, almost the only additional expenditure involved in the
present plan arises from the effort to dispose of these anticipated
demands, and from the cost of some repairs needed under any
organization of microscopical work.
Should the recommendations of this report be adopted by
the Board, they would involve action upon the following points:
1. The establishment, by simple resolution, of a " Laboratory for Microscopy and General Histology."




210


JUNE MEETING, 1882.


2. The appointment of Dr. Charles H. Stowell as "Assistant Professor of Histology and Microscopy and Director of the
Microscopical Laboratory."
3. The appointment of Mrs. Louisa Reed Stowell as "Assistant Professor of Vegetable Histology and Microscopy."
4. The appointment of an " Assistant in the Laboratory for
Microscopy and General Histology,"-an arrangement being
practicable as suggested.
5. The adoption of a resolution fixing the fees to be collected
for the use of microscopee, and defining the responsibility of
students for extraordinary damages.
6. Such appropriations as may be involved in the foregoing
appointments, and also an appropriation of $150 for new stands
and eye-pieces for six instruments in the Microscopical Laboratory.-Appropriations for the following objects the Committee
leave without recommendations, in the light of statements previously made:
Mineralogical Laboratory --------- _  1 microscope, $125
Pathological " ___ ----          - 4 microscopes, 140
Zoological     "   -------  ----   9    "     315
Botanical     "        --------- 15     "     525
Total    -------------- 29             $1105
7. The designation of separate apartments for the working
room for Vegetable Histology and for the Botanical Laboratory.
8. Arrangemrents for the construction of a central Microscopical Laboratory building at some time in the future.
Respectfully submitted.

To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN,-In presenting the Annual Report of the Department of Medicine and Surgery, I have the satisfaction of
stating that another year of prosperity and success has attended




JUNE MEETING, 1882.


213


our labors. The extended course of three years of nine months
each is now thoroughly inaugurated. A very large proportion
of the present candidates for graduation have been with us three
years; have devoted their first year to the elementary branches
of Anatomy, Physiology, Chemistry, and Materia Medica, with
practical work in the various laboratories; the second year they
have reviewed these studies by again listening to lectures upon
them, and have passed their examination by the State Board of
Examiners, as well as by the members of the Faculty, touching
these subjects, and completed their work in the laboratories.
During this second year they have also attended the lectures on
the practical branches of Practice of Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics, and Ophthalmology, thus getting a general view of the
whole field of medical science. The third year they have devoted themselves exclusively to the advanced practical branches,
attending the numerous clinics, keeping records of cases, assisting in the care and watching the progress of the numerous interesting diseases in the Hospital, and thus preparing themselves
for the practice of their profession.
During their course, besides attending the descriptions and
demonstrations in the lecture-room, they have had thorough instruction in practical anatomy in the dissecting-room, having
themselves worked out every part of the human body; have had
special courses in Surgical Anatomy and in Pathological Anatomy; have performed surgical operations on the cadaver; have
been well instructed in the use and become familiar with the
revelations of the microscope, especially as applied to medicine;
have had extended work in the Chemical Laboratory, analyzing
numerous substances and witnessing the reaction of agents;
have had practical work in Medical Chemistry, examining the
secretions of the body, healthy and morbid, furnished by patients in the Hospital, and by others; have had a course in Botany; have had instruction in the application of electricity; in
the use of the sphygmograph, the ophthalmoscope, and the
laryngoscope, and, in short, have had all the subjects of a thorough medical education presented by those who have become
experts in the various branches.
The effects of this extended and thorough course have been
manifested in the medical scholarship of the class now presented
to you for the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Although our
standard of qualifications has been constantly elevated, no class
has hitherto received so high an aggregate vote as the present,
2




214


JUNE MEETING,, 18s2.


and no class, we believe, has here, or elsewhere in the country,
been more worthy of the honor they are about to receive. Even
stronger language than this would be justified, did we choose to
use it. The superiority claimed is for the system rather than
for those concerned in carrying it out.
The work in the lecture-rooms by the six full professors in
the Medical Faculty has been carried on in the usual manner,
and requires no special notice.
The work in the Hospital and clinics has largely increased.
Over thirteen hundred different persons have gone upon the
record as patients, and although many of them have had more
than one disease, and come under the care of more than one
member of the Faculty, or have had more than one attack, they
have been counted but once. Many, for instance, presenting
themselves for diseases of the eye or some surgical affection,
have had internal diseases requiring the attention of those having the care of that department, but the cases have been recorded
as belonging in the department to which they first applied, and
although having all the interest of new medical cases, they are
mentioned in the report but once.
Arranged according to the department in which they have
been recorded, there have been 526 cases of diseases of the eye
and ear, 394 surgical cases, 328 medical cases, and 73 cases of diseases peculiar to womcn and children. The greater part of these
have come from a distance, very many of them requiring special methods of investigation and treatment. Important operations, or unusual appliances, have been in very great variety,
and have been of much more than common interest.
For a more full account of the Hospital work, reference is
made to the report of the House Physician and Surgeon, which
is submitted.
Not to dwell further upon the work of the full members of
the Faculty, it seems desirable to call the attention of your Honorable Body to the work of professors in other departments done
for our class, the work of assistant professors and lecturers,
and of the assistants to the different professors.
Professor Winchell, by the invitation of our Faculty, has
given a short but very interesting and profitable course on Botany, which has been attended more particularly by our first
year students. The Faculty wish to express their obligation to
Professor Winchell for this gratuitous work.

Professor Prescott, though professor in and Dean of another
Department, has given a course of lectures on Organic Chenlistry which has been of much interest and value.
Dr. Sewall has occupied the last semester with a course of
lectures and instruction on Physiology, of which an account
will be given in a separate report, concerning which recommendations will be offered.
Assistant Professor Herdman has given a course of instruction on Surgical and another on Pathological Anatomy, in addition to his duties as Demonstrator. A more full report made by
him is transmitted.
Assistant Professor Vaughan, in addition to his work in the
Chemical Laboratory, has given a short course of instruction in
Diseases of the Urinary Organs, and another in Diseases of the
Throat, and the Use of the Laryngoscope. He has also, as in
former years, given a portion of the course on Materia Medica.
Dr. Vaughan reports that during the entire year he has had four
hours a day in the laboratory, and on an average has given five
lectures a week. During the first semester, however, a part of
the lectures were given in the School of Political Science.
Assistant Professor Stowell has given a course of Histological lecturrs, and given instruction to a large number of our students in the practical use of the microscope. Reference is umade
to his report, which is transmitted.
The Assistants to the several Professors have also performed
important services to the students and the University, for which,
as they have received but small pecuniary they should have
proper verbal and recorded acknowledgements.
Dr. Hendricks, who has been in the service of the Anatomical Department for several years, has rendered during the last
term most efficient service to the Professor of Anatomy and also
in building up the Medical Museum, of which he is Curator. His
report of his work is transmitted, and I am instructed by a
unanimous vote of the Faculty, and requested by a letter from
Professor Ford, to present a recommendation respecting him, to
which your attention will be more particularly called.
The Assistant to the Professor of Pathology and Practice of
Medicine and Clinical Medicine-Dr. Dight-has rendered important service. According to his report, made to the Dean, he
has met the senior class in lectures three times a week during
the term, and in what are called " Quizzes" has reviewed with
them the lectures that have been given by the Professors he as



216


JUNE MEETING, 1882.


sists. He has attended all the lectures of the Professors in order
to examine upon the subjects. He has also in sections of five or
six assisted in giving instruction in the use of the Laryngoscope.
He has also attended all the medical clinics, continuing from one
to two hours each, three times a week, and has spent, as he reports, from one and a half to two hours daily, on an average, or
twelve and a quarter hours a week, in clinical work in the amphitheatre and the hospital. All this is exclusive of his very
efficient work as secretary of the Faculty. The recording of all
the names of students, attending to their seating, recording their
absences, giving them certificates of attendance, notifying the
Professors of Faculty meetings, conducting the. correspondence,
sending away from 4,000 to 5,000 Announcements, etc., requires
an amount of labor which one cannot appreciate without witnessing it.
Dr. Kennan, Assistant to the Professor of Materia Medica
and Ophthalmology, reports that during the first semester he
held two recitations a week, with assigned lessons from a work
or Materia Medica for the first year's students, and the same
number for the second year's students during the second semester. He has also bestowed much labor in the Ophthalmic clinics
and the hospital in attendance upon the patients. His work has
been very efficiently performed.
Dr. Hall, Assistant to the Professor of Obstetrics, reports that
he has given nine hours of labor a week at the hospital,
three hours at the college in recitations with the senior class,
and four in attendance upon the lectures of the Professors,
making sixteen hours a week.    His duties have been to
assist at two clinics a week, and to visit the patients in the
hospital under Professor Dunster's care, look to their condition,
direct what may be necessary for the time, and report to the Professor.
The Assistant to the Professor of Surgery, Dr. Sullivan, as
he reports, has attended the lectures on Surgery, three times a
week,getting in readiness means of illustration,has attended often
four clinics a week, meantime being required to continue after
the clinic to look after the patient operated upon. During the
first semester instruction was given by him once a week on Minor Surgery, bandaging, etc., and he has applied or aided in adplying fifty-three plaster casts, for diseases of joints, club-foot,
and disease of the spine, and three reviews were held each week
for sections of the senior class. He says it would be impossible




JUNE MEETING, 1882.


217


to state the number of hours spent in the hospital wards; part
of his time, however, he states, has been spent in this work as
Assistant to the Chair of Surgery.
Dr. Joy, assistant to the professor of General Chemisty, has
given 72 lessons in Electro-Therapeutics to sections of the class
and a quiz once a week during the first semester, and cannot,
therefore, state the amount of work done by him.
The labor of these assistants to the professors has been of
very great service to the students and the college, without which
the proper teaching of so large a number of students would have
been impossible. In the course of my experience I have never
known so large an amount of so skilled and useful labor performed for so little compensation. It is feared that we cannot
long expect so much for so little. It is true that this, like all useful and skilful labor, has a reflex effect upon those performing it,
especially if performed by the young, but other than this kind of
compensation is generally found necessary.
In conclusion, the Faculty congratulate the University and
the Regents upon the large number of students in attendance
upon the department, and upon the results which have been accomplished.                Respectfully submitted,
A. B. PALMER, Dean.
On motion of Regent Walker, the papers accompanying the report just read were ordered to be placed on file.
Certain resolutions adopted by the Faculty of the Department of Medicine and Surgery, relative to the appointment of " medical examiners," and to other matters, were
read by Dr. Palmer. On motion of Regent Grosvenor, the
resolutions touching the affairs of the Medical Department
were referred to the Committee on the Medical Department; and those relative to the expenditure of money
were referred to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Medical Department jointly.
Dr. Henry Sewall read a paper relative to the work
which had been performed in the Department of Physiology, which had been under his charge during the second
semester of the present academic year.
Regent Cutcheon moved the reference of the paper to
the Committee on Finance and the Executive Committee
jointly, which was agreed to.

J UNE MEETING, 1882.


Dr. Donald Maclean read his report on the clinical
work performed in the hospital during the year just closed.
On motion of Regent Grosvenor, the report was received
and ordered printed in the minutes.
A Condensed Report to the Board of Regents of the Surgical
Clinic of University Hospital for the Session 1881-2, by
Donald Maclean, M. D., Professor of Surgery.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents, of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN: I have the honor herewith to present to you
the annual report of work done by me in the Surgical department of the University Hospital.
It will be observed that the name, age, disease, treatment,
and result of each case, together with the postoffice address is
noted in full.
The accompanying volume (referring to clinical record of
the hospital) contains a full history and description of each of
these cases.
For this record my clinical clerk, Mr. E. A. Christian, deserves very great credit. A single glance at the case-book will
suffice to give you some idea of the thoroughness, care, and neatness with which he has executed his task.
The following is a condensed summary of the report herewith submitted:
Four hundred surgical patients have passed through my
hands during the season now closed. Of these a large proportion were presented to the class on several different occasions for
the purpose of illustrating different forms or phases of their ailments, and to illustrate also the effects of treatment. The dressing and after-treatment of these patients has furnished the
merbers of the graduating class with much valuable practice.
I will not weary you with details of purely professional facts, but
will merely mention a few of the more important diseases met
with during the session:
Different forms of abscess, including Lumbar Abscess.
Caries of bones of foot requiring Syme's ankle-joint amputation.
Caries of bones of wrist requiring amputation of forearm.

From this partial list it will appear that almost every department of surgery has been illustrated by characteristic cases.
One hundred and fifty operations were performed by me before
the class. One hundred of these were performed under anaesthetics, chloroform being the only anaesthetic employed. Four
pounds of chloroform in all were used. The largest quantity
given to any one patients was gij, and the smallest.ss. The average quantity of each patient was 3ivN. No accident of any
kind resulted from the use of this anesthetic. The same statement may be made with regard to all preceding sessions. The
great economy of chloroform used is due mainly to the peculiar
apparatus and method of administration.
Of the four-hundred cases recorded this year the great majority, it will be seen, were dismissed, cured, or in progress of cure.
A few were only relieved, a still smaller number were dismissed
unbenefited or incurable, and six died. Of the latter every case
was after operation for painful diseases, which must soon have
terminated fatally under any circumstances, the operation affording the last forlorn hope of life.
When the critical and peculiar nature of almost every case
sent to this clinic is considered, I am sure it will be conceded
by every impartial judge of the subject that the results and statistics here presented are in all respects creditable to surgery and
to this department of the University of Michigan.
The annual report of the House Surgeon and Resident Physician of the University Hospital, presented by
Regent Grosvenor, was received, and is as follows.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, }
June 27, 1882.    }
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN,-I have the honor to submit the following report:
During the past year, from October 1, 1881, up to and including June 24 last, thirteen hundred and twenty-one patients
have registered and been treated at the clinics of the Department
of Medicine and Surgery, this number not including one hundred and four patients who have returned within this time for
treatment for the same or some other ailment.
Of this number eight hundred and twenty-three have remained in the hospital; the remaining four hundred and ninetyeight, through choice or necessity, owing to want of room in the




222


JUNE MEETING, 1882.


hospital, have found accommodations outside. Besides this,
many patients have been accompanied by their friends, to care
for them during their sickness. The number extends into the
hundreds, but no official record of them has been kept.
The patients have been classified as follows:
Diseases of the Eye and Ear   -----—. --- —- 526
Surgical Cases __ —__ -------------— _- -__ — ____ _ 400
Medical Cases — _______ --- —------------------- 328
Diseases peculiar to Wome  -----------------  73
Total -------------     ------   --- 1327
A large number of patients have entered two or more of the
clinics. In the above arrangement the patient has been put in
that department in which he more particularly belongs.
They come from fifteen States, Ontario, and Manitoba, viz:
From Ohio, 39; Indiana, 38; Ontario, 34; Illinois, 5; 3 each
from Wisconsin, Kansas, and Iowa; 2 each from Massachusetts,
New York, and Pennsylvania, and 1 each from Colorado, Vermont, Nebraska, Missouri, Dakota, and Manitoba; the remaining eleven hundred and eighty-four being from Michigan.
Three hundred and fifty-five important operations have been
performed during the year, and anaesthetics have been administered in two hundred and thirty-nine cases.
One hundred and ninety-six of these operations have been
on the eye, thirty-five being for the extraction of hard cataract,
and all, with one exception, have been the means of restoring
sight to the blind. Enucleations have been performed fifteen
times, and operations for the relief of squint in forty-six cases.
In the surgical clinics, one hundred and forty-eight operations have been performed, many of them major operations and
of very important character. Numerous casts, splints, extensions, and other apparatus have also been applied before the
classes or in the wards of the hospital.
In the department of diseases peculiar to women, seventeen
important operations have been performed, twelve resulting in
perfect success, two greatly improved, and three failures.
In all, ten have died. Many have come too late to receive
benefit, and have been immediately dismissed. Of the remainder very many have been cured, many have been benefited, and
many more have received treatment, gone to their homes, and
never reported.
During the year thirteen children have been received under
Act No. 138, of May, 1881, providing for the treatment of de



JUNE MEETING, 18S2.


223


pendent and neglected children; others have been refused admission, owing to want of proper accommodations; and in this
connection I deem it proper to state, that if this Act, one of the
most charitable our Legislature in its wisdom has ever passed,
providing for the medical care of the young at a time when disease most readily yields to treatment, is to be of any force, it is
imperative that some proper provision be made for them outside
the crowded wards of a general hospital.
The year has been one of prosperity to the University Hospital, due in a great measure to harmony among all and hard
work by all. To Drs. Young and Turner, and to Mrs. De Motte
and Mrs. Allerdice, much credit is due. They have discharged
their duties faithfully towards the patients and the interests of
the department. Great credit also is-due the matrons, Mrs. Hurd
and Mrs. Rosebrugh. Their care of the wards and University
property entrusted to their keeping has never been equaled,
their bill of fare has been all that could be desired, and in catering to the whims and appetites of the sick they have been very
successful.
Nor would I forget the students of the graduating class.
They have cheerfully done an immense amount of work in the
care of the sick assigned them, both by day and night. Without their aid it would have been impossible to have gotten along.
The capacity of the hospital has been strained to the utmost.
With the exception of a few days during the holidays, from the
day of opening up to the time of closing, the wards have been
overcrowded all the time. All available room has been occupied, and patients were often glad to sleep in cots, stretchers, operating tables, chairs, or on the floor, rather than be turned away.
If this department of this great University is to be allowed to
grow, as it must and will, more room will be required. The
large number of outdoor patients, and the great increase in
attendance upon the clinics over previous years, must suggest
some of its possibilities.
We feel thankful to you for the many improvements you
have given us during the past year; but our needs are still many,
and, in conclusion, I beg briefly to call your attention to a few
most earnestly needed, asking them, not of or for ourselves, but
in the name of sixteen hundred afflicted who will ask admittance and proper accommodations in the University Hospital
next year.
The ventilation of the two main wards is very imperfect.
The wards of a crowded hospital should above all things else be




224


JUNE MEETING, 1882.


thoroughly ventilated, and special attention is called to this
matter.
Professor Dunster's room for gynaecological work, always too
small, has been almost unfitted for his work by the building of
the eye ward opposite his window, thereby obstructing the light
and seriously interfering with his work. A larger and well
lighted room is needed for this growing clinic.
I would also recommend that a proper room be fitted up for
the dispensing of medicines; that a dispensing clerk be appointed from either the Medical or Pharmacy classes, at no salary, who will fill one or more regular hours a day dispensing
medicines, dressings, etc. I urge this as a matter of economy,
fully believing that the amount saved in a year will more than
pay the necessary initiatory expense.
Further, I would recommend for your consideration the heating by steam of the older portion of the hospital, occupied by
the Resident Physician, Matrons, and private rooms for very
sick patients. In these rooms seven stoves are in use about
seven months of the year. Their exchange for steam-pipes I
would consider a matter of safety, cleanliness, and economy.
The accommodations of the ward water-closets should be
increased, and some method adopted for their ventilation.
Some provision should be made for the increasing number
of help employed in buildings connected with the hospital. At
present they are obliged to occupy the private rooms and beds in
the wards, to the detriment oftentimes of the sick. I would
suggest the advisability of adding another story to the kitchen
and dining-room, for their accommodation.
At present, in all the wards, only hard water can be obtained
for the cleansing of wounds and toilet purposes. For many reasons this is not suitable. Cannot some means be employed by
which the large quantity of rain water from our roofs might be
utilized in the wards?
Respectfully submitted.
GEO. F. HEATH, M. D.,
House Surgeon and Res. Phys., University Hospital.

The following paper, read by Regent Cutcheon, was
adopted:
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN.-Certain members of the Faculty of the Department of Medicine and Surgery having requested the Board
in writing " that it be ascertained whether any one connected
with the University is responsible for the unauthorized use of
the statements of members of the Faculty, or for the contents
or character of" a certain publication made by Wagner & Co.
relating to the electrical belt or device invented by Dr. D. A.
Joy, which publication is regarded as a violation of medical ethics, and charges having been formulated against Dr. D. A. Joy,
as the party claimed to be responsible therefor, and evidence
having been adduced both in support of and in denial of said
charges, and argument had thereon, and the whole matter having been duly considered, the Board do find from the evidence
before us, as follows, to wit:
1. That the Faculty of the Department of Medicine and
Surgery are in no manner and to no extent responsible for the
unethical advertisement of Dr. D. A. Joy's electrical belt.
2. That Dr. Joy did not by his written contract wiih Wagner & Co., protect himself and his associates in the Faculty from
the unprofessional and unethical use of their certificates, and
thereby exposed himself and them to the liability of injury,
through either the ignorance or unscrupulousness of his advertisers and contractors, and that thus the enemies of the department have taken occasion to make scandal.
But believing that Dr. Joy has in good faith discontinued
the said business, and so far as he could control it, the advertisement thereof, and that he has not intentionally brought this
scandal upon the medical Faculty, we do not find that he has
been guilty of any conduct requiring dismissal from the University.
The report of the Homceopathic Medical College was
read by Dr. T. P. Wilson, Dean, as follows:

JUNE MEETING, 1882.


Report of the Homceopathic Medical College.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
Anni Arbor, June 27, 1882. 
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN,-The Faculty and Board of Examiners have
the honor to report the continued and satisfactory prosperity of
this Department.
It is no small gratification to us to find, at the end of the
seventh annual session, that in all respects we have made from
the commencement until now steady and substantial gain. No
other Department in this University in its earlier years enjoyed
a greater relative prosperity than has this Department.
Under the liberal endowment given us by the Legislature,
and under your protecting and fostering care, our success has
met our most sanguine expectations.
The past session has demonstrated the wisdom of the extension of the curriculum adopted by your Honorable body. Our
students have been immeasurably benefited by the additional
advantages presented in the nine months' course, and we are
pleased to know that our sister institutions throughout the country are seriously agitating the question of adopting our plan of
instruction.
We beg to call your attention to the great increase of clinical
work the past year.
Our Hospital during the greater part of the year was inadequate to hold all the cases that applied to us for relief. We have
been obliged to secure private quarters for a large number of
patients.
The conversion of our upper lecture room into a ward gave
us needed relief, and we have in addition converted our faculty
room into a private ward.
Besides the large increase of hospital patients, we have had
our out-patients much increased, so that we have often found it
difficult to treat all who came within the brief hours we have
allotted to this work.
And here we desire to call the attention of your Honorable
Board to a matter of supreme importance to our future plan of
instruction.
It is the desire of this Faculty to make our clinical instruction of the highest possible value to our classes. Our curriculum
is arranged to secure the attendance of Freshmen and Juniors




JUdYE MEETING, 1882.

as well as Seniors during our clinical lectures, and we have prepared clinical record books in which students are to keep a careful record of the various cases brought before them.
Our plan, however, has measurably failed during the past
year, on account of the arrangement of lectures in the Department of Medicine and Surgery, which required the attendance
of our students there during our clinic hours.
This we have in vain sought to remedy by petition to the
Faculty of the Department of Medicine and Surgery.
What we desire is that your Honorable Board shall direct
that in the future arrangement of lectures all the classes in our
Department shall be under our charge during every Wednesday
and Saturday forenoon from 9 to 12 o'clock, and that at the same
time they shall not suffer loss from non-attendance upon required lectures; in other words, that the lectures in the two
Departments shall be so arranged that our plan of clinical education may be successfully carried out.
The chair of Diseases of Women and Children in our Department still remains vacant. We solicit your earnest attention again to this want, and beg you to secure for us from the
Legislature the needed appropriation, that we may have it filled.
We respectfully present you the following reports from our
hospital and general clinical work.
T. P. WILSON, Dean.

JUNE MEETING, 1882.


Of this number of surgical diseases treated in the Homoeopathic hospital and clinic, there were 131 operations performed,
some of which were known as the major operations of surgery,
viz: three cases of stone in the bladder; one immense tumor of
the mammae; one case of atresia vaginae with complete occlusion
of the canal; three cases of resection from necrosis; three cases
of external urethrotomy; three cases of internal urethrotomry;
one case of Dupuytren's operation for artificial anus; one amputation of the thigh (lower third); two cases of perineal rupture
with laceration of the recto-vaginal septum; three cases of tumors removed from the neck; one case of extrophy of the bladder; one case of lithrotity; one case of resection of the entire
ulna, besides scores of others of greater or less magnitude. The
number of spinal-curvature cases treated during the term was
45, and 103 plaster casts applied according to my improved process, all of whom are cured or in various stages of improvement.
Of these 131 surgical operations, performed in various condiditions of health and under circumstances quite different from
the patient's usual mode of life, it is gratifying to state that not
a single death occurred either in or out of the hospital, so far as
I am informed.
Very respectfully,
E. C. FRANKLIN.

Present-the President, Regents Cutcheon, Walker,
Duffield, VanRiper, Grosvenor, Shearer, and Blair.
The following report from  Professor Mortimer E.
Cooley, from the Department of Mechanical Engineering,
was read by Regent Cutcheon:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, }
June 26, 1882. 
To the President and Honorable Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan:
GENTLEMEN,-At the close of this, my first year's connection with the University of Michigan, I deem it fit and an
appropriate time to submit to your honorable body a report
on the year's work, and on the future possibilities of the course
in mechanical engineering. My connection with this University dates from the 9th of August, 1881, when, under orders from
the Navy Department, I reported in person to the then Acting
President; and my duties commenced immediately on being informed of the nature of the work I was expected to undertake.
As explained to me then, it was desired to establish in connection with the course in civil engineering a parallel course in
mechanical engineering, which, with the reorganized course in
mining engineering, would make a complete school of engineering. With this object in view the course in mechanical engineering was laid out as it now appears in the calendar. It was
arranged so as to permit of development according to the denmands of the students who might elect the work offered. It was
not expected that it would be found necessary to give instruction
in the advanced courses under two years at least, or until students should be regularly entered for the degree of mechanical
engineer. When that time should have arrived, it was recognized that the proper amount of technical work necessary for the
degree of mechanical engineer could not be given with the present teaching force in the Department of Engineering.
The opening of the school year disclosed a much greater demand for the courses offered than was anticipated. Even the
advanced courses were in demand, those which it is not possible
to give at present. The work was commenced under the most
encouraging auspices, and has continued, even with the necessarily hasty and imperfect preparation of the subject matter of the
courses, to attract favorable attention and considerable application on the part of the students.




240


JUNE MEETING, 1882.


The following is a list of the courses offered, with the number of students electing them during the past year:
1. Workshop Appliances and Processes, Pattern Making,
Moulding and Founding. A 2-5 course ------------  5 students.
2. Mechanical Laboratory work (not given this year.)
3. Mechanical Laboratory work. A 2-5 course ------ 5 students.

Total number of students ------— _ _ --- —---- 35
Courses5 and 6 are identical with the courses of the same number in civil
engineering, and the students taking them were mostly civil
engineering students.
During the latter part of October the question of a mechanical laboratory was brought up for consideration. It was found
that the $2,500 appropriated by the Legislature for a Inechanical
laboratory in connection with the Department of Civil Engineering would revert to the State treasury on January 1, 1882,
because that department was not ready to use it; and it was suggested that the money might be advantageously expended in
erecting a building and equipping the same (as a mechanical
laboratory) for the Department of Mechanical Engineering.
Although at first it did not seem possible to expend so small a
sum for so large a purpose and be able to secure any immediate
and desirable results, by careful calculation it was found that certain definite results might be accomplished with benefit to a limited number of students; and it was decided that if a building
could be erected leaving $1,000 out of that $2,500 for the purchase
of machinery and tools, results justifying the expenditure of the
whole sum might be expected. On that decision the building
and fixtures as they now appear were erected, the $2,500 being
expended as is expressed by the following statement:

Total -   -      ---------—.   ----------- 2,500 00
The above account covers all the direct cash expenditures for
the Mechanical Laboratory. Some indirect expenditures were
incurred in making needed additional arrangements inside the
building, including doors, work-benches, coal-bins, moulding
tray, stair balustrade, and cupboards for materials and hand
tools, which work was done by the regular University workmen
and those students taking the course in Mechanical Laboratory
work.
In this connection may be enumerated the gifts which the
University has received for the Mechanical Laboratory, as follows: A No. 1 steel pressure blower, from B. F. Sturtevant, of
Boston; a number of iron and steel tests, from the Pennsylvania
R. R. Co.'s works, at Altoona; a number of photographs of modern iron working machinery, from Wm. Sellers & Co., Philadelphia; a few specimes of students' work, from the workshops
of the Mechanic Art Department of Cornell University; and a
large number from the shops of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
Notwithstanding considerable delay experienced in receiving
goods from the manufacturers, it was made possible to open the
Mechanical Laboratory at the beginning of the second semester.
Six students were permitted to take the course, the number being confined to those who the first semester had taken the course
in the theory of workshop practice. A large number of students
inquired about the course and expressed a desire to take it, but
were not permitted because of insufficient accommodation. The
six who took the course were not confined to a prescribed course
of work, as is contemplated for the future, but were engaged for
a large share of the time in overhauling and erecting the machinery in the shop. Almost all of the machinery as it now appears in the shop was erected by them. In several instances it
was found necessary to refit certain portions of the machinery
before it could be used, and this work was also done by the students. The remainder of the time was devoted to grinding and
putting in order the cutting tools, in performing some of the




242


JUNE MEETING, 1882.


simpler operations at the work-bench, in preparing work for the
iron lathe, in wood-turning, forging, brazing, and soldering, and
in running the engine. One student working for the master's
degree was permitted to devote his entire time to the construction of an electric lamp with which to perform the experiments
required by the subject of his thesis. Another student was permitted to devote a part of his time to the construction of a
model of an automatic grain weigher to be used in mills and in
grain elevators. The work of both of these gentlemen was creditable. Although broken and irregular the semester's work in
the Mechanical Laboratory has shown conclusively that there is
a demand for such work among the students, and that it may be
made a successful and profitable, as well as a popular, course
among the many such at this University.
Regarding the future of the Mechanical Laboratory it may
be said, that with the present facilities, imperfect as they are in
many respects, instruction of a valuable nature can be given to
six or eight students, the time of this instruction, however, not
extending over six hours a week. These six hours added to the
time required by the other courses will demand of the Professor
of Mechanical Engineering nineteen (19) hours of class-room
work a week. To make the courses thorough it would doubtless
be found necessary to curtail the work in some directions. This
alternative is one not to be accepted if it is possible to avoid it;
for the work as already prescribed in the calendar is barely sufficient to justify graduating men as mechanical engineers. If,
however, it were possible to secure the services of an assistant,
then the work in the Mechanical Laboratory could easily be
mlade to cover twenty or thirty hours a week, and a proportionately larger number of students could be accommodated. Excellent results could then be attained, and without increasing
materially the present shop facilities; but by the addition of two
engine lathes, a planer, a shaper, and a few more hand-tools,
which would make about all the present shop could contain, the
instruction could be made much more valuable than is possible
now. The additional tools could be purchased for $1,500 or $2,000.
If this is thought to be too large a sum to expend for that purpose at present, a smaller sum, $600 or $800, would purchase a
planer, which is an absolute necessity and must be had before
an attempt can be made to do any work requiring the preparation of large, flat surfaces, and long, straight edges.
The assistant referred to should be a skilled mechanic in
every sense of the word, and should have sufficient education to




JUNE MEETING, 1882.


243


make him an intelligent reader of such scientific matter as it
would be desirable for him to become familiar with. He might
be a mall of long experience in the practice of his profession or
trade, having learned it on the apprentice systen, or he might
be a graduate of one of the technical schools referred to in the
appended reports and letters. On many accounts the latter would
be preferable, as a man of college education would be able to imnpart information in a more scientific manner, and would command greater respect from the students. The cost of such an
assistant might be $1,000 or $1,400 per annum.
These suggestions are respectfully made for your honorable
consideration, and it is earnestly hoped that such favorable action may be taken as will at once permit of the course in mechanical engineering being offered in its most complete form. I
should not feel justified in asking for assistance at this time
except for the favorable position which the course has already
taken. There seems to be good reasons for believing that this
course will continue to grow in favor and that it will not lack for
applicants. There is no doubt that a mechanical laboratory is
needed in connection with a course in mechanical engineering
and that it will not fail to be appreciated. I feel safe in predicting that its capacity will in the near future have to be largely
increased; and I am convinced that where so many schools having this special feature have made it successful, the University
of Michigan will not fail to place it on even a higher level, one
not possible elsewhere.
Education in the mechanic arts has already become a prominent feature in the educational systems of this country and of
Europe, and it has taken a position which its evident usefulness
enables it to sustain with the highest credit. A great and growing necessity has long been felt for better educated mechanics
and for more practical engineers; and it is generally recognized
that this necessity can best be met by having in connection with
our schools laboratories, or workshops, in which the practical
nature of tools and materials can be studied at the same time
with the theoretical. These laboratories, or workshops, should
be open not only to the students of engineering and architecture,
but also to those students whose time and circumstances permit
to take only special work.
In concluding this report the following brief description of
some of the more important American schools where this special
workshop feature has been introduced is appended, for the pur

pose of showing the progress already made in the introduction
of this form of technical education; and you are respectfully referred to the accompanying letters* and reports from which these
descriptions are taken, for other and more minute particulars:
STEVENS INSTITUTE, Hoboken, N. J.-" This superior institution has an annual income of $40,000, and is devoted to the one
thing of making mechanical engineers. The theory of this institution is that the mechanical engineer ought to be, and in the
near future will be, as expert in the use of tools as he is in scientific calculations. Hence the institution provides alike for
the theoretical and practical instruction of its students." All
students are required to labor in the shops six hours a week for
the nine months, and eight hours a day for one month, of the
year. The building occupied by the machine shop and carpenter shop is 50 ft. by 80 ft., and has in addition to the main floor a
gallery 15 feet wide extending all around on the inside. Its
equipment cost $10,000, and was the gift of President Morton.
Separate apartments are occupied by the foundry and smith
shop, and for the exercises in steam fitting and millwrighting.
The number of students is limited to one hundred. Instruction
in the shops is given by one full instructor, assisted by two
skilled workmen and one student who had learned his trade before entering the school. The salary of these instructors amounts
to about $1,000. The need is already felt at this institution for
greater shop facilities, and it is estimated that $25,000 at least
would be required to provide them.
THE MASSACH4USETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, Boston.
-This institution gives instruction to nearly three hundred students. The course in the mechanic arts was established in 1876,
and is devoted to two purposes: first, the making of working
mechanics; second, the making of mechanical engineers. Nine
hours a week for two years is devoted to shop work. The following is a list of the shops in which practical instruction is given:
the machine shop, 20 x 37 ft.; the pattern weaving shop, 20 x 32

besides having had a long and varied experience in his profession. Assistance is rendered by a graduate of the school. It is
intended at an early day to have new and larger shops, and to
increase the time of shop instruction to three years.
WORCESTER FREE INSTITUTE, Massachusetts.-The Washburn Machine Shop was established in 1866 by the gift of the
late Hon. Ichabod Washburn, of Worcester, and occupies a
three-story building, 40x 140 ft., with a two-story ell, 40x 77 ft.
The first floor of the main building is occupied by offices, the
drawing room, machine shop and tool room; the second floor,
by the wood shop and tool room; and the third floor, by the
paint shop, pattern room, and store room. In the ell the first
floor is occupied by the engine and boiler rooms and wash rooms;
and the second floor, by a store room for lumber. The basement
of the main building contains a forge shop, 20 x 40 ft. The cost
of buildings was $43,000, and equipment, $25,000. Six months'
solid labor in wood work is required of the students, and ten
hours a week for four years in iron work. From eight to eleven
workmen are employed in the shops, and instruction can be
given to one hundred students. The object of the instruction is
to make mechanical engineers and working mechanics.
CORNELL UNIVERSITY, Ithaca, N. Y.-The Sibley School of
Mechanic Arts was established in 1870, by the gift of the Hon.
Hiram Sibley, of Rochester, N. Y., and occupies a three-story
building and basement, 42 x 110 ft., with an engine house in rear,
20x 30 ft., a brass and iron foundry, 37 x 46 ft., and a stereotype
foundry, 16 x 20 ft. The first floor of the main building is occupied by a machine shop and printing office, and a part of the
basement by a forge shop, which also contains facilities for pipe
fitting. The cost of buildings was $29,000, and equipments,
about $13,000. The instruction is given by two professors, one
assistant, and one foreman. It is intended in the future to employ two or three skilled workmen. The object of the instruction is to make mechanical engineers and working mechanics.
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, St. Louis, Mo.-The Manual
Training School was established in 1879 by a special ordinance of
the University, and occupies a three-story building about 45 x 100
ft. The first floor contains a forge shop, 29 x 39 ft., with twenty
forges, cost $1,500, a machine shop, 39 x 39 ft., with twenty-eight
machine tools, cost $8,000, and an engine room. The second
floor contains a carpenters' shop, 39 x 39 ft., arranged for twenty
students, cost $1,000, and a pattern shop, 39 x 39 ft., with twenty

lathes, cost $1,200. The third floor contains drawing rooms and
recitation rooms. The cost of building was $12,000, equipment,
$11,700, and land, $6,000. The instruction in the shops is given
by two full instructors and one assistant. About one hundred
students can be accommodated. The course extends over three
years, the object being to prepare students for a course in mechanical engineering, and to fit them for some industrial pursuit. The facilities are to be doubled soon.
THE ILLINOIS INDUSTRIAL UNIVERSITY, Champaign. —The
Mechanic Art Department was opened about 1873, when the State
appropriated $25,000 for a building for military purposes and for
a mechanical laboratory. The equipment of the machine shop,
vise shop and pattern shop cost about $5,000, and accommodations are furnished for fifteen students in each. It is proposed to
build a forge shop for sixteen students. At present instruction
is given to twenty-five students. The capacity is to be doubled
this year. The students are required to work two hours a day
for the first two years, and one term during the senior year, on
some model or project. The foreman of the machine shop is paid
$600. The object of the instruction is to fit students for mechanical engineering, and also to make working mechanics.
THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, Columbus.-A new building
has been erected in connection with this institution by the aid
of a State appropriation, and is devoted exclusively to manual
work. It contains a machine shop, 30 x 40 ft., with thirteen machine tools, and vise benches along the walls for sixteen students,
a forge shop, 25 x 30 ft., with four forges, a foundry, 25 x 30 ft.,
and a pattern shop for eight students. The cost of building was
$4,600, and equipment, $5,500. The object is to give instruction
to those students intending to become mechanical engineers.
THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, Minneapolis.-The Mechanic Art Department was established in 1881, and contains a
vise shop, a forge shop, and a wood shop, all temporarily located
in the basement of the agricultural building. New and special
buildings are to be erected this year, when a machine shop and
foundry will be added to the present facilities. The instruction
is given by one special instructor, and ten students can be accommodated. The object is to give the students of mechanical
engineering a practical knowledge of the use of tools and materials.
PURDUE UNIVERSITY, Lafayette, Ind.-The Mechanic Art
Department was established in 1879, and excellent facilities are

afforded a limited number of students to prepare for a course in
mechanical engineering, or for some industrial pursuit. Work
is required of the student in the shop two hours daily five days
in the week for two years, and embraces courses in wood work
including wood turning and pattern making, vise work in iron,
forging, and machine tool work in iron.
THE STATE COLLEGE, Orono, Me.-The Mechanic Art Department was established in 1878, with facilities for giving instruction in vise work and forging. Forty-two lessons of three
hours each, five days in the week, are devoted to each course.
The shop work accompanies the studies of the college, and does
not interfere with them. It has proved so successful that the
system is to be extended in that school.
Respectfully submitted.
M. E. COOLEY,
Asst. Engineer, U. S. Navy,
Professor of Mech. Engineering.
At the close of the discussion on the report, Regent
Cutcheon presented the following resolution, which was
adopted unanimously:
Resolved, That the report of Professor M. E. Cooley, in
charge of the course in Mechanical Engineering, with the accompanying documents, be accepted and placed on file, that the
report be printed in the Minutes, and that the subject matter
thereof be made a special subject of memorial to the next Legislature of the State.
Regent Blair presented the following resolution, which
was adopted:
Resolved, That the Committee on Finance be instructed to
examine into the condition of the finances of the Univesity and
the methods of conducting its business generally, and report to
this Board at its next meeting its condition, as to its present and
future needs, and what if any further regulations are necessary
to the proper and safe conduct of its business.
Regent Duffield, chairman of the Library Committee,
read the annual report of the Librarian, as follows:
Librarian's Report for the Year 1881-82.
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
I have the pleasure of reporting more accessions to the
library this year than there have been any previous year of its

existence, except the year in which its foundations were laid in
the 3,700 volumes purchased abroad by Dr. Gray, and the year
in which the Parsons library was received.
There have been added since July 1, 1881, 2,700 volumes
and 479 pamphlets. Of these 1,904 volumes and 276 pamphlets
were purchased, 516 volumes and 203 pamphlets were presented,
and 280 volumes were the result of binding periodicals.
In no year have there been such important additions. I will
mention Poggendorff's Annalen der Physik und der Chemie, 179
volumes, costing $562.50; Crelle's Journal fur reine und angewandte Mathematik, the gift of Mr. Hegeler; the Percy Society
Publications, 32 volumes, costing $150.00; and the Camden Society Publications, 127 volumes, costing $58.00.
One hundred and forty-four periodicals, American and foreign, have been received regularly. In addition to these the
Students' Lecture Association has furnished for the Reading
Room 60 magazines and newspapers.
The books and pamphlets purchased cost --- —------------ -$ 2,991 44

During the year the unbound pamphlets have been examined, and wherever a sufficient number to make a volume was
found on one subject, these were put into a cheap binding. In
this way the count of pamphlets has been decreased by 818, and
the count of volumes increased by 59.
It is our policy to put upon the books all the repairs needed
to keep them in a safe condition for use. There are many volumes that are in use constantly, and these will, at no remote
time, in spite of mending and rebinding, be worn out. Of a
few of these there are duplicate copies. Many more should be
duplicated, and of some works there should be at least three
copies.
One volume and one pamphlet have been missed from the
main collection. It is possible that they have been misplaced,
and will reappear when we take possession of our new quarters,
and the shelves of the old are emptied.
All books were " present or accounted for" at the Observatory and the Botanical Rooms.
Three were missing from the Chemical Laboratory, and 20
from the Dental College. For these last it is quite probable that
Dr. Taft will be able to account. His record could not be found
when my visit to the books was made.
The Library was kept open five hours daily during the vacation.
In that time (12 weeks) there were drawn and used in the

85,736 vols.
The recorded use of the library for the year, therefore, has
been 85,736 volumes, an increase of 4,437 volumes over last year.
There are uses of the books of which we are unable to obtain
an account. What these uses are can be briefly told in the language of last year's report.
"The recorded use does not include the use made of the Library by the professors, as a reference library, or by the portgraduate students, or the use made of the books at the Observatory, the Laboratory, the Botanical Rooms, and the Dental
College. It is proper to explain, also, in this connection, that
loans of books, varying in number from 50 to 100 volumes are

made annually to the Physical Laboratory, and to the workrooms of the Museum. "

Room-has been classified with the following results:

It is not claimed for these statistics that they show accurately the comparative amount of reading done by particular
classes of students in the prosecution of their college work. It
is impossible that they should do so. Students in history consult books in other branches of literature, and vice versa; and
all students, whatever the nature of their studies, and readers
who are not students, read more or less history and belles-lettres.
The record has simply to do with the kind of books called for,
and not with the purpose of the reader.
In further explanation of the percentages I will quote again
from last year's report:
" The low per cent. of reading in Physics, Astronomy, and
Chemistry, and the failure of Geology, Palieontology, Zoology,
Botany, and some other subjects to appear at all, is rather mis

leading. These subjects are read at the places where the technical
works on them are permanently, or temporarily, located, and we
cannot cast our statistical net so as to enclose their use."
The principal gifts of the year have been those of Mr. Hegeler, and Mr. Parsons, which have already been brought to the
notice of the Board. Crelle's Journal, the gift of Mr. Hegeler,
I have already named. The gift of Mr. Parsons was a copy of
Kuhn's " Zeitschrift fur vergleichende Sprachforschung " from
1852 to 1881, in 25 volumes.
Mr. A. E. Richards has continued to send from Italy packages of books and coins alternately. The number of volumes
presented by him this year is 25.
A set of the Chinese Classics, in 28 volumes, was presented
by President Angell on his return from China.
J. O. Halliwell-Phillips, Esq., the Shakespearean scholar,
sent, by the hand of Professor Demmon, 3 volumes of his Memoranda of Shakespeare.
Dr. Dunster and Professor Harrington have each given several volumes.
Other valuable gifts, from departments of the national government, and the state governments, from learned societies, and
from individuals, have been received, of which a list, with the
names of the donors, accompanies this report.
The new methods of instruction have so increased the dependence of the students upon the library that, since the first of
April, I have kept it open an additional hour for their accommodation. It is open now 1112 hours daily.
I have given the usual number of lectures on subjects connected with books and reading; and, in all ways open to me, I
have labored to increase the number of volumes in the library
and their usefulness.
The regular daily duties have this year been more arduous
than ever before. In their performance I have been efficiently
aided by my assistants. The services of one of these, Carril M.
Coe, I shall lose at the end of the college year. He has been
five years connected with the library, and during all that time
has been prompt and faithful in the performance of his duties.
I regret greatly that he finds it necessary to leave.
During the vacation I hope to visit some of the college
libraries where the classification of books has been studied with

reference to the wants of the departments of instruction. I wish
to acquaint myself with results in this direction, and with all
the results of library administration that will be of interest and
importance to us when we remove to the new building. I will
make no recommendations now, but wil ask permission to present a supplemental report in October, which shall embody the
results of my investigations, and, also, what the Library Committee may recommend in reference to the reorganization of the
library force.
Very respectfully submitted.

PRESIDENT'S REPORT.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
In offering to you my annual report for the academic year
ending September 30th, 1882, I desire first of all to thank you
most sincerely for the kindness with which you granted me
leave of absence in 1880 to undertake important diplomatic
duties entrusted to me by the President of the United States. I
wish also to make most hearty and grateful recognition of the
eminent services of Dr. Frieze, who at your request assumed
the burdens of my office and brought to his work an energy and
skill, which largely conduced to the marked prosperity of the
University during the last two years.
I cannot but congratulate you on the evidences which I find
of the progress that was made during my absence. The Eye and

Ear Infirmary was erected, the sewer extending from our grounds
to the river was completed, the capacity of the Chemical Laboratory was nearly doubled, the Museum building was completed
and occupied, the interior of the North College was partially
reconstructed, and the new fire proof Library Building so long
desired and so sorely needed was begun. A professor of Meclanical Engineering was appointed, and work in that useful branch
has been organized and has been begun with a skill and an enthusiasmn which promise excellent results. A School of Political
Science has also been established, and has been most warmly
commended by the public press. The number of students during the last two years has been larger than ever before. All
these signs of growth and prosperity are most inspiriting.
The changes in the Faculties during the past year have been
fewer than usual. William P. Wells, A. M., Kent Professor of
Law, who had been unable by reason of illness for some time to
discharge his duties, has resumed his place. Henry Sewall, M.
D., has been appointed Professor of Physiology in the Department of Medicine and' Surgery, and has been for some months
giving instruction.
Degrees have been conferred as follows:

OCTOBER MEETING, 1SS2.


About three-fifths of the students in the Literary Depart-?, i were from Michigan. More than half of the students in
the other Departments were from elsewhere. Perhaps no other
institution in the country has so wide-spread a constituency.
Last year we had students from every one of the Eastern, the
Middle, and the Western States, and from every Southern State
but four, from four Territories and the District of Columbia, and
fiom Ontario, New Brunswick, Manitoba, the Hawaiian Islands,
Nicaragua, Cuba, Bermuda, England, Ireland, Roumania, Egypt,
and Burmah.
It is a cause of satisfaction that the increase in attendance
has not been due to the lowering of the standard of admission,
but has come during those years when we have been gradually
raising the standard. The attainments of students who matriculate as candidates for degrees in the Department of Literature,
Science, and the Arts represent nearly, if not quite, a year's
work in addition to what was asked ten years ago. We are
grateful to the excellent High Schools in the State for their aid
in accomplishing this most desirable result. The increased requirements for admission to the Professional Schools, though by
no means so stringent as we hope to see them at no distant (lay,
have had a beneficial influence on the Schools. The lengthening of the Medical Course to three years, and the grading of the
work, have attracted rather than repelled the best class of students. It seems probable that the increase in fees which it las
been deemed necessary to make, will cause a slight diminution
in attendance the coming year.
Work in the Mechanical Laboratory has been very auspiciously begun. The courses offered have proved very attractive
and very beneficial. It was not possible for the Professor alone
and in his narrow quarters to give instruction to all who desired
it. The utility of actual work with tools and machines to engineers is now recognized in leading schools on both sides of the
Atlantic. It is to be hoped that means may be placed at our
disposal for enlarging the equipment of the Laboratory, and for
providing a suitable assistant for the Professor.
The attention of the Board has been called during the year
to the need of a more thorough organization of the microscopical work in the University.  The aid of the microscope in
giving instruction or in making researches in several of the sciences, is now so indispensable that within the last few years we
have been purchasing instruments until now they number more




OCTOBER MEETING, 1882.


269


than a hundred. These are used in the study of Human, Comparative and Vegetable Histology, Botany, Zoology, Mineralogy,
Palaeontology, Pathological Anatomy, and Piysiological and
Analytical Chemistry.
Notwithstanding our supply our students are so numerous
that some addition to it seems to be needed. It appears also that
in order to secure economy and efficiency we should have a central laboratory for instruction in the use of the instruments in
Histology and Pathological Anatomy. Instruction by the microscope in the other sciences could be given in the rooms now
devoted to it. The report presented by a special cormmittee of
Professors on the whole subject is so exhaustive that I need not
do more than to express the hope that we may be able at no distant day to provide the needed laboratory and instruments.
Our laboratory of Physics needs important additions to its
apparatus. Perhaps in no department has the progress of investigation been more rapid during the last few years than in Physics. In none have more important discoveries been made. The
leading institutions in the land have therefore wisely devoted
large sums to the equipment of laboratories for instruction and
research in Physics. In no branch is our supply of the proper
means of illustration so inferior to that of the best schools. I
trust that as rapidly as our friends will permit, we shall place
our Physical laboratory at least on an equality with those of
institutions whose grade of scientific work may be fairly conmpared with ours.
The school of Political Science, which was established at the
beginning of the year, has attracted miuch attention, and the
plan of work laid out for it has been heartily approved by the
press of the country. The courses of instruction were attended
by interested classes. Some pains were found necessary to secure
a desirable adjustment of the work of the school to that of the
Department of Literature, Science and tie Arts, but the result
has been satisfactorily attained, and there seems to be now
no obstacle to the successful career of the school. Tie establishment of similar schools in other universities is only one of many
signs that the need of special training in the political sciences is
widely recognized. The report of the Dean of the School furnishes details of the year's work.
Acting President Frieze in his learned and suggestive report
last year called attention to the propriety of drawing the line at
the end of the second or sophomore year of college life, not only




270


OCTOBER MEETING, 18S2.


in the School of Political Science, but in the entire Department
of Literature, Science and the Arts, between the secondary education and the higher or genuine University education. The
subject has received most careful and prolonged consideration
during the year from the Faculty of that Department. The result of their deliberations appeared in the plan which in May
they asked you to adopt. It permits students to proceed for the
Bachelor's degree on the " credit system" which has been in use
in the past. But it also permits those who have completed two
years of work to proceed for a degree upon what we call the
" University system." Under this the candidate will not be held
to the completion of a fixed number of courses, but will under
the direction of a committee of the Faculty take a large amount
of work in a limited range of studies, and at the end of the
fourth year of residence sustain a searching examination. If his
attainments warrant, he will win a Bachelor's degree; if they
are very conspicuous and he presents a meritorious thesis, he
may attain a Master's degree. He may then continue his studies
for a Doctor's degree. It is expected that those who seek a degree upon the University system will pursue a somewhat freer
method of study than others, and will concentrate their labor
on a few studies with the purpose of making large attainments
in them, rather than of making limited attainments in many studies. It is hoped that a manly and enthusiastic spirit of investigation and research will be fostered, and that scholarship of a
lofty type will be stimulated. We are aware that we are taking
a very important and a bold step. But it is not the first time
that this University has taken bold steps. It is entirely probable that we may find it expedient to modify some of the details
of the scheme we have adopted. But we are very hopeful that
the general results will justify us in retaining the main features
of our plan.
Tile reports of the Deans of the Professional Schools show
that they have been enjoying their usual prosperity. The Faculty of the Department of Medicine and Surgery has been
strengthened by the addition of a Professor of Physiology. He
needs very much a larger equipment for the development of a
Physiological Laboratory. It is a cause of satisfaction that the
Professional Schools are able to continue to raise gradually their
standard of admission without reducing their numbers.
It seerms probable that soon the question of larger hospital
accommodations will be forced upon us. The official reports




OCTOBER MEETING, 1882.


271


show that the pressure on us was very great last year and a considerable number of patients, I am inllfored,were obliged to find
rooms in private houses. It would not be difficult to show that
the hospitals return to the State more than the value of all it
expends on them by restoring to health and productive power
persons who would otherwise remain as a charge upon the public treasury. If the State should see fit to erect a hospital sufficiently large and the counties or a considerable number of them
should send here their invalid poor, now lying helpless in the
almshouses, and pay for their support while they are under the
skillful treatment of our Professors and our nurses, it cannot be
questioned that the investment would be profitable to the State.
As a University we are interested in observing that the subject of education for the professions is receiving more and more
attention from the public. There is an unmistakable drift of enlightened public opinion towards demanding a more complete education of the practitioners of law and of medicine than has hitherto been exacted in this country. How to secure the desired
elevation of the standard of professional education is a problem,
for which various solutions have been proposed.
I cannot but think that it would conduce greatly to this end
if there were fewer schools, and if those really needed were constituent parts of universities. The number of law schools is
perhaps not much in excess of what we need, and most of them
are connected with some university. But there are certainly a
good many superfluous medical schools, and a certain number
of unnecessary theological schools. The increased facilities of
communication by railway have removed the only argument
which ever existed for many of the professional schools. Every
one knows the history of the origin of not a few medical colleges. A half dozen physicians in some town imagine that if
they can prefix the title Professor to their names and persuade a
few students to hear them lecture, they will thus secure the best
possible advertisement for themselves. As the fees are small,
the shorter the course of lectures, the better for the professors.
As they give for two short courses a diploma every whit as handsome as can be gotten from Harvard or Michigan in three long
years, the students are as delighted as the professors. The country is speckled with these advertising establishments for ambitious physicians, who delude'young men into the belief that
after a few weeks' attendance upon lectures they have become
fitted to practice a learned profession and to take the care of




272


OCTOBER MAEETING, 1882.


men's lives into their hands. A few of these short-course schools
have, it is true, a nominal connection with colleges, though
really they are self-governing. With very few exceptions, the
theological schools are dissociated from colleges or universities,
even when they are in the same town with them, and in most
cases college towns have not been chosen as the sites of divinity
schools.
Now I believe that all these professional schools, including
those meritorious medical colleges which have virtually an independent organization, would be far more profitable to their
students, if they were really so incorporated into a vigorous university that they caught the spirit of its life. The danger of a
young man who is pursuing special studies in one department of
thought in an isolated school is that he takes on a certain onesidedness of culture; there is an intellectual breeding in and in
with his own sort, which leads to a lack of the best vigor. His
horizon is not extended. He often has what may be called a
mental provincialism. He fails to get a right view of the miscellaneous world into which he is going.
But give him access to museums and great libraries, not devoted to the illustration merely of his special studies, let him
now and then hear the lectures of gifted professors on topics
which he has had no opportunity to master; and his horizon
will be broadened and his culture will be enriched. But above
all, the influence of association with students who are working
in other departments than his own, who are looking at many
truths from a different point of view, will have a most healthful
and liberalizing influence. It will help him cast down his idols
of the cave. It will lead him to look all around a truth, and to
judge how the great variety of men in the world will regard it.
It will aid him in comparing the methods of investigation in his
profession with the methods in the other professions. If the attrition with others rubs off many of the angularities of his mind,
he will be none the worse for that.
To the theological student would the life of the real university be specially helpful. Such are the relations of scientific in vestigation and discussion to theology now that the divinity schools
are constrained to secure a few special lectures from scientists or
to establish professorshlips, in which the new aspects of religious
and scientific truth are presented. But surely the investigations
and prelections of the acknowledged masters of science like
Pierce or Henry or Dana at a university would be generally more




OCTOBER MEETING, 1882.


273


helpful than the instructions of special apologists. If there is
any one, who should be familiar with all phases of current
thought, who should have felt the stir of the best intellectual
life of the young men just coming on to the stage of action, it
is the preacher. But too often the little retired seminary with
its quiet life keeps him in a sort of monastic seclusion. When
he emerges from it and is confronted with the bright, active
minds of men trained in other professions, he is frequently surprised and puzzled. Could he have associated with them somewhat freely during the period of his professional study, he would
have both received and imparted good.
The law student also is likely to profit much by the opportunity to hear lectures on History and the Political Sciences.
In short, the university life with its manifold stimulations
must greatly aid every professional student in avoiding the perils of entering upon his work in life with either an exaggerated
view of its relative importance or a narrow view of it as a trade,
a mere means of earning bread. It sends him forth with a
broader, larger, more vigorous manhood than he would be likely
to acquire in an isolated school.
Again, the incorporation of professional schools into one
university may be urged, because thus the proper elevation of
the standard of admission and of work can be more easily secured. My remarks on this head are not applicable to divinity
schools, where the standard of admission is quite high enough,
but they do apply to law schools and medical schools.
It needs no argument to show that there is an inherent
weakness in the organization, which leaves the pay of the professors dependent entirely on the receipts from students' fees.
In such a case no reform, however desirable, can readily be
made, if it tends to diminish the number of students, even temporarily. Average human nature even in professors is too weak
to be iconoclastic at the sacrifice of bread and butter. So inclited
are teachers, especially elderly teachers, to stick fast in the old
ways, so averse are even institutions with large means to reduce
their attendance, that progress even in universities (including
our own) in raising the qualifications for admission and the grade
of work in professional studies, has been much too slow. I need
not say how much slower it has been in independent professional
schools. At least one conspicuous medical school in New York,
which in a moment of heroic courage recently undertook to lift




274


OCTOBER MEETING, 1882.


its standard higher, after a few weeks of experiment retreated
hastily to its old position.
That the requirements for admission to nearly all of our
medical students is now shamefully low-at most of them there
are none at all-and that the grade of work done in them is too
low, and that in most of them the course is far too brief, no intelligent man can doubt. It may be said that it is useless to
elevate the standard of a few schools, while the great mass of
them makes no change. But we may hope that the stimulating
influence of the better schools will not be lost on the others. It
is one of the cheering facts in respect to medical education that
the schools which have acted bravely have notlong suffered from
lack of students, but have after a little regained their old numbers. This shows that public opinion is ripe for improvement.
But the lead in that improvemernt must come in the main from
schools, in which the salaries of the teachers are not dependent
on the number of students in attendance.
Although it be conceded to Tertullian that Theology is " the
Queen of the Sciences," yet for obvious reasons which were apparent to the founders of the University we cannot have a theological school as a part of this institution. But I have longS thought
-and in holding this opinion I am simply concurring with my
honored predecessors, Presidents Tappan and Haven-that it
would have been of great advantage to the churches of the west
and certainly no disadvantage to the University, if the religious
denominations which desire divinity schools in this section of
the Union had seen fit to plant them in this city near to us. We
could have extended to them our hospitalities without inconvenience or expense, could have given their students and teachers
access to our libraries and museums and some of our lectures,
could have kept them in contact with University life, and could
have doubtless drawn from them both scholarly and religious inspirations which we should have prized. Perhaps it is not too
late for some of the Christian coinmnunions to think upon this
subject. It is well known that at least two or three imolortant
religious bodies are considering the expediency of founding halls
in which the students of their faith attending the University
may live together in their own Christian home. Such a hall
might, if its founders and patrons desired, easily become the
germ, o, the predecessor of a school of theological instruction. Of
course the University could have no further interest in any such
school than that which comes from having a pleasant and edify

ing neighbor, with which it could freely exchange courtesies.
But we might well be gratified at seeing such neighbors settle
near us.
The report of the Committee on Finance is hereto appended.
Notwithstanding our large resources, the demands made upon
our treasury by our varied work are so heavy that the greatest
economy is absolutely necessary.
I am happy to report that the growth of the library has been
greater thah in any previous year since it was established. The
increase has been 2,700 volumes and 479 pamphlets. The chief
donors of books have been Mr. E. C. Hegeler and Hon.
Philo Parsons. Owing to unexpected delay in procuring some
of the materials for the new library building, the completion of
it cannot be expected until several months hence. But when it
is completed, no pains should be spared to make a large addition
to our collection of books. Our library, admirable as has been
the selection of books for it, is not worthy of the University.
There can be no great University without a good library. Private
munificence cannot furnish us so valuable aid in any other way
as by placing at our disposal a handsome suni for the purchase
outright of a large number of books, or still better perhaps by
endowing us with a permanent fund which for all time to come
shall yield its blessing to the University. Tile State cannot perhaps do its citizens a better service than by generously assisting
in the building up of one library within its borders where they
can come to find needed help in the investigation of any subject.
Dr. Frieze in his report last year was called to pay his tribute
of respect to four eminent men who had died after leaving bright
records as friends and servants of the University, Professor Watson, Governor Bagley, ex-President Haven and Professor Williams. Hardly was his report in type, before the news came
from beyond the sea of the sudden death of the first President
of the University, Dr. Henry P. Tappan. You have already
spread upon your records your testimony to his distinguished
abilities and to his eminent services to this institution. Dr.
Frieze in his commemorative address delivered at Conmmencement has so admirably depicted his character and his career
that I need not dwell upon them here. But this report of the
year would be very incomplete, if it did not express however
briefly the appreciation which we all feel of the great indebtedness of the University to him who in its youthful days gave it
its form and its inspiration and who in a very emphatic -.itse




276


OCTOBER MEETING, 18S2.


may be called the founder of the University which we know.
The generation of the founders is indeed passing away. But it
is gratifying to us that so many of them lived to see the reward
of their toils in the present prosperity and strength of the institution to which they gave the best years of their lives. It stands
and will ever stand as the proud monument of their devotion
and wisdom.
Regent Duffield presntted the following resolution,
which was adopted:
Resolved, That the report of the President be accepted and
printed in the minutes, and that one thousand extra copies be
printed and bound in paper covers, for the use of the Board and
of the University.
Ayes-Regents Walker, Duffield, VanRiper, Grosvenor,
Shearer, Blair, and Joy.
Nay-None.
The President stated that several papers had reached
his hands, which he suggested might be referred to appropriate committees for consideration. There being no objection, the papers took that course. He also stated that
the report of the Dean of the School of Political Science
had been prepared and was held subject to the pleasure of
the Board.
Regent Duffield moved that the report be read by the
Dean of that School. The motion prevailed.
At the close of the reading of the report, Regent
Grosvenor moved that it be accepted and printed with the
President's report, as an accompanying paper. The motion prevailed.
REPORT OF THE DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF POLITIICAL SCIENCE.
To the Honorable, the President and the Regents of the University of
Michigan:
GENTLEMEN,-The Dean of the School of Political Science
would beg leave to report that the School was organized in accordance with the provisions made by the Regents in June of
1881; and that the work of instruction was begun at the commencement of the ensuing University year. The tine that




OCTOBER MEETING, 182.


277


elapsed between the first announcement of the School and the
opening of classes was too short to justify anticipations of any
considerable increase, on account of the new school, of the number of students in the Academic Department of the University.
It is also to be said that at the beginning of the year there was
considerable uncertainty as to whether students of the School of
Political Science might be admitted to other degrees than that
of Doctor of Philosophy; and, until this question was settled, it
was not thought wise to encourage students to transfer themselves from the courses in which they had previously been enrolled. But notwithstanding these facts it is gratifying to note
that all the classes were attended by an encouraging number of
students.
The following table, made out from the records, does not include the very considerable number of students who attended
the lectures without desiring credit therefor; but embraces
simply the number actually present at the final examinations:

Two of the above-named courses,-the course in Rights and
the course in Forestry-are worthy of especial note, not simply
for the reason that they were given last year for the first time in
this institution, but also from the fact, that, so far as is known,
courses upon these subjects have never before been given in any
American University. It cannot but augur well for the School
that the subject of Political and Social Ethics from a practical
and legal point of view should be given by so eminent an authority as Judge Cooley, as the foundation of his subsequent
courses on Constitutional and administrative Law. The course
on Forestry has naturally attracted much attention; and it is
not a little singular that a subject of so much importance has
hitherto been entirely neglected by our oolleges and universities.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1882.

Within the past few years the necessity of some care of our forests has impressed itself upon the people of our country as never
before. Their rapid disappearance in some parts of the land is
a matter of the gravest consequence. Not only are vast economic questions directly involved in the destruction of timber,
but, what is, perhaps, of even greater importance, if this destruction is not properly guarded against or counterbalanced by
the judicious planting and care of trees, even our climate is in
danger of being permanently changed. In this State our forests
are a great source of wealth; and there is no one of our industrial resources that is worthy of more careful study. We have
recently had painful admonitions that the unwise cutting away
of our forests may be attended with the most appalling consequences. The mere statement of these facts is enough to show
that the subject is entitled to the most careful consideration. In
the old world Schools of Forestry have long devoted themselves
to a systematic study of the various ways in which the questions
that now perplex us in regard to the care of forests are best to be
met. As the fruitof studies carried on in these schools,and the consequent wise mianagement of forests, Germrany is much less likely
to suffer in the near future from the want of the different kinds
of useful woods, than is the United States. An important literature on the subject has grown up; and, although it is not to be
supposed that the methods adapted to European requirements
can be transferred to America without essential modifications,
yet it is certain that great advantage may be gained from a
familiarity with the results of European study and experience.
From the appropriation made a year ago for the School of Political Science, a considerable number of valuable works on the
subject of Forestry have been placed in the University Library.
But the subject must also be studied in the light of practical observation. It is gratifying to note that the establishment of the
course in Forestry has already attracted the attention of the
Commissioner of Agriculture, and that our School is likely to
be the recipient of such favors as the Commissioner may have
it in his power to bestow.
In addition to the courses of instruction given during the
past year, several new courses will be given in the year to come.
Arrangements have already been completed by which, without
further expense to the University, courses will be given on the
Principles of Finance; on the Financial History of the Untited
States; on the History of Diplomacy; on the History of Politi

cal Ideas; on Methods of Local Government; on Theories and
Methods of Taxation; on Political Ethics; on Social Science;
on the Historical Development of Educational Systems; on the
Economic Development of Mineral Resources; and on Public
Scientific Surveys. Thus it appears that the School enters its
second year under favorable omens. Its establishment and the
scope of its instruction have attracted much attention, and have
called forth not a little favorable comment. The present number of students in the classes and the zeal with which they are
entering upon their work, promise to justify the approving
words with which the establishment of the School was so generously greeted.

Regent Duffield submitted the following resolution,
which was adopted:
Resolved, That the memorial to the Legislature be prepared
by the Executive Committee, and reported to the next meeting
of the Board.
Regent Walker, chairman of the Finance Committee,
read the annual report of that committee, which i s s follows:
REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE.
Before presenting the statement of the receipts and expenditures for the past year, it has been thought proper to review
for a moment the sources of income of the University. The
funds of the University accrue from three principal sources:
1st. From the endowment of the United States.
2d. From appropriations by the Legislature for special and
specific objects.
3d. From students' fees and charges. Small sums accrue
from other sources, but not in such amounts or with such regularity as to be classed as a permanent income.
The endowment of the University originally came from the
general government in a grant of lands the proceeds of the sale of
which are in the hands of the State. On this the University
2

receives from the State interest at the rate of seven per cent. per
annum.    This interest is now nearly a fixed quantity and
amounted in 1882 to $38,398.47. A portion of the lands are still
held on " part-paid certificates," and the irregularity of the payment of interest by these private holders, and the occasional
surrender or forfeiture of these lands, cause the small variation
of the sums received from this source. There is still due fromt
the purchasers of University lands, upon "part-paid certificates,"
$60,621.11, as appears by the records of the State land office.
There remain unsold, of the lands granted by the general government, but 287.75 acres, as appears by a statement from the
office of the Land Conmmissioner, dated May 1, 1882.
The Legislature of 1873, by act No. 32, provided that an annual tax of 1-20th of a mill on the dollar should be levied on all
the property of the State and paid to the University as a '" State
Aid."  The sum now annually received from this source is $40,500.
By legislative act No. 128, 1875, establishing the Homceopathic Medical College, the sum of $6,000 was provided annually
for the support of this department. These comprise all the items
of income coming to the University from stated appropriations;
large sums are however from time to time generously provided
by legislative acts for special and specific objects.
The fees received from   students have been frequently
changed, and as they stand at present are as follows:
For Matriculation in the University by a resident of this State -----— $10

The State Board of Auditors, by law of 1881, reimburse the
University for the board and expenses of certain destitute and
dependent children sent to the Hospitals for treatment.
The miscellaneous resources of the University consist of:
1st. Interest on Bank account;
2d. Anatomical material sold to other medical colleges in
Michigan, etc., as provided by legislation of 1881;
3d. Sale of property.
The condition of the funds of the University as shown by
the balance sheet and the estimates for the current year, make
it apparent that some further changes must be made, either increasing the income or decreasing the expenses.
Your committee do not deem that any important increase
can be made in the income of the University from students'
fees; they would, however, recommend that the scheme for fees
in the Microscopical Laboratories as reported by the Committee
in June last (see Regents' Proceedings, page 208,) be adopted.A revision of the charges in the Chemical Laboratory would
likely also add a little to thle income from that source.


* The change was made October 11th, and the fee was fixed as above reported, at $3.

OCTOBER MEETING, 18S2.


Sundry changes in the duties and salaries of the various officers and employees of the University, as will be hereafter indicated, can be made to reduce somewhat the expenditure.
The methods pursued in the Laboratories requiring the deposit of a stated sum to apply on material used, should be extended to the Dental department. A system of coupon receipts,
such as are used in the Laboratories, by which a student is at no
time without a full receipt for all payments made, and the University at the same time has a perfect set of vouchers, should be
introduced into all the departments. The system of accounting
at the Chemical Laboratory by which the accounts in detail are
kept by the Treasurer, can perhaps be shortened up so that the
burden of the work will have to be done but once, and the Treasurer will be relieved of a large amount of detail work.
The record of all goods ordered should be kept at one office,
so that the obligations outstanding can readily be ascertained.
When funds are appropriated by the Board for a specific object, the Secretary should be directed to keep an account of the
same by crediting that amount to a separate account bearing a
proper heading, and as goods are ordered or work performed for
these specific objects, the account should be at once debited with
the same, whether the bill is yet paid, or even presented, or not;
and if the amount cannot be definitely ascertained, an approximate amount should be inserted, that all times the true condition of the funds may appear.
In presenting the annual report of the Treasurer to the
Finance Committee, which we submit as the report of the Committee, we take great pleasure in certifying to the accuracy,
clearness and amplitude of detail of the report, and to the thorough and able manner in which the work of that office has been
done. The items have been all checked, and for each item a
voucher in proper form was found. There are 1,604 vouchers.
All the footings have been carefully checked.
The accuracy of entries of receipts from students, whether
for admission fee, annual dues, laboratory expenses, practical
anatomy, or diplomas, was checked by the tickets issued by the
Steward. The entry of receipts from miscellaneous sources was
in a majority of cases tested in the same way. The number of
tickets examined was about 5,000, and the statement and tickets
agreed throughout. For the items of miscellaneous receipts for
which no tickets were issued by the Steward, other satisfactory
evidence was found.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1882.


285


Careful examination of the stubs of the tickets issued by the
Steward was made, to see that all were properly paid. Besides
those of recent date outstanding, some fourteen were discovered
that had not been presented to the Treasurer. The corresponding dues had not been paid. In several cases it is probable the
sums due will yet be paid. A few students either left without
going farther than to get the Steward's ticket, or did not take the
courses indicated by the tickets, after making application for
them.
The disbursement vouchers were cirefully exa-mined as to
the classification of accounts, and no variation of importance
from the classification intended was found.
This examination of the Treasurer's account in detail was
made by Professor W. H. Pettee, at the request of and under the
direction of the Committee, and was most carefully and thoroughly done.
The receipts of the treasury from the State were carefully
compared with a statement of the same from the office of the
Auditor General, and verified completely.
To the Finance Committee of the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN,-Herewitlh please find a statement of the receipts and expenditures for the fiscal year ending September 30,

In submitting the estimate of receipts and expenditures for
the current year, the committee have two or three items to which
they wish especially to call your attention:
1st. As to the propriety of estimating the receipt of $15,500
from appropriations by the Legislature to commence January 1st.
These items are, for the Dental College $8,000; the University
Hospital $3,500; the Honoeopathic Hospital $2,000; and the
Homceopathic Medical College $2,000. Without these appropriations these Departments in our care must cease, and it is not to
be supposed that after so carefully fostering these institutions
and realizing such benefits from them as are apparent, they will
cease to receive the fostering care of the Legislature.
2d. The estimates of expenditures are made quite in detail,
and are thereby more readily examined, and should bear careful
criticism.
3d. That in the estimates of disbursements, the debts for
expenses of the current year already incurred are classified, and
the balances due the special funds set forth as liabilities, thereby
fully showing the condition of the funds as near as practicable.

fessors Winchell, Steere, Pettee, Palmer, Prescott, Franklin,
and Dr. Dorrance, who had been asked to represent the interests
of the Dental College, in the absence of Professor Taft.
There was a lengthy interchange of views upon several topics connected with the designation and the management of the
museums belonging to the University; and it was found that in
one or two particulars there was a difference of opinion, though
for the most part there was practical unanimity.
The following are proposed as by-laws, which meet the approval of a majority of the members of the committee present
at the meeting:
I. The various illustrative collections belonging to the University are
arranged in the following museums:
(1) The Museum of Fine Arts and History;
(2) The Museum of Natural History;
(3) The Museum of Applied Chemistry;
(4) The Museum of the Department of Medicine and Surgery;
(5) The Museum of the Homoeopathic Medical College;
(6) The Museum of the College of Dental Surgery.
II. The President of the University shall have the general supervision
of the relations of the museums to each other and to the University; and
he shall have power to decide all questions affecting these relations, his decisions to be subject to revision by the Board of Regents.
IIH. The Professors in charge of the instruction in Mineralogy,Geology,
Botany, and Zoology, shall be the Curators of the corresponding collections
in the Museum of Natural History; the Professor of ZoOlogy shall also have
charge of the collections illustrating Archaeology and Ethnology; a Curator
of the Museum of Fine Arts and History, and a Curator of the Museum of
Applied Clhemistry shall be appointed by the Board of Regents from the
Faculty of the Department of Literature, Science, aud the Arts; and Curators of the Museums connected with the Medical and Dental Colleges shall
be appointed by the Board from the respective Faculties.
IV. For the Museum of Natural History there shall be a Custodian appointed, who shall perform, under the direction of the Curators, the duties
with which Custodians of similar Museums are ordinarily charged. He
shall also, when required, assist the several Professors, who make use of the
collections in the Museum at their lectures.
V. It shall be the duty of each of the Curators mentioned in III. to
make an annual report to the President of the University on the condition
of the collection or the Museum under his charge; which reports or the substance thereof, shall be embodied by the President in his annual report to
the Board of Regents.
VI. The Museums sha!l, as a rule, be open to the public daily, Sundays
excepted, between the hours of 9 A. im. and 1212 P. i.; and between 2 and 5 P
m.; but any Curator may require his department to remain temporarily
closed whenever, in his judgment, the interests of the University require it.

OCTOBER MIEETING, 1882.


In behalf of the members present at the meeting.

To the Honorable Board of Regents:

The following communication was read by the Dean
of the Department of Medicine and Surgery:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,          )
DEPARTMENT OFI MEDICINE AND SURGERY,
Ann Arbor, Oct. 10, 1882.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
The Faculty of the Department of Medicine and Surgery
respectfully request the following appointments:
As Assistant to the Chair of Pathology and Practice of Medicine, C. F.
Dight, M. D., $200.
To the Chair of Surgery, T. J. Sullivan, M. D., $200.
To the Chair ot Ophthalmology, etc., Harold Gifford, M D., $200.
To the Chair of Physiology, Willis E. Hallowell, M. D.
All of them at the salary formerly paid for such services.
The case of Dr. G. A. Hendricks is peculiar. He has been
in the service of the Anatomical Department since 1876-7-over
five years, abstainincgfrom other business and devoting his entire
time to the work, especially since he received the appointment
of Curator of the Museum. His compensation has been very
small-entirely inadequate for the faithful and skilled services
rendered, and does not correspond with that which others receive in proportion to the time, labor, and skill expended.
It is the desire of his Principal-the Professor of Anatomywhom he assists, that he should have the title of Instructor in
Anatotmy, and Curator of the Medical Museum, and that his
salary be increased to correspond with his labors. It is the opinion of the Faculty that this should be done.

Respectfully submitted,
A. B. PALMER, Dean.
To the Deat of the Depariment of Medicine and Surgery of the University
of Michigan:
The following is a brief history of my connection with the University:
I graduated in June, '77. During the previous winter was asked by Dr.
Herdman to return and assist him in the dissecting rooms, Was with him
four years. During the first and second I not only worked in the dissecting
rooms, but received, emualmed, and injected all the subjects" used. The
third and fourth being relieved of these latter duties, I took almost entire
charge of the rooms. I inspected and made a weekly record of each student's work.
At a meeting of the Board of Regents in June, 1881, I was appointed
Assistant to Professor Ford, and made Curator of the Medical Museum.
My duties the past year. were to prepare and dissect the " subject" for his
lectures, and in other ways assist him. To take out and return all preparations of the museum that were used by any of the Faculty. I met the classes
seven hours each week for " quiz" and recitations. Made over 150 preparations for the museum. Severat of these required, each, nmoths of labor in
their preparation. Made a uumber of large charts showing the distribution
of the cranial nerves. During the three spring months I lectured tnree
times a week to the First Year Students, and conducted a class in Comparative Anatomy.
During the winter I spent from three to five hours each week with Literary students who came to the Medical building to pursue their studies in
Comparative Anatomy.
Very repectfully,
GEO. A. HENDRICKS.

be insufficient to pay for the mounting, I-s.hould be glad to be
authorized to supplement it from a part of the proceeds from the

Prescott, Dean, was read by Regent Joy:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY,
March 24, 1883.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN,-The resignations of Joseph F. Geisler, Assistant in Qualitative Chemistry, and Oscar Textor, Assistant in
Quantitative Analysis, both to take effect on the 31st inst., are
presented to you at this time. These assistants have rendered
most satisfactory service in the Chemical Laboratory, and have
had the esteem of both students and teachers. This is the third
year of Mr. Geisler's service in teaching. and the second year of
Mr. Textor's. We are fortunate in having retained them so long.
They are now called to places of professional usefulness, where
we believe they will do credit to analytical chemistry, and to the
University, of which they are graduates. Mr. Geisler is asked




MARCH iMEETING, 1883.

by a house extensively engaged in the manufacture and importation of foods, in New York, to conduct an analytical laboratory for the detection of adulterations and the determination of
the quality of food products. This appears to be the first instance in this country of the opening of a analytical laboratory
for foods, within the business of a commercial house. It is an
initiatory movement following the execution of the law for the
suppression of adulterations in the State:of New York, and gives
a promise especially hopeful at this time. Mr. Textor, the assistant of Professor Cheever, is offered a responsible position, for
the analysis of iron ores, iron, and steel, in one of the large iron
works of Cleveland, where his accuracy and experience will give
good results. I beg leave to recommend the acceptance of both
these resignations.
To fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Geisler,
I desire to recommend the appointment of Lucius L. Van Slyke,
Ph. D., from his present duty as Assistant in the Chemical Laboratory, to be Assistant in Qualitative Chemistry, the appointment to take effect on April 1, 1883, and:to continue through the
year 1883-4, and (if deemed proper) to be with the same salary
granted to Mr. Geisler, namely, five hundred dollars per annum.
To fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Textor,
I would recommend the appointment of Julian W. Baird, A.B.,
(now in studies for the degrees of A. M. and Ph. C.), to be Assistant in Quantitative Analysis, the appointment to take effect
on April 1, 1883, to continue to the end of the fiscal year 1883-4,
and to receive the salary of the previous occupant, two hundred
and fifty dollars per annum. In this recommendation Professor
Cheever unites with the undersigned.
To fill the vacancy which may be made by the advance of
Mr. Van Slyke, I beg leave to recommend the appointment of
Franklin T. Babbitt, of the present senior class in the Department of Pharmacy, to be an Assistant in the Chemical Laboratory, the appointment to take effect on April 1, 1883, to continue
to the end of the fiscal year 1883-4, and with the salary previously granted for the same duty, one hundred and thirty dollars.
per annum. In this recommendation I have the concurrence of
Professor Johnson, in whose work the duty of this assistant belongs.
Also in your hands at this time is the request of Mr. Theo.
J. Wrampelmeier, Instructor in Analytical Chemistry, for leave
of absence for the collegiate year 1883-4, for purposes of study in




328


MARCH MEETING, 1883.


Europe. I willingly support this request, coming from an earnest devotion to good learning. Mr. Wrampelmeier's services
will be greatly missed, but arrangements to supply his principal
duties can be proposed to you at the meeting of your Honorable
Body in June.
Respectfully submitted,
ALBERT B. PRESCOTT.

The three foregoing appointments are made in accordance
with the recommendation of the Dean of the Faculty of the
School of Pharmacy.
The vote on the above resolutions was as follows:
Ayes-Regents Norris, Duffield, Grosvenor, Shearer, Blair,
and Joy.
Nays-None.
Regent Grosvenor read a communication from Messrs.
Morphy, Miller, and Meyer, barristers and solicitors, of
Toronto, relative to one D. L. Smith, deceased, which was
ordered to be placed on file.
Regent Norris moved that the report read by Regent
Duffield, Chairman of the Library Committee, be accepted
and printed in the minutes. The motion prevailed, and
the report is as follows:
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
The Library Committee of the Regents would report in reference to the dedication of the Library Building as follows:




MARCH MEETING, 1883.


329


That they have had frequent correspondence with the Library
Committee and the Librarian, that a sub-committee of three consisting of Professors Demmrnon, Pettee and the Librarian was appointed to devise a programme for the occasion, for submission
to the Library Committee of the Board of Regents. In this report they assume that the building will be in the hands of the
Building Committee, completed by the contractor, and turned
over to this committee by Commencement week, but inasmuch
as we learn from the Chairman of the Building Committee that
it will not be completed by the time supposed, the report is to
this extent subject to further correction and amendment previous to final adoption.
FOR THE EXERCISES.
1. A speech by Regent Shearer, Chairman of the Building Committee,
in which he shall give a brief history of the appropriation for the building
and of its erection, and then formally deliver it over to the Board of Regents.
2. A speech from a member of the Board accepting the building and
sketching its possible future, by the President of the Board, Dr. Angell.
3. A brief history of the collection of books that constitutes the Library of the University, showing its increase in numbers and usefulness,
by the Librarian, R. C. Davis.
4. A dedicatory ode by Regent Duffield.
5. An address from Mr. Winsor, Librarian of Harvard College.
6. Prayer and benediction by Bishop Harris.
The exercises to be interspersed with music from the band
in attendance.
They also regarded favorably the idea of participation in
the dedicatory exercises by the graduating class by planting an
ivy, etc., but with their present knowledge they were unable to
make any definite recommendation.
The first question for the Board to consider, is whether it
will not be desirable, if it be not absolutely necessary, to change
the time of the dedication from the Commencement week, to the
first week in the fall term.
When the dedication is made, it would seem proper according to all similar services, that the edifice should be completed,
accepted, and furnished, and every volume be in its proper
place, so that in every room the Library would speak for itself.
Your Committee also report as the result of their conference
and correspondence with the same committee, the following as
the classification of the books on the shelves of the new building:




330


33TARCH M~EETING, 1883.


On the first floor tlie general Dictionaries, Encyclopmedias, and Periodicals, and History and English Literature; History occupying Range 1;
English Literature, Range 2; distributing the books over the entire space,
leaving vacant shelves according to the anticipated increase.
On the second floor, Range 1; Greek Language and Literature, Latin
Language and Literature, Modern Languages and Literature, Comparative
Philology, Philosophy, Theology, Useful Arts and Fine Arts. In Range 2:
Science and Medicine.
On the third floor. Range 1: The class called Society, Political Economy, Government, Politics, Education, etc., and the Parsons Library. In
Range 2: Public Documents of the United States and Michigan.
It is also the sense of this committee that the newspapers
should be excluded from the reading-room, in which the coinmittee of the Board of Regents do most heartily concur and recommend that the same be adopted.
Your tommittee also recommend an appropriation not exceeding $300 for repairing and rebinding a large number of books
which have been gathered out from the rest, as utterly unfit to
be placed in the new Library until they are in a better condition.
GEORGE DUFFIELD.

To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN: In the spring of 1882 President White of
Cornell University volunteered to be one of three or four persons
to place a peal of bells in one of the towers of the new Library
Building. "Find two or three persons to join me in the matter,"
said he, " and we will put four or five bells in place without
cost to the University." This suggestion was acted upon. Two
brief letters were enough to bring favorable responses. The requisite money was put at my command; and I received direction
to make a selection of bells.
In the course of the summer I visited New York and learned that Robbins Battell, Esq., of that city would be my best
adviser for the object I had in mind. Mr. Battell was temporarily absent; but he generously responded to every inquiry I addressed to him, and, still further, with great courtesy he volun



JUNE MEETING, 1883..


341


teered to visit Ann Arbor to give me the opportunity of a personal interview. The result of our conference was the opening
of a correspondence with the bell founders. Meneely & Co. of
West Troy, The Clinton H. Meneely Bell Company of Troy,
William Blake & Co. of Boston, and Levesin Van Aerscodt of
Louvain, Belgium.
Of all musical instruments, a group of bells is probably the
most difficult to select.  The sound of a bell consists of not less
than six individual tones, mare or le-s distinct to an acute and
cultivated ear; and the quality of the note emitted depends upon
the harmonic adjustment of these several tones. No science can
prescribe the exact conditions by which this adjustment can invariably be secured; and no art seems able to correct a defective
adjustment when once a bell has been cast. A perfect peal
would consist of a group of bells in which all these harmonic
conditions were perfect in every bell, and in which all the bells
were in perfect musical accord with one another. These conditions are so difficult of fulfillment that there is probably not a
peal in the world in which they are perfectly realized. A close
approximation to these conditions is what gives the especial
charm to some of the famous bells of Europe.
After a somewhat extended correspondence with founders in
Europe and America, it was decided to give the order to the
Clinton H. Meneely Bell Company at Troy, New York. Two
visits to the founders were made, one in company with Mr.
Battell, and one in company with Professor C. B. Cady, of our
School of Music. In the visit for final inspection we examined
the chime in Albany, cast by the Clinton H. Meneely Company,
as well as the chimes in Buffalo, one of which is the largest and
probably the most satisfactory in America. Professor Cady is of
the opinion that the bells cast for this University, though not
quite perfect when judged from a standard of ideal excellence,
are more nearly in tune than were the bells of any of the chimes
we visited. The acquaintances of Professor Cady need not be
reminded that he is not accustomed to find musical perfection.
The bells are tuned respectively to G, F, Eb, Bb, and Eb -a
succession which provides for the striking of the so-called Cambridge quarters besides the strike of the houron the large bell.
The bells range in weight from 210 to 3,071 lbs.
On the large bell are two inscriptions. That on the east side
is the following:

On the opposite side is inscribed:

The University is indebted not only to the generosity of the
givers, but also to the technical knowledge and the unstinted interest and courtesy of Mr. Battell.
In fulfillment of instructions from the donors and in their
behalf, I now present these bells to the University. Through
the years to come may they speak out their own words:-call together those who are studious of all good things both human
and divine.
C. K. ADAMS.
On motion of Regent Shearer, the President was requested to tender the sincere thanks of the Regents to
Messrs. J. J. Hagerman, E. C. Hegeler, and President Andrew D. White, for the present of a peal of bells for the
new Library building, and also to acknowledge their indebtedness to Professor C. K. Adams for his services in
securing the bells from the manufacturers, and placing
them in the bell tower.
Professor C. K. Adams presented and read the following:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
Ann Arbor, June 26, 1883. )
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN,-A little less than a year ago I received a letter containing money for the purchase of books to be used by
students of history in this University. The letter contained the
following sentences:




JUNE MEETING, 1883.


343


" I give you this on one condition which is absolute; you
must not name the giver. You can order the books you want
most, and ask the advice of no one. The money is for your department only. I hope to do more if things go right with me.
If things financial come about as I hope, I will send more
money for more books. If they can be kept together where students can have access to them, it will please me. I like the idea
of a kind of historical laboratory."
With the money thus provided I have been able to purchase
and place in the University Library somewhat more than fourteen hundred volumes. Keeping in mind the phrase " historical laboratory," I have thought it wise to select such books as
seemed to me most needed by our students in carrying on the
work of historical investigation. The Colonial Records, the
collections of the several State Historical Societies, the most important State Histories, and the New England Historic Genealogical Register, have been added to the materials already at our
command for the study of American History. For researches
in English History the most important purchases have been
The Annual Register in 124 volumes, Rymer's Feedera in twenty
volumes, and Hansard's Debates in 185 volumes. On the history of France, besides a considerable number of works designed
to assist in the study of French political and administrative
methods, the new acquisitions include the great collection of
"i eemoires" by Petitot et Monmarqud, in 131 volumes. In
German complete sets of Von Sybel's Historische Zeitschrift,
the Preussische Jahrbicher and Unsere Zeit are perhaps the
most worthy of note. Nearly two hundred volumes have been
procured to aid in the study of administrative methods in Europe and America. A very considerable collection has also been
brought together for the better study of the governments of our
cities.
This generous contribution promises to grow into something
even more extensive in the future. I beg, therefore, to call the
attention of your honorable Board to the wish expressed in the
letter of the giver, and to add the expression of a hope that you
may find a way to comply with his suggestion.
I have the honor to be
Very respectfully yours,
C. K. ADAMS,
Professor of History.

In the By-Laws adopted November, 1830, defining the

"He shall be the purchasing agent of the University, in all
of its Departments, subject to the approval of a majority of the
Auditing Board, except as may be otherwise ordered by the
Board of Regents. But in the purchase of books for the several
libraries the General Librarian shall be associated with the
Steward and shall furnish the lists therefor; and in making purchases Which may be ordered for the several Departments, or for
individual chairs, the Dean of the Department or the incumbent
of the chair, as the case may be, shall in like manner be associated, and shall furnish proper lists."
And in place of the omitted words insert the following:
" He shall be and is hereby designated as sole purchasing
agent for the University and his duties as such shall be to order
and purchase any and all goods, supplies, incidentals, material,
etc., not otherwise specifically provided for by resolution of this
Board. His powers as such purchasing agent shall be limited to
the ordering and purchasing such books, goods and supplies as
shall be desired or required by any of the Departments of the
University, the list with details as to editions, binding,quantity,
and quality, etc., etc., to be furnished in writing over the signature of the head of the department desiring the goods. The
requisition so made shall be submitted at once to the Auditing
Board and with the approval of the said Board, of which a record shall be made, the purchasing agent shall order and purchase the goods so requested and certified, but the purchasing.agent shall in no case order or purchase any goods for any Department when funds are not at the. credit of the proper fund
sufficient to pay all the indebtedness incurred, or when the immediate certain resources are not sufficient therefor."
The objects of this resolution were stated by the mover to be,
1st: That all the purchasing of goods of any and every nature for the University shall be systematically made by one person and a full and complete record of the same shall be kept at one
place which record shall be the property of the University and
accessible at all times to the members of the Board of Regents.

Regent Duffield presented and read the following report which was ordered printed in the minutes:
To the Honorable, the Regents of the University of Michigan:
The Committee appointed by your honorable body at their
meeting, June 29th, 1882, " to investigate and report their recommendations on " the Memorial presented by the American
Philological Association and the Amlerican Association for the
Advancement of Science in regard to the matter of conferring
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy honoris causa, beg leave
to report the following as the result of their conclusions.
The paper presented by your memorialists consist of three
essential elements; first, that the degree of Ph. D. in Germany
where it originated, is purely a professional degree and is conferred only after a course of study at a University of at least three

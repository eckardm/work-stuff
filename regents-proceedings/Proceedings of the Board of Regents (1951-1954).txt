Retirements:     The President reported the retirement of four members of the
Faculty  faculty whose seventieth birthdays occurred after the end of the second
semester of the University year 1950-51 and before the August 3 meeting of the Board. The following memoirs were adopted for inclusion
in these minutes:
B. Jimenez:     Buenaventura Jimenez, M.S.P.H., M.D., Lecturer in Hygiene and Public
Memoir   Health and Physician in the Health Service, became Medical Examiner in the
Health Service in February, 1928, and has continuously since that time been a
member of its staff. He has also, from  1931 to 1935, been associated with the
Sensitization Clinic of the University Hospital, and between 1935 and 1938 was
Instructor in Pediatrics. The Regents of the University of Michigan are deeply
appreciative of the valuable services which Dr. Jimenez has rendered in these
various capacities, and upon the attainment of his seventieth birthday, July 14,
1951, extend to him both their thanks and their sincere felicitations. They confer
upon him the title Physician Emeritus in the Health Service and invite him to
avail himself of all the courtesies customarily shown to emeritus members of the
faculty.
M. D. Mackoy:       As a member of long standing in the faculty of the School of Dentistry,
Memoir   whose loyalty so the School and whose services to many hundreds of its students
have been of a high order of importance and value, Dr. Morris Davis Mackoy,
upon the occasion of his retirement, merits the gratitude and the good wishes
which the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby express to him. His first
appointment in this University came in the year 1906-7, immediately after his
graduation with the degree D.D.S., and since 1916 he has continuously combined
with his private practice of dentistry service to the Dental faculty as an instructor
in various phases of dental techniques. His colleagues and his students alike have
prized the kindliness, modesty, and the constant helpfulness of his character, which
have endeared him to many members of the School and of the University community throughout the years of his activity as a teacher. Inasmuch as Dr. Mackoy
attained the age of seventy years on July 8, 1951, the Regents of the University
of Michigan confer upon him the title Instructor Emeritus in Dentistry and invite
him to avail himself of all the courtesies customarily extended to emeritus members of the faculty.
A. F. Shull:     The best wishes of the Board of Regents are extended to Professor A. Franklin
Memoir   Shull upon the attainment of his seventieth birthday, August 1, 1951, whereby he
has become eligible for retirement from the chair of zoology which he has occupied
with distinction for many years past. A graduate of this University in the class of
1908, and in 1911 recipient of the doctorate from Columbia University, Dr. Shull
has for forty years been a member of our faculty, and for the past thirty years
has held the title of Professor of Zoology. By his researches in the special areas
of heredity, the mechanism of development, and sex determination, he has won
an enviable position among the scholars in his field; his skill as a teacher and
his guidance of advanced students have made him an outstanding member of his
department. In addition to the honors that have come to him from other sources,
the University of Michigan selected him as its Henry Russel Lecturer for the year
1950-51. Now, upon the occasion of his retirement, the Regents of the University
of Michigan confer upon Dr. A. Franklin Shull the title Professor Emeritus of
Zoology and invite him to avail himself of all the courtesies customarily extended
to emeritus members of the faculty.
W. Telfer:     The retirement from active service of William Telfer, Instructor in the WorkMemoir ing, Treating, and Welding of Steel, takes place upon the attainment of his seventieth birthday, July 12, 1951. Born in Jarrow, Durham, England, and since 1916
a citizen of the United States, Mr. Telfer joined the Department of Metal Processing in 1910, and since 1915 has been in charge of the course in metal working.
Possessed of an excellent technical background, a high degree of manual skill,
and remarkable personal qualities, Mr. Telfer has in the past forty-one years
been the teacher of thousands of students in the College of Engineering, who recall
with profit the subjects they have studied under his guidance and with affection
the kindly treatment they have received at his hands. The Regents of the Univer



AUGUST MEETING, 1951


45


sity of Michigan hereby express their great appreciation of Mr. William Telfer's
long-continued and devoted service to this University and confer upon him the
title Instructor Emeritus in the Working, Treating, and Welding of Steel, inviting
him to avail himself of all the courtesies customarily extended to emeritus members
of the faculty.

and for the regulation of the driving and parking of motor vehicles upon said
property; and to provide for enforcement of such rules and regulations and of the
laws of the State of Michigan and the ordinances of the City of Ann Arbor on

AUGUST MEETING, 1951


Development     On recommendation of the National Executive Committee of the
Council  Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project, the Board established a fundraising unit of the University, to be known as the Development Council, with the understanding that tentatively the Council will operate
under the following terms and conditions (R.P., 1948-51, p. 1281):
1. That a preliminary organization be set up immediately in order to maintain the values and make use of the experience gained in the Michigan MemorialPhoenix Project.
2. That the tentative name of this organization be known as the Development
Council of the University of Michigan.
3. That this Development Council have autonomy and jurisdiction under the
Board of Regents and that it be made up of fifteen to twenty-five members representing the Board of Regents, the Administration and Faculty, Alumni and Students, Industry and other friends. From the Council, it is proposed that a Steering
Committee of five be chosen. Final approval of the membership of the Council
shall be the responsibility of the Board of Regents.
4. That the preliminary staff of the Council include a paid Director (p. 28),
and Assistant to the Director, or other head, and a Secretary. Nominations for
these positions and the salaries to be paid should be recommended to the Board of
Regents by the University's President and executive officers. Headquarters for the
Council staff should be established at the University.
5. That the Development Council prepare studies of the University's probable
needs for which the Council should attempt to secure financing and probable
sources of funds to meet these needs for a period of a decade or longer.
That special committees of the University's faculties be appointed to make
studies of long-term and current needs; and that special committees of alumni
and other friends be appointed to make studies of potential sources of funds to
meet the needs.
6. That the Council consider various types of programs for securing funds, including bequests and insurance policies, gifts and grants, and annual giving
programs, and present to the Board of Regents an outline of an organizational
plan for securing such funds.
7. That the Development Council meet at regular intervals, to be determined
by the Council.
8. That in the interim, while the Council is being formulated, authority be
given to the Steering Committee members of the Michigan Memorial-Phoenix
Project to carry on the preliminary work of the Council and to make recommendations to the Board of Regents for membership personnel of the Council.
Foundry      On recommendation of the Executive Committee of the College of
Educational
Foundation  Engineering, the Board gratefully accepted a fund of $2,500, to be expended during the University year 1951-52, from the Foundry Educational Foundation whereby the University of Michigan becomes a participating school in its program. The purpose of the fund is to provide
$500 for "travel and meeting fund... to enable staff to attend functions of the foundry industry and of the Foundry Educational Foundation," and the balance of the money is to be used as scholarships
ranging between $200 and $500 or, if the conditions make such action
desirable, a part of this balance may be used to help cover the expenses
of a graduate assistant where such help is needed in the Foundry Laboratory.
Regents-Alumni     The Regents approved a change in the policy in connection with
Honor Awards  the Regents-Alumni Scholarship awards. In the future the name of
the award will be University of Michigan Regents-Alumni Honor
Awards. The awards will be made on the same plan as at the present,
one to each accredited high school in the state from which a qualified
graduating senior applies, plus a number of awards-at-large on the
basis of state-wide competition. To be eligible for one of these awards,




AUGUST MEETING, 1951


49


an applicant must be relatively mature, of unquestionable integrity,
admissible to the University with a good high-school record, and must
show evidence of good citizenship. Recipients of these awards who also
show evidence of financial need to make attendance at the University
possible, will be given tuition grants-in-aid for the first two semesters,
renewable for six additional semesters if the recipient's scholastic performance warrants. Public announcement will be made of all Honor
Award recipients and a certificate presented to each winner. Those to
whom grants-in-aid are awarded will be notified individually but no
public announcement will be made (R.P., 1948-51, p. 214).
Student Loans:
The Board directed that sixty-four student loans, to a total of       Charged Off
$8,356, regarded as uncollectible, should be charged to the Reserve for
Uncollectible Student Loans (R.P., 1948-51, p. 809). Special efforts
have been made in each case for the repayment of these loans, without
result. The balance in the Reserve for Uncollectible Student Loans is
$25,021.50 as of July 13, 1951. It should be noted that since the first
loan fund was established in 1897 until June 30, 1950, loans have
amounted to $3,692,251.27, and to the same date only $46,631.61 has
been charged off as a loss. Of this sum $2,605 was subsequently recovered.
The Secretary filed for record a letter from Dean Emeritus Russell    R W. Bunting
W. Bunting in which he expressed his appreciation to the Regents of
the opportunities and continued support which the administration of
the University has afforded him during his term of service.
The Regents adopted the following statement, with the understand-     Phoenix
ing that copies will be sent to the members of the group concerned:       Workers
To the alumni, students, and faculty members whose united loyalty and indi-  Commendation
vidual work in the campaign have made the Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project
an accomplished reality and a lasting monument to those of our number who gave
their lives for their country in the Second World War, the Regents of the University of Michigan present this testimonial of their profound gratitude. The
efforts of these workers in a common cause have been inspired by their unfailing
regard for this University and their belief in its ability to take a leading part
in the study and solution of new and unprecedented problems. Their success, in
addition to providing the means for this extension of its major interests, has
brought the University's name and reputation into prominence in all parts of the
country and has created a renewed sense of solidarity and responsibility among
its alumni and friends, such as has never before existed. Their services, freely
rendered and requited only by the sense of a great task well done, are thankfully
acknowledged and will forever be borne in remembrance.
The Regents approved an arrangement regarding the retirement          P. W. Rabinovitz:
allowance of Mrs. Patricia W. Rabinovitz, appointed Assistant Professor   pl iremen
of Social Work beginning with the first semester of the University
year 1951-52 with compensation of $5,300 for the University year.
Mrs. Rabinovitz has been employed for approximately ten years by
the State of Michigan and has membership in the State Employees'
Retirement System. To protect her equity in that system, which can
only be secured by her continuing membership for an additional five
years, the following program was approved: Beginning with the first
payment of salary for the University year 1951-52, Mrs. Rabinovitz
will contribute 5 per cent of $3,600, or $180, to the Employees' Retirement System, and the University will contribute 5 per cent of
$5,300, her University salary, or $265, to the same account. She will,
during -the same period, pay 2X2 per cent of $3,600, or $90. and 7'2
per cent of $1,700, the difference between $3,600 and $5,300, or




50


AUGUST MEETING, 1951


$127.50, to her TIAA contract. The University will pay 212 per cent of
$5,300, or $132.50, to the TIAA contract. Both parties, therefore, will
each pay a total of $397.50 toward the retirement of Mrs. Rabinovitz,
this arrangement to continue for a period of approximately five years.
Regent Herbert's travel expense vouchers for attendance at the
meetings of June 15 and 29, in the total amount of $190.85, were
approved.
Budget      There having been no objection within the stipulated two-week
1sls2d    period from   any Regent to any item     included in the proposed budget
for 1951-52, tentatively approved at the meeting of June 29 (R.P.,
1948-51, p. 1397), the budget was considered as formally adopted as
of July 13, 1951, and included the following appointment changes:

The President reported the death of Donal Hamilton Haines, Associate Professor of Journalism, on August 28, 1951, and the Board
adopted the following memoir for inclusion in these minutes:
Donal Hamilton Haines, Associate Professor of Journalism, whose death occurred suddenly on August 28, 1951, was an alumnus of this University of the
Class of 1909 who, during the past thirty years, had given service of high value
and importance to his alma mater. Himself a skilled journalist and an experienced
writer of fiction, he was unusually well fitted to counsel and instruct those who
aspired to enter the journalistic profession or to engage in creative writing. His
vigorous and positive personality, flavored by his keen love of the out-doors and
his genial interest in the individual, made him an inspiring teacher and a cherished
colleague, whose friendship was prized and whose memory will live long after him.
The Regents of the University of Michigan hereby record their profound sorrow
at the passing of one so highly regarded by his many friends among the students,
alumni, and faculty of the University, and extend to Mrs. Haines their heartfelt
sympathy for his loss.


D. H. Haines:
Memoir


The President reported that the emeritus status of Professor
Arthur B. Moehlman has now become effective (R.P., 1948-51, p. 724),
and the following memoir expressing appreciation of his service was
adopted:
As he withdraws from the active faculty of the University and assumes
emeritus status, the Regents of the University of Michigan extend their sincerest
thanks to Arthur B. Moehlman and-express their admiration for his outstanding
accomplishments in the field of school administration and supervision. A graduate
of Michigan (A.B., 1912- A.M., 1921; Ph.D., 1923) and since 1923 Professor of
School Administration and Supervision in the School of Education, Dr. Moehlman,
as teacher, author, editor, and consultant, is regarded as a national leader in the
subject of his specialty. Many of those who today occupy prominent positions in
our educational system received their advanced training under his direction, and
his influence has been further extended by his books and articles, and by his
editorship from 1932 to 1948 of The Nation's Schools. He has conducted surveys
of the school systems of numerous municipalities in both Michigan and Illinois,
and public officials have frequently and profitably drawn unon his store of knowledge and experience in seeking the solution of difficult educational problems. It
is therefore with the greatest regret that the Regents of this University accept
Dr. Moehlman's decision to retire from the post which he has occupied with notable
distinction for the past twenty-eight years, but they trust that as an emeritus member of the faculty, with the title Professor Emeritus of Education, he may for
many years continue his close association with his alma mater, and avail himself
of all the courtesies customarily extended to emeritus professors.
The following leaves of absence and an extension of leave of absence
were approved (p. 45):
John D. Adcock, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine, extension of leave of
absence for the month of September, 1951, with half salary, because of illness
(R.P., 1945-48, p. 1398)

A letter addressed to the Regents respecting the departmental administrative procedure of the Medical School was referred to the

The President reported     the death of Willett Forrest Ramsdell,        W. F. Ramsdell:
George Willis Pack Professor of Forest Land Management, on Satur-           Memoir
day, September 29. The following memoir was adopted for inclusion
in these minutes:
The loss of Willett Forrest Ramsdell, whose death occurred on September 29,
1951, is one which is severely felt both by the University of Michigan and by
his countless friends in the faculty, in professional forestry circles, in forest and
wood-using industries, and among the students and alumni of the University.
Professor Ramsdell, himself an alumnus of Michigan with the degrees B.S., 1912,
and M.S.F., 1914, returned to his alma mater in 1930 after a successful career
in the United States Forest Service and had since that time occupied with distinction the George Willis Pack Professorship of Forest Land Management. His
services in this capacity were of unusual variety and importance, including the
direction of the Chase S. Osborn Preserve in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan,
the organization and oversight of the interdepartmental seminar and research
program on land utilization, and during the Second World War the direction of
the Civil Affairs Training School which the University conducted on behalf of the
United States Government. Furthermore, as secretary of the Michigan Forest
Industries Information Committee, member of the board of directors of the
Michigan Rural Rehabilitation Corporation, and member of various other scientific,
professional, and civic organizations, his influence was exerted far beyond the
immediate bounds of our campus. In all of these associations Professor Ramsdell
was held in high esteem and genuine affection for his scholarly attainments and
for his personal qualities —unquestioned integrity, generous friendliness, sound
judgment, loyalty, and industry. The Regents of the University of Michigan
share the grief of Professor Ramsdell's many friends and extend their heartfelt
sympathy to the members of his surviving family.
The President reported the death of Murray Slotnick, Assistant           M. Slotnick:
Professor of Physics, on October 5, 1951. The following memoir was          Memolr
adopted for inclusion in these minutes:
Dr. Murray Slotnick, Assistant Professor of Physics, who met his death by
accidental drowning on October 5, 1951, had been a member of the faculty of
this University only since September, 1950. The high regard in which he was
held by his department is evidenced by the rapidity of his promotion from the
grade of instructor to that of assistant professor after service of but a single
year. During that time, however, his colleagues had been amply convinced of his
unusual qualities as a scholar in the fields of theoretical nuclear physics and of
electromagnetic phenomena, and he had proved himself correspondingly successful
as a teacher. His sudden death, at the early age of twenty-four years, is especially
distressing to those who had come to hold him in high regard for the pleasing
modesty of his personality, and who had looked to him for many years of
important productive work in the fields of his special competence. The Regents
of the University of Michigan share in the sorrow experienced by Dr. Slotnick's
many friends, and in particular they convey to his bereaved parents assurance of
their heartfelt sympathy.

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1951


The Regents of the University of Michigan express their deepest sympathy to
the family and friends of James Sherman Gault, Professor of Electrical Engineering, whose sudden death occurred on November 16, 1951. Respected and regarded
with affection by his students and colleagues, Professor Gault had been a member
of our faculty since 1922, one year after his graduation from the College of Engineering. His department owes to him the development of its laboratory and courses
dealing with servomechanisms and has profited by his professional knowledge, his
recognized gifts as a teacher, and his friendly co-operative spirit. Professor Gault
will likewise be keenly missed in the numerous organizations, including the Senate
Advisory Committee of this University and the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, in whose activities he was prominently engaged. On behalf of the University of which he was a loyal alumnus and which he served long and effectively
as scholar and teacher, the Regents hereby record their heartfelt sorrow for the
untimely passing of Professor James Sherman Gault.

M.L. Byrn:      The President reported the death of Marshall L. Byrn, Assistant
Memoir Professor of Vocational Education and Head of the Department of
Industrial Arts in the University High School, which occurred on
November 23, 1951. The following memoir was adopted for inclusion
in these minutes:
By the death of Marshall Lyman Byrn, on November 23, 1951, the Regents
of the University of Michigan recognize that the University has lost from its
faculty a teacher highly respected by his students and colleagues, whose devotion
to this University and to his duties as a member of its staff was unsurpassed in
its sincerity and constancy. A graduate of the Indiana State Normal College and
the Michigan State Normal College, holder of a master's degree from this University, Professor Byrn had taught at the Crookston, Minnesota, High School and
Cass Technical High School, Detroit, prior to joining the staff of the University
High School in 1924, the year in which it was first opened. His services since
that time, both to the High School, in which he was Head of the Department
of Industrial Arts, and to the School of Education, in which he was Assistant
Professor of Vocational Education, have been of unusual value. Evidence of the
esteem in which he was held by the members of his profession is to be found in
his selection, in 1931-32, as President of the Michigan Industrial Education Society and for that Society's Master Teacher Award in 1949. Admired for his friendliness, his high standards of performance, and his fine character, Professor Byrn is
one whose place among us can hardly be taken by another, and whose passing is
mourned by many. To his friends and surviving family the Regents of the University of Michigan extend their deepest sympathy.
Leaves of     The following leaves of absence were approved (p. 224):

and the faculty of the School of Natural Resources will allow the
University to use the income from the foundation in such a manner
as will, in its judgment in view of the circumstances prevailing at any
given time, contribute most effectively toward strengthening the national economy through the wise use of its natural resources.

G. and H. B.      The Board accepted, with sincere thanks, the following assignment
Slocum
Foundation  from  the testamentary trustees of the George and Helen B. Slocum
Loan fund  trust fund, originally established under Article 12 in the will of Dr.
George Slocum, M.D.'89, who died in 1933 (R.P., 1932-36, p. 132).
The Probate Court in the County of Washtenaw, having found that
the creation of the George and Helen B. Slocum trust fund as originally
created is invalid as in violation of the rules and statutes relating to
perpetuities and accumulations in the State of Michigan, and because
literal compliance with Article 12 of said will is impracticable, if not
impossible, the trustees are tendering this assignment of the fund,
with an alleged principal of $2,000 as a substitute, to establish the
George and Helen B. Slocum Foundation Loan fund:
The Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, in its discretion, may
retain the present investment of said funds, or reinvest same in such investments
as are permitted for trustees under the laws of this State, until March 31, 1953,
after which time principal and accrued interest, or other income, may be loaned
in sums. of $500 or more, up to a maximum sum of $1,000, at a low interest
rate to be fixed by the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan at not
more than 3%   per annum, under proper liberal safeguards, to worthy seniors
of any of the colleges of the University of Michigan who may apply for such
loans, who, although not necessarily of a high scholastic standing, indicate in
the judgment of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan promise of
benefiting the world in the way of religion, ethics, morals, literature, art, science
or in the chosen profession or study, who might otherwise be forced to discontinue
the course of study or to devote time to earning his living to the prejudice of
his studies on account of lack of financial funds, in order to defray his education
and other expenses at college during the senior year, preference being given during
a period of 35 years after the acceptance by the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan of the within trust to direct descendants of Giles F. Slocum,
deceased, father of the said George Slocum, deceased, formerly of Sherwood,
Cayuga County, New York, possessing the above-stated qualifications, but in the
event that there be more than one such applicant, the direct descendants of the
said late George Slocum, the testator, shall have preference. The sum or sums so
loaned shall be made repayable within ten years or less, unless upon investigation
of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan it should appear that
repayment has become permanently impossible, when such loan, in the discretion
of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, may be charged off as
a loss.
It is further understood that future donations may be added to the George
and Helen B. Slocum Foundation by relatives of the said George Slocum, deceased,
or others, which donations shall be subject to the terms and conditions hereinbefore stated.
G. C. Hartman     The Vice-President in charge of business and finance reported that

Library in accordance with the terms of the gift.

R. A. Kelley:      The President reported the death, on January 7, of Master Sergeant
Memoir   Russell A. Kelley, Assistant Instructor in the Department of Military
Science and Tactics. The following memoir was adopted for inclusion
in these minutes:
The Regents of the University of Michigan express their sincere sympathy
to the surviving family of Master Sergeant Russell Alfred Kelley, since 1946
Assistant Instructor in Military Science and Tactics, whose sudden death occurred
on January 7, 1952. Sergeant Kelley, a fine soldier whose wartime services to
his country were attested by well-earned combat decorations, brought to our
campus a spirit and a personality which gained for him the respect and high
regard of the students who profited by his instruction and of the officers of his
department. The Regents hereby record their appreciation of his valued contribution as a member of the University's instructional staff and their sorrow occasioned
by his untimely death.
Retirements:     The President reported the retirement of four members of the
Memoirs   faculty, as of the end of the first semester of the University year
1951-52. The following memoirs were adopted for inclusion in these
minutes:
A. E. Wood       Having reached the age of seventy years on October 19, 1951, Dr. Arthur
Evans Wood, Professor of Sociology and Chairman of the Degree Program in
Preprofessional Social Work, has become eligible for retirement at the end of the
first semester, 1951-52, under the provisions of the "Bylaws" of the Board of
Regents. Professor Wood's career has been an unusually varied and significant
one for its impact both upon this University and upon the social structure of the
State. The provision of opportunities for our students to gain professional
experience in social work are largely due to his initiative, and his long-continued
studies, especially in criminology, penology, and community social service, have
made him effective alike as a teacher and as a counselor on the social problems
of governmental units and of organizations such as the Ann Arbor Community
Fund, the Ann Arbor Family Welfare Society, the Detroit Community Fund, and
the Detroit Council of Social Agencies. He prepared the plan for reorganizing
the penal system of Michigan that was adopted by the committee appointed to
draw up a new law in 1937, was made chairman, in 1948, of the State Advisory
Council on Corrections, and was an organizer and president, in 1946-47, of the
Michigan Corrections Association. He has also been honored by election to the
presidency, at various times, of the Michigan Sociological Society, the National
Community Center Association, and the Michigan Conference of Social Work.
Dr. Wood has been a frequent and thoughtful contributor to the journals of his
profession and is the author, or co-author, of two books, Community Social Problems and Crime and Its Treatment, respectively. He has been a member of our
faculty for the past thirty-five years, highly regarded by students and colleagues
alike. As he now retires, after a long and honorable career, the Regents offer him
their sincere felicitations and their good wishes for the future, conferring upon
him the title Professor Emeritus of Sociology and inviting him to avail himself
of all the courtesies customarily shown to emeritus members of the faculty.
G. R. LaRue       George Roger LaRue became a member of the faculty of this University in
1911, the year in which the Ph.D. degree was conferred upon him by the University
of Illinois. In 1927 he was promoted to a full professorship in zoology, and from
1937 to 1949 he was chairman of that important department. For twenty-two years
he also served as Director of the Biological Station, besides holding membership,
at various times, on a number of important administrative and advisory com



JANUARY MEETING, 1952


271


mittees of the University. As a scholar, Dr. LaRue has contributed substantially in
the general field of parasitology, and his colleagues have recognized his eminence
as a scientist by electing him to the presidency of the American Microscopical
Society in 1926, the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters in 1932, and
the American Society of Parasitologists in 1937. As a teacher, he has been effective
and inspiring; numbers of young people have by his influence, especially during
his years at the Biological Station, been stimulated to undertake careers of
zoological research and teaching. An able administrator, conscientious, just, and
co-operative, a respected scholar and teacher, and a colleague regarded with affection for his friendly spirit and integrity of character, Professor LaRue has
throughout the forty-one years of his association with the University of Michigan
exercised a wholesome and helpful influence. Impressed by the value of his longcontinued services, the Regents of the University of Michigan express their thanks
and congratulations to Dr. George R. LaRue, and upon the occasion of his retirement at the end of the first semester of this year they confer upon him the title
Professor Emeritus of Zoology, inviting him to avail himself of all the courtesies
customarily extended to emeritus members of the faculty.
At the close of the first semester, 1951-52, Dr. Norman Leroy Willey, Profes-  N. L. Willey
sor of German, who passed his seventieth birthday on January 17, 1952, becomes
eligible for retirement under the provisions of the "Bylaws" of the Board of
Regents. Dr. Willey first joined our faculty in 1920, after having received undergraduate and graduate training in both literary subjects and the law and having
taught for seven years in several prominent preparatory schools for boys. In 1925
he was granted the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Michigan,
and in 1931, after speedy promotion through the intervening ranks, he was made
a full professor. Throughout his thirty-two years of membership in our faculty,
Dr. Willey has shown himself to be a stimulating and effective teacher, specializing
in the Scandinavian literatures and Germanic philology. His undergraduate courses
have been eagerly sought by students year after year, and he has likewise been
successful in the guidance of graduate candidates for the advanced degrees. Professor Willey's long list of scholarly publications, ranging through the areas of
Germanic philology, Spanish, and Scandinavian literatures, and the ancient languages of Mexico attest his attainments as a productive scholar, and he now retires
from active service with the respect and good wishes of his colleagues and former
students. The Regents of the University of Michigan express their thanks and their
congratulations to Dr. Willey, and confer upon him the title Professor Emeritus of
German, inviting him to avail himself of all the courtesies customarily extended
to emeritus members of the faculty.
Paul Smith Welch, whose seventieth birthday occurs on January 28,. 1952,  P. S. Welch
came to the University of Michigan thirty-two years ago, after having completed
his graduate work at the University of Illinois and having taught for five years
at Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science. Since 1928 his title
has been Professor of Zoology and now, as the end of the first semester of this
academic year approaches, he becomes eligible for retirement under the provisions
of our "Bylaws." The Regents of the University of Michigan extend to Professor
Welch their heartiest congratulations upon the notable record that he has made
both as a teacher and as an investigator. Stimulating to undergraduates in the
classroom, and with graduate students meticulously insistent upon sound scholarly
methods, he has importantly served his department, while his own researches,
skillfully and industriously pursued, have brought him national eminence as an
entomologist and limnologist. Testimony to the success of his career as an
investigator is to be found in the scores of scientific papers which he has published
in the professional journals, in his two authoritative treatises, Limnology and
Limnological Methods, and in the honors paid him by the learned societies of
which he has been an active member, including the presidency of the Limnological
Society of America and of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters.
The Regents of the University of Michigan express their profound appreciation
to Professor Welch, and upon the occasion of his retirement from active membership in the faculty they confer upon him the title Professor Emeritus of Zoology
and invite him to avail himself of all the courtesties customarily extended to
emeritus professors.
The Regents accepted, with sincere regret, the resignation of Pro-        P. A. Leidy:
fessor Paul A. Leidy, a member of the faculty of the Law School for          Resignation

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1952


299


The President reported the retirement of Professor Robert Craig,           R. Craig, Jr.
Jr., of the School of Natural Resources, which took place at the close
of the first semester of the University year 1951-52. The following
memoir was approved for inclusion in these minutes:
Upon the occasion of his retirement from active duty, the Regents of the
University of Michigan express to Robert Craig, Jr., Professor of Wood Utilization, their profound gratitude for the loyalty and devotion which he has exemplified in the thirty-two years of his association with the University, and extend to
him their cordial good wishes for his health and happiness in the years to come.
The Regents are aware that Professor Craig's services have in ample measure
accrued to the advantage of the University of which he is an alumnus. His wise
direction of the summer courses at Camp Filibert Roth for some twenty years
has made this the standard of excellence for forestry camps in this country, and
as Secretary of the School of Forestry and Conservation (now the School of Natural Resources) from  its establishment in 1927 to 1945, he contributed substantially to the successful administration of this division of the University. His
rugged integrity, his intimate knowledge of his field of specialization, his ready
friendliness, and his consistently sympathetic and helpful attitude have made it
possible for him both to exercise a most salutary influence among the students
of his School and to represent the School with great effectiveness in its outside
contacts. As he now terminates his active service, the Regents confer upon him
the title Professor Emeritus of Wood Utilization and invite him to avail himself
of all the courtesies customarily extended to emeritus members of the faculty.
Leave of absence was granted to John E. Magielski, Senior Clinical         Leave of
Instructor in Otolaryngology, for two months, March 1 to April 30,             Absence
1952, with full salary (p. 272).
The limit of liability of the Group Honesty Insurance Bond, issued         Group Honesty
by the National Surety Corporation, which indemnifies the Regents of           Insurance Bond
the University of Michigan and its subsidiary corporations against any
loss caused by the dishonesty of any employee or employees through
larceny, embezzlement, or other fraudulent act, was increased from
$50,000 to $100,000 on each employee, it being understood that the
additional premium necessary to increase this limit is slightly less than
$700 for a three-year period (p. 272).
The Regents approved the University of Michigan Employees' Re-             Employees
tirement Plan, as printed in full in Supplement A of this meeting, the         Retirement Plan
plan to be effective March 1, 1952. The Vice-President in charge of
business and finance was authorized and directed to put the plan into
effect as of that date, including the issuing of suitable certificates of
participation to each employee who is a member of the plan (p. 201).
The Regents requested the Vice-President in charge of business and         Women's
finance to invite the architects, Black and Black, of Lansing, and             Athletic
Alden Dow, of Midland, to present the plans of the Women's Athletic            Building
Building project to the Regents at their meeting on March 21 (p. 202).
On recommendation of the Executive Committee of the College of             Transportation
Engineering, the Transportation Institute was established within the           Institute
College of Engineering, for the following purposes:
1. To develop and conduct, directly, or in co-operation with appropriate
University departments and services, inservice training programs, institutes, short
courses, and conferences for engineers, technicians, and other personnel in the
transportation industry, related organizations, and concerned public agencies.
2. To sponsor study and research in the many phases of transportation
through scholarships, fellowships, and grants.
3. To assist in the development of the Transportation Library as an outstanding facility for study and research and as a broadly useful center for transportation information.
The Institute is to be under the administrative supervision of a Director, who




300


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1952


shall be responsible to the Dean and the Executive Committee of the College of
Engineering for the development of appropriate programs of Institute activity.
An advisory committee, representing the several schools and departments of
the University having an interest in transportation, is to be appointed by the Dean
and the Executive Committee of the College of Engineering, upon recommendation
of the Director and with the approval of the chairmen of the departments and
the deans of the schools concerned, to assist the Director in the development of
the several activities that may be allocated to the Institute.
It is understood that the establishment of the Institute will not involve any
additional expenditure of University funds nor does it imply any commitment
for additional staff or space.
National     On recommendation by the Vice-President in charge of business and
Bank of
Ypsilanti finance, the following resolution was adopted (p. 143 and R.P., 1948 -51, p. 1280):
Resolved, That the Vice-President in charge of business and finance be authorized to open a bank account in the National Bank of Ypsilanti, Ypsilanti, Michigan, with a maximum deposit of $5,000.00, such account to be entitled "Willow

in the name of the University of Michigan on such account: W. K. Pierpont, VicePresident, LaVerne R. Biasell, Assistant Director, Willow Run Research Center,
and Carroll E. Caldwell, Business Manager, Willow Run Research Center.
North Campus       The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized

Institutes: Fees  Session and the Committee on University Fees, the Regents designated
a fee of $30 for those participating in workshops, conferences, and
institutes of approximately two weeks' duration, held during the summer session. It is understood, however, that if such institutes are conducted for regularly established groups, such as the Department of
Elementary School Principals and the National Science Teachers Association, any members of these groups who are residents of Michigan
may register for a fee of $20, whereas the fee of $30 will apply in
these cases to nonresident students only. In general, the credit hours
earned by attendance at the institutes are not in excess of two.
English     The Regents designated that, effective immediately, the fee for
Institutgees   those in attendance at the English Language Institute shall be $175
for each of the Institute's two-month terms, thus increasing the fee
by the amount of $25.
Ernst and Ernst:    The Board approved the appointment of the firm            of Ernst and
Audit by  Ernst to audit the University records for the year 1951-52 at a fee
not to exceed $19,500 (R.P., 1948-51, p. 1153).
Appropriation    The Board approved, by        call vote, the following appropriation
(p. 272):
Museum of Paleontology, Publications: $3,000 to provide funds for the printing
of unpublished manuscripts which have been prepared under the direction of
the Museum, with the understanding that the budget for 1952-53 will include
a like amount to be used for the same purpose. Under this arrangement the
Committee on Scholarly Publications will have no obligation for the publishing
of manuscript material but will be prepared to consider the publishing of
manuscripts of monograph or book length.
Transfer of     The Board approved the following transfer of funds:
unds  Transfer of $2,900 from  General Sponsored Research-Research Overhead Receipts, to Plant-Building Alterations, to provide funds for the construction
on the ground floor of the Radiation Laboratory of a waste storage and
packaging area for those radioactive materials for which the various departments conducting research have no more use.

amounting to $2,000, for use as a loan fund for students of Armenian
parentage, from which no loans have been made, be returned to the
donors as an addition to a larger scholarship fund which the Club now
holds, available for scholarships in any college or university in this
state.
On recommendation by the Broadcasting Service Committee of the
University, the Board approved a series of television programs over
Station WOOD-TV, in Grand Rapids, at a total cost of $2,000 for
thirteen such weekly programs, provided it is reported by the Chairman of the Committee that the audition, to be held on Sunday, February 17, is satisfactory.

10.1. The retirement benefits set forth in Sections 11 to 13 will be available to
Participants upon completion of the requirements for such benefits and
proper application for same not later than two years after termination of

a) "Prior Service Credit" shall mean the number of years credited to the
Participant for service to the University prior to the effective date of
the amended Plan.. This credit shall be determined by the Administrator

b) "Prior Service Salary Base" shall mean the average of the amounts not
in excess of $5,000 earned in the five fiscal years, not necessarily consecutive, of highest compensation for the Participant in the eight full
fiscal years immediately prior to March 1, 1952. A fiscal year shall be
considered in the calculation only if the Participant was an employee
for the whole of that year and was of age 30 or more at the beginning
of the year. In case the number of such fiscal years is one, two, three,
or four, the Prior Service Salary Base shall be calculated as an average
for such shorter period. If there is no such full fiscal year, the Prior
Service Salary Base, if required, shall be the base rate of pay for the
Participant as of September 1, 1951, but shall not exceed $5,000.
11.3. The Prior Service Annuity of a Participant shall provide the annual income
equal to 1.5 per cent of his Prior Service Salary Base times his Prior Service
Credit.
11.4. For the purpose of stating how the Current Service Annuity shall be determined. the following definitions will be used:
a) "Joint Contribution for a Participant" during a fiscal year shall mean
the sum of the contribution by the Participant and the matching contribution by the University for that year.
b) "Participant's Annuity Credit" for a fiscal year shall mean the amount
of life annuity, payable from his Normal Retirement Date, which is provided by the Joint Contribution for the Participant during that year in
accordance with the Annuity Rate Schedule (Table II) in effect for that
year.
11.5. The Current Service Annuity for a Participant shall equal the aggregate of
the Participant's Annuity Credits for the fiscal years, after the effective
date, during which he has been an Active Participant, together with such
additional Annuity Credits, if any, as may be distributed under the provisions of Section 19.
SECTION 12. ANNUITY RATE SCHEDULE
12.1. As of the end of each fiscal year there shall be determined for each Active
Participant the amount of life annuity that in accordance with the Annuity
Rate Schedule (Table II) is provided by the Joint Contribution for the
Participant during the fiscal year. Such amount shall be the Participant's
Annuity Credit for the fiscal year, as defined in Subsection 11.4, paragraph
(b).
12.2. The amounts of annuity shown in Table II apply only to benefits commencing on or after the Participant's Normal Retirement Date. Modified
benefits for retirement prior to the Normal Retirement Date are to be
calculated in accordance with Section 13.
12.3. The Annuity Rate Schedule has been computed on the assumption that 100
per cent of the Participant's share of the Joint Contribution and 95 per
cent of the University's share will be accumulated at 2 2 per cent per
annum until Normal Retirement Date, whereupon the accumulated amount
is applied to provide a life annuity on a basis consistent with the group
annuity rates in current use by leading life insurance companies. The remaining 5 per cent of the University's share of the Joint Contribution is reserved
to finance the early retirement and minimum benefit features of the Plan.

SECTION 14. ACCUMULATIONS
14.1. The various accumulations for a Participant are defined as follows:
a) "Prior Service Accumulation" at any time shall mean the amount obtained by accumulating with Regular Interest to that time the contributions made by the Participant prior to March 1, 1952, under the
provisions of the Intermediate Plan.
b) "Current Service Accumulation" at any time shall equal, in accordance
with the actuarial basis employed for the calculation of current service
annuities, the discounted value at that time of the amount required at
Normal Retirement Date of the Particinant to provide his Current
Service Annuity. (This discounted value will equal, or exceed, the amount
obtained by accumulating with Regular Interest to that time the Joint
Contributions made by the Participant and the University after March 1,




334


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1952


1952, less the portion of the University's contributions reserved for
early retirement and minimum benefits.)
c) "Total Accumulation" for a Participant shall mean the sum of his Current Service Accumulation and of his Prior Service Accumulation, if any.
SECTION 15. REGULAR FORM OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS
15.1. The regular form for the retirement benefits provided in Subsections 11.3,
11.5, 13.2, and 13.3 shall be a life annuity with monthly payments so long
as the Retired Participant shall live. In addition, should the Retired Participant die before the sum of all annuity payments he has received under
the Plan equals his Prior Service Accumulation, as defined in Subsection
14.1, at his date of retirement, the excess of such Prior Service Accumulation over such sum shall be refunded to his Beneficiary.
15.2. The basis for the payment of the regular form of retirement annuities shall
be monthly payments. Whenever retirement takes place on a first-of-themonth, the first full monthly payment shall be due on the last day of the
month in which such retirement occurs.
Whenever retirement becomes effective on a date other than a first-of-themonth, the first full monthly payment shall be due on the last day of the
month next following the month in which the retirement becomes effective,
and a partial payment computed on a pro rata basis shall be due on the
last day of the month in which such retirement occurs.
All such regular monthly annuity payments will terminate with the last
payment preceding the date of death of the payee, and there will be no
proportionate payment to the time of death.
SECTION 16. OPTIONAL FORMS OF RETIREMENT BENEFIT
16.1. At any time before annuity payments have begun, the Participant may
elect to receive, in lieu of the regular form for his retirement benefit, one
of the options hereinafter stated. Such Optional Annuity shall be for such
reduced amount as may be provided or purchased by a sum equal to the
Total Reserve held for the Participant's regular form of retirement benefit.
Such Total Reserve shall equal the value, as of the retirement date, in
accordance with the actuarial bases employed for Prior Service and Current
Service annuities, of the regular form of retirement benefit available to the
Participant.
16.2. Option I-Modified Cash Refund Annuity. An annuity payable during the
lifetime of the Participant with a guarantee that if, at the death of the
Participant, the sum of his Prior Service Accumulation and 52 per cent of
his Current Service Accumulation as of his retirement date exceeds the sum
of the annuity payments that have been made, the amount of such excess
will be paid to his Beneficiary in the form of a single payment.
16.3. Option II-Installment Refund Annuity. An annuity payable during the
lifetime of the Participant with a guarantee that if, at the death of the
Participant, the amount of the Total Accumulation for the Participant as
of his retirement date is greater than the sum of the annuity payments
already made, the annuity payments will continue to his Beneficiary, if
living, until the sum of all annuity payments made equals the amount of
such Total Accumulation. If the last survivor of such Beneficiary and the
Participant shall die while receiving annuity payments, any guaranteed
payments then remaining unpaid will be commuted in value and paid in
one sum to the estate of such last survivor.
16.4. Option III-Joint and Survivor Annuity. Under this option the Administrator
shall use the sum defined in Subsection 16.1 to purchase from a life insurance company an annuity providing an income payable during the lifetime
of the Participant and continuing for a full or reduced amount to a contingent annuitant designated by the Participant during his or her lifetime.
The income provided under this annuity will depend upon the sum available
for its purchase, the age and sex of the Participant, the age and sex of the
contingent annuitant, and the type of annuity chosen.
SECTION 17. WITHDRAWAL BENEFITS
17.1. A Participant of the Plan whose active participation has terminated for
reason other than death or retirement shall be entitled to a withdrawal

benefit upon application for same within two years after such termination of
active participation (see Section 23.4).
17.2. The Withdrawal Benefit for a Participant whose active participation after
March 1, 1952, has been for a period of less than five full years shall equal
the sum of his Prior Service Accumulation and 52 per cent of his Current
Service Accumulation and shall be provided to him in the form of a single
payment.
17.3. A Participant whose active participation after March 1, 1952, has been for
a period of five or more full years may elect to receive a Regular Withdrawal
Benefit equivalent to the sum of his Prior Service Accumulation and such
per cent of his Current Service Accumulation as is stated in Table IV.

provided in the following manner:
a) If the total sum available is less than $1,000, a single payment shall be
made to the Participant.
b) If the total sum available is $1,000 or more, the Administrator shall
apply such amount to purchase an annuity contract on the life of the
Participant with income to begin on or after the Participant reaches age
60. Such annuity contract shall be purchased from a life insurance
company designated by the Administrator and shall not provide loan or
cash surrender values.
17.4. In lieu of electing the Regular Withdrawal Benefit as provided in Subsection
17.3 the Participant may elect to receive a single payment equal to the sum
of his Prior Service Accumulation and 52 per cent of his Current Service
Accumulation.
17.5. After a withdrawal benefit has been provided to the Participant, his participation shall cease, and he shall have no right to further benefits under the
Plan by reason of his former participation.
SECTION 18. DEATH BENEFITS
18.1. If a Participant of this Plan dies at any time before arrangements for his
retirement have been completed, a death benefit will be available to the
Participant's Beneficiary upon proper application for same and upon receipt
of due proof of the death of the Participant. Arrangements for the retirement of a Participant shall be considered completed when the Participant
has received an annuity payment or when an annuity contract has been
purchased for his benefit.
18.2. The Death Benefit for such Participant shall be the equivalent of the Withdrawal Benefit, as defined in Subsections 17.2 and 17.3, which would be
available as of the date on which death occurred, and shall be provided by
one of the methods of settlement described in Subsection 18.3. The Participant
shall have the right to elect the method of settlement and, if he does not exercise
such right, his Beneficiary shall have such right after the Participant's death.




336


F BRUARY MEETING, 1952


18.3. The Death Benefit, as provided in Subsection 18.2, may be settled by the
following methods:
a) A single payment provided such payment is not in excess of $3,000.
b) Equal monthly installments for such period as may be elected. An election of a period of less than ten years which would result in payments
of more than $200 a month shall be void and another election shall
be made.
c) A combination of methods (a) and (b).
d) An annuity on the life of the Beneficiary that may be purchased by the
Administrator by use of the Total Accumulation for the Participant.
Such annuity may have installments guaranteed for a period of years or
other features as may be considered to be for the best interest of the
Beneficiary and shall be purchased from a life insurance company
designated by the Administrator.
Any election of a method of settlement which would result in payments of
less than $10 a month shall be void and another election shall be made.
If an estate is payee at the Participant's death, the death benefit shall be
payable at the option of the Administrator in a single sum.
18.4. Whenever a Participant dies after arrangements for his retirement have
been completed, the Death Benefit, if any, shall be limited to the benefit
available under the form of Retirement Benefit elected by the Participant
when he retired, as provided in Sections 15 and 16.
SECTION 19. DISTRIBUTION OF SURPLUS
19.1. On the basis of findings of actuarial valuations and of recommendations by
the University Committee on Annuities, the Administrator shall from time
to time distribute, in accordance with actuarial formula, such additional
Annuity Credits to the Participants of the Plan as can be provided by
surplus funds of the Plan, if any, which are not required for actuarial
reserves or for insurance of the benefits or for other means of guaranteeing
benefits under the Plan.
SECTION 20. PRESENT ANNUITANTS
20.1. All former employees who, as of the effective date, were receiving retirement
annuities unde- the Intermediate Plan shall have such annuities continued
for the same amounts and shall retain right to any refunds available to
them under the Intermediate Plan.

accordance with the May, 1946, action of The Regents (R.P., 1945-48,
p. 389) has as of the effective date, rights to benefits under the Intermediate

in accordance with the provisions of the amended Plan, and in regard to his
Prior Service Accumulation shall have such rights as are consistent with the
provisions of the amended Plan.
21.2. A Participant of the Plan who, after the effective date, becomes eligible
for participation in the faculty retirement plan, shall have the sum of his
Total Accumulation, and his equitable share in the aggregate reserve for
prior service benefits. transferred to his credit in the faculty plan, whereupon his participation in this Plan shall cease.
SECTION 22. BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

"request for information" form, provided by the Administrator, and may
thereon designate as his Beneficiary the person or persons to receive any
benefits, other than contingent annuities, which on the basis of his participation and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, are available after
his death.
22.2. The Participant may, from time to time, and without the consent of his
Beneficiary, make a change of Beneficiary by filing written notice of such
change with the Administrator on a form furnished by or satisfactory to
the Administrator, and by having such change endorsed on his certificate of

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1952                              337
22.3. No Participant shall be permitted to designate more than three beneficiaries
under this Plan and whenever more than one Beneficiary is designated each
shall share equally in the benefits. If any designated Beneficiary predeceases
the Participant, the interest of such Beneficiary shall terminate, and his share
shall be payable equally to such of the beneficiaries as survive the Participant.
22.4. In event that the Participant has failed to designate a Beneficiary or that
no designated Beneficiary survives the Participant, the estate of the Participant shall be the Beneficiary of such Participant.
SECTION 23. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
23.1. To the extent permitted by law none of the benefits or payments hereunder
shall be subject to any claim of any creditor of any Participant or of any
Beneficiary of any Participant; and shall not be subject to attachment or
garnishment or other legal proceedings or process by any creditor of any
Participant or any Beneficiary of any Participant; and neither the Participant nor any Beneficiary shall have any right to alienate, encumber, or
assign any of the benefits or payments under the Plan.
23.2. If any payee under this Plan is, in the judgment of the Administrator,
legally, physically, or mentally incapable of receiving payments due under
the Plan, the Administrator may, at his sole discretion, withhold such payments or make payments (not in excess of $50.00 monthly) to such other
person, persons, or institution who, in the opinion of the Administrator. are
then maintaining or have custody of such payee, until claim is made by a
duly appointed guardian or legal representative of such payee. Upon receipt
of such claim, the Administrator shall make proper adjustments in payments,
and future payments, as.they become payable, shall be paid to such guardian
or legal representative.
23.3. Whenever under the provisions of the Plan a single payment is to be made,
the University reserves the right to defer such payment for a period not in
excess of six months.
23.4. Whenever a Participant fails to make, within a period of two years after

benefits under the Plan, he shall thereafter be eligible to receive, in lieu of
all other benefits under the Plan, only a single payment equal to the sum
of his Prior Service Accumulation and 52 per cent of his Current Service
Accumulation as of the end of such two-year period.
23.5. Unless the context indicates another intent, words of the singular number
shall include the plural number; words of the masculine gender shall include
the feminine gender; and vice versa.
23.6. A Participant may not withdraw from the Plan so long as he remains in

statement concerning benefits which is provided by the Administrator shall
be null and void unless the information concerning such benefits is based
on the correct age of the Participant.
23.9. The amount of benefit available to a Participant depends on the correct age
of the Participant. Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that
the age of the Participant, as recorded, may be incorrect, he shall withhold
the payment of benefits until satisfactory evidence of the correct age of the
Participant is received. Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of age. the
benefit available in accordance with the correct age shall be determined and
any monthly payments which may have become payable in the interim shall
be paid in a single sum. The Participant shall not be entitled to interest
earnings on such benefits for the period they have been withheld pending

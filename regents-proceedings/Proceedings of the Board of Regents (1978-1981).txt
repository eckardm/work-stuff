JULY MEETING, 1978
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, JULY 27, 1978


The Regents met at 1:30 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Laro, Nederlander, Power, Roach, and Waters. Chancellors
Goodall and Moran and Vice-Presidents Shapiro, Brinkerhoff,
Radock, Overberger, Johnson and Vice-President and Secretary
Kennedy also were present.
Dr. Jeptha Dalston, Director of University Hospital, reported
briefly on the 1977-78 fiscal operation for the Hospital. He indicated that there has been remarkable improvement in the last
half of the fiscal year. The Hospital, through efforts of the medical and nursing staff, an expense reduction program by hospital
managers, dietetics staff, building services and others, will end
this fiscal year without a financial loss. However, funds must be
generated to meet the enormous capital and equipment needs.
Regent Baker commented that the hospital is to be congratulated and asked if the high level of utilization will be helpful
in negotiations for the new facility.
Dr. Dalston replied in the affirmative, adding that the higher
occupancy rate is the manifestation of new vigorous young chairmen, service chiefs, and faculty members in the Medical School.
He said that everyone realizes that the operation must be tightened. The medical and nursing staff also realize that the health
care industry is volatile, and that there must be accountability
and reevaluations of procedures.
President Fleming referred to the Hospital Planning report
and said that a more detailed report would be available in September. In the meantime, he wanted to apprise the Regents of
the time frame within which some decisions must be made and
to make everyone aware that by the time construction begins,
there will be a considerable escalation of cost. A project of this
size takes approximately two years to design, therefore, construction cannot begin until 1981.
Regent Nederlander commented that if 1981 is the earliest
date on which construction can commence, the cost of the facility

will almost double. Will the hospital be smaller than anticipated
or is it feasible at this point to further consider a new hospital.
President Fleming responded that since the proposed cost of
$140 million was geared to 1974 estimates, we are assuming the
State will recognize the inflationary factor and be willing to work
on a solution. At this time, however, the time frame is very important because of the certificate of need moratorium that has
been enacted by the Legislature.
Tuition, 1978-79  Vice-President Shapiro reviewed the tuition proposals for
Dearborn,and 1978-79 at Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint. The undergraduate
Flint resident tuition was acted upon by the Regents in April. The
proposal includes a registration fee of $15.00 per term for all
students and a shift in the graduate structure. There is also information on the kinds of financial aid at the University and
tuition rates at peer institutions.
Regent Roach noted that two significant outside sources of
student aid, the work study program funds and the loan funds
provided through Michigan State scholarships and loan programs,
are decreasing. He hoped that these programs would receive
attention.
Vice-President Shapiro stated that the amount indicated in
the report for the work study program is assured. There is a
possibility the University will receive a substantial supplement
at the end of the year. The University is also working to increase
State loan funds.
Regent Power suggested the establishment of a task force to
encourage the government to substantially increase work study
program funds.
Regent Laro said that he felt the proposed tuition rates for
the Law School and the Medical School were out of balance. A
substantial increase in the Law School tuition would not damage
its competitive position, and perhaps could relieve the burden on
the Medical School.
Vice-President Shapiro stated that there were a number of
factors involved in considering the current recommendation. The
per capita financial aid at the Law School's competitors is very
much higher; the percentage of non-resident students to whom
admission has been offered and accepted has declined dramatically
in the last few years; student/faculty ratio in the Law School is
higher by a significant number; and there is a greater proportion
of non-residents in the Law School than in the Medical School,
therefore, tuition would have to be increased a great deal to make
up for the dollars lost.
Regent Laro commented that applicants for admission to the
Law School far outnumber available space, therefore, he does not




JULY MEETING, 1978

believe there would be any problem in filling an entering class.
He said he was not anxious to raise tuition, but as long as it was
necessary, it should be on an equitable basis.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve the tuition rates for
1977-78, as recommended. Regent Dunn seconded the motion
and it was adopted with Regent Baker voting no and Regent
Laro voting no only on the Law School tuition proposal.
Regent Roach moved to approve the 1978-79 tuition rates
for UM-Dearborn and UM-Flint. Regent Waters seconded
the motion and it was adopted with Regent Baker voting no.
Vice-President Shapiro presented the budget for 1978-79, indicating the highlights of the critical areas of the Ann Arbor
general fund budget.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve the budget for the
Ann Arbor campus, as recommended. Regent Waters seconded
the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Waters moved to approve the UM-Flint budget for
1978-79, as recommended. Regent Laro seconded the motion and
it was adopted.
Regent Laro moved to approve the UM-Dearborn budget
for 1978-79, as recommended. Regent Dunn seconded the motion
and it was adopted.
Vice-President Johnson reviewed the Michigan Student Assembly Fee Assessment proposal and indicated that the request
had been amended to include an additional assessment of 60 for
the Ann Arbor Tenant's Union. It is felt that with the centralization of legal aid activity which would include the question of
housing reform, this service could best be handled within the
context of an expanded legal aid service. He pointed out that no
part of the mandatory fee would be directed to the Center for
National Housing Reform.
Mr. Jonathan Rose, and Mr. Paul Teich, Legal Aid Society
attorneys reviewed the background and the activities of the
Society, and the Michigan Student Assembly housing law reform
project.
Vice-President Johnson commented that they were requesting
additional funds to expand legal aid services for students of The
University of Michigan. Under the guidelines of the Washtenaw
County Legal Aid Society, many students at the University,
particularly at the graduate level, were being denied access to
legal services because of income restrictions.
President Fleming mentioned that up until this year the University had given the Legal Aid Society some monetary support
through the Office for Student Services. However, because of the


Budget, 1978-79

JULY MEETING, 1978


budget restrictions in that office, it was no longer possible to
provide these funds. The students felt that this was a valuable
service, therefore, MSA asked the students, through an election
process, if they would support the service on a mandatory fee
basis. The results of the April election supported the issue overwhelmingly.
Regent Baker asked if there were any restrictions on the
availability of the service.
Mr. Teich responded that income from all sources would be
taken into consideration, including that received from parents
and grants. However, the cost of tuition would be subtracted
because it is considered to be an extraordinary fixed cost. Under
the old plan only indigent students were qualified, but under the
new plan, since all students would be taxed, all students would
be eligible.
Regent Baker commented that he had just voted against a
tuition increase because tuition is too high, and something must
be done to reduce the cost of education. The only protest he has
is to vote against tuition. He said that he was going to vote
against this proposal because it not only adds to the cost of education, but is not on a voluntary basis. It is unreasonable to
request the Regents to approve a mandatory assessment to support an issue that all students do not support. In essence, a
bureaucracy has been established and it is in the best interest of
the Society to continue its existence.
Vice-President Johnson stated that this is not the original
request, but the result of serious discussion with the Executive
Officers, the Office for Student Services, the General Counsel, and
the three parties presenting the issue. He said that he felt it
merits the Regents positive consideration.
Regent Baker indicated that if there is, indeed, a need on
the part of the students for legal services, perhaps it is something
that should be incorporated into the administrative function. It
would seem appropriate to have the University provide the necessary personnel. This would negate any peripheral issues because
they would not exist. He also said that he wanted to discuss this
issue with the General Counsel.
Vice-President Johnson remarked that there has been extended meetings with Mr. Daane, and he is at ease with the
present proposal.
Regent Roach stated that the Regents should not exercise
control over the specific projects or organizations MSA desires
to fund. This would be a dangerous precedent. Once the Regents
start such organization by organization restraint, there would be
no way to draw a line. While he, personally, does not support




JULY MEETING, 1978                          5
many organizations funded by MSA, and opposes some of them,
MSA should have the right to make its own decisions within
general guidelines.
The Regents then deferred action until Friday.
The Regents then heard comments from Karen Downing and         Public
Susan Van Hattum concerning the MSA fee assessment; Arthur          omment
Anderson concerning the Hospital subcontract; Jim Delcamp and
Andy Feeney concerning South African Investments; Carol Mezo,
Howard Brick, and Reginald Baugh concerning affirmative action.
The meeting was adjourned.

Radock, Overberger, Johnson, and Vice-President and Secretary
Kennedy also were present.

Vice-President Brinkerhoff placed on file his monthly reports
on investment transactions, temporary investments, plant extension, litigation, and personnel-labor relations. He also filed a
quarterly report on non-competitive purchases over $1,000 from
single sources.
Historic    In connection with the plant extension report, Mr. Roderick
Central campus  Daane, University Counsel, reviewed the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act. Under the Act, property eligible
for inclusion in the National Register means any property the
Secretary of the Interior determines is likely to meet certain
historical criteria. This makes it possible to be subjected to the
restrictions of the legislation if your property is determined to be
eligible for listing, even though it is not listed.
He then suggested certain procedures the University might
pursue to remove from the listing the Central Campus as an
historic district. The University could request formally to both
the state and federal agencies that the property be removed from
the list because of the defective process by which it was nominated
as an historic district; seek from the Michigan Court of Claims a




JULY MEETING, 1978


7


declaratory judgment on the Constitutional grounds that the
Michigan Department of State, acting through its History Division, lacks the authority to nominate University property for
inclusion as an historic district. If the latter prevails, it is likely
that the Federal Government would remove the University from
the list, but might still consider the property eligible, and therefore bound to the restrictions of the Act. Based upon further
research the University might institute a federal court action
arguing that the regulations, because of their overbreadth, are
void and should be disregarded. Another possibility, and the
most effective, would be to have Congress amend the National
Historic Preservation Act. This would be entirely consistent with
the reservation of power in the Tenth Amendment to provide
that nominations to the historic district of state owned property
should be made by an appropriate state official who, in this case,
would be the Board of Regents.
Regents Nederlander and Roach agreed that appropriate legal
proceedings should be undertaken. Regent Roach indicated that
there was also the question of due process and the possibility of
an appeal to the Court of Appeals under the Administrative Procedure Act.
Regent Brown commented that there seemed to be a lack of
appreciation for the importance of the act and of the Central
Campus with respect to it as a place of national significance.
There is no indication that the Federal Government would be
unreasonable in future changes the University might wish to
make to this area. He felt that the University should not oppose
this action at present.
Regent Baker mentioned that the matter evolved from the
controversy surrounding Barbour/Waterman gymnasiums. At that
time, a petition for historic designation was submitted to the
State History Division to prevent the University from demolishing the gymnasium buildings. He agreed that the preservation of
historical places is important, but there is a difference in a legitimate interest in protecting history and using federal law to create
difficulty in the administration of the University.
Regent Power indicated that a negative assessment of the
designation is unfortunate. This country is just beginning to
realize the importance of the preservation of its history. Perhaps
the positive effects of this legislation and its implications could
be addressed.
Regent Baker moved that appropriate action be taken, as
recommended by University Counsel, to have the central campus
removed from the listing as an historic district, and to examine
Regent Roach's suggestions of due process and an appeal under
the Administrative Procedure Act. Regent Roach seconded the

motion and it was adopted with Regents Brown and Power
voting no.
Vice-President Overberger filed a listing of grants and contracts for research.
Vice-President Radock filed his monthly report on the Office of

The Regents also approved the title of Director Emeritus to
Nicholas Falcone who served as Director of Bands from 1927 to
1935. Following is the memoir:
Nicholas Falcone served as Director of Bands at The University of
Michigan from 1927 to 1935. It is the recommendation of the School of
Music that he be appointed Director Emeritus of University Bands.
Nicholas Falcone was born in Italy and came to America in 1912. As a
virtuoso clarinetist, he performed extensively as a professional musican, and
in 1927 was appointed Director of Bands at The University of Michigan.
An examination of programs of the period 1927 to 1935 indicates performance
of the finest symphonic literature available at the time, and a most complete
band instrumentation. The bands performed in public concert on regular
intervals and often performed in other areas of the state. Critical reviews of
the concerts of this entire period were highly complimentary.
Mr. Falcone also served as conductor of the Marching Band during this
period, and newspaper clippings of the era were also highly complimentary
of these performances.
Nicholas Falcone served with great distinction in the position of Director
of Bands at The University of Michigan until 1935 when he retired because
of a sudden loss of hearing. Despite this handicap in the ensuing years, Nick's
love for music and for Michigan continued unabated. Compositions and
band arrangements continued to pour from his talented soul and were published and played on a national scale. In addition, he attended almost every
concert played by all the Michigan Bands during these fifty-one years
despite the fact that he couldn't hear a single note being performed. Mr.
Nicholas Falcone is truly an "M" man with contributions indelibly recorded
in the historical annals of the Michigan Bands.
Mr. Falcone currently resides at 418 Thompson St., Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The Regents now salute this distinguished musical artist, arranger,
teacher, and conductor for his dedicated service by naming him Director
Emeritus of University Bands.

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of eleven faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted.
WILLIAM    BELCHER     BALLIS, Professor of Political Science, has  W. B. Ballis
retired from active faculty status as of June 30, 1978, after an outstanding  Retirement
career in teaching, research, and service as a diplomat and political analyst
for the United States Government.
Professor Ballis was born in Portland, Oregon. He received his B.A.
degree from Stanford University and his Ph.D. degree from The University
of Chicago. He was a fellow of The Rockefeller Foundation for Russian
Studies (1937-1939). He taught at The Ohio State University (1939-1941)
and then served in Washington, D.C., and in Moscow as a political analyst
from 1941 to 1948. He was a professor of political science at the University
of Washington, Seattle (1948-1957) when he joined The University of
Michigan.
He has been a professor, lecturer, and consultant at several of the War
Colleges and at other distinguished institutions-in Europe as well as the
United States-and was instrumental in helping to build the Russian and
East European studies program at the University in Ann Arbor.
His publications are many, especially on the USSR, with special attention to the Inner Asian sector of the Soviet Union where he is recognized as
a pioneer in Outer Mongolian political studies.
The Regents salute this distinguished political scientist for his excellence
in service to the University by naming him Professor Emeritus of Political
Science.
Professor ROBERT C. F. BARTELS, Director of the Computing Center R. C. F. Bartels
and Professor of Mathematics, retired from  active faculty status as of  Retirement
June 30, 1978, after a productive career as a teacher, researcher, and administrator.




16


JULY MEETING, 1978


Professor Bartels was born in Brooklyn, New York, and took his undergraduate and graduate degrees at the University of Wisconsin, receiving his
Ph.D. in 1938. He came to The University of Michigan in 1938 as an Instructor, was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1945, to Associate Professor
in 1950, and to Professor in 1957.
Professor Bartels was one of a few farsighted people who, during the
1950's, applied numerical techniques to solve new problems in mathematics
and introduced numerical analysis as a field of study in the university curriculum. He was appointed Director of the newly established University of
Michigan Computing Center in 1959, a position which he held until his
retirement. As Director he did a remarkable job of fostering an environment
in which the Center could grow to its present prominence as one of the best
in the academic world. That he did so in spite of severe budgetary restrictions and many conflicting demands for computing services attests to his
great skill as an administrator.
In 1972 Professor Bartels received a Distinguished Faculty Achievement
Award in recognition of excellence in teaching, research, and public service.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated
service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Mathematics and Director
Emeritus of the Computing Center.
W. K. Frankena     Professor WILLIAM    K. FRANKENA, Roy Wood Sellars Professor of
Retirement Philosophy and Distinguished Scholar/College Professor, retired from active
faculty status on July 1, 1978, after a highly productive career as a teacher
and scholar.
He was born in Manhattan, Montana, in 1908. He received the B.A.
from Calvin College in 1930, the M.A. from The University of Michigan in
1933, a second M.A. from Harvard University in 1935, and the Ph.D. from
Harvard University in 1937.
Professor Frankena began his teaching career at The University of
Michigan as an instructor in philosophy in 1937, and, apart from visiting
appointments at Harvard, Columbia, Tokyo, the University of Washington,
and Princeton, has been at this University ever since. He was promoted to
assistant professor in 1940, associate professor in 1946, and professor in
1947. He served as Chairman of the Department of Philosophy from 1947
to 1961.
Professor Frankena was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1948-49, Fellow of
the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford in
1968-69, Chairman of the Board of Officers of the American Philosophical
Association from 1962-65, President of the Western Division of the American
Philosophical Association in 1965-66, member of the President's Commission
on the Humanities, 1963-65, Chairman of the Council for Philosophical
Studies from 1965-72, member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, member of the National Academy of Education from 1965, and was
the Carus Foundation Lecturer in 1974.
He is renowned for his learning in the history of ethics, a subject about
which he is generally believed in the profession to know more than anyone
else in the world. His scholarly knowledge in the philosophy of education is
of nearly equal scope. His major contribution, however, has been his original
work in moral philosophy. He has published several definitive articles on
the "naturalistic fallacy" in ethics, and on the senses of "can" and their
relation to various senses of "ought." He has written many papers on the
meaning of the ethical terms, particularly on whether they can be given a
"naturalistic" or an "emotivist" analysis. And he has written influential
papers on distributive justice, on the concept of human rights, on the relation between an ethics of "duty" and one of "virtue," and on the relation
of religion to ethics. His book Ethics has been enormously influential, and
is properly greatly admired for its care and judiciousness.
Professor Frankena especially served the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts not only as a dedicated Chairman for thirteen years, but as a




JULY MEETING, 1978


17


member of the Executive Committee for three terms.
In view of all these accomplishments, the Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and philosopher for his dedicated service by naming him
Professor Emeritus of Philosophy.
ERASMUS L. HOCH, Professor and Associate Chairman of Psychology,     E. L. Hoch
has retired from active faculty status as of July 1, 1978 after a most pro-  Retirement
ductive career as a clinician, teacher, and administrator.
A native of New York, "Bob" Hoch completed his baccalaureate in 1936
and a Master of Science degree in 1937, both from the College of the City
of New York. Following military service during World War II, he entered
Columbia University and completed his Ph.D. in 1950 with specialty in
clinical psychology. He served as a clinical psychologist in several Veterans
Administration hospitals in New Jersey and Main, rising in 1954-56 to the
position of Chief Clinical Psychologist at the Veterans Administration Center,
Togus, Maine.
In 1956 he was appointed Administrative Officer in charge of state and
professional affairs of the American Psychological Association in Washington, D.C. He served with distinction in this capacity during a period of
vigorous development and rapid expansion of the roles of clinical and other
professional psychologists in American society. His monthly column in the
American Psychologist entitled "Psychology in the States" served more than
any other single element to keep the profession informed of rapidly evolving
legislative, organizational, and ethical issues during this era of rapid transition.
In 1962 the Department of Psychology attracted Bob away from the
APA central office to serve as its Administrative Officer and later as Professor and Associate Chairman of the Department until the time of his
retirement.
During his 14 years at the University, Bob Hoch, more than any other
person, was responsible for the efficient operation of the Psychology Department. His conscientiousness, his ingenuity and above all, his sensitivity to the
needs of students and of a diverse and vigorous faculty and staff created
confidence and assurance that the program would run smoothly and that the
teaching and research missions of the Department would be met to the full
extent that available resources would permit. Never content merely to do
his part, he undertook a wide range of service activities and professional
responsibilities throughout the University and in the professional sector. He
chaired the College Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research
for five years, for two years he served as chairman of the Senate Advisory
Review Committee, and during his last two years on campus he served as
Secretary for the Faculty Senate and the Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs. In the last 10 years of his professional career alone, he
served on no less than 10 major committees of the Michigan Psychological
Association, and the American Psychological Association, chairing half of
these assignments-and always with wisdom, grace, and wit.
The AMOCO Good Teaching Award, which he received in 1976, is only
the most recent indication of his excellence as a teacher. His students knew
him not only as a delightful and challenging instructor, but as a close personal friend as well. His colleagues knew they could scarcely do better than
to attempt to merely match Bob Hoch's performance as a mentor and
advisor to students. He was known to all as one who could make the learning process not merely stimulating and enlightening but personally relevant,
humane, and fun besides.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher, administrator and
selfless good citizen of this University and his profession by naming him
Professor Emeritus of Psychology.
ROBERT L. IGLEHART, Professor of Art and former Art Department R. L. Iglehart
chairman, retired from active faculty status May 31, 1978, after a most pro-  Retirement
ductive career as teacher, art educator and administrator.




18


JULY MEETING, 1978


A native of Maryland, Robert Iglehart studied Design on an undergraduate level at the Maryland Institute, followed by study at Johns Hopkins
University and Columbia University where he obtained a B.S. in Education.
From 1935 to 1941 he worked as a professional designer in New York City.
In 1946, after serving as correspondent in World War II, Professor
Iglehart continued postgraduate studies at the New School for Social Research in New York City. In 1948 he was appointed chairman of the Department of Art at New York University.
In 1955 he joined The University of Michigan as first chairman of the
newly formed Department of Art in the former College of Architecture &
Design. His contributions to the university at large and his leadership in the
former Art Department have been outstanding in effecting the development
and reputation of the School. Professor Iglehart is a renowned scholar and
Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 1970 he stepped down from the
department chairmanship and returned to teaching and research.
He has traveled extensively in Europe and England receiving many
international awards and citations. His work has earned consistent grant
support, including Rackham grants and his writing is well known in the
Art Education field across the country.
The Regents now acknowledge the contribution of this distinguished art
educator and scholar. His dedicated service and continuing work in the arts
richly deserves the title of Professor Emeritus of Art.
D. A. Kerr     Dr. DONALD A. KERR, Professor of Dentistry, has retired from active
Retirement  faculty status as of June 30, 1978, after an outstanding career as a teacher
and researcher.
Dr. Kerr, who was born in Detroit, earned the A.B. degree in 1931 at
Eastern Michigan University, and the degree Doctor of Dental Surgery at
The University of Michigan in 1937. He joined the faculty of the School of
Dentistry that year as a Clinical Instructor and completed the Master of
Science degree in 1943. Dr. Kerr became Assistant Professor of Dentistry (in
histopathology and periodontics) in 1944, and in 1948 was named Associate
Professor and Chairman of what was then the Department of Oral Pathology
and Periodontics. In 1952 Dr. Kerr was promoted to Professor. He chaired
the joint department until 1963 when it was divided into two departments,
Periodontics and Oral Pathology, continuing to chair the latter until his
retirement. Dr. Kerr holds also an appointment as Professor of Pathology
(in Dentistry) in the Medical School and for five years served as co-chairman
of the Service of Dentistry and Oral Surgery at University Hospital.
Dr. Kerr has played a key role in the development of the School of
Dentistry in his 40 years here. He was instrumental in organizing the School's
department of Periodontics and Occlusion, both of which are recognized as
among the best in the country. Dr. Kerr was responsible also for establishing
and directing the oral pathology biopsy service, one of the earliest and largest
dental-school-based biopsy services. His influence upon the biological aspects
of the dental curriculum has been highly significant.
Internationally recognized in the field of oral pathology, Dr. Kerr has
developed a successful program for the management of irradiated oral cancer
patients. He has served as a consultant to many federal agencies, including
the Naval Dental School and Walter Reed Hospital. Included among his
many honors for his research in the study of oral cancer are the prestigious
Pierre Fauchard Gold Medal for outstanding contributions to oral pathology
and the Tufts University Award for Leadership in Oral Pathology. In 1972
he received the University's Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award.
The Regents now honor this distinguished health educator for his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Dentistry.
R. S. Moyer     Dr. RALPH S. MOYER, Professor of Dentistry, has retired from active
Retirement faculty status as of May 31, 1978, after a most productive career as a
teacher and clinician in the School of Dentistry.




JULY MEETING, 1978


19


Born near Temperance, Michigan, Dr. Moyer attended Eastern Michigan
University before coming to The University of Michigan to pursue a dental
education. After graduation from the School of Dentistry in 1931 he served
as a demonstrator in basic technics and operative dentistry. In 1943 he
earned the degree Master of Science and was promoted to Assistant Professor. In addition to his teaching duties, Dr. Moyer maintained an active
dental practice in Ann Arbor. In 1949 he was made Associate Professor and
named Chairman of the former Department of Basic Technics. In 1964 Dr.
Moyer was named Professor of Dentistry.
As head of the Department of Basic Technics, Dr. Moyer was responsible
for introducing freshmen and sophomore dental students to the art of dentistry. His idealism and ability to stimulate students to achieve excellence in
their clinical skills have contributed significantly to the School's reputation
for producing expert clinicians. That his influence upon the practice of dentistry in Michigan has been far-reaching is indicated by the fact that virtually every graduate of the School practicing dentistry today received his
or her instruction in basic clinical technics from Dr. Moyer.
With the advent of the revised curriculum and the new building in
1969, the department's name was changed to "Preclinical Dentistry," and
Dr. Moyer was joined by Dr. Harvey Schield as co-chairman. In addition to
his teaching duties and his private practice, Dr. Moyer has been active in
various professional organizations, and he served for nine years on the
board of the Michigan Children's Aid Society.
Well-liked by students and co-workers alike, Dr. Moyer's contributions
as a teacher of clinical skills in dentistry have had a significant impact upon
the quality of dental education established in the past 46 years of his association with the School of Dentistry.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Dentistry.
GEORGE E. PALMER, Professor of Law, has retired from          active  G. E. Palmer
faculty status as of May 31, 1978, after a devoted career of teaching and  Retirement
research.
Professor Palmer was born in Washington, Indiana in 1908. He received
both his A.B. (1930) and his J.D. (1932) from The University of Michigan.
From 1932 to 1939 he was engaged in private law practice in Indianapolis.
He then did a year of graduate study at Columbia, obtaining an LL.M. in
1940.
Professor Palmer began teaching as an Assistant Professor of Law at
the University of Kansas in 1940, and was promoted to Associate Professor
in 1945. His teaching was interrupted during World War II, when he spent
three years as counsel for the Office of Price Administration and served a
further short stint as an attorney in the Department of Justice. Professor
Palmer came to Michigan as an Associate Professor of Law in 1946. He was
advanced to full Professor in 1951.
The teaching specialties of Professor Palmer include Remedies, Restitution, and Trusts and Estates. Over the years he has produced numerous
articles marked by meticulous scholarship and impeccable style. His books
include Mistake and Unjust Enrichment (1962), Cases on Trusts and Succession (1968), and Cases on Restitution (1969). This year he will crown
his career with the publication of a four-volume treatise that promises to
be the definitive word on The Law of Restitution.
In an era that has increasingly succumbed to elaborate and often impenetrable statutes and regulations, Professor Palmer has been hailed as
"The Last Great Common Lawyer." For generations of Michigan students
who have sat dazzled (and sometimes quaking) in his classroom, the image
of him deftly cutting through the verbiage of some appellate judge's opinion
to the solid bedrock of fact beneath will long be one of the most cherished
memories of their law school years.
The Regents now salute this gifted lawyer and educator for his long




20


JULY MEETING, 1978


service to The University of Michigan by naming him Professor Emeritus
of Law.
N. Sherman     Professor NOAH    SHERMAN      retired effective May 31, 1978, after
Retirement  twenty years of service to the University.
Dr. Sherman was born in New York City on June 24, 1921, received his
Bachelor of Science degree from the City College of New York in 1948, his
Master of Arts degree in Physics at The University of Michigan in 1949
and his Ph.D. in Physics from The University of Michigan in 1952 with a
specialty in Cosmic Ray Physics. He was appointed as Instructor of Physics
at The University of Michigan in 1952-53, served as a Physicist at the University of California Radiation Laboratory from 1953 to 1956 and was
appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at The University of Michigan in
the fall of 1956. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1961 and to
Professor in 1966.
His service to the University has included membership in SACUA and
on the Committee on the Proposal for the Establishment of a New College
appiinted by Dean Thuma. He was active in the development of and intensely interested in a wide variety of new teaching techniques and media.
He participated in the Academic Year Institutes held for high school science
teachers here at the University, served as liaison between the Department of
Physics and the Center for Learning and Teaching and assisted the development of a self-paced general physics course for Liberal Arts majors.
His research efforts began in experimental Cosmic Ray Physics, changed
to Theoretical Nuclear Physics and, in most recent years, to the development
of interactive programs for Computer Assisted Instruction. Professor Sherman
brought to all of his work a catching enthusiasm and dedication.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar for his many contributions
to the University by naming him Professor Emeritus of Physics.
E. Stasheff    EDWARD     STASHEFF, Professor of Speech       Communication   and
Retirement  Theatre, whose field was radio and television, has retired from the faculty as
of July 1, 1978, after twenty six years service to The University of Michigan.
He joined the faculty in 1952 as an Associate Professor and was promoted to
Professor in 1958.
Born in New York City, he was first a high school teacher and then an
educational radio broadcaster for the New York schools. He became active
in television in its earliest years when he joined CBS-TV in 1945 as an
educational consultant. Later he served WPIX-TV as a program specialist
and directed drama programs for the ABC-TV network.
Although he taught a wide range of courses, Professor Stasheff's specialty was television production and direction. Three books on this subject,
which became standard texts, and more than forty articles established him
as a national figure; the quality of his students, who found positions in
stations, networks, and universities around the country further enhanced
his reputation.
Throughout his career he continued to be an innovator in the television
field. While on leave, he served for a year as a Program Associate for
National Educational Television in its beginning years in 1957-58, and again
while on leave in 1965-66 he went to Israel to help that nation establish a
television service. He returned to Israel on two other occasions between
academic years to conduct training sessions and served on international committees dealing with educational television. He has also been a consultant
and given lectures in a number of other countries.
In 1968 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by Eastern
Michigan University for his contributions as a teacher, writer, and specialist
in television in both this country and abroad.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his contributions
to this University and his field by naming him Professor Emeritus of Speech
Communication and Theatre.

ERNEST A. H. WOODMAN, Assistant Professor of Natural Resources,
has retired from active faculty status as of June 30, 1978, after a most productive career as a teacher and administrator.
A native of Massachusetts, he took undergraduate studies at the University of Alabama and The University of Michigan and received his M.B.A.
at The George Washington University in 1963. He served with the U.S. Army
as a colonel in the American, European, and Far Eastern theaters from 1940
until his retirement in 1966. During 1957-61, he served as Professor and
Chairman of the Department of Military Science at The University of Michigan. Upon retirement from the U.S. Army, he joined the School of Natural
Resources as an Assistant Professor in the Forestry Program and Assistant
to the Dean.
Professor Woodman taught a forest fire ecology course which was very
popular with the students. He served the School in the Assistant to the Dean
post representing the School of Natural Resources on the University's Admissions Board, Assistant and Associate Deans Committee, Advanced Classification Committee, Diving Safety Committee, Student Activities Board,
Community College Advisory Committee, and Scholarship Selection Committee for ROTC. He also held the positions of Liaison Representative with
the Development of Academic Opportunities Group and of Chairman of the
University Relations Committee. He is a member of the Victors Club and
the President's Club.
The Regents now salute Ernest A. H. Woodman for his dedicated service
by naming him Assistant Professor Emeritus of Natural Resources.

Retirement


VII. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported to the Regents the death of
Richard K. Beardsley, Professor of Anthropology and Director
of the Center of Japanese Studies. The following memorial statement was adopted:
It is with deep regret that the Regents learned of the death of Richard
K. Beardsley, Professor of Anthropology and Director of the Center for
Japanese Studies, on Friday, June 9, 1978, at the University Hospital. Professor Beardsley's untimely death at the age of 59 was a great shock to his
colleagues and students, and leaves a profound gap in the ranks of Michigan's
distinguished faculty in Japanese studies.
Co-author of several books on the culture of Japan, Professor Beardsley
specialized in the anthropology of the Far East and had carried out extensive
field work and other research in Japan. In such works as Village Japan,
Twelve Doors to Japan, and Japanese Culture: Its Development and Characteristics, along with many research publications, he wrote of the history
and politics of Japan and its changing social patterns. He was a figure of
national and international reputation in the field of Japanese studies.
Born December 16, 1918 in Cripple Creek, Colorado, Professor Beardsley
received the Bachelor of Arts degree in 1939 and the Ph.D. degree in 1947,
both from the University of California at Berkeley. After teaching briefly
at the University of Minnesota, he joined the Michigan faculty in 1947 as
instructor in the Department of Anthropology. He was thus the first of
several younger faculty members in various academic disciplines who had
major interests in Japan and became the core faculty of the Center for
Japanese Studies, which had been established in that year. He first became
Director of the University's Center for Japanese Studies in 1961, a post he
held several times, and in which he was serving at the time of his death. He
served as Acting Chairman of the Department of Anthropology in 1971-72.
Professor Beardsley's war service included 23 months' service overseas
as Navy language officer in Hawaii, Guam, Iwo Jima, and China.
His anthropological research took him several times to Japan, and also
to Spain, Soviet Central Asia and Mexico. He did work in the archaeology

of western North America early in his career and retained a keen interest in
archaeology and ethnographic art throughout his life. In Japan he helped
set up the Center for Japanese Studies field station in Okayama in 1950-51
and served as its director for two years while studying Japanese village life.
He also served as adviser at the Second U.S.-Japan Conference on Educational and Cultural Interchange held in Washington, D.C., in 1963.
He was a member of Sigma Xi, Phi Beta Kappa, American Ethnological Society, Association for Asian Studies, American Association for the
Advancement of Science, Far Eastern Prehistory Association, American
Association of University Professors, American Anthropological Association,
Society for American Archaeology, Michigan Academy of Science, Arts and
Letters, The University of Michigan Science Research Club, and The University of Michigan Research Club. He served as trustee and continental
editor for the Council on Old World Archaeology, President of the Far
Eastern Prehistory Association, American Branch, and Director of the
Association for Asian Studies.
He was one of the first faculty members to carry his knowledge to the
wider community through the University of Michigan Television Center,
having done several programs dealing with Asia. He also had been active in
the Project on Asian Studies in Education. He worked tirelessly on behalf of
Michigan's East Asian Capital Campaign, particularly among Japanese
donors. He was widely known and respected in Japanese academic and
public circles and was very effective in making Michigan known in the
Japanese corporate and industrial world.
Professor Beardsley's interests included folk and tribal art and the
theory of culture change. At the time of his death, he was working on a
book based on a revisit to the Japanese community he studied 25 years ago
in preparation for his book, Village Japan.
Professor Beardsley was well known for his warmth and kindliness and
his gentle, balanced disposition. His calm, reasonable outlook helped his
colleagues and students weather more than one crisis, and his loss is deeply
felt by a host of friends. Among the distinguished members of the profession
who did their Ph.D. work at Michigan under Professor Beardsley's direction
are Nancy Gonzales, Vice Chancellor of the University of Maryland, and
Edward Norbeck, Chairman of the Department of Anthropology of Rice
University.
The Regents join the entire University community in extending deepest
sympathies to his family.

Mall Project,
UM-Dearborn,
Loan and Security
Agreements


Vice-President Brinkerhoff explained the resolution for the
two term loan and security agreements for financing the UMDearborn Mall project. He said it was more desirable to separate
the two loans in order to protect the University's allowable margin
between that which the student would pay under student loans
and that which the University would pay the bank.
Regent Nederlander inquired as to whether the University
would continue to increase its student loan funds by this method.
Mr. Brinkerhoff responded in the affirmative and explained
that the University of Michigan is involved in the Michigan
insured student loan program, which means that in the event of
payment default the University would be covered.
Regent Roach observed that the amount of student loan funds
the University is receiving from the State is declining. With the
unavoidable increases in tuition, more funds are needed to provide
financial aid to students. The University ought to provide loans
to students who are unable to secure the necessary aid through
other means. The loan agreement is ideal because there is little
risk involved and essentially it pays for itself.
Regent Baker said he was supportive of the observation that
any student should have access to a loan. He asked what restrictions were placed on this loan program. Did it involve providing
parental income statements?
Vice-President Shapiro responded that there is no means test
on the University loan program, but the financial aid office makes
an assessment of family support, if any, scholarship support, job
support, and so forth to determine a student's needs.
Regent Roach said that income test is used only when the
Federal Government provides for the interest on the loan. By

assessing the need of each applicant for financial aid, the legitimacy of the request can be determined.
Regent Baker indicated that the University should consider
specific regulations to prevent abuse of the program.
Regent Dunn moved to approve the revised project budget
for the UM-Dearborn Mall project of $5,700,000 and to adopt
the resolution providing for borrowing of funds and approval of
the two term loan agreements with Ann Arbor Bank and Trust
Company. Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The resolution follows and the loan agreement appears as Appendix A to these minutes.
RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN AUTHORIZING (1) THE BORROWING OF FUNDS
FOR THE PROVIDING OF A UNIVERSITY MALL AT THE
DEARBORN CAMPUS AND (2) THE BORROWING OF
STUDENT LOAN FUNDS
WHEREAS, in order to properly serve the needs of students attending
the University of Michigan, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the
terms "Regents" and "University" hereinafter refer to the Regents or the
University or both as the context permits or requires), by resolution adopted
June 16, 1978, determined and by this resolution confirms that it is necessary
and advisable to construct, equip and furnish the University Mall and remodel buildings containing activities to be transferred to the University Mall
(the "Project") on the campus of the University of Michigan-Dearborn.
The University Mall is more particularly described as follows:
An approximately 84,000 gross square feet building (net assignable area of 63,387 square feet), located near the center of
campus, of two-story height, including skylit single story,
mezzanine and two-story sections and utilizing steel frame and
face brick, aluminum panel and glass exterior wall construction,
to be used for diagonal pedestrian mall, bookstore, commercial
leased areas, offices and classrooms;
WHEREAS, it is anticipated that the costs incidental to construction
and to the furnishing and equipping of the Project, as set forth in the
approved Project budget, will be $5,775,000; and
WHEREAS, in the opinion of the Regents it is necessary and expedient
that it borrow by means of a commercial bank loan the sum of $5,700,000
to be used by it, together with other funds available in paying costs incidental to the construction and to furnishing and equipping of the Project;
and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of their constitutional duties and in order
to properly serve the needs of students attending the University, the Regents
determine it is necessary and advisable that additional funds be obtained
by the University and made available for loans to students to assist them in
defraying their costs of attending the University of Michigan; and
WHEREAS, in the opinion of the Regents it is necessary and expedient
that it borrow by means of a commercial bank loan the sum of $1,500,000
to be used by it, together with other funds available, to provide student
loan funds which may be borrowed from the University by students attending the University; and




30


JULY MEETING, 1978


WHEREAS, the Project and student loans will be for the benefit of all
students attending the University; and
WHEREAS, there has been submitted for consideration of the Regents
proposed Term Loan and Security Agreements (the "Agreements") and
Promissory Notes (the "Notes") whereby the sums of $5,700,000 and
$1,500,000, respectively may be borrowed from ANN ARBOR BANK AND
TRUST COMPANY (the "Bank"), Ann Arbor, Michigan a State banking
corporation.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Regents borrow
for such purposes the total sum of $7,200,000 from the Bank upon the terms
and conditions more fully set forth in the Agreements. The repayment of
the loans is to be secured by a pledge of and payable out of Student Fees
or in the case of the $1,500,000 Note, the Student Loan Repayments, as
defined in the Agreements. The Regents also reserve the right to use from
Funds Legally Available Therefor, as defined in the Agreements for the
purpose of paying principal and interest on the loans; and
Be it further resolved that the Regents will cause to be segregated and
allocated from the fees charged and collected from students attending the
University of Michigan, or in the case of the $1,500,000 Note, the Student
Loan Repayments, for so long as any portion of the principal or interest on
the respective Notes shall remain unpaid, amounts, respectively, sufficient to
pay said installments of principal and interest on the Notes as they fall due
as provided in the Agreements. The Regents further covenant and agree that
they will cause to be charged and will use their best efforts to cause to be
collected from students attending the University of Michigan, fees sufficient
in amounts to meet its obligations under the Agreements; and
Be it further resolved that the Agreements attached hereto and the
Notes attached thereto are hereby approved, and
Be it further resolved that James F. Brinkerhoff, Vice-President of the
Regents, and Richard L. Kennedy, its Secretary, be and they are hereby
authorized, empowered, and directed in the name of the Regents and as its
corporate act and deed to execute and enter into the Agreements and Notes
in the amounts of $5,700,000 and $1,500,000, respectively, to the Bank,
substantially in the form as those submitted herewith, and to execute the
other documents and to take the other actions required by the Agreements;
and
Be it further resolved that the said officers be and they hereby are
authorized, empowered and directed for and in the name of the Regents and
as its corporate act and deed to make, consent to, and agree to any changes
in the terms and conditions of the Agreements and Notes which they may
deem necessary, expedient, and proper prior to or at the time of execution
of the Agreements and Notes, but no such amendment shall change the
provisions therein for the amounts to be borrowed, the interest to be paid
thereon, the payments required to be made, or the security pledged; provided, however, nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting the
right of said officers to alter or change the date of issue of said Notes and
the date of the Agreements; and
Be it further resolved that the said officers, in the execution of said
Agreements and Notes, shall not pledge the credit of or create any liability
on the part of the State of Michigan, the Regents, or any member of this
Board, or any of their successors, other than to pledge or commit the
Student Fees, or in the case of the $1,500,000 Note, the Student Loan
Repayments, and Funds Legally Available Therefor, as provided in the
Agreements, respectively; and
Be it further resolved that should it develop that James F. Brinkerhoff,
Vice-President of the Regents, through illness, absence, or otherwise, be




JULY MEETING, 1978


31


unable to perform the acts he is herein authorized, empowered and directed
to perform, then in that case, Richard L. Kennedy, Secretary of the Regents,
is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to perform any and all acts
and deeds herein authorized and directed to be performed by said James F.
Brinkerhoff, and any action so taken by said Richard L. Kennedy shall be as
binding on the Regents as if performed by said James F. Brinkerhoff; and
Be it further resolved that should it develop that Richard L. Kennedy,
Secretary of the Regents, through illness, absence, or otherwise, be unable
to perform the acts he is herein authorized, empowered and directed to perform, then in that case, Chandler W. Matthews, Controller of the Regents,
is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to perform any and all acts
and deeds herein authorized and directed to be performed by the said
Richard L. Kennedy, and any action so taken by said Chandler W. Matthews
shall be as binding on the Regents as if performed by the said Richard L.
Kennedy.
Be it further resolved that the said officers are authorized, if they so
desire, to sign said Agreements and Notes and any other documents required
by the Agreement as J. F. Brinkerhoff, R. L. Kennedy, or C. W. Matthews,
respectively.
Regent Baker moved authorization to apply for funds under        HUD Loan
the Housing and Urban Development, College Housing Loan Pro-         Program
gram. Regent Waters seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The Regents received a report on an appropriation from      the   Renovations for
State Fire Marshall's office to the University to correct safety     Fire Safety
deficiencies at the Health Service Building and the Children's
Psychiatric Hospital.
A report, requested by the Regents, on methods of receiving       Bid Procedures
bids for construction projects was submitted for their information.   epor
The Regents received a report outlining the actions required      State Building
for University projects to be acquired and constructed by the        Procedures
State Building Authority.
The Regents received a report on the progress of the renova-      Hospital
Renovation
tions of the 7th level of University Hospital.                       Progress
Regent Nederlander moved to approve proceeding with the          Hospital
renovation of the Dietetics Department of University Hospital,       Approved
as recommended. Regent Waters seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve proceeding with the
renovation and expansion of the Pulmonary Division Laboratory.
Regent Waters seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Dunn moved to accept the offer to purchase from the        H. F. Weber
University 40 acres of land in Powell Township, Marquette            Estate
County, from the Helen F. Weber estate, subject to a reservation
of the mineral rights. Regent Roach seconded the motion and it
was adopted.
With respect to the request to lease certain lands in Marquette
County from the Helen F. Weber estate for mining purposes,




32


JULY MEETING, 1978


Regent Nederlander indicated that a long-term lease might encourage stockpiling of the land rather than exploration. He suggested that a covenant be added to the lease stating the company's
intention to commence exploration within a reasonable time.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff stated that one of the key aspects
of the agreement is the escalation of the advance royalty which
provides incentive for exploration. He said it would not be very
economical for the company to lease the land and not explore.
Regent Nederlander then moved to authorize the University
to renegotiate the proposal to include an affirmative covenant
which would commit the lessee to develop the rights. Regent
Baker seconded the motion and it was adopted with Regent Laro
abstaining because of a potential conflict of interest.
Real Property  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the request to sell certain
property on Broadway Street in Ann Arbor.
Regent Nederlander commented that it might be advisable to
add some deed restrictions on the property to eliminate the possibility of undesirable tenants.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff responded that it was possible to
do that, however, it must be done before the appraisal occurs.
Regent Baker suggested entering into a reasonable lease
agreement with the potential buyers to allow them to utilize the
property. This would enable the University to control the property
and forego the possibility of lowering its value.
Regent Roach moved authorization to proceed with the appraisal and sale of the property, subject to terms to be approved
by the Regents at a subsequent meeting. Regent Dunn seconded
the motion.
Regent Roach commented that if the University has no conceivable future need for this property, then it would be better to
turn the property into a productive asset by getting it back on
the tax roles of the City of Ann Arbor.
Regent Brown indicated that the owner of the adjacent
property should be contacted to ascertain their interest in the
property.
The motion made by Regent Roach and seconded by Regent
Dunn was adopted with the inclusion of exploring the suggested
alternatives.
Governmental  Regent Laro moved to authorize the University to invoke
Invked governmental immunity as a defense of a medical malpractice
case (Emily E. Justice - Davey Shepard Justice), and of a lawsuit
against the University (Nabil Farha). Regent Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted.




JULY MEETING, 1978


33


Regent Dunn moved to approve the request to negotiate with  Hospital Planning
Studies, funds for
banks or other financial institutions to finance the cost of hospital  ues
planning studies. Regent Laro seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Regent Laro moved concurrence in awarding contracts to the  Library and
Learning
low bidders contingent upon release of funds by the Department Resources
of Management and Budget and the State Administrative Board  Buildiro
for the UM-Dearborn Library and Learning Resources Building.
Regent Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Baker moved to authorize Chancellor Moran, UM-  Physical
Education
Flint, to sign a grant letter from the Mott Foundation, dated  Facility, Flint
June 16, 1978, offering $6 million for the construction of a physical education facility on the Flint campus. Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Chancellor Moran explained that the formal transfer of rights
to Mott Community College will be brought back to the Regents
as a recommendation when the conditions for making the transfer,
as stipulated in the grant letter, have been met.
X. OTHER
Regent Nederlander moved to authorize the Vice-President for Hospital
Academic Affairs and the Vice-President and Chief Financial Rnproednts
Officer, with the endorsement of the Hospital Executive Board, to
take interim action to fill positions of Controller and Financial
Officer, an Associate Director for Hospital and Professional
Services, and an Administrator of the Psychiatric Hospitals, subject to confirming action by the Board of Regents in September.
Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
President Fleming reviewed the discussion of the Michigan  aSAFee
Assessment
Student Assembly fee assessment which occurred on Thursday.  sses
He said that he incorporated various suggestions and wrote a new
draft for consideration by the Regents. Mr. Daane, University
Counsel, Mr. Arnson, MSA president, and Mr. Rose and Mr.
Teich, legal aid attorneys have reviewed the resolution and are in
agreement that is an acceptable solution to the problem. He asked
that the Regents review the document and comment upon it.
Regent Roach stated that the new draft contains the substance of the comments during the previous discussion. In order
to avoid the interpretation that the Regents were incorporating
by reference the referenda the students conducted and to address
this issue again when students were on campus, he would like to
offer an amendment to the resolution.
Regent Roach then moved to amend the first sentence to read:
"That the Regents assess and collect for MSA a fee of $2.92 for




34


JULY MEETING, 1978


the fall and winter terms of 1978-79, subject to the following
conditions:"
Eric Arnson, President of MSA, indicated that student elections are held in April, therefore, it would be impossible to bring
the matter to the Regents before May when the students leave
the campus. He suggested extending the term to one full year,
thereby making it possible to renew the issue with the Regents in
September.
President Fleming commented that this would not present a
problem.
Regents Brown and Nederlander concurred that the contract
should extend to a full year. Even though the issue would be
considered again next summer, student reaction would be known
before that.
Regent Baker asked if there were any other fees placed by
MSA on the students in addition to the proposed fee. He received
a negative response.
Regent Roach moved that the resolution should be amended
to read: "That the Regents assess and collect for MSA a fee of
$2.92 per term starting in the Fall of 1978 through term IIIB
of 1979, subject to the following conditions:" Regent Waters
seconded the motion.
Regent Baker commented that all of the observations made
the previous day were not incorporated in the amendment. There
was no indication of making the fee non-mandatory, nor was there
an indication of incorporating the legal service structure into the
University administration.
He expressed his confidence in the present MSA officers, the
legal aid administrators, and the lawyers, but said that student
government changes and that confidence may become substantially less. In the University system there is an advisory relationship between student government, the administration and the
Regents of which he is supportive. He said that he sometimes
votes for and sometimes against what is perceived to be the
student interest, but at all times he votes for what he believes to
be the best interest of the University.
In continuing, Regent Baker said that this proposed fee represents a considerable amount of money which could be used for
an attack against the University, or some of the institutions that
make up this society, by a bureaucracy seeking to protect its
existence. In addition, this fee would add almost one percent to
the educational process. If it is, in fact, important to the University to provide this service, it could be incorporated into the
University system rather than delegated to outsiders whose long



JULY MEETING, 1978


35


term interests in the University are not necessarily the same as
the Board of Regents.
Regent Baker stated that he has always been opposed to
compulsory fees, especially when only a small percentage of the
entire student body has voted for it. He then moved to amend
the motion to assess the fee in a voluntary way. Regent Laro
seconded the motion for the purpose of further discussion.
Regent Brown commented that the students were provided an
opportunity to vote on this issue. The election took place at a
time when students were on campus. It is the students' privilege
as to whether they will participate in an election, however, those
students who did not vote must accept the responsibility of their
failure to do so. Of those who did vote on this issue, the MSA
fee assessment received an overwhelming majority in favor of it.
There is no evidence that those who did not vote are opposed to
it. Furthermore, if the Regents chose to accept some votes the
students make and do not accept others, the purpose of student
government and student elections is a travesty. The students have
demonstrated their interests and concerns in a responsible, democratic, and peaceful way, and the Board should encourage this
and accept their decision.
Regent Baker stated that it is the Board of Regents' prerogative to agree or disagree with student election results. The cost of
an education is already too high, and this added assessment will
contribute to further escalation. He indicated that his concerns
were for efficient management of this University; cost reduction
avenues must be considered.
Regent Roach stated that the Regents have already set a
precedent of assessing mandatory fees. There is a mandatory fee
in the housing contract and school and college student governments are supported in this manner. Present funding of MSA is
the only student government that gives students a choice. The
University is trying to provide impetus for the strengthening of
the central student government and the University encouraged
their constitutional reform. In view of the precedent already set
and the fact that this is a legitimate student function, he was
persuaded that the mandatory fee is in order.
Regent Nederlander commented that he has always viewed a
student vote in an advisory capacity and not necessarily something that the Regents must agree to. However, student government can be considered as part of their training, and they ought
to have fees to do this. These are legitimate concerns that the
Board of Regents have, such as the purpose for which they spend
their money. Students ought not to get involved in lobbying
activities which would cause problems for the University, or to
bring actions against the University. Whether the University pro



36


JULY MEETING, 1978


vides the funds, or the students are assessed directly, student
government council should be supported.
Regent Laro agreed that those services should be provided,
and that the mandatory provision should remain at this time with
future review to determine a different funding mechanism, if
necessary.
President Fleming called for the vote on Regent Baker's motion which placed the fee assessment on a non-mandatory basis.
The motion failed with Regents Brown, Dunn, Laro, Nederlander,
Power, and Roach voting no.
Regent Baker then moved that the Board of Regents direct
the administration to establish within the Office of General Counsel a division which would provide these legal services to the
student body of the University of Michigan and the cost of this
activity be underwritten as an administrative cost of the University. The motion failed for lack of a second.
President Fleming then called for the vote on Regent Roach's
original motion to approve the basic document as amended and
seconded by Regent Waters. It was adopted with Regent Baker
voting no. The resolution follows:
That the Regents assess and collect for Michigan Student
Assembly a fee of $2.92 per term starting in the Fall of 1978
through term IIIB of 1979, subject to the following conditions:
1. That the Campus Legal Aid Office purchase malpractice insurance naming the University as an additional insured party.
2. That the Campus Legal Aid Office agree to indemnify the
University for any litigation costs the University might sustain as a result of suits objecting to the collection of such
mandatory fee.
3. That the Campus Legal Aid Office serve only students; that
it not engage in any lobbying activities.
4. That no part of the mandatory fee collection allocated to
MSA be used, directly or indirectly, to initiate or cause to
be initiated, proceedings, concerted actions, or suits against
The University of Michigan, or its Regents, employees or
agents acting in their representative capacities.
5. That accountability procedures be worked out with the
Office of the Vice President for Student Services. Such procedures shall include, but not be limited to: (1) annual
audit; (2) annual reporting of activities of the Legal Aid
Office; and (3) the depositing and disbursement of funds
through the Student Organizational Services Business Office.
6. That no part of the mandatory fee collection allocated to
MSA shall be paid to or used in support of activities which




JULY MEETING, 1978


37


threaten the tax status of The University of Michigan under
the terms of Section 501 (c) (3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code.
That in the event of the violation of any of the above conditions the University cease forthwith to assess and collect said fees.
Regent Baker moved to direct the administration to study the
alternative of providing legal services to the student body of the
University of Michigan. Regent Laro seconded the motion.
Regent Nederlander indicated that the whole issue should be
reviewed in its totality next spring after the legal aid office has
had some experience. Alternatives should be brought up at that
time for consideration.
Regent Waters commented that he saw no need for further
study unless the students decide to have a legal system under the
administration. He said that if some student needs are not being
met under the present system, additional counsel can be provided
along with the proposed system.
Regent Baker said he would withdraw the motion and Regent
Laro his second.
Regent Nederlander indicated that when this issue is reviewed
next spring, consideration of establishing within the Office of General Counsel legal aid to students be included along with other
alternatives.
Regent Waters moved to approve the proposal to drop the  Degree Dropped
B.S. Applied Mathematics Degree in the College of Engineering, Einollege of
as recommended. Regent Dunn seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Regent Power moved to approve membership in the Inter- Membership,
University Center for Japanese Language Study. Regent Waters Approved

derived therefrom.
Section 5
Allocation of Student Loan Repayments, Student Fees
The University covenants and agrees that it will from time to time
allocate out of the collections of Student Loan Repayments amounts sufficient, when combined with Funds Legally Available Therefor, to pay installments of the principal and interest on the Note as they fall due.
Except as otherwise provided in this agreement, such Student Loan
Repayments are pledged solely and only for the payment of the principal of
and interest on the Note, and the University covenants and agrees that it
will use and apply such Student Loan Repayments for said purpose so that
said principal and interest will be paid promptly when due. Such Student
Loan Repayments shall be applied first to pay interest on the Note as the
same becomes due and thereafter shall be applied on and used to pay the
principal of the Note as the same becomes due.
The University further covenants and agrees that in the event Student
Loan Repayments are not received in amounts and at times sufficient to
assure payment of the installments of the principal and interest on the Note
as they fall due, it will from time to time allocate out of the collections of
Student Fees, amounts sufficient, when combined with the Student Loan
Repayments or other Funds Legally Available Therefor in the possession of
the University which it may appropriate for that purpose, to pay the installments of the principal and interest on the Note as they fall due.
The University reserves the right to use any Funds Legally Available
Therefor for the purpose of paying principal or interest on the Note.
So long as the installments of principal and interest on the Note are
paid when due, the University may in its discretion allocate excess funds
generated from Student Loan Repayments and Student Fees to such other
lawful purposes of the University as are consistent with the requirements of
Section 4 of this Agreement and the Agreements relating to Parity Obligations of the University.

Creation of a Lien Thereon and the Pledge Thereof

Michigan in amounts sufficient to provide annual sums equal to at least two
hundred per cent (200%) of the maximum future annual debt service requirements on all Parity Obligations. The pledge of Student Fees hereby
shall constitute and be a first lien or charge against the Student Fees, which
shall be of equal standing with lien or charge thereon made with respect to

with any additional Parity Obligations to be incurred, as authorized by

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1978
The Regents met at 2:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Laro, Nederlander, Power, Roach, and Waters. Chancellors
Goodall and Moran and Vice-Presidents Shapiro, Brinkerhoff,
Radock, Overberger, Johnson and Vice-President and Secretary
Kennedy also were present.
President Fleming called the meeting to order and said that President Fleming
by consent of the Regents the order of the agenda would be  Retirement
altered so that he could make the following statement:
"In December of 1978 I shall be eligible for early retirement
from the University. Accordingly, I have during the past year
talked with the Regents about my desire to retire in 1979. This is
consistent with my oft-repeated statement that universities benefit
from periodic changes in leadership.
"Initially, I had planned to retire next summer, or perhaps
September 1, whichever date was most convenient for the University and my successor. However, since my wife and I wish to
continue in some other assignment, we have had to consider other
positions as they occur. Among the other opportunities that have
been presented to us is a proposal that I become president of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting in Washington, D.C. To do
so requires that I take the position in January 1979. The Regents
have been kind enough to consent to my departure at that time,
and I am advised that the Board of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting acted on the proposed appointment today. We find
public radio and television an exciting field.
"Though Sally and I have been unswerving in our conviction
that it would be well for the University to enter on a period of
new leadership, we would not want to pretend that the decision
to leave the University and Ann Arbor has been easy for us. We
have great affection and respect for both the University and the
city. We own a home here and we hope, after a few years in
Washington, D.C., to return here to live. In the interim, we hope
to be here often. The Regents, the faculty, the staff, the students,
and the community have been enormously kind to us. And The
University of Michigan is, and will continue to be, one of the
49




50


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


great universities of the world. We shall always consider ourselves
a part of it.
"The Regents have laid careful plans for finding my successor
and I am sure they will have the cooperation of the entire academic
community in that undertaking.
"There are many things to be done this Fall, and I shall in
no way reduce my efforts to see that they are done. In the interval
between my departure and the naming of a successor, I shall want
to be helpful in every way possible. Beyond that time, I shall
always be pleased to be of assistance when this seems desirable."
Statement by  Mrs. Fleming then added the following statement:
Mrs. Fleming
"I think I should add my thoughts to Bob's that it has been
a very difficult decision to make because The University of Michigan in all aspects has been tremendously good to both of us. It
is very difficult to leave Ann Arbor. The Regents, the faculty,
students, our friends both on campus and in the community have
opened their arms to us and I feel-we both feel-very much at
home here.
"Mr. Fleming has said that we have felt that the time was
right, and I think that he is the right man at the right time for
the job that has been offered to him in Washington. These opportunities do not come by all the time, and I think that he needs a
challenge, and he will do an excellent job for them.
"We are very grateful to the University and, we are very sorry
to leave you, but we will be here eventually again."
Statement by  Regent Nederlander then said, "Mr. President and Sally, on
Regent
Nederlander behalf of the Regents we would like to make this statement. Then
when I am finished the individual Regents want to say something."
"President Fleming communicated to each of us his desire to
resign as President of The University of Michigan. Notwithstanding our individual entreaties to him to continue in his present post,
we respect, honor and accept his decision to resign in January,
1979. He has given eleven years of outstanding, dedicated and
exemplary service to the university community, and we are most
grateful.
"The Regents have each reviewed and studied the proceedings
of the special committee on selection of a president created in
1966 and the history of that process. The Regents have determined
that the selection of the next president will be accomplished in
substantially the same manner as in 1966-67. The responsibility
for a presidential appointment is vested by the Constitution of
the State of Michigan in the Board of Regents. This duty cannot
be delegated. The final choice will be made by the Board of
Regents.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978

"The Regents welcome suggestions from the faculty, students
and alumni in this most important undertaking. It is contemplated
that committees of faculty, students and alumni will be invited
to be formed for this purpose. The Regents will also be open
to suggestions from the entire university community, the people
of Michigan and any individual having an interest in The University of Michigan.
"This statement has been circulated among the entire Board
of Regents, and represents the consensus of the Regents' opinions.
"As a result of the foregoing, the Regents hereby adopt the
following:
RESOLVED, THAT                                                       Presidential
Selection
(a) A special committee on selection of a president consisting of  Committee
Regents Deane Baker, Paul W. Brown, Gerald R. Dunn, David Laro, Robert  Established
E. Nederlander, Sarah Goddard Power, Thomas A. Roach and James L.
Waters, or the successor in office of each such person, be and is hereby
established.
(b) The function of this Committee, to be known as Selection Committee, shall be to consider all matters in connection with selecting a president.
It shall receive suggestions as to candidates and arrange for interviews with
selected candidates and the making of recommendations as to the appointment of a president to the Board of Regents at the appropriate time.
(c) The Chairman of the Committee shall be Robert E. Nederlander.
(d)  In connection with the appointment of a president, the Board of
Regents invites the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs to
appoint a representative committee of not more than fifteen members. The
Board of Regents also invites the Michigan Student Assembly to select a
representative committee of not more than ten members and the Board of
Directors of the Alumni Association to appoint a similar committee of not
more than ten members. These committees shall suggest future University
needs and the names of candidates.
(e) The Board of Regents also invites suggestions from the entire
University community, the people of Michigan, and any individual having
an interest in The University of Michigan.
(f) The Selection Committee shall have the power and authority to
take such steps and perform such acts as may be necessary or proper in
carrying out its assignment.
(g) Allan F. Smith is hereby designated as Acting President of the
University to take office upon the effective date of the resignation of Robben
Fleming.
The above resolution was seconded by Regent Dunn and
unanimously adopted.
Individual Regents then commented as follows:
Regent Waters:                                                       Regents
I have enjoyed my relationship and serving on the Board with       Comments
Bob and Sally. They will be dearly missed by the Board of




52


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


Regents and the University. Over the past my wife and I have
had the opportunity to travel with Bob and Sally to a few places
where there were other university presidents and their wives,
and I have always felt, and so has Nancy, that they were by far
the best that we have ever seen. At times it looked as if the Board
was rubber stamping a lot of the President's decisions, and I think
the reason for that is that Bob has always had the best interest of
the University in mind, and his decisions and recommendations
have been reasonable and easy to support. The few times that
I did disagree with him, I always knew that whatever decisions
were made it was in the best interest of the University as well as
the State of Michigan. I am sure he is going to do a good job in
Washington. I wish you and Sally the best of luck.
Regent Laro:
Mr. President, when I first was appointed to this Board several
years ago, I looked forward to the opportunity of serving this
University and of being of any help I could to it. I did not realize
then, because I did not know you both as well as I do now, really
how enriching the opportunity would be for me to have the opportunity to work with you. I know that one of the things that this
University certainly stands for is the teaching of higher education
in its finest manner and that is best exemplified by your careful
guidance to this Board. You have inspired not only the faculty
and the students but you have inspired the Regents to do a better
job. On several occasions I have been in your home with other
guests and dignitaries and with heads of state, and I have observed
the great respect which you have been given by others all over
the country and around the world. Your recent trip to South Africa
is only another example of the kind of recognition that the world
gives you for the job that you have done at this University. We
have only the greatest affection for you. I personally thank you
for the enjoyment of being able to serve with you.
Regent Power:
Mr. President, I have heard your statement with deep personal
regret. The nation and the Public Broadcasting Corporation will
be the beneficiaries of the many talents that you have exercised
with discretion and devotion on behalf of this University during
the past decade. There is, however, one matter, Mr. President, to
which I feel incumbent to address myself briefly, and that is the timing of the assumption of your new duties. Allow me to point out that
the football season opens this Saturday. Only in recent months, sir,
have I detected in you a small but increasing, tentative but




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


53


encouraging, acknowledgment of my ability to grasp some of
the obvious intricacies of football, and that, Mr. President, in
the words of a great eighteenth century philosopher, puts air
under my track shoes. Under your patient guidance I have come to
understand that the matter of our hospital replacement is at heart
a veer formation with a quarterback draw attached. That our
long revered financial policy, taking it out of interest, is essentially
a buck lateral series. That our faculty search committee process
is, in fact, a delayed screen pass. And that the matter of historical
designation of part of our campus is similar to an over-shifted
nose guard led, semi-zone, five-two defense. With personal sadness,
and God knows, some despair, Mr. President, I must acknowledge
that your wise and long suffering instruction to me will soon end.
However, Mr. President, to do credit to the faith you have had
in me, I shall continue in all further matters brought before the
Regents to attempt to throw set shots, past the short stop as we
drive from the red line for a four point touchdown.
Rgent Roach:
Mr. President, we have been singularly fortunate these last
eleven years to have at Michigan the finest University President
in the United States, and Sally has been the finest wife of a
President of any university in the United States. The task you
leave us-replacing you-is an immense one. But, one thing you
have taught us is the importance of consultative leadership, and
the importance of the involvement of the University community
as a whole. We will be ever in your debt for the service you have
given this University.
Regent Baker:
Mr. President: The University of Michigan has been fortunate
over the years to have benefitted from the exemplary leadership
of outstanding Presidents. Certainly, Bob, the quality of your
leadership ranks high among the other great Presidents of the
University. There have been both good and difficult times during
your tenure, as the bruises and the scars dimly show, but they
are there-from the difficult times in the '60's, the war, student
unrest, and all of those dramatic events which the University has
endured. They were also times of inflation, sagging legislative
financial support, and federal indifference. Nevertheless, you resolved or brought into proper perspective, all of these problems
as they affect the University. You exercised leadership in a fair
manner, an honest manner, and in a reasonable manner, and more
importantly, you made progress in every area of building a great




54


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


University. In spite of your usual gentleness you were a "tough
guy" when you needed to be, you did the job and you did it right.
You led this University forward and upward, towards new horizons, through the recruitment of excellent faculty, administrators
and staff, in intellectual pursuit, in teaching, in public service, and
in research, not only within the state-wide arena, but nationally
and internationally. You leave the University a better place than
when you came. For the people of Michigan we thank you and
we wish you and Sally well.
Regent Brown:
Mr. President, like many here I am saddened that you are
leaving. I came on the Board shortly after you became president,
and in the experiences of the past eight years, I have always found
your ways to be considerate, polite, and moral. I have learned a
great deal about reasonable ways to make decisions on many
important matters, not only for the University, but concerning life
in general. I had some hope that you might stay here until retirement, and if you chose to retire soon, you would have an opportunity to work on your golf game so we could have a little better
competition. I guess that will have to wait for another five or six
years. So, on behalf of my wife and myself and the people of the
State of Michigan, I want to thank you for your service to the
University. It is a better place having had you both here. I certainly wish you good luck, and good fortune in your new position
which I know you will find challenging and interesting. They are
fortunate in having someone of your caliber and your qualities
to direct that establishment for the next several years. Sorry to
see you go.
Regent Dunn:
Mr. President and Sally, you, Regent Nederlander and I have
been around here a long time. The past years have been good
years. I think the University, our country, and our State are better
places today as a result of some of the decisions that were made
under your leadership. I am sorry, personally, to see both of you
leave. I wish you well, but I want you to know that between now
and December I will be working on a toast for you that would be
most appropriate on some of our lighter moments that we have
had the past nine years. I hate to see you leave.
Hospital  President Fleming reviewed the hospital replacement project.
Plan emenrt He said that there was no disagreement among the Governor, the
Legislators, and the accrediting agencies of the need to replace




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


55


the old main hospital which is now obsolete. The two basic
problems are the size of the replacement unit and the cost.
The size of the unit is dependent on such factors as the proportions of tertiary care versus primary care; length of patient stay
in the hospital; percent of occupancy; future demographics, and
the market situation. Another factor to be considered is that
University Hospital is an educational facility, therefore, a significant amount of space is required to provide clinical programs
for the health science schools. Professional studies recently completed will assist in determining the actual size hospital to be
constructed.
Inflation has escalated the original estimated cost of construction of $140 million to $276 million by 1983. A solution to this
problem must be resolved before final plans on the type and size
of the structure can be determined.
Because health care is costly, the State and Federal Governments have placed substantial restrictions on health care facilities.
The State of Michigan Legislature recently passed a law placing
a moratorium on hospital construction costs if a notice of intent
has not been submitted by early October. Since there will not
be a meeting of the Board of Regents before that time, it is
important that the recommendation, as it appears in the agenda,
be approved at this meeting. The project will not be reviewed
unless it has the initial approval of the Regents.
Following discussion, Regent Laro moved to authorize the
University to file a notice of intent with the State of Michigan
to apply for a Certificate of Need for the hospital replacement
and to otherwise approve the other elements of the project outlined in the September report. Regent Dunn seconded the motion
and it was adopted.
Mr. Larry Tolley and Mr. Bill Johnston, President and Vice- Family Housing
President of Rackham Student Government respectively, stated  Rates
that they had formed an ad hoc committee to study the housing
budget which had been provided by the Housing Office. After
careful study, the committee felt that there were excessive costs
in certain areas, therefore, were recommending a 7.9% increase
in family rates retroactive to July 1 at which time a regentally
approved 13% increase took effect.
Mr. Robert Hughes, Director of University Housing, commented that a survey by a consulting firm engaged by the Housing
Office had recommended a greater increase than that proposed
last February by Housing. Renovations and utilities will cost
more than estimated by the ad hoc committee. The whole housing
system is based on the fact that one generation of students pays
for improvements and new facilities for the next generation.




56


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


Public Comments


The Regents felt that the discrepancies in the data of the
Housing Office and the Ad Hoc Committee warranted further
review. Therefore, more information will be presented to the
Regents in October.
The Regents then heard comments from Mike Synk, Michael
O'Connor, Gina Tonge, Tom Clinton, and Scott Reit concerning
the dining hall consolidation. Associate Dean Richard W. Morshead, UM-Dearborn, spoke on University administrative organization, and Mitchell Kaminski spoke on Medical School tuition
rates.
President Fleming then announced that there would not be
a meeting at 8:00 P.M. The financial aid report would be discussed
on Friday.
The meeting was adjourned.

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of eight faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted.
S. J. Axelrod   SOLOMON J. AXELROD, M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Medical Care
Retirement Organization has retired from active faculty status as of August 31, 1978,
after a distinguished career as scholar and teacher in the field of Medical
Care.
Dr. Axelrod's undergraduate studies were completed at Dartmouth
College; he then entered Medical School at Jefferson Medical College and
received his M.D. degree in 1938. After an internship at Philadelphia General
Hospital and a fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Axelrod
began a career in Public Health.
From 1941 through 1943, Dr. Axelrod served as Medical Officer in the
Tennessee State Department of Health. Between 1943 and 1949, he was a
commissioned officer in the United States Public Health Service serving as
Venereal Disease Control Officer, Chief Medical Officer in the War Food
Administration, and later, as Rural Health Consultant.
Following this employment, Dr. Axelrod attended The University of
Michigan School of Public Health where he earned his M.P.H. degree in
1949. Upon graduation, Dr. Axelrod joined the School of Public Health
faculty as a Resident Lecturer. He was appointed Associate Professor in 1952
and promoted to Professor in 1955. From 1959 to 1970, he served both as
Director of the Bureau of Health Economics, and, after it was established
in 1965, Chairman of the Department of Medical Care Organization.
After his resignation as Chairman of the Department, Dr. Axelrod
continued as a teaching member of the Department. He carried the major
responsibility for the basic course in Medical Care Organization which forms
a part of the core curriculum of the School's M.H.S.A. program.
Dr. Axelrod was awarded a Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award
by the University in 1974 in recognition of his accomplishments as a teacher
and scholar and of the significant influence he has exerted in the health
care field on a national level. His role in the University is exemplified by his
having served on the search committee for the current Presiden of the
University and for the current Dean of the School of Public Health.
Dr. Axelrod's contribution to the field of Medical Care Organization and
the esteem with which he is held by colleagues were recognized at the
Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association in 1976 when the
Medical Care Section of that organization sponsored "A Night with Sy
Axelrod" and in 1977 when the Black Caucus of Health Workers honored
Dr. Axelrod at their annual awards dinner.
Dr. Axelrod's extensive participation in activities directed to national
needs and policy has not meant a lack of concern with local issues, and he
has had a long term interest in the health services in the City of Detroit
Dr. Axelrod has been an advisor to both the prior and present Mayor; he
has been a consultant to a variety of agencies and institutions concerned




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


71


with health services and has made an outstanding contribution to the
improvement of health services for the residents of Detroit.
While Dr. Axelrod is noted for a variety of achievements, his commitment and contribution to the education of persons who will be responsible
for the organization, financing and evaluation of health services in the United
States is preeminent. The education of health personnel committed to a high
quality, accessible health care system who have the ability to direct the
system to this end, has been the dominant theme in his career.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his
dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Medical Care
Organization.
CHARLES     GARDNER     CHILD, III, M.D., Professor of Surgery,     C. G. Child, III
retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1978, after a most productive  Retirement
career in teaching, research, patient care and administration.
Dr. Child was born February 1, 1908, in New York City. He did his
undergraduate work at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut and
received his A.B. degree in 1930. He earned his M.D. degree at Cornell
University Medical College, New York, New York in 1934 and served his
internship, assistant residency, and residency at the New York Hospital
in New York City from 1936 through 1942.
His academic appointments began with the title of Instructor at Cornell
University Medical College, and he progressed through the ranks to Associate
Profesor by 1947. In 1953 he accepted the appointment of Professor and
Chairman of the Department of Surgery, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts. There he remained until he came to Michigan
in 1959. Dr. Child was Chairman of the Department of Surgery, The University of Michigan, from 1959 until a period just prior to his retirement.
At Michigan he was the project director of a 13-year-long, federally
sponsored research grant in support of his work on portal hypertension.
He is recognized as a world authority on portal hypertension and produced
three books on the subject: Hepatic Circulation and Portal Hypertension
(1954); The Liver and Portal Hypertension (1964); and Portal Hypertension as Seen by Seventeen Authorities (1974). He has written more than
140 articles and chapters in books on a variety of surgical subjects. From
1960 to 1966 he was Editor of The Journal of Surgical Research.
During his long and distinguished career, Dr. Child maintained membership in over 30 professional societies. He was admitted as a Fellow of the
American College of Surgeons in 1948 and was a charter member of the
Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences. He served as
Chairman of the Committee on Admissions, the Society of Clinical Surgery
(1968-69); Chairman of the Policy Committee of the National Research
Council's Study of Differences in Postoperative Mortality (1970); Chairman
of the subcommittee on the Quality of Surgical Care of the American
Surgical Association and American College of Surgeons (1970); and Chairman of the American Board of Surgery (1964-65).
In 1972 Dr. Child was honored with a Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award at The University of Michigan. He received a Distinguished
Faculty Award from Cornell Univesrsity in 1974.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physician and health educator
for his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Surgery.
MS. ELIZABETH M. DUSSEAU, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology,      E. MI. Dusseau
has retired from active faculty status as of August 31, 1978, after a long  Retirement
and productive career in public health.
A native of Michigan, Professor Dusseau was born in Monroe on
April 11, 1911. She attended The University of Michigan concentrating on
bacteriology and was awarded an A.B. in 1933. Her first position after gradu



72


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


ation was as a case worker with the Monroe County Emergency Relief
Administration. She continued in that position until 1937 when she was
hired as a laboratory technician at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Monroe.
In 1940, she returned to The University of Michigan to work on an M.S.P.H.
degree in public health laboratory practice. In 1942 when she completed her
degree, she joined Drs. Lowell T. Coggeshall and Richard J. Porter in the
new U-M School of Public Health as a research assistant working on their
studies of malaria. In 1943, she was promoted to Chief Technician under
Dr. Porter.
Over the years, Ms. Dusseau played a progressively more important role
in Dr. Porter's research and in assisting in the teaching of parasitology. Her
participation in the teaching of the laboratory course in parasitology led to
her appointment as an Instructor in Epidemiology in 1966. By 1973, when
she was promoted to Assistant Professor, she had assumed virtually complete
responsibility for the teaching of Epidemiology 531. She was a very skillful
and conscientious teacher. Her work was technically sound and always well
received by students. In addition to formal classroom teaching, she provided
extensive consultation to doctoral students in immunology and parasitology.
As Dr. Porter's collaborator in his research on parasitology and immunology, Professor Dusseau was co-author of many of his scientific
publications. She also engaged in essentially independent research on evidence
of parasites in fossilized fecal specimens from caves and in material from
remote Indian populations in South America. She provided considerable
service to units of the Medical Center by assisting in the laboratory diagnosis
of parasitic infections.
Professor Dusseau was active in many professional organizations including Women of the Faculty and the Women's Research Club. Her interest
led to the appointment of an Affirmative Action for Women Committee in
the Department of Epidemiology well before a similar committee on a
School-wide basis was formed. She served as Chairperson of the Department's committee.
In recognition of a long and able career as a devoted teacher and
researcher in public health, the Regents designate Elizabeth M. Dusseau as
Assistant Professor Emeritus of Epidemiology.
W. W. Hunter      WOODROW W. HUNTER, Professor of Education, retired from active
Retirement faculty status at The University of Michigan on August 31, 1978.
Professor Hunter has been a member of the University community for
forty-five years, first as a student and later as a distinguished faculty member
and administrator. Having previously earned the A.B. and M.A. degrees here,
he returned to the campus in 1946 after miltiary service in World War II
to become a research assistant in the Institute for Human Adjustment. It
was at that time that he launched his remarkable career in the then emerging
field of social gerontology.
Although that career has taken him to distant points and has brought
him international renown, it is on this campus that his superb talents as a
teacher, researcher, and innovator have been most evident.
Professor Hunter's particular interest has been preretirement education
although he has made major contributions in many aspects of gerontology.
As a pioneer and persistent pacesetter in this area, as well as committed
teacher, trainer, and researcher, he has brought great distinction to this
University. Professor Hunter originated and taught graduate studies in
preretirement education and a seminar in applied research and teaching in
aging. He also developed the University-wide preretirement counseling programs which today give every faculty and staff member an opportunity
to address personally the issues crucial to successful retirement.
Woodrow Hunter has been a leader in state, national, and international
professional societies. He is a fellow of the Section on Psychological and




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


73


Social Sciences of the Gerontological Society, and a member of the Executive
Committee of the Section on Aging of the Adult Education Association of
the USA. He has been awarded the Harry J. Kelly Award for Meritorious
service to Michigan's older people.
As Director of the Program in Preretirement Education for the Institute
of Gerontology, Professor Hunter has headed numerous federally-funded
research and training projects, has provided consultation and training
enabling many other institutions of higher education to develop programs
in aging, and has given expert guidance to state and area planning agencies,
labor unions, industries, public schools, and a wide variety of organizations.
Abroad, he has served as consultant to the governments of Belgium and
Great Britain, led the first National Conference in Retirement Educatioin
in Dublin, Ireland, and made presentations at the invitation of the International Center for Social Gerontology. He played a leading role in the
1971 White House Conference on Aging, and is presently serving on the
U.S. Department of Labor Expert Committee on Aging.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his outstanding
service to The University of Michigan, the field of gerontology, and the
broader community by naming him Professor Emeritus of Education.
LILLIAN   G. OSTRAND, Professor of Public Health Nursing in the      L. G. Ostrand
Department of Community Health Programs, has retired from active faculty  Retirement
status as of August 31, 1978, after a most productive career as a teacher and
public health nursing adviser and consultant.
A native of Crystal Falls in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Professor
Ostrand received her Diploma in Nursing from Augustana Hospital in
Chicago in 1937 and immediately entered clinical nursing practice, serving
first as a staff nurse, then as assistant supervisor and as an operating room
supervisor in World War II with the Army Nurse Corps. Following World
War II she began her career as a public health nurse with the Washtenaw
County Health Department while she completed her work for the degree
of Bachelor of Science in Public Health Nursing from this University. In the
early 1950's she was a supervising public health nurse with the Pittsburgh
Department of Public Health and later the assistant chief in education for
that same department. While there she also served as an instructor at
Duquesne University. She returned to Ann Arbor and the School of Public
Health in 1955 where she served as a resident lecturer while completing her
studies for the degree of Master of Public Health which she received in 1957.
She was named Associate Professor of Public Health Nursing in 1969, Program Director of Public Health Nursing in 1973, and Professor of Public
Health Nursing in 1974.
Throughout her career she has been active in professional public health
nursing circles both as an offiicer of professional associations and as a consultant and advisor to many public health nursing agencies. Her publications
reflect her interests in the public health nursing aspects of chronic disease
control.
Her early years of direct patient contact, both in clinical and public
health nursing have been reflected in her continuing concern for patients as
people-whether teaching about them to public health nursing students or
in providing consultation about them to public health agencies.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher for her dedicated
service to The University of Michigan by naming her Professor Emeritus of
Public Health Nursing.
DR. FLOYD A. PEYTON, Professor of Dentistry, retired from active F. A. Peyton
faculty status as of February 28, 1970, after an illustrious career as a teacher  Retirement
and researcher in the School of Dentistry.
Born on February 2, 1905, Dr. Peyton earned the A.B. degree in chem



74


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


istry at Indiana University in 1928 and the M.S. in physical chemistry at
the Michigan College of Mining and Technology the following year. In 1933
he completed at this university the degree Sc.D in dental materials, as one
of the earliest graduates of the program.
In 1935 Dr. Peyton joined the faculty of the Department of Materials
Science as an instructor and in 1941 was promoted to the rank of Assistant
Professor. From 1945 to 1948 he taught on the faculty of the University of
Texas as Professor of Dental Physics. He returned to Michigan in 1948 as
Professor and Chairman of the Department of Materials Science (later to
become Dental Materials), a position he held until June 30, 1969.
As a teacher and researcher, Dr. Peyton has played a major role in the
development of the field of dental materials, both inside and outside the
university. He was instrumental in the development and expansion of the
department's graduate program in dental materials, which under his guidance
achieved the reputation as one of the most respected programs of its kind in
the world. Graduates of Michigan's program are leaders in the field, occupying prominent roles in similar departments of dental schools in this country
and abroad.
Dr. Peyton's contributions outside the University are equally noteworthy. He served as a visiting professor at San Carlos University in Guatemala in 1945, and as a Fulbright Lecturer in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1961, in
New Zealand in 1966, and in India in 1968. He was the first chairman of
the Dental Materials Group of the International Association of Dental Research, and in 1961 he received the prestigious Wilmar Souder Award for
outstanding and meritorious dental research. Since 1968 he has served as a
consultant to the Pan American Health Organization.
Respected and admired by colleagues and students alike, Dr. Peyton
has exerted a profound influence in his field as a teacher and dental researcher.
The Regents salute this distinguished scientist and educator for his
dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Dentistry.
R. J. Porter    DR. RICHARD J. PORTER, Professor of Protozoology, has retired
Retirement from active faculty status as of June 30, 1978, after thirty-seven years as a
teacher of parasitology and tropical diseases. Dr. Porter has the distinction
of having served longer on the School of Public Health faculty than any
other person.
Dr. Porter was born in Swampscott, Massachusetts on October 22, 1913.
He attended Harvard University for two years and then completed his
undergraduate training at the University of Virginia, receiving his B.A. from
that school in 1935 and his M.A. in 1936. He then spent five years at the
University of Chicago where he was awarded the Ph.D. degree in 1941.
Immediately thereafter, Dr. Porter joined the faculty of the University of
Michigan's School of Public Health which was then being established.
Dr. Porter's first appointment was as Instructor of Epidemiology. In
addition to teaching, he joined Dr. Lowell T. Coggeshall in research on
malaria which was then being supported by a defense contract from the
Office of Scientific Research and Development. When a separate Department
of Tropical Diseases was established in 1944, under the chairmanship of
Dr. Coggeshall, Dr. Porter was promoted to Assistant Professor of Protozoology. In 1947, when Dr. Coggeshall left the University, Tropical Diseases
was reunited with the Department of Epidemiology and Dr. Porter assumed
primary responsibiliy for teaching and research in parasitology and tropical
diseases. In that year, he was promoted to Associate Professor at Protozoology, and he became a full Professor in 1954. Over the years, the scope
of Dr. Porter's research interests broadened to include basic immunology
and the mechanics of antibody formation. Dr. Porter is the author of
numerous scientific publications.
In 1970, Dr. Porter was appointed to the newly created position of




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


75


Assistant Dean for Curriculum for the School of Public Health and assumed
primary responsibility for reorganizing and supervising the teaching of the
School's core curriculum. Dr. Porter had always been an imaginative and
effective teacher, and he had extended his influence beyond his own classrooms by serving as a member or Chairman of committees responsible for
various phases of the School's curriculum. Because of his background and
personal attributes, he was well qualified to fill this new post. He served as
Assistant Dean until 1976 when he began a program of phased retirement.
In addition to teaching and research, Dr. Porter made significant contributions by serving on a variety of panels both in the School and University and at the national level. He was a member of the Senate Advisory
Committe and the Executive Committe of the School of Public Health. He
was elected Secretary of the Faculty in 1967 serving a three year term. He
was a member of the editorial board of the American Society of Parasitologists and served on various committees of the National Research Council.
Among other activities he served as a member of the Commission on Enteric
Infections of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board.
In recognition of his distinguished career as a public health educator,
the Regents designate Dr. Richard J. Porter as Professor Emeritus of
Protozoology.
HERBERT     T. SCHMALE, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry in the        H. T. Schmale
Department of Psychiatry, retired on August 10, 1978 after a lengthy and  Retirement
productive career as a teacher and practicing psychoanalyst.
A native of Pennsylvania, Dr. Schmale did both his undergraduate and
medical studies at The University of Michigan, from which he received his
M.D. in 1940. Immediately thereafter, he completed a rotating internship
at the University, followed by a psychiatric residency, which he completed
in 1943. Following two and one-half years of military service, he returned
to The University of Michigan in 1946, where he has been affiliated with
the Neuropsychiatric Institute since that time.
He joined the University faculty in February, 1946, as an Instructor.
He became an Assistant Professor in 1948 and was promoted to the level
of Associate Professor in 1951, when he was simultaneously appointed
Chief of the Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic, a position he held with distinction
for many years. In 1966, he was promoted to full Professor of Psychiatry,
an appointment which he held continuously until his recent retirement
furlough.
Dr. Schmale has had a long and productive career in the Department
of Psychiatry. A graduate of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, he
became one of the most knowledgeable and respected analytic training supervisors in the country. In this context, Dr. Schmale has been responsible
over the past three decades for teaching and supervising literally hundreds
of residents and fellows, many of whom are now practicing senior analysts in
their own right.
Dr. Schmale was very active in the late 1950's in developing an analytically-oriented teaching program for our medical students. His advanced
work in the field of psychoanalysis has gained him national acclaim. On the
local and national scene, he has been active in the American Psychoanalytic
Association, the New York Psychoanalytic Society, the Michigan Psychoanalytic Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, to name just a few. Over the years, he has been involved in numerous
Medical School and Hospital Committees, serving for nearly a decade on the
Medical School Curriculum Committee and for six years on its Admissions
Committee.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his thirtytwo years of dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of
Psychiatry.

IX. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Vice-President Shapiro reviewed the detailed general fund
budget for 1978-79 for the Ann Arbor campus. He indicated that
the budget reflects some of the directions the University wishes to
pursue and the policies the University is trying to effect. There has
been significant improvement in funding for book acquisitions for
University Library, and particular effort is being made to address
the pressing need for scientific equipment for both classroom instruction and research.
The general fund allocation to financial aid has been increased
through the tuition grant program for graduate teaching assistants
and research assistants. The general fund contributions to financial
aid are a matter of great concern to the University and will continue to be addressed over the next few years.


Operating Budget
for 1978-79




78


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


Included in the budget is a $950,000 enforced savings item.
How best to meet this will be determined shortly.
Regent Dunn then moved to approve the Operating Budgets
for 1978-79. Regent Waters seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Audit Report  The Regents received the annual audit report of Arthur Young
Annual and Company for 1977-78 for discussion in October.
H. F. Weber  Regent Laro moved to accept the offer to purchase from the
University 40 acres of land in Powell Township, Marquette
County, from the Helen F. Weber estate, subject to a reservation
of the mineral rights. Regent Power seconded the motion and
it was adopted. This action corrects the location of the 40 acres
reported to and approved by the Regents in July.
Regent Nederlander moved to authorize the University to sell
their Y2 undivided interest in 160 acres in Marquette Township,
Marquette County from the Helen F. Weber estate. Regent Roach
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that further negotiations
had taken place concerning the request to lease certain University
lands in Marquette County for mining purposes. He explained the
improvements and recommended approval.
Regent Roach moved to authorize leasing certain lands in
Marquette County from the Helen F. Weber estate to Superior
Oil Company for mining purposes, as recommended. Regent Power
seconded the motion and it was adopted with Regent Laro abstaining because of a potential conflict of interest.
Investments  The Regents received the annual report on investments.
Report
Dining Hail  Mr. Robert Hughes, Director of University Housing, presented
Consolidation
a proposal to consolidate food service in the residence halls. He
said that the Housing Office has considered this action on a
number of occasions as a cost savings device. However, the negative student reaction to the project, and the cost savings at that
time did not seem sufficient to warrant the proposal. Alternatives
such as trucking the food from one building to another, central
preparation of certain items, central kitchens providing food to
the individual building, and convenience foods, have been discused but would not provide significant cost savings.
At this point in time, consolidation would provide considerable
cost savings in labor and energy conservation, and additional
space for student housing. A survey of other institutions has shown
that most schools are already more consolidated than the University and these changes have been accepted by the students
although the first reactions were negative.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


79


After considering a number of ways to implement consolidation, construction of a new facility was preferred. The precise
method of financing the facility would depend on whether an
application for funds to the Federal College Housing Program is
approved.
Regents Brown, Laro and Roach agreed that unless the cost
savings were substantial, they would not be in favor of proceeding
with this project.
Regent Power commented that she is concerned about building
another single purpose facility on campus. She asked if the housing
office has made a long-range study of the total food service operation on campus. All alternatives must be considered, including
the possibility of contracting out the food service.
Mr. Hughes replied that at this point a contract service has
not been considered. He said he is familiar with this type of service
and thinks that the University can do a better and more economical job.
Regent Dunn suggested that consolidation should begin at
West and South Quads. This action would result in immediate
savings for everyone without capital outlay.
Regent Roach then moved to refer action until October at
which time alternative concepts of consolidation will be presented
to the Board. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Regent Roach moved to adopt the following resolution pro- Hospital
viding for the borrowing of funds for paying the cost of University  Studies Resolution
Hospital replacement studies and to approve a Term Loan Agreement with National Bank and Trust Company of Ann Arbor.
Regent Laro seconded the motion and it was adopted. The loan
agreement appears as Appendix B to these minutes.
RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN AUTHORIZING THE BORROWING OF FUNDS
FOR PAYING THE COST OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
REPLACEMENT STUDIES
WHEREAS, the Regents of The University of Michigan (the "Regents"),

to be used by it to pay the cost of the Project; and




80


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


WHEREAS, there has been submitted for consideration of the Regents a
proposed Term Loan and Security Agreement (the "Agreement") and related
Note (the "Note") whereby the sum of $1,000,000.00 may be borrowed from
NATIONAL BANK AND TRUST COMPANY of Ann Arbor, Michigan (the "Bank"),
a national banking association;
Now, THEREFORE, Be It Resolved that the Regents borrow for such
purposes the sum of $1,000,000.00 from the Bank upon the terms and conditions more fully set forth in the Agreement. The loan is to be for a term
of approximately 2y2 years, starting October 2, 1978, at an interest rate of
5.35% per annum. The repayment of the loan is to be secured solely by a
pledge of Total Revenue of the Hospital and Allocated Total Revenue, as
defined in the Agreement. In the event that Total Revenue of the Hospital
is not sufficient to repay said loan, the loan will be paid to the extent necessary from Funds Legally Available Therefor, as defined in the Agreement;
and
Be It Further Resolved that the Regents will cause to be segregated
and allocated from the Total Revenue of the Hospital, for so long as any
portion of the principal or interest on the Note shall remain unpaid, an

keeping services.                                                 Services
Regent Roach moved to appoint the firm of Price Waterhouse     Auditors for
& Company as auditors for the University for 1978-79. Regent      1978-79 Appointed
Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Waters moved to authorize proceeding with the re-       Renovations, Old
modeling of the Old Architecture and Design building, as recommended. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
X. OTHER
The Regents received reports on selected characteristics of    Financial Aid
students receiving financial assistance administered by the Ann Report
Arbor campus, and highlights of the financial aid programs at
Dearborn and Flint for 1976-77.
Regent Waters expressed his concern regarding University      Investments,
investments in corporations, particularly those conducting busi-  Committee
ness in South Africa. He then moved that the Regents direct the
administration to meet with appropriate individuals and groups
to recommend to the Regents at the regular meeting in October
whether the University should have an investment advisory committee on social responsibility and investment policy; if so, what
should be the composition of that committee; whether staff for
the committee should be separate or should these services be
provided by the existing investment office; and whether such a
committee should make recommendations directly to the President
or to the Regents. Regent Brown seconded the motion.
In responding to the question as to whether the committee
would limit their concerns to South African investments or to total
University investments, Regent Waters stated that would be
determined by the recommendation.
Regent Roach commented that this issue was considered last
spring when the question of South African investments was




82


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


addressed. The Senate Advisory Committee on Financial Affairs
also considered it very carefully at that time. Their report contained the following paragraph concerning making institutional
statements in a University setting: "The right to dissent is
precious both to the University and to our society; but this is the
right of the individual member of the university community and
its exercise should in no way compromise the freedom of others.
If the University operates successfully, members of the community should be free to discuss any question or analyze any issue,
no matter how controversial or unpopulair. However, when the
University, acting as a corporate body, adopts a political position
by formal statements of the Regents, or by their official actions,
it runs the risk of impairing its essential role as a neutral forum
for discussion or debate. Such large and dangerous risks should
be taken only in those cases where the University's policies or
practices clearly affect fundamental human rights and liberties."
Regent Roach said that he felt the thrust of the motion in its
general sense is absolutely contrary to what the Senate committee
recommended and contrary to regental action last spring. If other
issues should arise which affects fundamental human rights and
liberties and are broad concerns to the campus community, then
an ad hoc committee would again be appointed to study the issues
and appropriate action would be taken.
President Fleming called for the vote. The motion failed with
Regents Dunn, Laro, Nederlander and Roach voting no.
Affirmative  With respect to Regents Waters' request to consider establishing
President for the position of Vice-President for Affirmative Action, Vice-President Shapiro said that a committee had been studying the issue
and would report to the Regents in October.
Search   The problems concerning the composition of search committees
Committees,
Composition of for vice president, deans, etc. were discussed. Regent Waters asked
that a report be presented to the Regents next month outlining
the problems and possible solutions.
Regents' Meeting  Regent Roach moved to approve the following Regents' meeting schedule for 1979. Regents Nederlander seconded the motion
and it was adopted.

it will be necessary to file letters of intent for a number of projects

letters of intent do not commit the University to embark upon
the project or to follow the general description of the project as
included in the letter, but they must be filed before a certificate
of need can be obtained. Specific program proposals will be presented to the Regents for their approval before a firm commitment
is made.

APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREES
Characterizations by Professor Emeritus Frank Huntley
Conferred August 20, 1978
W. MICHAEL BLUMENTHAL, Adopted American, Business Executive,
Secretary of the United States Treasury.
Born in Germany of Jewish background, Mr. Blumenthal as a boy fled
with his parents from Hitler's oppression and landed in Shanghai. Throughout the Second World War the family lived in a one-room shack under prison
conditions set by the Japanese occupation. Arriving in the United States
at war's end, he subsequently earned from Berkeley and Princeton four
academic degrees, including the Ph.D. He became labor arbitrator for the
State of New Jersey while securing a tenured professorship at Princeton.
Later, making his home in Ann Arbor, he served as chief officer of Michigan's
multinational Bendix Corporation. Here he brought the company to its
highest profits despite some recessional times and set a mark for involving
employees in managerial decisions. In 1963 he was President Kennedy's
special representative, with the rank of Ambassador, for international trade
negotiations, and, not surprisingly, inherits a cabinet position in the present
Administration.
Thus Michael Blumenthal embodies the American dream, rising from
privation to outstanding success in three demanding professions-those of
academia, business, and government service.
A valued friend of our University, he has lent his insight and energy to
those of our academic units that represents his major interests, including
of course the Center for Chinese Studies. We honor ourselves by honoring
with the degree of Doctor of Laws this man of eminence in our community,
the nation, and the world.
STELLA BRUNT OSBORN, Author, Philanthropist, World Stateswoman.
This wise and gracious lady has been claimed as one of their own by
our University, by the State of Michigan, and by the world at large. Twice
an alumna, in 1967 she received our award for "Outstanding Achievement."
Our Bentley Library and its invaluable historical collections have been the
special beneficiaries of her energy, talent, and dedication. As the wife of the
late Governor Chase Osborn and through her many books, she has helped
give our state, from Copper Harbor to Monroe and from St. Joseph to
Detroit, its cultural shape. In prose and poetry she has expressed what it
feels like to be a Michigander, and, since making her winter home in Georgia,
a Southerner too, and above all an American.
It is particularly for her contribution to international relations, however, that our internationally oriented University honors her now. She has
been a pioneer worker in the Atlantic Union on both sides of the ocean,
representing its ideals of peace and freedom as delegate to conferences in
Copenhagen, Paris, Athens, Munich, Rome, Amsterdam, Lisbon, and Madrid.
She is a member of the London Institute of World Affairs, the American
Scandinavian Foundation, and the prestigious Hugo Grotius Foundation,
named after the great seventeenth century Dutch founder of International
Law. For all this and more, last year she was given the first Frank Cyril
James Award for citizen participation in international affairs.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1978


87


Stella Brunt Osborn, we honor you today with the degree Doctor of
Leters for what you have been and are, and at the same time declare our love
for you by echoing John Donne
"No Spring nor Summer beauty hath such grace
As we have seen in one Autumnal face."
HERBERT A. SIMON, Computer Expert, Model Builder, Humanitarian.
Among social scientists there is not a dissenting voice to the proposition
that Mr. Simon is one of the world's most brilliant innovators. A pioneer in
computer technology, he has built such models in the behavioral sciences,
especially in communication, that instead of machines imitating the work of
man, men may well learn from the machine how better to behave. Were
we not beset by problems we would hardly be human-problems of personal
identity, problems between parents and children, management and labor,
administration and faculty, reality and dream. Even the titles of Mr. Simon's
distinguished books ring a litany on the problem of solving human problems:
Administrative Behavior, Public Administration, Models of Man, Organizations, New Science of Management Decision, The Shape of Automation, The
Sciences of the Artificial, Human Problem Solving. Besides writing and lecturing here and abroad, he serves on dozens of committees, often as chairman. One of his most recent appointments was to the Chairmanship of the
National Academy Committee to review the complex aims, means, and
methods of the National Science Foundation, which has been so responsible
for America's world leadership.
Unspoiled by these demands, honors, and he exactitude of his profession,
Mr. Simon remains a modest and loving human being who honors The
University of Michigan today as we honor him with the degree Doctor of
Laws.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1978
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1978
The Regents met at 11:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, and Waters. Chancellor Goodall and VicePresidents Shapiro, Radock, Overberger, Johnson and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regents Laro and
Roach and Vice-President Brinkerhoff were absent.
Mr. Chandler Matthews, Controller of the University, intro- Audit Report
duced Philip Calder from the Arthur Young and Company who
would comment on the completed audit report for the year ending
June 30, 1978.
Mr. Calder discussed the problem still existing at University
Hospital concerning collecting receivables, and suggested that the
hospital administration act promptly to remedy the situation. He
also discussed what the Arthur Young and Company considered
to be a violation of University policy by the Athletic Department
with regard to competitive bidding for renovations at the stadium.
The Regents then adjourned to reconvene at UM-Flint for
continuation of the meeting. Chancellor Moran and Regent Laro
joined the meeting at 2:30 P.M.
Chancellor Moran reviewed for the Regents a status report Public Television
on the public television project at Flint. He stated that all the  U'M-Flint
licenses for public television stations but the Detroit station in the
State of Michigan are owned by Community Colleges or Universities. The Flint metropolitan area and the Thumb area are
virtually unserved by public television. The results of a feasibility
study financed by the Mott Foundation in 1975 indicated that a
strong case could be made for a public television station in the
Flint metropolitan area and that state and federal support would
in all likelihood be available.
Because circumstances at that time were not propitious,
further investigation into the possibilities of UM-Flint developing a TV station was not begun until 1977 when a proposal to two
Flint area foundations requesting funds was submitted. After
receiving approval from the Board of Regents, application was
97




98                OCTOBER MEETING, 1978
made for a construction permit and operating funds from the
State Legislature were sought and obtained. With the private
monies in place and the matching equipment monies from HEW
expected shortly, the project has about reached the point of no
return.
Chancellor Moran described the intended coverage of the
television station and the location of the transmitter. He also explained the revenue sources for the operating costs and equipment
expenditures.
Following discussion of various aspects of the project, Chancellor Moran said that a report on the Federal Grant would be
submitted, along with plans to proceed, to the Regents at the
November meeting.
I. MINUTES

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of one faculty
member. The following was adopted.
M. E. W'egman,    MYRON EZRA WEGMAN, B.A., M.D., M.P.H., Dean Emeritus, John
Retirement G. Searle, Professor of Public Health, and Professor of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, completed eighteen years of distinguished service to
The University of Michigan on October 1, 1978. Appointed Dean of the
School of Public Health and Professor of Public Health in 1960, Professor
Wegman actively led the faculty of that School during a period of significant
expansion and strengthening to where it now is in the forefront of Schools
of Public Health worldwide. Throughout his tenure as Dean, he taught in
the area of International Health, and with appointment to the Medical
School faculty in 1961, regularly held rounds for medical students and
pediatric residents. His resumption of full-time faculty responsibilities allowed
him to strengthen the work of international health and to give needed
leadership to the School-wide program in Preventive Medicine and Public




OCTOBER MEETING, 1978


109


Health. His publications range from basic work in pediatrics to those
focused on the fundamental problems of health policy and administration.
His service to the State, the University, and other bodies has been extensive,
and has included assignments as Chairman of the Governor's Action Committee, President of the Southeastern Michigan Comprehensive Health Planning Coucil, and special advisor to the University on the development of a
comprehensive health plan for faculty and staff of the University.
He continues to be active in public health work at the local, state,
national, and international levels. Starting as a pediatric consultant in Maryland, he served with the New York City Health Department and for eight
years as Secretary-General of the Pan American Health Organization. His
academic career has included appointments with the Yale University School
of Medicine, the Johns Hopkins Schools of Hygiene and Medicine, Cornell
University School of Medicine, Columbia University School of Public Health,
School of Tropical Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico and Chairman
and Professor of Pediatrics of the Louisiana State University School of
Medicine. A member of several medical and professional organizations,
Dr. Wegman has served as President of the American Public Health Association, Chairman of its Executive Board, and Chairman of the Editorial
Boards of the American Journal of Public Health and Pediatrics. He continues to be in demand as a consultant for various public health and related
organizational groups, among them the Pan American Health Organization,
the Resources for the Future, the World Health Organization and is currently serving on the Board of the Pan American Health and Education
Foundation.
His many and distinct contributions to public health and education have
been recognized by his election to honorary membership in the Pediatric
Societies of Equador, Peru and Argentina, his being named City College of
New York Class of 1928 Man of the Year, receiving the Townsend Harris
Medal for outstanding accomplishment from that same institution, the first
winner of the Walter P. Reuther Distinguished Service Award and induction
into the Johns Hopkins University Society of Scholars. In 1967, he was
awarded the Bronfman Prize for excellence in public health by the American
Public Health Association; and in 1974, he received the Sedgwick Medal
for distinguished service in public health from the same association.
Born in New York City, Professor Wegman completed his undergraduate
degree at City College of New York, earned his Doctor of Medicine from the
Yale University School of Medicine, and his Master of Public Health from
the John Hopkins University School of Hygiene. In a career extending over
four decades, as a pediatrician, public health practitioner, teacher, and
scholar, Dr. Wegman has served each of these roles with unusual effectiveness,
dedication, grace and wit.
The Regents now salute this disinguished educator for his outstanding
service to The University of Michigan by naming him the John G. Searle
Emeritus Professor of Public Health and Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics
and Communicable Diseases.
President Fleming commented that Professor Wegman has
been an outstanding citizen of the University over the years. He
has always been willing to help and his ideas have been useful
and constructive. Although he will remain in the community, the
University, by virtue of retirement, loses him as an active member
of the University community.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1978


Financial Report


VII. DEATHS
Vice-President Shapiro reported the deaths of Dorothy Robinson, Associate Professor of Social Work and Burton Baker, Professor of Anatomy. The appropriate memorials will be submitted
to the Regents in November.
IX. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Vice-President Shapiro reviewed the financial report for The
University of Michigan for the year ending June 30, 1978. He
pointed out that the University has fallen behind in funding such
things as equipment, books, and supplies, therefore the expenditures for those items show a significant increase. The plant improvement portion of the budget remains seriously underfunded
because of inadequate support over the past several years.
Regent Nederlander asked if there has been an analysis made
of the positions that have not been filled for economic reasons for
the past several years.


Vice-President Shapiro responded that these figures would be
supplied to the Regents, and he felt there would be the need for
further cutbacks in order to support more adequately those areas
just mentioned.
Audit Report  Regent Baker moved to approve the certified audit report for
1977-78 by Arthur Young and Company. Regent Waters seconded
the motion and it was adopted.


Investments,
Schedule of
Investment Report


The Regents received a schedule of investments for the year
ending June 30, 1978.
The Regents received a report of investments as of June 30,
1978 which reflects the sale of Kraft, Incorporated debentures.


Administration  Regent Baker moved to authorize the renewal of the advance
Building from the investment of working capital fund for the administration
building. Regent Nederlander seconded the motion and it was
adopted.


Health Insnrance
Coverage


Regent Nederlander moved to authorize the University to
increase the University support for Health Insurance coverage,
effective December 1, 1978. Regent Power seconded the motion
and it was adopted.


Renovations  Regent Power moved to approve the renovations to the Chemistry Building as recommended. Regent Nederlander seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
Regent Baker moved to approve proceeding with the renovation of the two elevators which service the Emergency Service
area within University Hospital. Regent Brown seconded the
motion and it was adopted.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1978


111


Regent Nederlander moved authorization to sell 40 acres of Real Property
land from the William H. McClure estate to Steven Gardocki and
C. D. Zeleski subject to the reservation of the mineral rights.
Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The request for authorization to lease Camp Davis land in
Teton County, Wyoming, was deferred until November.
Regent Nederlander moved authorization to invoke the defense  Governmental
Immunity.
of governmental immunity in a medical malpractice case. Regent invoked
Baker seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Chancellor Moran reviewed the site and program planning for Recreational
Facility,
the recreational facility at UM-Flint. He stated that the site, U-I-Flint
which was set by the campus plan in 1972, was rather small for
this building but the proximity to the University Center would be
a great advantage. He said the maximum seating capacity would
be about 2,000 and the building would include three or four classrooms for educational programming in the physical education area.
The Regents expressed their concern that the site was not
adequate for the proposed building, and asked if the architects
and campus planners were all in accord on this particular site for
the recreational facility.
Chancellor Moran responded that the orignal campus planners
had met recently to review the progress on the Flint campus and
still maintained that the proposed site was desirable for the
recreational facility. The planned facility is comparable to the
North Campus facility in Ann Arbor, but would have a lesser total
usage because of the smaller student population. The location
serves a number of purposes; it's proximity to the University
Center, therefore would better serve the student body which is a
commuting body; it does not mar the river view; and it would
form an entry courtyard to the University Center.
Regent Power then commented that it has been her observation
that Chancellor Moran and his colleagues have had a very careful
and thoughtful approach to the special needs of Flint, the University in it, and the student population and moved to approve the
site selection, the budget, and to authorize proceeding with the
design of the recreation building at UM-Flint. Regent Waters
seconded the motion and it was adopted with Regents Baker
and Dunn abstaining.
The Regents then heard comments from Michael Moore, Dan  Public Comments
Kildee, and Steve Stewart concerning South African investments.
Dwight Newman, an AFSCME representative, spoke on the
Housekeeping services at University Hospital. Professor Robert
Heywood, UM-Flint, then addressed remarks concerning the
retirement of President Fleming.
The meeting was adjourned at 5 P.M.




112


OCTOBER MEETING, 1978


FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1978
The Regents met at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Nederlander, Power and Waters. Chancellors Goodall and Moran and
Vice-Presidents Shapiro, Radock, Overberger, Johnson and VicePresident and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent Dunn,
Laro, and Roach, and Vice-President Brinkerhoff were absent.
CESF Report  Professor Edward Gramlich presented the report by the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF). He said
that compared to peer institutions the University's faculty salaries
have fallen behind 4% since 1972; and compared to consumer
prices, faculty salaries have fallen behind by 10 percentage points
over this same interval. Therefore, the committee recommended a
14.5% increase in faculty salaries for 1979-80.
Budget Request  Vice-President Shapiro reviewed the budget request for 1979 -or 197980 80. He indicated that although there was no fundamental disagreement with the recommendation by CESF for a 14.5%  salary
increase, the University was requesting 10.1% because it seemed
more reasonable and attainable to make up part of the lost ground
this year and part of it in subsequent years. The major elements
of the budget request for 1979-80 include compensation; economic
requests, such as utilities, book purchases, instructional equipment; and program revision requests.
President Fleming commented that in the past few years the
University has asked the legislature for what was perceived to
be the demonstrated need in terms of salaries, even though chances
of obtaining that goal were slim. Under the State's present system
of funding, only 60% of the salary request is covered, which means
that the University must depend upon its own resources to pay the
remaining 40%. Obtaining the resources to do this without raising
tuition or cutting back on personnel is a very difficult task. Therefore, the University is asking for a 10.1% salary increase with the
hope of reaching its goal in two or three years.
Vice-President Kennedy commented that the proposed budget
request attempts to be more realistic in terms of availability of
state resources, and takes some cognizance of the fact that the
State has other problems with which to deal. Hopefully, the request would be closer to what the State would recommend for
higher education.
Regent Baker moved to approve the State Operating appropriations request for 1979-80 for Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint.
Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1978


113


Regent Waters moved to approve the capital outlay program  Capital Outlay
revision request for all three campuses for 1979-80, including the  1979-80
Medical campus. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was
adopted.

IX. FINANCE-PROPERTY
The Regents received a report on handicapped parking.
Mr. Norman Herbert, Investment Officer, and Mr. Chandler
Matthews, Controller, reviewed the report prepared to show the
status of University efforts to carry out the Regents' resolution
on the investment policy with respect to companies and banks
doing business in South Africa.
President Fleming commented that following receipt of a letter
from Mr. Dwight Newman, who noted AFSCME's disagreement
with the information reported by the Director of University Hospital regarding the Service Master contract, further study would
be undertaken and reported to the Regents at their November
meeting.
Regent Power moved to approve the discontinuance of the
B.S. (Pharmacy) Degree Program, as recommended. Regent
Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted.

Regent Nederlander then commented that he had circulated Guidelines for
among the Regents certain guidelines for advisory committees to    Advisry Comaommittee to Selection
Committee




116


OCTOBER MEETING, 1978


the Presidential Selection Committee. Ms. Kate Rubin, a Michigan
Student Assembly representative, has requested the opportunity
to speak before the Board before adoption of these guidelines.
Ms. Rubin listed the following student concerns regarding the
advisory committees: the level of student input provided in the
process; communication between the three advisory committees
and the relationship between the three committees and the Board
of Regents; access to all Regental candidate lists; competition
among the three committees resulting from separate committee
meetings; personal access to the candidates by all committees;
access to biographical information and resumes; provision of an
adequate budget to enable students to travel with the Regents to
interview candidates and for long distance telephone calls. The
students feel that personal access to the candidates by all groups
involved in the process is a very crucial issue. The guidelines speak
to some of their concerns but not to all of them. The students
want a sense of what their influence will be before they participate
in the process.
Professor Shaw Livermore, Chairman of SACUA, commented
that many faculty members do believe that some participation in
interviewing is a necessary and integral part of a careful search,
therefore he urged the Regents to consider some role for the
advisory committees in the interviewing process.
Regent Nederlander stated that basically these guidelines have
been submitted in order to begin the whole process. There will be
more guidelines issued in the future to clarify either certain points
that need further clarification or to take care of problems that
arise. The question of interviews presents a very difficult problem.
The Regents feel very strongly about the importance of confidentiality, therefore, initially interviews of candidates will be
conducted by the Regents. There might be a possibility later in
the process for involvement by a member of each committee.
Regent Baker moved to approve the following guidelines for
advisory committees to the Presidential Selection Committee.
Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted:
Guidelines for        GUIDELINES FOR ADVISORY COMMITTEES
Advisory Committees to Presidential  1. Each Advisory Committee may organize itself and meet as often as it
Selection  wishes.
Committee  2. There is no objection to any committees meeting with each other.
3. Each committee is requested to prepare a statement of recommended
future needs of the University and submit such statement by November 10, 1978.
4. All groups in the entire university community, including noninstructional
staff, organized labor, and the public, are also invited to submit in writing
to the Regents Selection Committee by November 10, 1978 what they
consider to be the future needs of the University.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1978


117


5. On or before November 25, 1978, the Regents Selection Committee will
develop the criteria and characteristics desired in a university President,
based upon the needs of the University.
The criteria will be provided to each Advisory Committee and made
available to all groups and organizations.
7. After the criteria have been established, each Advisory Committee is
requested to submit names for preliminary consideration to the Secretary
who will prepare biographical information in standard form (so as to
treat all names alike), and then the name shall be sent to the committee
of origin. That committee would then decide whether to drop the name
or give it further consideration. If the particular committee decides to
give a name further consideration, it would be sent to the Regents Selection Committee which would then distribute the standard form biography
to the chairmen of all committees, but without designaion as to the source
of the recommendation.
8. Besides the Advisory Committees, any group, organization or person may
suggest names to the Regents Selection Committee. The Regents Selection
Committee can then decide whether or not they want to recommend that
name for further consideration and if so, would then send it to the
other committee chairmen.
9. If a name is suggested by the Regents Selection Committee, a biographical sketch will be sent to the chairmen of the three Advisory Committees. In this way, every committee will know the candidates being
considered and the Selection Committee and the Advisory Committees
would begin to have names to study.
10. Procedures should be developed by each Advisory Committee to insure
a limited distribution of biographical material. Because the disclosure of
a person under consideration would injure the viability of a candidate,
a revelation of a name under consideration will be considered a breach
of trust.
11. The Advisory Committees are encouraged to gather supporting evidence
for favored candidates and forward educational articles to the Regents
Selection Committee.
12. The Advisory Committees are not to conduct any interviews. This is the
prerogative of the Regents Selection Committee alone.
13. There shall be no ranking by the Advisory Committees.
14. The three committees are advisory only and the Board of Regents alone
has the power to appoint and cannot share this power.
15. Nothing herein should be considered acceptance of any precondition
established by any of the four Committees. No other arrangement, agreement or understanding exists between the Regents Selection Commitee
and the Faculty Alumni or Student Advisory Committees, other than
those listed herein.
16. The Regents reserve the right to modify, alter or amend any of these
Guidelines, should the Regents deem it necessary.
17. The Regents Selection Committee has established an office at 4010 LSA
Building, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109 (telephone 763-3223 and 763-3224).
Fred Wagman has been appointed Secretary to the Regents Selection
Committee.
Regent Nederlander indicated that all groups in the entire
University community, including the non-instructional staff, labor,
public and otherwise, are also invited to submit to the Presidential
Selection Committee by November 10 what they consider to be
the future needs of the University. He said this is in addition to
the advisory committee, and the Regents hoped that they would
proceed promptly to submit their views by that time.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1978


Hospital  Dr. Jeptha Dalston, Director of University hospital, reported
Replacement Site on the campus master planning study by Albert Kahn Associates
regarding the hospital replacement site. He said that both internal
and external activity is continuing with the faculty committee,
hospital committees, the executive branch of State government,
the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Public
Health, the local health systems agencies and Blue Cross for
further refinement and scope of the project.
Dr. Douglas Sarbach, Director of Planning, Resource and
Development of the Hospital, presented slides focusing on physical
definition of the project and an understanding of its architectural,
engineering and ultimate cost implications. He described and explained different concepts under study. He said the most important
affinities that had to be maintained were the relationship between
inpatient activities, diagnostic and treatment activities and outpatient activities. Office space should relate to all three. It is most
desirable to erect the buildings as quickly as possible in the least
disruptive fashion. Once the move to the new facilities takes place
then the old building would be available for renovation. A more
sharply defined report will be presented to the Regents next
month.
Affirmative  In response to a request by the Regents to study organizational
Action Report procedures of affirmative action at other institutions, Dr. Nellie
Varner, Chairman of the Committee, stated that there seemed to
be no most efficient or effective way of organizing affirmative
action. Primarily, it depends upon the organizational structure
of the institution. The committee felt that the recommendations
in the report would best lend themselves to an effective affirmative
action program at The University of Michigan.
The Regents commended Dr. Varner and Dr. Gwendolyn
Baker for their leadership of the program and were pleased with
their efforts to rectify the inequities that have been present.
President Fleming commented that the report would be discussed further with the Regents after review internally by interested parties. He asked for direction with regard to implementing the recommendations of the report. Since a new president
would be appointed within a year, it might be advisable to allow
that person to appoint an assistant, but it would mean delaying
the appointment.
Regent Waters suggested that the executive officers make a
recommendation to the Regents after the report has been discussed
internally.
Medical Service  Regent Power moved to authorize the revised implementation
Pans schedule for Medical Service Plans in the sections and departments

recommended. Regent Baker seconded the motion and it was

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1978
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1978
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Laro, Nederlander, and Roach. Chancellors Goodall and Moran
and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Overberger, Radock, Shapiro,
and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also were present.
Regents Power and Waters and Vice-President Johnson were
absent.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff and C. Edward Schwartz, Associate  Audit Report
Director and Financial Officer of University Hospital, presented
further background material explaining the status of accounts
receivable at the Hospital. The Regents commented that the report
was helpful in understanding the relationship between accounts
receivable and overall patient care revenues.
Mr. Philip Calder, representing the Arthur Young and Company, commented that progress was being made, but because of
the nature of the problem constant attention must be given to
remedy the situation.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff commented on several points raised
in connection with the Medical Service Plan audit report. He said
that it is now possible for the Medical Service Plan (MSP) billing
service to prorate bills among various services.
Regent Baker expressed his gratitude to the Arthur Young
Company for their service to the University.
Mr. A. B. Hicks, University Auditor, reviewed the six-months
report on University audits. He indicated that he was not satisfied
with the progress being made in certain areas, and would issue
another report to the Regents shortly.
Regent Roach commented that he viewed the internal auditors
as being responsible to the Regents; therefore, they must feel free
to communicate their concerns directly to the Regents.
Regent Dunn stated that the administration should seek
legislation which would remove personnel or security related audit
reports from discussion in a public meeting.


125




126


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1978


President Fleming explained that seeking this legislation was
not to be considered an effort to conceal any wrong doing, but
simply a way to protect an individual or a department from
damaging exposure until an allegation has been proven.
Diniidg Hall  Mr. Robert Hughes, Director of Housing, reviewed his request
for approval of a site and authorization to appoint an architect
for a dining commons for Hill area residence halls which had been
submitted and discussed in October. At that time the Regents
asked for additional information on the financing of the project
and alternatives to the recommended consolidation. Mr. Hughes
said that he now has received preliminary approval of a $4,980,000
loan from HUD to finance this project and energy conservation
programs in the dormitory system. He indicated that this was an
area in which substantial savings could be achieved. If the present
system of serving meals continues, housing costs would most certainly accelerate, thereby adding to the growing problem of keeping overall educational costs within the reach of students and their
families.
Charles Waterhouse, Tom Clinton, Gina Tonge, and Michael
O'Connor, who reside in the residence halls, spoke against consolidation. They felt this would be detrimental to the community
spirit of the dormitories. Students do not want to leave the dormitories for their meals. The savings per student would not be
substantial enough to warrant the inconvenience. They said a
commissary plan, having a central kitchen and trucking meals to
residence halls, would be more acceptable. Another suggestion
involved weekend consolidation rather than total consolidation.
In response to a question concerning security, Mr. Hughes replied that the planned site is heavily traveled now and is well
lighted. No more problems are anticipated than there are now.
The Regents acknowledged the genuine concern of the students
and asked for further analysis of alternatives including cost saving
figures.
Regent Roach suggested that perhaps some concerns the students have could be solved architecturally by having four smaller
(lining rooms in one facility and a covered walkway to the facility.
The Regents then decided to delay action until Friday.
Hospital Organi-  Dr. Jeptha Dalston reviewed the organizational structure of
zation Structure University Hospital.
Hospital  Dr. Douglas Sarbach, Director of Planning, Resource and
Planning Development of the Hospital, reviewed two sites on which tentative plans for the Hospital replacement facility were being considered. He explained the advantages of each and said that a
detailed description of what the University Hospital should be in




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1978


127


the future would be presented to the Regents in December. This
information would then be submitted to the State in January to
apply for a Certificate of Need.
Regent Baker expressed his concerns that the integrity of the
final site be protected; that maximum freedom be afforded the
Regents and the administration for effective use of the site in the
future; and that the circulation pattern not be limited.
Dr. Sarbach stated that at this point the North site configuration was favored because it allows for some logical expansion in
the future.
Dr. Jeptha Dalston reviewed the proposal for an expanded  Burn Center
Burn Center. He stated that the proposal would consolidate into a 
30-bed burn care program the existing ten acute burn care beds at
University Hospital, the fourteen rehabilitation beds at Chelsea
Community Hospital and the six acute care beds at St. Joseph
Mercy Hospital. The facility will provide the comprehensive care
required by the critically burned patient which involves a multidisciplinary team of specially trained personnel. The Burn Center
will also serve the state and the nation as a model facility for
teaching all phases of burn care and for research. He also noted
that the capital involved would be raised by the National Institute
for Burn Medicine in collaboration with the University.
In response to a question from Regent Nederlander concerning
the sources of fund raising, Vice-President Radock said that the
National Institute for Burn Medicine has many of its own sources.
This type of project has wide support throughout the state and
the country. Many constituencies which support this type of
project would not support general University projects. The problem of duplication of fund requests would be solved by careful
monitoring of all requests to foundations and major corporations.
Regent Nederlander stated that it should be understood that
design and construction will not commence until the necessary
funds are on hand or pledges confirmed.
Dr. Dalston commented that Vice-President Brinkerhoff has
made it very clear that the necessary funds must be available
before the project can proceed.
The Regents then discussed the location of the facility. They
agreed that careful attention must be given the placement of the
facility on the site whether it is integrated or independent in
nature.
Regent Roach moved to approve the program for an expanded
Burn Center program with the clear understanding that it is not
the intent of the motion to approve the location or to determine




128


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1978


whether it should be an integrated or independent unit. Regent
Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Public Comments  The Regents heard comments concerning the Michigan Union
report from Larry Pulkownik, Jeff Lebow, Eric Arnson, and Dave
Brownlee. On the whole they agreed with the recommendations of
the report, with the exception of continuing the hotel operation.
Bob Gurss, Janice O'Neal, Jennie Patchen, and Alan Levy
spoke on the question of tenure for Professor Joel Samoff; and
Professors Arthur Schwartz and Thomas Weisskopf commented
upon the question of tenure as a whole.
Marti Bombyk spoke on the Graduate Employees Organization. Larry Tolley and Bill Johnston commented on family housing
rates.
Closed Meeting  Regent Dunn then moved to close the meeting for the purpose
of discussion of applications for the position of personnel director.
These applicants have expressed their wish for a private discussion.
Regent Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted with
Regents Bakers, Brown, Dunn, Laro, Nederlander, and Roach
voting affirmatively.
The meeting was adjourned.
The meeting reconvened at 8:00 P.M.
SACUA    The members of the Senate Advisory Committee on University
Affairs (SACUA) discussed their concerns regarding interview

VII. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported to the Regents the deaths of Guy
Palazzola, Associate Dean of the School of Art and Mary
Reynolds, Professor of Nursing. The following memorial statements were adopted:
G. Palazzola   It is with deep regret that the Regents learned of the death of GUY
Memorial PALAZZOLA, Associate Dean of the School of Art, on October 28, 1978.
St aement    Guy Palazzola was born in Kalamazoo and grew up in Detroit. He
attended the Art School of the Society of Arts and Crafts and received its
diploma in Painting. Subsequently he taught on its faculty and served as
Assistant to the Director before joining the faculty at The University of
Michigan in 1957. He was named Associate Dean in the School of Art in
1975 and carried on extensive television broadcasting which has earned him
an international reputation. His work in this medium carried his views on
art and its techniques to countless thousands across the country in a direct
way which had enormous appeal.
His gifts as a teacher were widely known and his classes in drawing and
painting were regularly oversubscribed. In 1973 he received the University's
Distinguished Achievement Award for outstanding teaching and research.
As a practicing artist Dean Palazzola has been a consistent award winner
since his student days in the late 30's.
His paintings have always been characterized by virtuosity and a compelling sense of the respect he held for the traditional values in composition
and technique. These were qualities which he maintained in his teaching
and which gave him the unique character he possessed as a teacher.
Dean Palazzola worked tirelessly for the improvement of the educational
opportunities for students in the School of Art. The example he set by his




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1978


135


creative work, his lecturing and his own family life set the highest standards
for his students as well as his colleagues. He loved art, teaching and the
School. His place in our esteem and affection has grown more enduring over
the years. The achievements in art and education that he produced will
remain a striking monument to him. In losing Guy Palazzola the University
has lost one of its most articulate spokesmen for the visual arts and one
of its most trusted friends.
The Regents join the entire University community in extending deepest
sympathies to his family.
The Regents of the University acknowledge with deep sorrow the death  M. Reynolds
of MARY REYNOLDS, Professor Emeritus of Nursing, on September 1,       Memorial
1978, at the age of 56.
Born on January 13, 1922 in Albany, New York, Ms. Reynolds attended
Skidmore College before transferring to Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing, where she received a diploma in nursing in 1946.
She received her Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from Russell Sage
College in 1952 and her Master of Science in Education degree from Indiana
University in 1953.
Ms. Reynolds practiced nursing at Northern Westchester Hospital, White
Plains, New York, in the office of Dr. H. J. Hoerling, Valatie, New York,
and at Albany Hospital, Albany, New York, prior to assuming the position
of clinical instructor at Union University School of Nursing, Albany, New
York, in 1949. She became Director of Nursing Education at Mount Sinai
Hospital School of Nursing, Cleveland, Ohio, in 1953. She joined the School
of Nursing faculty in 1957 as Assistant Professor of Nursing and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1962 and to Professor in 1966.
Her colleagues in the School of Nursing long respected Ms. Reynolds as
an excellent teacher of medical-surgical nursing. Her students esteemed her
particularly for her emphasis on the humanistic values as well as the scientific
basis of nursing. She shared her nursing expertise by presenting numerous
papers at professional meetings and through several publications in nursing
journals. She served on many School, University, and professional committees,
always furthering the work of the committees through her thoughtful contributions.
In 1975 in recognition of her contributions to the School of Nursing
and the nursing profession, Ms. Reynolds received the Award for Excellence
in Nursing from the Rho Chapter, Sigma Theta Tau, and the Distinguished
Alumni Award from The University of Michigan Medical Center Alumni
Society.
The Regents now extend their sincerest sympathies to her family and join
the University community in mourning her passing.
President Fleming    reported   the sudden death of Fredrick        F. Davids
Davids, Director of the Department of Safety. He commented that        Death Reported
Mr. Davids helped the University through an extremely difficult
period and was a very good influence on this campus. A great
many students came to regard him as a real and trusted friend
who wanted to help them with their problems. He will be remembered with great affection, and the University owes him a great
deal of thanks for his contributions to the University.

given due consideration by the rate study committee.
Regent Nederlander commended Mr. Larry Tolley and his
Committee for the time and effort involved in bringing these
problems to the attention of the Board of Regents.
Mniochian    The Regents received a report on the Michigan Union. The
subject will be discussed and a recommendation will be presented
to the Regents in December.
Dining Hall  Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the recommendation for
onsolidation a dining commons for the Hill area residence halls. He said that
preserving the characteristics of the individual dining areas; minimizing the problems of security and developing a satisfactory
passageway between the dormitories and the facility would be
given all possible consideration in the architectural design. This is
an area of potential major savings in terms of student costs,
therefore, he recommended positive action.
President Fleming remarked that despite the sincere and
deeply felt opposition to the project by the students he also
recommends approval. Consolidation of the dining areas is feasible
and it will achieve substantial cost savings. The University must
take whatever constructive steps possible to contain the mounting
cost of an education. If a central facility is not constructed, then
remodeling of the existing dormitory kitchens is of top priority.
Regent Brown commented that in such a large institution there
are few places where a community feeling can be created as in
the individual dining rooms. He felt that alternatives should be
more thoroughly explored.
Regent Roach indicated that it was possible that the individual
community problem could be solved architecturally. In view of the
substantial savings to the students involved, it seems advisable
to proceed. He then moved to proceed with the architectural study




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1978

through the design development phase on a thirty-year amortization basis. Regent Nederlander seconded the motion.
Regents Laro and Waters said that they realized the need for
cost savings, and this project would accomplish that need. They
also were aware of the necessity to remodel the kitchens in the
residence halls at a considerable cost if this consolidation did
not take place, but they felt that this was not the time to proceed
with the recommended project.
President Fleming called for the vote. The motion failed with
Regents Roach, Dunn, and Nederlander voting affirmatively and
Regents Brown, Laro and Waters voting in the negative.
Regent Roach then moved to reconsider the vote and then to
table the motion until the December meeting. Regent Laro seconded the motion. The motion failed with Regents Brown, Dunn,
and Waters voting no.
The Regents approved the applications for membership to the  Memberships to
Medical Staff,
medical staff of University Hospital.                     Approved
Vice-President Overberger reviewed in detail a report on re- Research
search expenditures for fiscal 1978. He said that research expendi- Ep1rditures
tures have increased dramatically since 1969, and is probably
attributable to the more aggressive quest for funds on the part of
faculty and staff.
President Fleming indicated that Regent Baker had requested  PIRGIM
that the discussion of a permanent arrangement with the Public
Interest Research Group in Michigan (PIRGIM) be deferred until
the December meeting because he was unable to attend this meeting. However, since registration for next semester is in progress
and the contract with PIRGIM has expired, some action must be
taken at this meeting. He suggested that the present contract be
extended for one term and bring the matter to the Board for discussion in December to decide on a long-term policy.
Regent Dunn then moved to extend the present PIRGIM contract for one term. Regent Waters seconded the motion and it was
adopted with Regent Laro voting no. Regent Laro said that he is
opposed to having the University involved in the collection of
these fees.
President Fleming commented that following the Regents Affirmative
directive, the Executive Officers have discussed the matter of the Action Program
appointment of an Assistant to the President with certain other
official duties to head the affirmative action program. They concluded that given the time delay that would ensue by delaying
the appointment until the President's successor could make the
appointment, it would be in the best interest of the University to
proceed immediately.

Middle Income
Student Assistance
Act, 1978
Public Television
UM-Flint
Presidential
Selection
Committee Guidelines Amended


The Regents received a report on the Middle Income Student
Assistance Act of 1978: Projected funding increase in selected
Federal student assistance programs for The University of Michigan students for 1979-80.
Chancellor Moran reported that the anticipated federal grant
for the Flint television station has been announced. UM-Flint
now has approximately 44% of the operating budget and approximately 50% of the capital. It is now necessary to begin the search
for a manager for the station and to begin construction planning
and to order the equipment for the tower. He said the Regents will
receive a report shortly on the results of this next step.
Regent Nederlander commented that there have been some
questions in connection with the Presidential Selection Committee
and the Guidelines issued. The Guidelines do provide that the
committees can make whatever rules and regulations they wish.
The Guidelines further say that the Regents have no objections
to the committees meeting with each other, and the Presidential
Selection Committee is happy to meet with any of the committees
at any time.
Regent Nederlander then moved to add the following resolution to the Guidelines:
RESOLVED THAT it is the intent of the Regents Guidelines that there be
close Faculty, Alumni and Student involvement somewhere down the line in
the Presidential Selection process.
Regent Dunn seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Roach then read the following statement:
I agree with SACUA communication that the process of appointing a
President of the University should involve continuous communication, participation and consultation between the Regents and the University community. The faculty, student and alumni advisory committees are intended
to be representative bodies which will be the focus of the more formal aspects
of such communication, participation and consultation. Other members of
the University community are not precluded from communicating with the
Regents, nor are the Regents precluded from consultation with anyone.
In the matter of participation, no individual or group has the right or
power to exercise a veto or prior restraint on the Regents' choice. There is
no way of predicting at this time the exact course of the selection process,
particularly in its final stages.
I do not consider the process of selection to be an adversary process,
either between the various University constituencies, or between the Regents
and any of the University constituencies. Rather the process is intended to
be an exercise in consultative decision-making, in an atmosphere of complete intellectual honesty.
I feel strongly that the contribution of any group that politicizes the
process will be of little or no value, and will be counter-productive to the
task at hand.
Regents Brown and Laro agreed with the resolution. They felt
that it is too early to say exactly how joint participation will




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1978

occur, however, they feel it is appropriate that these groups be
represented in the final stages of the search as long as confidentiality prevails.
All the above transactions are by unanimous vote unless otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of October totaled $892.31.
The Regents adjourned to meet on December 14 and 15, 1978.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1978
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1978
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach and Waters, and Vice-Presidents
Brinkerhoff, Overberger, Radock, Shapiro, Johnson, and VicePresident and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regent Laro
was absent.
Professor Marilyn Mason Brown and Professor Donald Sinta School of lut.ic
Search Committee
presented a report on the status of the Search Committee con- for Dean
sidering a new dean for the School of Music.
They indicated that the Committee is striving to find an individual who will provide leadership for the School, sensitivity to
the talents and strengths of the current faculty, dedication to
innovation and new vistas in music education, good management
skills and an appreciation for raising private funds.
They noted that demand for graduates of the Music School
remained strong and enrollment patterns continue strongly.
After discussion, the Regents reminded the Committee that
this initial step in the search was the most important time to
identify and attract qualified minority and women applicants.
The Search Committee must be responsive to the University's
affirmative action goals. In addition, Regent Baker stated the
responsibility of the Committee was to discover the most qualified
applicants for the position.
Vice-President Shapiro commented that Dean Britton, who is
retiring at the end of this year, has done an enormously effective
job for the University.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the report on the Michi- Michigan Union
gan Union submitted to the Regents in November and recommended approval of the resolution to transfer the direction of the
Michigan Union to the Office for Student Services, to initiate a
market survey to determine services perceived as needed, to convert all but twelve of the hotel rooms to student housing, to
approve renovations as outlined in Phase I of the report and to
restructure the fee allocations for the Michigan Union, Michigan
League and North Campus Commons.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1978


President Fleming commented that in discussing the issue of
whether or not to convert the hotel rooms into student housing,
a substantial amount of money would be necessary to renovate
the hotel rooms. It would be inappropriate to finance such
renovations with student fees. Keeping in mind the critical need
for student housing, it seemed the better course of action to recommend that these spaces be converted to dormitory rooms. Also,
students need a variety of opportunities both for recreational
activities and for organizations experience and the Union would
adapt to this very well. The students are enthusiastic about these
reuse concepts and would benefit greatly from them.
Regent Roach mentioned the concern among some alumni that
their privileges as life members of the Union would be diminished
if the hotel operation is converted to student housing. He asked
if this conversion would be irreversible. Mr. Brinkerhoff responded
that converting back to hotel rooms at a later time would not be
precluded.
Regents Baker and Nederlander commented that they were not
convinced that this was the proper use for this building. Although
conversion to student use is very worthy, the central location of
the building makes it ideal for a variety of alternative uses which
ought to be considered.
Vice-President Johnson stated that only a small percentage
of students actually live in University housing. Those not in University housing need a place where they can feel some sense of
identity with the University other than the academic environment.
Regent Power expressed her support for the recommendations
and said her concern centered around the process by which the
space will be assessed.
Since there was reservation among the Regents concerning the
conversion of the hotel operation, Regent Nederlander moved to
approve the use of the Michigan Union for student use, but to
maintain the hotel space until more information has been received.
There was no second to the motion.
Regent Dunn then moved to table the issue for thirty days,
and to direct the Office of Student Services to begin a market
survey to determine what services were needed. Regent Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted with Regents
Power and Roach voting no.
Medical Center  Mr. Roderick Daane, General Counsel, reviewed the lease and
Library, Dearborn resolution documents that will be necessary to execute in order
to provide State Bond funds for construction of the Medical Center
Library and the Dearborn Library.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1978

After discussion and suggested amendments, Mr. Daane indicated that he would bring an amended copy to the Regents for
their approval on Friday.

D. P Cartwright,
Retirement


VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of two faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted.
DORWIN P. CARTWRIGHT, Professor of Psychology and Research
Coordinator in the Research Center for Group Dynamics, retired from active
faculty status as of September 1, 1978, after a distinguished career as researcher, administrator, and teacher.
Born in Iowa, the son of a preacher, Dorwin Cartwright moved often
throughout the country in his early years. He attended Swarthmore College,
earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard University, and spent a postdoctoral period working with Dr. Kurt Lewin at the State University of Iowa.
During World War II, Professor Cartwright joined the Division of
Programs and Surveys in the United States Department of Agriculture
(later the Survey Research Center at The University of Michigan). His
studies of motives for the purchase of war bonds and the effect of bombing
on civilian morale in Germany, were among the first social surveys using
psychological concepts. In 1945, Dr. Cartwright helped Dr. Lewin found the
Research Center for Group Dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Following Dr. Lewin's untimely death in 1946, Professor Cartwright became the Center's director and brought it to The University of
Michigan where it joined the Survey Research Center to create the Institute
for Social Research.
Since 1947, Professor Cartwright has been the intellectual leader of the
Center and a major member of the Institute for Social Research. He, more
than any other person, developed and nurtured group dynamics as a field of
study. His research and writings on the mathematical foundations of group
dynamics, the sources of social power, the nature of group structure, the
causes of risk taking in groups, and many other topics, have won him worldwide recognition. He has been a tireless citizen, serving on countless advisory
and review committees for agencies in the federal government and professional societies.
The Regents now salute this worthy scientist for his dedicated service
by naming him Professor Emeritus of Psychology.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1978

WALTER P. WORK, M.D., Professor of Otorhinolaryngology, will re-   W. P. Work,
tire from active faculty status as of December 31, 1978, after a most dis-  Retirement
tinguished career as a teacher and surgeon.
A native of Pennsylvania, Dr. Work took undergraduate studies at
Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, and The University of Michigan, before
entering Medical School at The University of Michigan from which he received an M.D. degree in 1935. He served an internship and residency in
Otorhinolaryngology at The University of Michigan, completing this phase
of his training in 1939.
From 1939 through 1941, Dr. Work was an Instructor in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at The University of Michigan and then joined
the Stanford University School of Medicine in San Francisco, California as a
Clinical Instructor in Otolaryngology. In 1946, he was promoted to Assistant
Clinical Professor of Otolaryngology at the University of California School
of Medicine, San Francisco, California. From 1942-1946, he served as a major

of California.
In 1961, Walter P. Work was named Professor and Chairman of the
Department of Otorhinolaryngology at The University of Michigan, a position he held until retiring as Chairman June 30, 1977. During his tenure here,
Dr. Work contributed strength and vitality to The University of Michigan
and to the instructional and research programs of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology. He carried the major responsibility for establishing a core
curriculum in Otorhinolaryngology for the Medical School.
From 1961, Dr. Work served as Chairman of the Executive Committee
of the Kresge Hearing Research Institute, working closely in liaison with
the Faculty Building Committee in designing the Kresge Hearing Research
Institute. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the Medical
School, Chairman of the medical staff of the University Hospital, and
recipient of the Galen's Society Faculty Award.
Dr. Work's research interests were in the area of Head and Neck
Surgery, especially salivary gland diseases and cancer of the larynx. He
made many innovative contributions in these areas, and was author of
numerous scientific publications.
Dr. Work has enjoyed a national reputation for excellence and has received a number of honors. Among them are: President of the Society of
University Otolaryngologists; second Vice President of the American College
of Surgeons; President of the American Otological Society; and President
of the American Laryngological, Rhinological, and Otological Society, Inc.
(The Triological Society). He is a member of the American Laryngological
Association and recipient of its highest award, the Newcomb Award. Dr.
Work has served as President of the American Board of Otolaryngology, the
most prestigious and influential body in the field of otolaryngology, having
been responsible for the development and maintenance of training and performance standards in the specialty. Since 1972, he has served as Executive
Secretary of the American Board of Otolaryngology, in charge of the business operations of that Board.
Dr. Work was elected to membership in the Collegium Oto-RhinoLaryngologicum Amicitiae Sacrum, a most renowned international honorary
society. Membership is tendered only to men in the field whose scholarly
achievements have brought international recognition.
Finally, and most importantly, Dr. Work has been a warm, revered

DECEMBER MEETING, 1978


VII. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported to the Regents the deaths of
Burton L. Baker, Professor of Anatomy and Dorothy Robinson,
Professor of Social Work.
B. L. Baker,    The Regents express their heartfelt sorrow at the loss of Professor
Memorial
Statement BURTON L. BAKER, who died on October 14, 1978.
Dr. Baker was born April 2, 1912 in Fife Lake, Michigan. He received
hiss A.B. degree from Kalamazoo College in 1933, his M.S. from Kansas
State College in 1935 and his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1941.
Dr. Baker spent his entire academic career at The University of Michigan
Medical School where he joined the faculty as an Instructor of Anatomy
in 1941, becoming a full Professor in 1952.
During his 37 year tenure, Dr. Baker became a highly respected researcher, teacher and administrator. He published more than 110 scientific
articles in his field of neuroendocrinology and reproductive biology. He was
one of the first investigators to demonstrate, by the use of labeled antibodies,
the presence of reproductive hormones in the pituitary and hypothalamus
and that this part of the brain controls pituitary functions. Dr. Baker was
internationally known and recognized for his important scientific contributions and recently received a "Professor Honoris Causa" from the University
of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.
Dr. Baker was the recipient of the Henry Russel Award in 1947, and in
1977 received the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award. He was twice
elected to the Executive Committee of the Medical School and served continually as Chairman of the Cancer Research Committee for almost twenty
years. He served on the University of Michigan Senate Assembly, on the
Executive Board of the H. H. Rackhom School of Graduate Studies and on
the Advisory Committee of the Dental Research Institute.
Nationally, Dr. Baker was Managing Editor and Associate Editor of the
American Journal of Anatomy and served on the Editorial Committee of
the Endocrine Society. His participation in professional societies included the
American Physiologic Society, the Endocrine Society, the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine, where he was on the Editorial and Publications
Committee for over five years, and further served on the Michigan Section.
Those who were privileged to know Dr. Baker, and there were many
friends, students and colleagues, all have benefited from the example this
great man set. He lived a life of intellectual curiosity which permeated and
influenced those around him. A humble but generous individual, Dr. Baker
sought truth in all his endeavors.
The Regents, honoring his service to his profession, colleagues, and students, now join the entire University community in mourning his death and
extend deepest sympathies to his family.
D. Robinson,    It is with deep regret that the Regents learned of the death of
Memorial DOROTHY ROBINSON of the School of Social Work, on October 3, 1978.
Statement     Dorothy Robinson was born in Detroit and grew up in that city. Upon
completing her college work at Wayne State University, Professor Robinson
took her first social work position with the Wayne County Bureau of Social
Aid. She followed this job with assignments as caseworker with Jewish Social Service of Detroit, Jewish Family Service of Cleveland, and the Veterans
Administration Mental Hygiene Clinic of Cleveland. She came to Ann Arbor
in 1948 to pursue graduate studies in social work at The University of
Michigan. After obtaining the M.S.W. degree, she served as a psychiatric
social worker and casework supervisor at University Hospital. She joined
the faculty of the School of Social Work in 1956.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1978


155


From the time Dorothy Robinson became a faculty member, she was
recognized as an excellent teacher. Students attested to her sound preparation for class presentations and her superior capacity to relate theoretical
knowledge to social work practice issues. She carried a heavy liaison load,
and worked strenuously to integrate class and field learning. Her consultation
to field instructors was highly valued, as she facilitated new services and
placements, and continuously sought to establish more effective field learning
experiences. At the same time, she created opportunities for communication
and exchange of ideas by meeting with students in a variety of settings, most
memorably in her apartment.
Thoughout her career, Professor Robinson contributed a critical perspective gained through practice experience and a long-time investment in
the clinical practice of social work and in mental health programs. She always
treated her clients, her students, and her colleagues with great respect. She
believed in students, in this ability to learn and to succeed. The brightness of
her spirit and her concern for students was a dominant theme in her life at
the School of Social Work.
The Regents join the entire University community in extending deepest
sympathies to her family.

Hospital
Replacement Site


Dr. Douglas Sarbach, Director of Hospital Planning, Resources
and Development, reviewed a progress report and a final review
of the siting question of the hospital replacement project. He ex



DECEMBER MEETING, 1978


157


plained the development of the unit on both the North and East
sites and indicated the North site had emerged as the preferred
location.
Mr. A. Alfred Taubman, Chairman of the Citizens Advisory
Committee of the Hospital replacement project, discussed the
difficulty of the site configurations, the location of the existing
structures with respect to the teaching and research facilities on
the Medical campus. He indicated that the Advisory Committee
had studied each site keeping in mind the many factors involved
and came to the conclusion that the North site was best and would
provide some cost savings over the East site.
Regent Power asked how the movement of the thousands of
people in the Medical Center every day would be handled?
Mr. Taubman replied that the five categories to be accommodated were the patients, the visitors, the students, the research
staff, and the faculty. The site would have to be planned in such a
way that the overlap in the movement patterns generated by these
different categories are minimized. The North site seems to accomplish this best.
Regent Power commented further that care must be taken to
insure sufficient flexibility to allow for future development.
Mr. Roy Johnson, of Johnson, Johnson & Roy, pointed out
that by fixing an edge on the North side the option for future
growth to the East would be retained.
Regent Baker noted that while Mr. Taubman had to leave the
meeting, he would wish him to know of the Regents appreciation
for his comments and indeed the time he has spent in studying
this project as head of the Citizens Advisory Committee.
Regent Baker then stated that while he and Mr. Taubman
would reach many of the same conclusions about the hospital planning, there were some differences that bear attention.
There is certainly a consensus of the need for a new hospital.
That facility will clearly require an enormous financial investment
on the part of the State and others, perhaps the largest in the
State's history. The decisions concerning the site, design and construction of the hospital will set land use policy for the entire
70 acre Medical Center site for the next several decades. Regent
Baker then reviewed the history of the Regents hospital planning
process for the proposed site. The Regents first considered the
alternatives of developing a medical campus on the site separate
from the present University Hospital. After careful consideration
they elected to construct the new hospital on the present medical
campus. The existing site chosen by the Regents presented extremely difficult site problems in terms of transportation, utilities,




158


DECEMBER MEETING, 1978


topography, available land, proposed design, as well as other
factors. The two basic questions to be considered, analyzed and
decided upon were:
(1) What kind of physical facility in a programmatic sense
was required to best meet the needs of the people of Michigan
and the University?
(2) Where should the building be placed on the available site
considering all legitimate site planning factors. Upon concluding
the most practical site for the new hospital was on the present
medical campus, the Regents elected to purchase the St. Joseph
Mercy Hospital and extend the existing medical campus to provide
substantially more land area for medical center growth over the
long period of time. The hospital planning group was charged
by the Regents with accomplishing the following goals:
(1) The development of a programmatic study of hospital
needs and use to be used as an outline for hospital design, and
(2) The creation of a site plan to implement the programmatic
study and assure proper use of the overall medical center land
and the proper siting of the new hospital.
The next hurdle to the development of the hospital site was
the formulation of a transportation and traffic plan working with
UATS to resolve the access and circulation problems which were
of concern for the University, the State of Michigan, Washtenaw
County and the City of Ann Arbor. A compromise plan was approved after substantial discussion between UATS and the
University.
Regent Baker said that one must always examine the complicated planning and construction project such as the proposed
University Hospital in the longer view. A primary consideration
was to see that both the programmatic plan and overall site plan
would provide the best potential and maximum use of both the
facility and the site over a long period of time; such a plan would
not be unlike the central campus master plan which has been used
time and time again as a guide in the planning and construction
for the central campus. The University does not now have such
a master plan for the medical campus and Regent Baker believes
it is essential to the planning and construction process in order
that the best utilization of the available 70 acres of land can be
attained. Regent Baker expressed disappointment that the study
had not been completed prior to the recommendation for the final
siting of the proposed hospital, particularly since the Regents
had requested such a plan on several occasions and were of the
opinion such a plan had been prepared. This is not to say that a
significant amount of planning has not been done, but the need
for a master plan is essential as evidenced, for example, by the




DECEMBER MEETING, 1978


159


present difficulty in trying to locate the proposed new Burn Center
in the hospital campus.
There appears to be two logical sites for the new hospital
called the North site and the East site respectively, with Mr. Taubman and the planners preferring the North option. Regent Baker
indicated that he is not particularly disposed to either site, except
that the East site seems to provide maximum flexibility of overall
land use over the longer term. He is concerned that decision on
either site in the absence of a master plan may be premature and
is conscious of the time constraints the University faces with
regard to the formal application to the various public authorities
for construction of the hospital.
There is a possibility, however, that planning funds may be
available from the State which would allow the University to carry
forward a master plan study and, at the same time, proceed with
the planning of the facility. To that end, he indicated he would
be willing, at the appropriate time, to move that the University
go forward with the plan suggested by Dr. Dalston so long as
there is also a commitment to develop a total master site plan
and keep open the option of the East site.
Regent Baker asked Mr. Johnson for his comments to this as
a next step.
Mr. Johnson agreed that master planning continues to need
refinement and testing as the present plans go forward.
In further discussion it was generally agreed that the East
site option could be held open even though for the purposes of the
Certificate of Need a preference for the North site is indicated.
Dr. Dalston pointed out that this could be done but reminded
the Regents that the further the project moves along the costlier
it would be to move back to develop the site on the East.
Regent Dunn moved that the North site be considered the
primary location for the hospital replacement. Regent Waters
seconded the motion and it was adopted with Regent Baker
voting no.
Regent Roach moved to authorize the preparation of a master
plan for the long-term use of the Medical Campus. Regent Power
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Mr. Robert Forman, Executive Director of the Alumni Association, introduced Mr. Clarence Roy of the architectural firm
of Johnson, Johnson and Roy, who would address the question
Regent Brown had raised on Thursday concerning selection of an
architect outside the State of Michigan for the Alumni Building.

Mr. Roy commented that the Washington firm had been the
unanimous choice of the Committee because of their response to
the sensitivity to the configuration of the site and the surrounding
buildings, and their experience in dealing with these problems.
Regent Roach agreed with Regent Brown that the University
should support state businesses, but the Alumni Association is a
national and international organization and the building would
not be constructed with state funds. He then moved to approve
the Washington firm as recommended. Regent Power seconded
the motion. The motion failed with Regents Brown, Dunn and
Waters voting no and Regent Laro abstaining.
Regent Brown suggested that the Alumni Association reconsider and submit further comments at the January meeting.

humanity. In the turbulence of the 1960's it was his grace under pressure
that committed the University to mark new goals in the struggle toward
educational opportunity for all. In the financial turmoil of the 1970's it




DECEMBER MEETING, 1978


165


was his tough minded commitment to excellence that preserved and expanded
the University's standing as one of the pre-eminent educational institutions
of this country and of the world. In the swirling mix of challenge and
opportunity that confronted this enormous University every day, it was
his willingness to listen intently, think clearly and act decisively that brought
every part of the University-faculty, students, staff and administrationtogether.
Most of all, he brought to The University of Michigan a sense of values
made concrete in the acts and choices of every day. Quietly, modestly, yet
masterfully he articulated in his presidency the great goals of that process
of education to which we are dedicated:
"You go to a great school not so much for knowledge as for arts and
habits; for the habit of attention, for the art of expression, for the art of
assuming at moment's notice a new intellectual position, for the art of entering quickly into another person's thoughts, for the habit of submitting to
censure and refutation, for the art of indicating assent or dissent in graduated
terms, for the habit of regarding minute points of accuracy, for the art of
working out what is possible in a given time, for taste, for discrimination,
for mental courage and mental soberness."*
* William Johnson Cory, a master at Eton, during the 19th century.
Robben Fleming made these things real and present every day of his
presidency.
We salute, praise, honor and thank him and his works here. We wish
him well in his coming endeavors, and we hold for him a very special place
in our hearts and minds.
Regent Baker moved to approve the appointment of Allan F.        A. F. Smith,
Smith as Interim President effective January 2, 1979, and until a    Interim President
permanent President is appointed. Regent Brown seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
All the above transactions are by unanimous vote unless otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of November totaled $1,719.40.
The Regents adjourned to meet on January 18 and 19, 1979.

APPENDIX A
OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS
Conferred November 18, 1978
RONALD KOTULAK, Bachelor of Arts in Journalish, Class of 1959;
science writer and science editor of the Chicago Tribune.
You are a representative of an elite-a critically important elite, the
translators of the meaning of developments in science for the rest of us;
the bridge between those who are at the cutting edge of discovery and those
to whom the things they learn will someday be important. It is an extraordinarily demanding craft, and you are among its finest practitioners.
There's testimony to that in the numerous awards you have won for
analytical reporting of research, and especially medicine; your presidency
of the national organization of science writers; your membership in the
Illinois Institute of Medicine.
There are other qualities that recommend you, however. The editor of
the Chicago Tribune says of you, "... He is free from the extremes of ego
which sometimes appear in high achievers, but he has never lost his ambition
to do each assignment a little better than the last. He is an extraordinarily
fine human being as well as a highly skilled professional."
Another colleague put it very directly.
"I consider Ron," he said, "the best science writer in the country."
It is with great pleasure that The University of Michigan presents to
this outstanding alumnus, the Outstanding Achievement Award.
JAMES SLATTIN MARTIN, JR., Bachelor of Science in Engineering.
Class of 1942; inventor, engineer, manager of space projects.
The Viking Project, which two years ago resulted in the successful
landing of a pair of spacecraft on the planet Mars, represents the most
complex, demanding, and expensive unmanned space mission ever attempted.
As project manager for Viking, you played a vital role in the success of
this mission.
Your earlier management achievements at Republic Aviation and later
as deputy director of the Lunar Orbiter Project were in themselves major
contributions to our space program. In fact all five missions of the unmanned
Lunar Orbiter in 1966 and 1967 were successful and produced the photographs
from which the Apollo moon landings were planned.
It is however, the Viking Project which represents your greatest management achievement. The entire world has been thrilled by the beautiful
photographs of the Martian surface which have been transmitted to earth,
and the scientific community continues to reap the benefits of the wide
range of data gathered by the Viking spacecraft. You successfully directed
the many industrial and governmental teams who designed, built, tested
and flew these spacecraft. You managed with skill the scientific teams involved in the Viking experiments, including more than fifty internationally
recognized scientists and several Nobel prize winners.
The University of Michigan is proud to recognize a distinguished alumnus
who has successfuly met one of the greatest aerospace challenges of our time.
and now presents to you this Outstanding Achievement Award.
JOHN HAROLD PICKERING, Bachelor of Arts in 1938; Juris Doctor
in Law in 1940; lawyer extra ordinary.
For nearly forty years, you have served the public as a lawyer with
dedication and consummate skill.




168


DECEMBER MEETING, 1978


After earning a law degree with honors, you began your career in New
York, but soon moved to Washington, D.C., to serve as a law clerk to another
distinguished son of Michigan, Mr. Justice Frank Murphy of the United
States Supreme Court. Thereafter, you became associated with the law firm
that you now head. Your reputation as one of the nation's outstanding
lawyers has contributed to making that firm one of the preeminent law offices
in the nation. Among those who have sought your counsel are many of the
nation's leading corporations and business associations.
Throughout your career, you have represented your clients diligently,
effectively, and in a manner that has maintained the highest ethical standards
of the legal profession. In doing so, you have been an exemplar for generations of young lawyers.
You have been generous in providing voluntary service to your profession, serving the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
as chairman of its Advisory Committee on Procedures and as a member
of its Rules Advisory Committee and of its Committee on the Administration
of Justice. You have also served as a member of the Board of Governors
of the District of Columbia Bar and, currently, as its President-Elect.
You have been of outstanding service to the Law School for many years
and have taken an active and personal interest in helping enrich and enhance
legal education and research at this institution.
The University of Michigan is proud to salute an illustrious alumnus
who has meant so much to his profession, his community, and his Alma
Mater, and now presents this Outstanding Achievement Award.
LOUIS W. ROBERTS, Master of Science in Engineering, Class of 1937;
outstanding scientist, humanitarian, administrator.
As an applied scientist you have made important contributions to microwave electronics through your work in universities and industrial laboratories.
The commercial importance of your work has been shown by the success
of your own companies.
As Director of Energy and Environment for the federal government's
Transportation Systems Center, you have led the attack upon some of our
nations most pressing problems. While others have chosen the role of spectator, you have consistently stepped into the arena and, with energy and
vigorous enthusiasm, have assumed the responsibility to achieve.
As a concerned citizen, you have given generously of your talents and
time in the development of educational opportunities for underprivileged
youth.
The University of Michigan salutes you as a distinguished alumnus for
your many contributions to science, technology, and governmental affairs
with the presentation of this Outstanding Achievement Award.
RUSSELL BANGS STEARNS, Bachelor of Arts, Class of 1916; corporation executive, humanitarian.
Commerce is your vocation, but mankind is your business. Your career
is distinguished by its fine synthesis of commerce and the arts, to their
mutual benefit and the enrichment of society. We applaud your enviable
record of philanthropy, public service, commitment to institutions of culture
and higher education, and accomplishments in the fields of business and
finance.
As an undergraduate at Michigan you were exposed to works of art
and their history. With characteristic humanity, you have sought to extend
this enrichment to others. Your generous gifts will enable present and future
generations of university students, faculty, and museum visitors to share
some of the pleasure you have derived from a lifelong involvement with the
arts.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1978


169


As a businessman you have served as director and executive officer of
major firms in food products, manufacturing, utility services, banking and
investments. Your prodigious energies have been devoted equally to the
support of the nation's scientific and cultural life. In a literal sense, the
voices of the Boston Opera Association sing to all of us for you.
In public commendation of your personal generosity of spirit and resources, The University of Michigan is privileged to present this Outstanding
Achievement Award.
REGENTS' CITATION OF HONOR
Conferred December 10, 1978
University of Michigan-Dearborn
FRANK CADDY, President of the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield
Village, Public-spirited Citizen, Cultural Historian, Dedicated Educator
Devoted to the goal of understanding American culture through the study
of commonplace artifacts designed and used by American inventors and
craftsmen, Frank Cady has spent forty-six years of his life serving and
guiding the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, now in their fortyninth year of operation. These two remarkable sister institutions, together
comprising one of the most extensive and significant collections of Americana
in existence, demand of their directors a measure of the same imagination
displayed by their founder, Henry Ford. Even as he was changing the future
of not only America but the world, Henry Ford foresaw the importance of
collecting, preserving, and studying what was being replaced by new technology. Others endowed museums for the fine arts; Ford initiated museums
for the industrial and decorative arts, and staffed it with individuals who had
to create a tradition as they went along, for they had no precedents to guide
them. Frank Caddy knew Ford personally, and has played an important part
in bringing to success Ford's visionary enterprise of awakening America to
the value of its heritage of accomplishment in the fields of material culture.
During his long and distinguished career with the Henry Ford Museum
and Greenfield Village, Frank Caddy has served at various times as their
Director of Administration, Treasurer, Secretary to the Board, Vice-President
for Administration, and, since 1976, President. Despite the economic difficulties of recent years, he has steered his charges boldly into activities which
have enhanced not only their popularity but also their professional prestige.
He has directed a major reorganization of exhibits, augmented professional
staff, authorized construction of new buildings, and fostered closer working
relations with area universities.
For guiding the Henry Ford Museum    and Greenfield Village from
strength to strength and in doing so enriching the cultural resources and
heritage of the area and the republic, The University of Michigan-Dearborn
takes pleasure in presenting to you this Regents' Citation of Honor.




JANUARY MEETING, 1979
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, JANUARY 18, 1979
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Laro, Nederlander, Power, Roach, and Waters. Chancellors Goodall
and Moran and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger,
Radock, Shapiro, and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also
were present.
President Smith briefly reviewed the recent history of the  Michigan Union,
Transfer of
Michigan Union and indicated that the proposal before the Board  Governance
to place the governance and operation of the facility under the
direction of the Vice-President for Student Services would more
clearly identify and devote the Union to student affairs.
Regent Baker said that he wished to make the comment that
the Regents were pleased to have Mr. Smith as president and were
looking forward to working with him. They were grateful for his
acceptance of this responsibility for the next few months.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that the recommendation
would eliminate the Union as a separate, non-profit corporation
and would place the fee structure for the Michigan Union, Michigan League and North Campus Commons in a common system
for support and maintenance. Phase I of the recommendation
would require an increase of $2.65 per student per term, of which
$1.65 would be used by the Michigan Union for debt service and
$1.00 for its operation. He reviewed the renovation, maintenance
and program improvement costs that were essential for conversion
to a more effective student oriented facility.
Vice-President Johnson reviewed the Union use survey which
was conducted by his office to ascertain the type of facilities and
services of interest to the students. The broad range of possibilities
indicated the need for flexibility in providing facilities and services
compatible both to the physical limitation of space and the services
offered by the nearby private sector.
After stating his concept of what the role of the Michigan
Union should be, Mr. Johnson indicated that should the transfer


171




172


JANUARY MEETING, 1979


of governance be approved, he would appoint an interim task force
committee to research student needs in depth; investigate ways
these needs are being met elsewhere; study the Union as it
presently exists; and develop alternative plans for meeting identified needs through programming, revenue-producing activities,
food service alternatives and ambience.
After further discussion, Regent Laro moved to approve the
resolutions as recommended. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Regent Baker expressed his concern that originally the Union
was organized for the alumni, faculty and students, and felt this
should be retained in the resolution. Therefore, he moved to amend
the fourth line of the first recommendation to read... facility
in keeping with its original purpose.... Regent Roach seconded
the motion and it was adopted. The resolution as amended follows:
1. Transfer direction to the Office of Student Services, with the understanding that appropriate advisory committees on programs and, if
required, operations, be developed by the Vice-President to assist in
determining programs, ambience, and upkeep priorities to ensure a
facility in keeping with its original purpose that is appropriate and
responsive to the needs of the University community.
The transfer can be accomplished by adoption of the following resolution:
WHEREAS, The Michigan Union was recognized in the 1967 edition of
the Regents Bylaws in Section 30.11, which section was deleted from all
post-1967 editions of the Regents Bylaws,
RESOLVED that Regents Bylaw Section 30.11 is hereby formally revoked,
including, without limitation, any and all delegations of authority made at
anytime to The University of Michigan Union, a Michigan nonprofit corporation, its Board of Directors, Officers, or members. Pursuant to Regents Bylaw
14.01, written notice of such revocation shall be given to the resident agent
of the Michigan Union, a Michigan non-profit corporation, Mr. Stanfield M.
Wells, Jr., by delivery of a copy of this resolution, certified by the Secretary
of the University; and
WHEREAS, Regents Bylaw Section 7.03 provides for delegation of further
programs to the Office of Student Services, it is
FURTHER RESOLVED that the Regents hereby delegate to the Office of
Student Services, pursuant to Regents Bylaw Section 7.03, the direction of
the programs of the Michigan Union, including, without limitation, the maintenance, operation, and control of all real and personal property occupied
by or used in connection with the Michigan Union.
2. Authorize the Vice-President for Student Services to:
a. Initiate a market survey to determine services perceived as needed.
Areas to be surveyed would include, (but not be limited to)
1) Student Oriented Food Service
2) Barber Shop
3) Billiard Room
4) Bowling Alley and Pinball area
5) Storage locker space




JANUARY MEETING, 1979


173


6) Music Practice and listening rooms
7) Space for chess, bridge, backgammon and other games
8) Television viewing area
9) Arts and crafts area
10) Expansion for bookstore
11) Potential for added services-other unions have found success
with bank machines, student craft sales stores, travel agencies,
graphic shops, photographic darkrooms and the like.
Such surveys have proved very helpful at the University of Illinois
and the University of Kansas.
b. Reorganize spaces in the building to separate noncomplementary
activities and to provide services, within financial resources outlined. This would include a student-oriented food service and the
continuation of the University Club, provided the Club is financially viable.
c. Accomplish immediate rehabilitation needs, as shown in the attached table as Phase I, and plan and schedule Phase II for later
review by the Regents.
3. Approve restructuring the fee allocation for the Michigan Union,
Michigan League, and North Campus Commons, beginning Fall Term
1979-80 as follows:


Michigan Union
/Term/
Total       Student
Operations.........$280,000         $ 4.00

This represents a net increase per student per term of $2.65, beginning
Fall 1979-80. When Phase II is committed, the additional projected increase
would be $3.85 per student per term. (See attached schedule.)
4. Authorize the Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer to arrange
financing to permit Phase I work to begin before Fall term 1979-80.
President Smith then spoke to the recommendation to convert
the Michigan Union hotel rooms to student housing, and explained
the expenditures involved. He also reviewed the renovation costs
if the hotel rooms were to be retained.

Certificate of Need


The Regents indicated their awareness of the University's
obligation in providing preferential room assignments to those
with life memberships to the Union. Regents Baker and Roach
concurred that the ideal situation would be to construct a new
dormitory, thus retaining the hotel rooms for returning alumni
and conferences. Since this is not feasible at this time, and there
is an urgent need for student housing, the conversion seemed the
best solution. It was also noted that conversion was not irreversible.
Regent Baker reiterated his concern for the long-standing
agreement between the University and the graduates of this
University, and suggested that the Regents reconsider their position.
Regent Waters moved to convert all but twelve of the hotel
rooms in the Michigan Union to student housing. Regent Power
seconded the motion and it was adopted with Regent Baker
voting no.
President Smith introduced the next topic, the Certificate of
Need for the Hospital replacement project. He said that past
discussions with the Regents indicated a total project budget of
$309-$311 million. It is now clear that funding from the State
will not exceed $200 million. The total funding recommended at
this time is $254 million which includes the $200 million from the
State, $20 million of private funding, and $34 million from debt
supported by hospital revenues. There has also been a reduction
in the total square footage of space.
Dr. Jeptha Dalston, Director of University Hospital, explained
that the hospital replacement program included razing three
buildings, the Neuropsychiatric Hospital, the Clinical-Faculty
office building, and the North Outpatient building; and remodeling
the Women's Hospital, Children's Psychiatric Hospital, Mott
Children's Hospital and the Outpatient Building. To respond to
the state-wide excess bed problem and to create greater efficiency
and utilization of the hospital, a substantial reduction in the
number of beds has been recommended.
Dr. Douglas Sarbach, Director of Hospital Planning, Resources
and Development, discussed the Certificate of Need documents
for the main hospital replacement and the renovation of Old
St. Joseph Mercy Hospital plant, and reviewed the cost components of each.
The Regents discussed the financing of the projects and the
implementation of the plan.
Regent Baker was assured that a specific site had not been
selected for the Burn Center. The question of a separate site
versus an integrated facility could not be decided at this point.




JANUARY MEETING, 1979


175


In response to a question by Regent Roach, Dr. Dalston said
that if the project does not receive the State's approval, it will
not go forward.
Regent Dunn moved that the two proposals: the replacement
and renovation of selected components of University Hospital and
the renovation of Old St. Joseph Mercy Hospital plant be approved, and that the applications for Certificate of Need for each
program be submitted to the State's review authorities. Regent
Baker seconded the motion and it was adopted.
I. MINUTES
The minutes of the meeting of November 16 and 17, 1978 were
approved with certain specified changes.
The minutes of the December 14 and 15, 1978 meeting were
deferred pending amendments suggested by Regent Baker.
II. REPORTS
Vice-President Brinkerhoff filed a quarterly report of Expendable Restricted Fund Budgets. It is summarized below:

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of one faculty
member. The following memoir was adopted.
WARREN A. KETCHAM, Professor of Education, retired from active
faculty status at The University of Michigan on December 31, 1978.
Professor Ketcham has been a member of the University community
for forty-eight years, first as a student and later as a distinguished faculty
member and a certified practicing psychologist. He earned the B.M. degree
in the School of Music in 1932. Prior to World War II he taught in the public
schools of Michigan. During World War II he served overseas in Australia,
New Guinea, and the Philippine Islands. Following military service, he returned to The University of Michigan and received his M.A. degree in 1947
and his Ph.D. in 1951. In 1950 he began his work as a school psychologist
and school psychological diagnostician. In 1953 he joined the School of
Education as a faculty member for the University School. He was granted a
Fulbright Award in 1959 and lectured in child development at the University
of Leeds, England. He also served as a visiting professor at the University
of Kentucky, the University of Louisville, Indiana University, Utah State
University and as a research consultant in the American School, Guatemala
City, Guatemala. His extensive research in child development directed his
interest and teaching more and more to the gifted and talented child and
he became a leader in the state and the nation as a consultant for schools,
parent groups, parents and students in recognizing and working with gifted
children.
Professor Ketcham is a fellow in the American Psychological Association,
a member of the Michigan Psychological Association, Michigan Association
of School Psychologists and the Michigan Society of Consulting Psychologists.
He is also a member of the National Register of Health Service Providers in
Psychology as well as a Certified Consulting Psychologist in the states of
Michigan and Texas.
The versatility of his training and experience enabled him to offer consultation services to both public schools and private industry in advising
personnel staff in hiring and promotion decisions. He is presently serving
as a personnel consultant, American Petrofina, Incorporated, Dallas, Texas.
In recognition of his outstanding service to The University of Michigan,
the fields of child development and school psychology, the Regents now
salute this distinguished educator by naming him Professor Emeritus of
Education.


W. A. Ketcham,

Regent Nederlander moved to authorize the University to
invoke governmental immunity as a defense of a medical malpractice case (Mary Lou LeFevere). Regent Laro seconded the motion
and it was adopted.
The Regents received the following revised Criteria for Use
in Considering Requests from Student Organizations for Access
to the University's Student Billing Services for Special Fee
Collections:
1. A student organization requesting collection of special fees through
University student billing procedures must demonstrate student support for its goals and funding procedures in all of the following ways:




JANUARY MEETING, 1979


183


a. The organization must be registered as a "student organization"
under the rules providing for such registration by the Michigan
Student Assembly and the Office of Student Services.
b. The organization must have secured approval of its goals and
funding procedure from the Michigan Student Assembly.
c. The organization must have obtained, by petition, written support
of a majority of the student population sought to be made subject
to the fee assessment. The petition must fairly represent the organization's goals and funding procedure. Upon request by the University, the student organization has the burden of establishing the
validity of the signatures on the petition.
2. The organization must be non-partisan and demonstrate direct educational benefits in which all students at the University have an opportunity to participate. This must be attested to by written endorsements from a reasonable number of deans and department chairmen.
3. The organization must agree to reimburse the University for all administrative costs incurred in collecting the fee.
4. The amount of the fee to be collected by the University for the student
organization must not exceed $2.00 per term.
5. The organization must agree to submit to an annual audit by an independent accountant. The auditor's findings will be made available to
the University.
6. The organization must agree to a procedure which adequately protects
the rights of those students who do not wish to lend financial support
to the organization's program. If less than 25% of students choose to
financially support the organization for two consecutive terms (exclusive of summer terms), the fee collection will be discontinued. A
specific procedure will be designed for each particular proposal to
accomplish the provisions of these criteria.

proposed Ann Arbor Summer Theatre Festival and asked their           Festival
approval of the recommended six University representatives to the
Board of Directors. He said that it had been clearly stressed that
the University's participation would carry no funding commitment,
and that any use of University facilities would be dependent upon
the adaptability of the festival to the summer program of the
University's theatre department.
Regent Dunn moved to approve the University's representatives to the Board of Directors of the Ann Arbor Summer Theatre

The meeting was adjourned.
FRIDAY, JANUARY 19, 1979
The meeting reconvened at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Laro,
Nederlander, Power, Roach and Waters. Chancellors Goodall and
Moran and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger,
Radock, Shapiro, and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also
were present. Regent Dunn was absent.
Dining Hall  President Smith commented that the document concerning a
onsolidation dining commons for the Hill area residence halls responds to the
request for information on savings that might be generated by
amortizing the project over a thirty-year period.
Mr. Smith indicated that the original loan application provided
for energy conservation and consolidation of the dining halls. Since
the dining commons concept was not endorsed by the Regents, a
request to seek approval from HUD to apply the total loan to
energy conservation purposes was now before the Board.
Housing Division  Regent Roach moved to approve the Housing Division Energy

HUD loan application. Regent Waters seconded the motion and
it was adopted.
Alumni Buildings  Vice-President Brinkerhoff introduced Mr. Robert Forman,
Architect Selectd Executive Director of the Alumni Association, Mrs. Margaret
Host, Mr. Clarence Roy, and Mr. Robert Briggs, members of the
architectural selection committee for the proposed Alumni Building.

Regent Roach moved to approve proceeding with the project
and to authorize the appointment of Hugh Jacobsen Associates
as the architect for the Alumni Building. Regent Power seconded
the motion and it was adopted with Regent Laro abstaining.

solidate the Department of Ophthalmology's patient care, educa-  hthonsolidation
tion and research functions at the Parkview Hospital/Turner
Clinic facility. If approved a Certificate of Need application would
be submitted to the review authorities in February.
Discussion of the financial aspects followed. The Regents were
assured that construction would not commence until funding was
available.
Regent Roach moved to approve in principle the consolidation
of Ophthalmology Patient Services, Education, and Research as
recommended; to authorize studies necessary to determine feasibility of fund-raising for the consolidation effort; and to authorize
submission of the Certificate of Need application for consolidation
of patient services in the Parkview Hospital/Turner Clinic facility
to include a fund-raising endeavor for Part A of the program
proposal. Regent Laro seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Power questioned the original purposes for which the
Turner Geriatric Clinic had been established. She commented upon
the special nature of the services currently being offered by the
Turner Clinic. Regent Power expressed the view that there is a
major opportunity for the University to take a leadership role in
developing a broad base geriatric program involving teaching,
research and service.
Regent Power qualified her support of the motion made by
Regent Roach requesting that a proposal for a Geriatric-Medical
program be brought to the Regents in the next six months.
President Smith reviewed the proposal for the diagnostic radiology improvements program. He stated that funding would come
from internal sources accumulated through the Hospital's cost
containment efforts and better utilization of funds.

JANUARY MEETING, 1979


Board of Directors for their dedicated efforts on behalf of the students,
faculty, and alumni of The University of Michigan.
Throughout its history, the Board of Directors has sought to foster and
strengthen the bonds of loyalty and friendship that have become so integral
a part of the traditions of the University. In that effort they have excelled.
So too have they demonstrated equal diligence in managing the Michigan
Union Building. Through the efforts of the Board that facility has long since
become a part of the very fabric of the institution.
The Regents, therefore, extend their thanks and deep appreciation to the
Directors of the Union, both individually and severally, for their significant
contributions to the life of the University, its students, staff, and alumni.
Regent Baker seconded the motion and it was adopted.
All the above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of December totaled $427.64.
The Regents adjourned to meet on February 15 and 16, 1979.

HONORARY DEGREES
Characterizations by Professor Emeritus Frank Huntley
Conferred December 17, 1978
KENNETH EWART BOULDING
Economist, Philosopher, Poet
Since Kenneth Boulding, of the University of Colorado at
Boulder, was Professor of Economics at The University of Michigan for twenty years, we may claim him as our own. Here, stimulated by our Institute for Social Research, he was able to go
"beyond economics" into the philosophical and psychological
problems, ranging from consumer-behavior to war-and-peace, of
conflict resolution.
Honors soon followed: the John B. Clark medal for Economics,
the American Council of Learned Societies' prize in the Humanities,
the Presidency of the American Association, memberships in the
National Academy of Science and the American Philosophical
Society. He has been visiting Professor at the University College of
Kingston, Jamaica; the University of Natal; the University of
Edinburgh; and the International Christian University in Tokyo.
He is at home in the world as well as the universe.
A member of the Society of Friends, Professor Boulding has
carried his religious commitment into the practice of love to
achieve through his more than thirty challenging books goals heretofore deemed unattainable. Early he discovered that the actual
writing of poetry is a whetstone with which to sharpen one's
English prose. Out of his discipline, his humanity, and his faith,
Kenneth Boulding, to quote one of his own "eiconic" phrases from
The Image, has built a true "Temple of the Mind."
With admiration and love, therefore, The University of Michigan bestows upon him the degree Doctor of Laws.
ROY HARRIS JENKINS
British Labour Politician, Biographer-Historian, Leader of the
"Common Market"
Mr. Jenkins' father was a coal miner in Wales, then a labor
union official, and finally private secretary to Clement Attlee.
Thus from boyhood Roy Jenkins walked and talked among the
highest reaches of British executive politics. At the age of seventeen he won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, and took a
First Class in Economics. Emerging from the war as Captain in
Intelligence, he revived his interest in politics, and, despite an
initial defeat, became with the endorsement of the Prime Minister
the youngest member of the House of Common. In economic
theory and practice on the moderate wing of the Labour Party,
he accomplished such retrenchment as Minister of Aviation under
Harold Wilson that he was made Home Secretary and two years
later Chancellor of the Exchequer.




188


JANUARY MEETING, 1979


God endows all Welshmen at birth with the gifts of words and
music, and early in his career Mr. Jenkins took up writing. Among
his many books he is especially acclaimed for the biographies of
the Victorian Liberal Sir Charles Dilke and of Prime Ministers
Herbert Asquith and Arthur Balfour. His English prose in essays,
political biography, and modern British history is characterized
by a deft precision and grace.
Though second in command in the Labour Government, he
broke with Wilson and his party on the issue of Britain's entry
into the "Common Market," thus sacrificing assured advantages
in national politics for the less certain ideal of international cooperation. Today he is the brilliant and trusted President of the
Commission of the European Communities at Brussels. Happily,
therefore, The University of Michigan salutes with the degree
Doctor of Laws Roy Harris Jenkins, a neighbor and a man of
talent and principle.
SAMUEL CHAO CHUNG TING
Michigan Alumnus, Ambassador between Two Cultures, 1976
Nobel Laureate in Physics
Two months after Samuel Ting was born in Ann Arbor, he was
taken back to China by his parents, both professors, to whom,
with his grandmother, he attributes, in the tradition of filial piety,
the beginnings of his life of science. Returning to Michigan at the
age of twenty with little English and only one hundred dollars,
he was given support by the late Dean G. G. Brown of Engineering; and in less than six years earned at our University the degrees
of B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. He is a Professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and member of many scientific societies.
Working with electron-positron pairs at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron in Hamburg and at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory, Dr. Ting played a major role in a series of experiments
in the field of electro-magnetic interactions: and in the Fall of
1974 found evidence of a totally new "J Particle." For this he was
awarded at the age of forty the Nobel Prize in Physics.
Throughout his research on both sides of the Atlantic, by
retaining his personal and professional ties with his ancestral
heritage in Taiwan and on the Mainland, Dr. Ting has joined the
newest and most abstruse theories of Western science to the ancient
Chinese genius for wisdom, gentleness, patience, and beauty. Selflessly he acknowledges the help of dozens of colleagues, often with
the revealing notation, "Professor X has extremely good taste in
Physics."
Hence with affection and pride we honor ourselves by honoring
with the degree Doctor of Science this eminent Michigan-trained
Chinese-American pioneer.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1979
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1979
The Regents met at 1:15 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Dunn, Laro,
Nederlander, Power and Roach. Chancellor Moran and VicePresidents Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger, Radock, Shapiro and
Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also were present. Regents
Brown and Waters and Chancellor Goodall were absent.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the salient points of the  Twelve Month
Investment
twelve month investment review. He noted several corrections in  Review
the investment report which are noted in the material on file with
the Secretary. Vice-President Brinkerhoff then introduced Donald
A. Lindow and Melvin D. Rousek, investment counsel for the
University from the National Bank of Detroit. Both commented
on the overall performance of the various University endowment
funds.
Regents Baker and Laro asked about the wisdom of maintaining investments in common stocks given their relatively poor
performance as opposed to higher return short-term securities.
Counsel responded that common stock investment is still a sound
long-term investment policy. Mr. Norman Herbert, University
Investment Officer, added that the University did move to some
extent to more short-term securities and perhaps should have done
more. He noted that this was also a good time to take advantage
of the relatively good buys in the equity market.
Regent Laro asked if consideration had been given to taking
advantage of the options market. Counsel responded that there are
varying opinions on the advantages of trading in options. Regent
Laro asked for more detailed information on the pros and cons
of the options market. Regent Roach also asked for an assessment
of a fiduciary's responsibilities in dealing in this type of market.
Regent Power asked whether the University should continue
to maintain its practice of keeping up to 60-65% of its investments in stocks as opposed to other securities. Some discussion
followed concerning our relative investment performance vis-a-vis
other institutional investors. Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated
that the results of an evaluation report comparing the University's


189




190


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1979


performance and practices with other institutional investors will
be provided to the Regents.
Common Stock  Regent Nederlander then moved to approve the recommendation to maintain a common stock ratio at approximately 60% of
the total assets at market value with the balance of the portfolio
invested in fixed income obligations for the Major Endowment
Funds, and a common stock objective of 65%  for the Fund
Functioning as Endowment. The motion was seconded by Regent
Dunn and adopted.
On a motion by Regent Baker and seconded by Regent Laro
the recommendation was adopted which authorizes the University
Officers to act independently of the Regents and vote against
management proposals when review by the Bank and the University of proxy materials clearly indicates a dilution of the University's financial interest as a stockholder, and the adoption of the
guidelines as outlined for routine proxy items.
Discussion then ensued on the recommendation that the stocks
of Dresser Industries, Inc., Johnson Controls, Inc., and MortonNorwich Products, Inc., be added to the approved list for possible
later investment by the University.
Investments in  In view of the Regental policy of March, 1978 regarding companies doing business in South Africa, Regent Power argued that
the University should inquire about a company's involvement and
practices in South Africa before they are added to the approved
list.
Additions to   Regent Baker moved that the stocks of Dresser Industries,
Approved Common
Stock List Inc., Johnson Controls, Inc., and Morton-Norwich Products, Inc.,
be added to the approved list as recommended. Regent Laro
seconded the motion.
Regent Power moved to table the motion. The motion failed
for lack of a second.
Regent Power indicated that she felt it appropriate to delay
action until the University could inquire whether or not Dresser
Industries had investments in South Africa and had been responsive to inquiries regarding its employment practice in South Africa.
Regent Roach commented that in his view a more appropriate
time to make such inquiries would be as a potential investor. Thus
he concluded that the University would be in a better position if
the company's stock was on the approved list.
The motion was approved with Regent Power voting no.
In response to an inquiry, the Regents indicated that they
expected a report on compliance with the March 1978 policy on
investments in October of each year. They also asked for an update
on pending matters noted in the October 1978 report.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1979

Chancellor Moran then went through a detailed presentation on
the schematic designs for the Flint Classroom-Laboratory Building
and for the University Plaza. On a motion by Regent Laro,
seconded by Regent Nederlander the designs were approved with
authorization to proceed with preliminary drawings for the Plaza
and design development of the Classroom-Laboratory Building
pending design approval by the Joint Capital Outlay Committee
of the Legislature and their authorization and funding for additional design work. Regent Baker abstained from the vote.
Vice-President Johnson presented the recommendation for
single student housing rates for 1979-80 which represented an
average 6.9%    increase over the current year. Housing office
officials, Robert Hughes and Norman Snustad, then commented
via charts on the relative single student housing cost increases for
the past ten years noting that they had not increased as fast as
the Consumer Price Index for the period.
On a motion by Regent Nederlander, seconded by Regent
Dunn the rate recommendations were approved.
Regent Dunn noted his recollection on the issue of food boycotts that such decisions were to be left to the individual housing
units rather than becoming a housing office decision. Other Regents
concurred.
Regent Baker stated his hope that the students would recall
that the Regents supported their position on the food consolidation
plan when they think about this rate increase.
Regent Baker then read into the record the following statement
concerning the recent cancellation of the Russian Art Exhibition
at the University.
"The Soviet Union's abrupt cancellation of the Russian Art Exhibit, for
purely political reasons, is interference by a foreign government with the
rights of free inquiry and academic freedom at a public University in the
United States and is completely unacceptable to The University of Michigan.
"The University of Michigan has a proud history of hearing voices of
dissent from diverse political viewpoints. It is entirely inappropriate that a
foreign government should attempt to influence freedom of expression in
America through its actions. It is my understanding the Soviet government
cancelled an exhibition of Russian art and would not honor a long planned
agreement with the University for lending the Russian artworks because
Josef Brodsky, a poet in residence at the University, and a former Russian
citizen, was to participate in a program called the Festival of Russian Arts
planned by the Center for Russian and East European Studies at The Universty of Michigan, and because a short quotation of Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, a
Soviet exile, was included in the festival brochure.
"The Regents of the University are supportive of the administration's
action rejecting the Soviet government actions. Freedom of inquiry and
academic freedom at this University is basic to America's concept of a free
society and attempts to limit those freedoms, and must be rejected by all
who stand for freedom. Other American Universities would be well served
to reject any conditions placed upon them by the Soviet government in
return for the right to exhibit Russian artworks."

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1979


Minority Student
Enrollment


Vice-President Shapiro, Associate Vice-President English and
George Goodman, Director of the Opportunity Program, then
presented the annual minority student enrollment report.
Vice-President Shapiro noted the University's long history of
minority student enrollment which preceded any special program
efforts in this direction. In the past decade the University has
undertaken a very ambitious program to increase enrollment opportunities for large numbers of minority students. While this
program has been largely successful, Vice-President Shapiro stated
that he was not completely satisfied with our results to date. His
assessment had led inevitably to question whether everything
possible was being done in the areas of recruitment and retention.
He concluded that to achieve the University's objectives reassessment of the University's resource commitment must be a continuous process; coordination between instructional units and
support service units must be improved; and the University community as a whole must develop plans to assist minority and other
students to succeed at the University.
Mr. Goodman commented on the need for faculty and staff
members to learn more about the background of disadvantaged
students so that University programs could be better adapted to
their needs.
Regent Baker suggested that Education schools undertake
teacher training efforts among secondary schools to better prepare
more students for University level work.
Regent Power emphasized the need to reach families of potential students to attempt to help them with an overall understanding of The University of Michigan experience whether attending
as a residential or non-residential student. She suggested that the
predominantly residential character of the Ann Arbor Campus
may pose special problems for some prospective minority students.
Dr. English responded that residential living in Ann Arbor was
indeed a very difficult adjustment for many.
The Regents complimented Vice-President Shapiro and his
staff on a well presented report.
The Regents then heard from the following individuals as part
of the Public Comments portion of the meeting: Ruth Campbell,
Barbara Chenowith, Margaret Young and Dorothy Robb concerning the Turner Clinic; Bruce Kozarsky, Jeffrey Cox and Mervat
Hatem concerning tenure; and Kate Rubin concerning University
investments.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1979
The Regents reconvened at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Laro, Nederlander, Power and Roach. Chancellors Goodall and
Moran and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger,
Radock, Shapiro, and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also
were present. Regent Waters was absent.
Vice-President Radock presented a special report on the cur- Fund Raising
rent status of private fundraising at the University. He emphasized  Report
the need for increased activity in order to sustain and increase the
University's revenues from private sources. He suggested that
increased support from corporations and foundations and nonalumni friends looked especially promising if new initiatives could
be undertaken. The new initiatives suggested were: 1) expanded
staff and services; 2) strengthening school and college giving
programs; 3) building a base of student support that would insure
higher levels of future alumni support; 4) increase volunteer
leadership among alumni, faculty, students and staff.
The Regents then heard comments from Messrs. George Slykhouse, Glenn Bixby and Dr. Harry Towsley strongly supporting
the need for increased effort in developing our private philanthropy potential. All of these gentlemen had served the University
as alumni leaders in the development area for many years.
Regent Nederlander thanked all of the participants for an
excellent presentation noting his hope that a concrete recommendation for increased activity would be forthcoming shortly.
Regent Roach noted that ideally funding for development
activities should come from non-general funds.
President Smith indicated that funding was a problem and that
approximately half of the development budget had to come from
general funds since there was not sufficient undesignated gift
monies.
Regent Baker commented the alumni emphasizing the need
to recruit new volunteers of the same stature of the individuals
participating in this presentation.
A subsequent proposal will be developed to implement increased activity.
Chancellor Moran presented his recommendations to authorize  Flint Television
the hiring of Grainger and Associates of Flint to design the tele- TraeSeected,                                                  Architect Selected

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of two faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1979


201


LILLIAN G. OSTRAND, Associate Professor of Nursing in the School    L. G. Ostrand,
of Nursing, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1978 after a most  Retirement
productive career as a teacher and Public Health Nursing advisor and consultant.
Professor Ostrand has been active in the field of nursing since she received her diploma in Nursing from Augustana Hospital in Chicago in 1937.
She has been an Associate Professor on the faculty of the School of Nursing
since 1974.
Throughout her career she has been providing skillful and able leadership
within the School of Nursing and the Public Health Nursing field.
The Regents recognized this distinguished health educator for her dedicated service by naming her Associate Professor Emeritus of Nursing.
GEORGE A. RICHARDSON, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry, has retired    G. A. Richardson,
from  active faculty status as of February 15, 1979, after a lengthy and  Retirement
productive career as a teacher and practicing psychoanalyst.
A native of Wisconsin, Dr. Richardson did both his undergraduate and
graduate studies at Northwestern University, from which he received his
M.D. in 1938 and an M.S. in Anatomy in 1940. Immediately thereafter, he
became a Roy Bishop Canfield Fellow in Otolaryngology at The University
of Michigan, a position he held until 1942. Later in that same year, he joined
the faculty of Northwestern University's Department of Otology as an
Assistant Professor, where he stayed until 1944.
In 1945, Dr. Richardson relocated back to Ann Arbor, and has been
affiliated with the Neuropsychiatric Institute since that time. His initial
appointment in 1945 was that of an Assistant in Psychiatry, from which he
was promoted to Instructor status in 1949. He became an Assistant Professor
in 1957 and was promoted to the level of Associate Professor in 1963. In July
of 1968 he was promoted to full Professor of Psychiatry.
Dr. Richardson has had a long and distinguished career in the Department of Psychiatry. He did extensive training in psychoanalysis and became
one of the most knowledgeable and respected analytic training supervisors in
the country. In this context, Dr. Richardson has been responsible through the
years for teaching and supervising literally hundreds of residents and
fellows, many of whom are now practicing senior analysts in their own right.
Due to his ongoing preeminence in the field of psychoanalysis, he has
held appointments at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and the Detroit
Psychoanalytic Training Center. In the local and national scene, Dr. Richardson has been active in the Detroit Psychoanalytic Association, the International Psychoanalytic Association, and the Michigan Psychoanalytic Society, to name just a few. Furthermore, he has been a training analyst in the
Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute for many years, a status earned by a select
few psychiatrists. His extensive research in the area has likewise earned him
national acclaim throughout his long and productive career.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his thirtyfour years of dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of
Psychiatry.
VII. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported to the Regents the death of
Stewart H. Rewoldt, Professor of Marketing. The following memorial statement was adopted:
The Regents of the University express their deep sorrow at the untimely  s. H. Rewoldt
death of Professor STEWART H. REWOLDT, who died on January 10,          Memorial
1979.                                                                   Statement
Professor Rewoldt was born in Dundee, Illinois on January 26, 1922.




202


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1979


He received his Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the University in 1946 after having his undergraduate education interrupted by three
years of military service with the U.S. Army, much of the time in Europe.
Continuing his studies at Michigan he was awarded an M.B.A. degree with
distinction in 1947 and a Ph.D. in Business Administration in 1952.
Rewoldt joined the faculty in 1947 as an instructor in marketing and
was promoted to the rank of assistant professor in 1952. A year later he
became a member of the business faculty at Indiana University where he
attained the rank of associate professor in 1955. He returned to Michigan
in 1956 and was promoted to full professor of marketing in 1960.
Stewart Rewoldt served the School of Business Administration well
for over two decades. He was a member of such School committees as the
Executive Committee, Curriculum Committee, Scholarship Committee and
Teaching Committee. In 1967 he chaired an ad hoc committee to recommend
changes in the MBA curriculum. Subsequent adoption of the recommendations of that committee improved greatly the rigor and reputation of the
MBA program. His research activities resulted in the authorship or co-authorship of two scholarly books and in several journal articles. In recent years
he concentrated on case research to collect materials for a widely used text
in marketing management which he co-authored with two Michigan colleagues.
Stewart Rewoldt was a dedicated teacher who had a profound effect
upon students just being exposed to marketing. He also provided guidance
and support to graduate student teaching assistants teaching for the first
time under his supervision. In all, Professor Rewoldt was a warm and compassionate human being who left a lasting impact on all those privileged to
have been associated with him.
The Regents join the entire University community in extending deepest
sympathies to his family.
Vice-President Shapiro noted the death of Arthur W. Bromage,
Professor Emeritus of Political Science.

IX. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Wage and Price  Vice-President Brinkerhoff recommended that the Regents
Control, Federal
Standards approve compliance with federal standards for wage and price
controls as announced by President Carter. In response to questions he indicated that this action should not unreasonably affect
our capacity to alter tuition or alter hospital revenues although
the impact on the Hospital is a much more complex question.
Regent Roach moved to adopt the compliance recommendation. The motion was seconded by Regent Nederlander and
adopted.
Amdab  puter   Vice-President Overberger explained the need to replace the
University's teaching/research Amdahl 470V/6 computer in order
to insure adequate future capacity. He indicated a specific financing plan would be proposed at the March meeting. The
present computer would be sold in the process. The principal contenders for the replacement are the Amdahl 470V/7 and the IBM
3033. All vendors were contacted and invited to bid including
relevant Michigan companies. This new equipment would likely
only be adequate until 1983. Hopefully a new generation of computers will then be available with greatly expanded capacities.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated a similar capacity problem is occurring with the computer used by the Data Systems
Center. A similar procedure is being followed in securing replacement equipment including an investigation of using the outmoded
Amdahl 470V/6 from the Computing Center. Financing plans will
be brought to the Regents in March.
Real Property  Regent Roach moved that the property at 110 East Broadway,
Mt. Clemens, Michigan be sold as recommended. Regent Laro
seconded the motion and it was adopted.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1979


205


Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the plans of a local developer to construct a very sizeable development at the intersection of Forest and Washtenaw Avenues. As a part of that
development the University is being requested to provide an option
to purchase 12,500 sq. ft. of land that is presently used for surface
parking and an easterly access/egress to the University's Church
Street parking structure from Forest. An alternative access/egress
easement would be provided if this proposal was consumated.
The developer's plans have not yet proceeded through the
City's planning approval process. The city will not proceed to
review the plan unless there is a willingness on the part of the
University to consider such a sale. Thus it was recommended that
the Regents authorize continued discussions with the developer.
Regent Brown cautioned that no options be executed without
assurances that the development is actually to be accomplished.
Regent Baker objected strongly to the massive nature of the
proposed development and the effect it will have on the surrounding community and indeed the entire easterly border of the campus. While he remained open minded on the project, he wanted to
insure the matter was given the fullest possible public airing
before any University action was taken. He suggested that interested parties be invited to discuss their concerns with the
Regents.
Regent Roach indicated that concerns about this development
are largely community oriented and that the process of review is
more properly a responsibility of the City. The development had
the potential for offering some relief for the inadequate housing
supply.
The University concern is largely one of providing for the lost
parking spaces and insuring that the access to our parking structure is maintained.
Regent Baker reiterated his concern about the impact of so
massive a development on the campus itself.
Regent Laro was agreeable to having discussions go forward,
but expressed his interest in insuring the University is adequately
compensated for any lost parking spaces.
Regent Power moved that discussions with the developer go
forward as recommended. Regent Brown seconded the motion.
Regent Baker moved to table the motion, but it failed for lack
of a second. Regent Power's motion was adopted with Regent
Baker voting no. Regent Nederlander abstained from the vote
and the discussion on this issue.
The Regents received a report on University Hospital patient Hospital Patient

Regent Roach moved approval and Regent Power seconded the
following resolution, and it was adopted.
Many staff members are employed for the purpose of creating
computer software in the discharge of their duties. Resulting software is within the scope of Bylaw 3.10(2). However, it is recognized that the creation of computer software is a process which
may involve University-supported and independent activity by
staff members, as contemplated by Bylaw 3.10(5), but the precise
division of the relative amounts of University-supported and independent effort is in most cases impossible to calculate. Accordingly, without limiting the authority of the Vice-President for
Research under Bylaw 3.10(5), the Regents hereby reaffirm the
policy they adopted in January 1974 whereby the author-creator

of computer software may in an appropriate case be paid 20%

computer software.
On a motion by Regent Dunn and seconded by Regent Laro
the following resolution was adopted:
The Board of Regents of The University of Michigan herewith acknowledge and extend their high commendation to the University Musical Society
and the University Choral Union on the occasion of their centennial anniversary.
Throughout its history, the University Musical Society has been inextricably associated with the University. Its founding served to crystallize
the mounting interest in music both in the Ann Arbor community and the
University. The Society from its inception became the focal point not only
for musical performance but also for instruction. It was indeed the progenitor
of the School of Music, having provided courses in music instruction until
1940 when those educational activities were fully incorporated within the
University.
The Society's "Choral Union Concert Series," begun in the early 1880's,
and the "May Festival," which followed in 1894, have achieved international
recognition. To this day they provide incomparable contributions to the
cultural growth and enrichment of the entire community.
In these later years the Society's programs have broadened to include
equally distinguished presentations from other areas of the performing arts.
Each production reflects a meticulous adherence to a high standard of
excellence that has marked all of the efforts of the Musical Society.
The Regents extend now their warm greetings and deep gratitude to the
University Musical Society and the University Choral Union for their century-long dedication to cultural advancement and service to the University
and the community.
On a motion by Regent Roach and seconded by Regent Laro
the following resolution was adopted:
The Board of Regents of The University of Michigan happily applaud
the Board of Governors of the Michigan League as well as those directing
the League's Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre as they jointly celebrate their
fiftieth anniversary.
For all of their history these institutions have provided a place of grace
and warmth where students, faculty, alumni and alumnae could come together
in both formal and informal settings to know and learn from one another.
Generations have been able to experienece theatre as performed by the learning
novice as well as by the seasoned professional. Countless hundreds have
enjoyed the hospitality of the League's dining facilities and its many other
services. In truth these institutions have become a part of the very fabric of
the University.
The Regents now extend to the League's Board of Governors and
Mendelssohn Theatre managers their congratulations and deep appreciation
for the significant contributions their respective institutions have made to
the quality and enrichment of university life.
President Smith received the Regents' concurrence with his
suggestion to process a bylaw change to add students to the
Honorary Degree Committee. Such a bylaw change would come
to the Regents for approval.

PSelection Co    Regent Nederlander offered the following proposed criteria to
Selection Committee Criteria be used in selecting a new president of the University.
for President
The Regents Selection Committee appreciates the reports submitted on
the Needs of The University of Michigan by the Faculty Committee on the
Presidency, Student Committee on the Presidency, and the Alumni Committee
on the Presidency. In addition, the Regents are indebted to those other groups
and individuals who submitted memorandums and reports on this subject.
Each Advisory Committee may assess for itself the weight to be given
each criterion. The order of the criteria is not indicative of their importance.
The Regents Selection Committee may modify the criteria for a University President as the process of selection evolves.
A person having all of these desired characteristics may not be found,
so some abilities will be regarded as more important than others.
The Regents Selection Committee has determined that the following
characteristics should be considered when selecting the next President of
The University of Michigan:
1. Possess outstanding ability to provide vigorous, informed, imaginative and innovative leadership.
2. Possess executive and administrative skills.
3. Possess sensitivity to the nature and purposes of the University as
an academic institution and to academic freedom.
4. Possess the ability to delegate authority.
5. While it is not contemplated that any present executive officers need
be replaced, the President should be able to possess the capacity to
form a team of administrators whose abilities complement the President's to achieve the goals of the University.
6. Possess scholarly background.
7. Be able to serve at least ten years.
8. Need not hold a Ph.D. degree.
9. May be selected from within or without The University of Michigan.
10. Possess sensitivity to affirmative action-the need for identifying and
attracting women and minorities for enrollment, hiring and promotion.
11. Be sensitive to personnel and labor relations problems, and dealings
with labor unions.
12. Possess those personality traits which are necessary to work effectively with people, including faculty, students, staff, alumni, general
public, and the Regents.
13. Be committed to excellence throughout the University-excellence in
teaching, research and service.
14. Possess the ability to work effectively with government officials at the
local, state and national level, but must have the capability to resist
any governmental interference which impinges upon the academic
and intellectual freedom of the University, or will have that effect
in the future.
15. Be able to manage prudently in times of financial stringency without
sacrificing the quality of excellence.
16. Be able to perceive the changing needs of society so as to plan and
prepare for the University to accomplish its missions and goals in
the future.
17. Possess the capacity to exercise leadership in fund raising.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1979


211


18. Be able to fully utilize all of the resources of the University in an
integrated manner to enhance excellence of teaching, research and
service.
19. Sensitivity to the problems of a multi-campus university.
Regent Baker moved approval of the resolution. Regent Dunn
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Nederlander then offered the following revised guide-       Presidential
Selection Comnline on interviewing presidential candidates:                          mittee Guidelines
Revised
The Regents Selection Committee, after receiving advice and recommendations of the three advisory committees, will identify a list of candidates.
While the exact number of candidates is unknown at this time, it is hopeful
that it will be less than eight persons.
The advisory committees shall be advised as to the names of the candidates when so identified. If there are any additional candidates identified
at a later date, each advisory committee shall be notified forthwith.
All of these candidates who are willing to be considered as a candidate
for the Presidency will be interviewed. The interviews will be held at a time
and place agreeable to the candidate.
Three representatives of the faculty advisory committee, two representatives of the student advisory committee, and two representatives of the
alumni advisory committee will be invited to participate with the Regents
in interviews of each candidate. While there are advantages of identity of
participants for comparison purposes, each advisory committee will determine for itself whether or not to rotate the interviewing assignment.
If it is necessary for the interviewing personnel to travel, the University
shall bear the necessary cost of such travel and expenses.
Advisory committee members shall not communicate directly or indirectly with persons recommended for the presidency unless expressly authorized in writing by the Chairman of the Regents Selection Committee.
Regent Roach moved approval of the resolution, Regent Laro
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
All of the above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of January totaled $620.60.
The Regents adjourned to meet on March 15 and 16, 1979.

SECTION 5
DEBT RETIREMENT FUND
The University covenants and agrees that it will immediately establish
a special separate account on its books and records designated "Michigan
League Repair and Renovation Loan Debt Retirement Fund" (the "Debt
Retirement Fund"), the moneys from time to time allocated and set aside in
said Fund to be used solely and only to pay the principal of, and interest
on, the Note when due or to prepay principal thereof. All Student Fees allocated for the retirement of the Note, as provided in Section 6 hereof, and
the release of the Loan proceeds as provided in Section 10 hereof, shall be set
aside in the Debt Retirement Fund.
SECTION 6
ALLOCATION OF STUDENT FEES
The University covenants and agrees that out of the collections of
Student Fees during each Fiscal Year, it will allocate and set aside in the
Debt Retirement Fund amounts fully sufficient, when combined with the
release of loan proceeds deposited in the Debt Retirement Fund, as provided
in Section 5 hereof, and any other funds allocated by the University to the
Debt Retirement Fund, to pay installments of the principal of, and interest
on, the Note as the same become due.
The Student Fees are hereby pledged for the payment of the principal,
of and interest on, the Note, and the University covenants and agrees that it
will use and apply the necessary amount of Student Fees for said purpose.
Student Fees allocated to the Debt Retirement Fund shall be applied first
to pay interest on the Note as the same becomes due and thereafter shall
be used to pay the principal of the Note.
The University reserves the right to use any Funds Legally Available
Therefor for the purpose of paying principal or interest on the Note.
So long as the installments of principal and interest on the Note are paid
when due, the University may in its discretion allocate excess funds generated
from the Student Fees to such other lawful purposes of the University as are
consistent with the requirements of Section 7 and 16 of this Agreement and
the agreements relating to Parity Obligations of the University.
SECTION 7
COVENANTS RE: STUDENT FEES, THE CREATION OF A LIEN THEREON
AND THE PLEDGE THEREOF
The University covenants and agrees that as long as the Note remains
unpaid, as to either principal or interest, it will establish and maintain Student
Fees to be collected from the students attending The University of Michigan
in amounts sufficient to provide annual sums equal to at least two hundred
per cent (200%) of the maximum future annual debt service requirements
on all Parity Obligations. The pledge of Student Fees hereby shall constitute
and be a first lien or charge against the Student Fees, which shall be of equal
standing with any lien or charge thereon made with respect to existing
Parity Obligations, described in Section 8 of this Agreement, and with any
additional Parity Obligations to be incurred, as authorized by Section 9 of
this Agreement. The University does hereby irrevocably pledge to the payment of the principal, of and interest on, the Note, the Student Fees and
any funds which may be deposited in the Debt Retirement Fund which are
intended and necessary to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Note
during the Fiscal Year of the deposit.

MARCH MEETING, 1979
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, MARCH 15, 1979


The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Dunn, Laro,
Nederlander, Power, Roach and Waters. Chancellors Goodall and
Moran and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger,
Radock, Shapiro and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also
were present. Regent Brown was absent.
The meeting was interrupted by a large group of students
and others representing the Wastenaw County Coalition against
Apartheid who demanded that the Regents take immediate action
to divest stocks owned by the University in companies doing
business in South Africa. After repeated attempts by President
Smith to continue with the regular business of the monthly meeting, Regent Nederlander moved to adjourn the meeting which
was seconded by Regent Dunn and adopted. The Regents and the
Executive Officers then vacated the meeting room.
After the students left the premises, the Regents reconvened
at 3:25 p.m. in the Regents' room. Regent Nederlander clarified
his motion for adjournment indicating it was his intention to recess
the meeting until business could be continued without interruption
rather than actually adjourning the meeting.
President Smith then indicated that the UM-Flint recreation
building item had been withdrawn; therefore, Vice-President
Shapiro would review the next two items on the agenda.
Vice-President Shapiro commented briefly on the recommendations to join the journalism department and the speech communication component of the department of speech communication
and theatre, thereby creating the Department of Communication
and to establish a separate Department of Theatre and Drama.
Following discussion, Regent Power moved to approve the
recommendation, Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was
adopted.

MARCH MEETING, 1979


Budget for  Vice-President Shapiro reviewed the status of the 1979-80
budget, including the Governor's recommendation, the existing
commitments on those funds, and revenue available for salary and
non-salary programs. He indicated an increase in tuition was
essential this year to maintain University programs at their present
levels. The General Fund budget for 1978-79 will be in balance
at year end, provided there is no reduction in state appropriations
for this current year through an executive order from the Governor.
Public Comments  The Regents' meeting then moved to the Michigan Union
Ballroom to continue the scheduled public comments session.
Although six persons had requested time on the agenda to
speak on South African investments, five yielded their time to
Jemardari Kamara, who spoke on the subject and asked that an
action item recommending divestiture of stock held by the University in companies doing business in South Africa be placed
on the agenda for the Friday morning meeting.
Academic freedom at Birzeit University was then addressed
by Joe Beinin, Amy Marmer, and Jim Lindsay who represented
the Palestinian Human Rights Committee and Rabbi William
Rudolph for the Hillel Foundation.
Jim Allen from Michigan Student Assembly spoke on the
tuition increase for the coming year.
The meeting was recessed.
FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1979
The Regents reconvened at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Dunn, Nederlander, Roach and Power. Chancellors Goodall and Moran and
Vice-President Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger, Radock, Shapiro
and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also were present.
Regents Brown, Laro, and Waters were absent.
U    ndergraduate  Vice-President Shapiro commented that a report on tuition
Fees, 1979-80 and fees for resident undergraduates for 1979-80 must be submitted to the Student Financial Assistance Services section of the
State of Michigan Department of Education early next month.
This report will determine the funds allocated to The University
of Michigan students. The recommendation requests approval of
an increase ranging from 8-9.5% for all campuses.
A motion to approve the range of the tuition increase as
recommended, was made by Regent Baker and seconded by Regent
Nederlander.
Regent Roach moved to amend the proposal substituting 7%
as the minimum increase for the Ann Arbor campus, retaining




MARCH MEETING, 1979


225


the 8-9.5% for the Dearborn and Flint campuses. Regent Power
seconded the motion.
Vice-President Shapiro commented that the action required
at this time was only setting the range of increase and not establishing actual tuition rates. He felt that a 7% increase would not
be viable; another year of enforced savings would have too great
an impact on existing programs.
The motion to amend the recommendation to a 7% minimum
failed with Regents Baker, Dunn, and Nederlander voting no.
President Smith then called for the vote on the original
motion which was moved by Regent Baker and seconded by
Regent Nederlander to approve the recommended range of 8-9.5 %
for resident undergraduate tuition fees for 1979-80 for all campuses. It was unanimously approved.
Regent Power commented that everyone deplores and regrets
having to take action each year to increase tuition. She suggested
that it would be appropriate for the Regents themselves, in conjunction with certain administrative officers, to participate in
appropriate discussions with the Governor to convey some of their
views and concerns about The University of Michigan as a state
and national resource. She moved that a representative group from
the Board of Regents meet with the Governor to discuss financial
affairs of The University of Michigan. Regent Roach seconded the
motion.
In amplification of Regent Power's motion, President Smith
stated that a few years ago the State government adopted a policy
in funding higher education under which appropriation increases
apply only to the state portion of the budget. This has the inevitable effect of requiring increases in student fees which is the
principle source of other revenue.
Regent Baker indicated that he would not support the motion
because he felt that this is and should continue to be a staff
relationship between the University, the legislature and the
Governor's office. The position of the Regents as well as the
University is adequately transmitted to those offices. He believes
that the Regents should not step into the political arena which
may force positions that may not be helpful to the legislature,
the Governor's office, or the University.
Regents Nederlander and Roach commented that any such
meetings would be coordinated with and in participation with the
Officers of the University.
President Smith called for the vote. The motion was adopted
with Regent Baker voting no.




226


MARCH MEETING, 1979


Investment  President Smith then stated that with the Regents permission,
Policies in
South Africa the two items in which the group of students were interested would
be next on the agenda. He said that all of the Regents, including
Regent Waters, who was absent, had asked that this meeting
be opened for such attention to the University's investment policy
as the Regents may want to take. He reminded everyone that
the issue is not whether political and social conditions in South
Africa are at a desirable level; the issue is whether or not certain
kinds of conduct can modify the direction of those conditions.
In addition, there is the question as to what agencies should take
political action that might be appropriate. There is also the question as to whether or not divestment produces good or ill toward
the changes everyone seeks. There are knowledgeable individuals
who have declared publicly that the maintenance of American
industrial presence in South Africa is advantageous to the improvement of those conditions, as well as people who have said
the contrary. The Regents adopted the present policy a year ago
after long deliberation and study by appropriate groups in the
community.
icReviewed  Regent Roach then moved that the matter of the Regents'
policy with respect to investment in corporations doing business
in South Africa and banks making loans to the government of
South Africa be referred to the Senate Advisory Committee on
Financial Affairs for review of such new information as may be
presented to it and for recommendations of suggested changes in
such policy, if any, and report to the Regents at an early date.
He further moved that the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA) request the Michigan Student Assembly
to appoint two students as members. Regent Power seconded the
motion.
In explanation, President Smith commented that the Senate
Advisory Committee on Financial Affairs (SACFA) is a standing
committee created by the Senate Advisory Committee for University Affairs. Routinely, advisory committees to the vice presidents include student members, but for some reason students have
not shown an interest in this particular committee. The Regents
feel that this committee clearly should have student representation
to review this policy to see whether or not there is justification or
reason for any suggested modifications of the policy.
Regent Power said that Regent Waters had asked her to
introduce a resolution asking that the Regents put the matter of
University investment policy with respect to South Africa on the
meeting agenda. She expressed her view that Regent Roach's motion
included and went beyond the intent of Regent Waters' resolution.
Regent Nederlander commented that although the group's
request was legitimate, they must realize that the University is




MARCH MEETING, 1979


227


a highly decentralized organization. It has always been the policy
of the University to obtain a divergence of opinion before action
on any important issue takes place. To do otherwise would not
be acting in the best interest of the University.
President Smith called for the vote on Regent Roach's motion.
The motion carried unanimously.
A student then asked permission to speak on the South Africa
issue indicating that she had new information for the Regents to
consider. Permission was denied.
Regent Baker stated that this was a meeting of the Regents
not the public comments session and asked that the business of
the meeting be continued.
Regent Roach commented that the opportunity to present the
information was available at the public comments session on
Thursday. Any new information the group may have can be
referred to the Senate Advisory Committee on Financial Affairs.
The committee will investigate and report to the Regents accordingly. There is no reason for departing from the usual procedure
in this business meeting.
President Smith then continued to the next item concerning
two companies in which the University holds stock.
In responding to a question, Vice-President Brinkerhoff stated
that he is waiting for additional information from Black and
Decker Manufacturing Company and G. D. Searle and Company
regarding their support of the Sullivan principles. He added that
Black and Decker have indicated that they have an affirmative
action program for their employees, and a response from G. D.
Searle and Company is expected next month.
Regent Roach said that University policy states that if companies did not specifically adopt the Sullivan principles, their
program must be substantially equivalent. He asked that whatever
response these companies make must be brought to the attention
of the Board of Regents in April for evaluation. The Board would
hope that these companies would take appropriate action in
accordance with the Board's request. He said he was satisfied
with Seattle First National Bank's policy, but the activities of
the Union Bank should be closely monitored because of the pending
merger of that bank with the Standard Chartered Bank Limited
of London. Since the University is not involved in any way with
the above mentioned banks, the Regents were only concerned
with the policies of the Black and Decker Company and G. D.
Searle and Company at this time.
Regent Dunn indicated that a year was more than enough time
for these companies to have responded to the University's request;
therefore, if affirmation is not received by the next Regents' meet

Meeting Recessed


ing, he is prepared to move divestment of University owned stocks
in these companies at the April meeting.
Repeated attempts to continue the regular business meeting
were constantly interrupted by the audience. Regent Baker stated
that in his opinion "a breach of the peace" was occurring through
the actions of the members of the Washtenaw County Coalition
against Apartheid (WCCAA) and that a breach of the peace had
taken place by that same group at the Regents' meeting on
Thursday, March 15th, inasmuch as the actions of the WCCAA
apparently violated the law and since they would not desist in
their disruptive actions, Regent Baker left the room leaving only
four members of the Board of Regents present. A quorum was not
then present. The meeting was then recessed. Upon their return,
Regent Roach moved that the rules of the meeting be suspended
to permit Anne Fullerton, a graduate student of public health,
to speak for five minutes on the issue of South African investments.
Ms. Fullerton summarized a report which contained information which she felt indicated action by the Regents to divest the
University portfolio of all stocks held by the University in companies doing business in South Africa. Ms. Fullerton was permitted
to speak for 22 minutes to conclude her speech.
The audience continued to disrupt the meeting and the chairman called a recess.
The Regents reconvened at 3:00 P.M. in the President's Conference room. Due to a prior commitment, Regent Dunn was
absent. Regent Laro returned to the meeting.
President Smith reviewed the events that led to changing the
location of the meeting of the Board of Regents. He noted that
after completion of the first item on the agenda, he had altered
the meeting schedule to accommodate the interest of the large
group attending the meeting. The Regents were prepared to
respond to the public comments of the previous day by asking for
a reconsideration or at least a review of the University's present
policy on financial investments with corporations doing business
in South Africa. A motion was made and adopted which, in effect,
gave the group requesting attention the success of having the
policy re-examined and clearly providing at some point in the
future an opportunity for affirmation or modification of the University's present policy. This action was less than the group wanted
and they persisted in demanding immediate action on the question
of divestiture.
The Board's function is to determine policy, to listen to reports,
and to insist upon multiple audiences being heard before important
decisions are made. The Board felt strongly that this practice
should not be modified in this case, therefore, they were quite

unwilling to make any determination at this meeting, nor were
they willing to set a date for a hearing on the examination of that
policy other than the first meeting after the report was received.
It is believed that that procedure, practice, and attitude is in the
best interest of the University and all of its constituents.
Under Section 3(6) of the Open Meetings Act, the University
would have been entitled to declare a breech of the peace because
of the disruption of the meeting and to clear the room of those
guilty of this breech. The result of this action most likely would
have necessitated massive police action which the University
wished to avoid if another way could be found to restore order
to the meeting. It was the opinion of the Regents and the Officers
that it would be a mistake to abandon the scheduled meeting
without accomplishing the routine monthly business of the University. A way within the law was sought to enable the Regents
to continue their meeting without forceful intervention. Upon
advice of General Counsel, an Ex-Parte Temporary Restraining
Order was sought and was issued by the Circuit Court of the
County of Washtenaw. Mr. Smith then read the order into the
record as follows:
EX-PARTE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER                       Restraining Order
At a session of said Court held in the Washtenaw County Building,
Ann Arbor, Michigan, on this 16th day of March, 1979.
PRESENT: HON. HAROLD VAN DOMELEN
Circuit Judge presiding
The Court having reviewed plaintiff's Verified Complaint For Declaratory Judgment, Injunctive and Other Relief, together with supporting
Affidavits, and being fully advised in the premises; now, therefore,
1. IT Is ORDERED that pending a hearing on said Verified Complaint and
until further Order of this Court, the defendants, their officers, agents, employees, organizers, members, representatives and all others having actual
notice of this Order be and are hereby restrained and enjoined from in any
way interfering with the meetings of plaintiff's Board of Regents, members
of the press and those persons having legitimate business before said Board.
2. IT Is FURTHER ORDERED that pending further Order of this Court the
plaintiff is authorized to relocate its regularly scheduled and noticed meetings
of the Board of Regents from the usual meeting place on the first floor of
the Administration Building to the Regents Room on the second floor of
said Building, or, if necessary in the reasonable discretion of the plaintiff, to
some other location safe and secure from the activities and threatened activities of defendants.
3. IT Is FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiff is authorized to close said
meetings to members of the public and to admit only members of the Press
and other persons within plaintiff's discretion, and to lock the doors to said
meetings.
4. Such Temporary Restraining Order is granted without notice for the
reason that it appears to the Court that immediate judicial relief is necessary
to preserve the public peace and safety and to prevent injury to persons and




230

defendants cannot be summoned and brought before the Court promptly
enough to hold a hearing.
5. The Temporary Restraining Order issued at Ann Arbor, Michigan,
this 16th day of March, 1979, at 2:05 o'clock in the afternoon.
/S/ Harold Van Domelen
Circuit Judge
March 16, 1979
Prospective  Vice-President Shapiro then summarized the new program of
Scholars rogram recruitment and academic recognition for entering freshmen at
the Ann Arbor campus. "The Prospective Scholars Program" offers
three types of merit scholarships: the Regents-Alumni Merit
Scholarships for in-state students, the Michigan Annual Giving
Scholarships and the Academic Recognition Scholarships for outstate students. The cohesiveness of the program should better
enable the University to compete for the best students both in-state
and out-state.
I. MINUTES
The minutes of the meeting of February 15 and 16, 1979 were

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of one faculty
member. The following memoir was adopted.
R. Rapp,     ROBERT RAPP, M.D., Associate Professor of Radiology has retired
Retreemmeot from active faculty status as of January 10, 1979, after a most productive
career in teaching, research, patient care and administration.
Dr. Rapp received his M.D. in 1946 from Temple University School of
Medicine and had an internship and residency training in diagnostic radiology at the Reading General Hospital, Reading, Pennsylvania. He then
entered military service and from 1948-50 served as Associate Chief and then
Chief of Diagnostic Roentgenology at the 387th Station Hospital, U.S. Army,
in Stuttgart, Germany. Following his military service, he came to The
University of Michigan for a three year training period in radiology. Dr. Rapp
was appointed an Instructor of Radiology in 1953 and with the opening of the
Veterans Administration Hospital in October 1953, he assumed direction of
that department. In 1956 he was promoted to Assistant Professor and was
formally elevated to the title of Chief of Radiology at the Veterans Administration Hospital. In July of 1963 he was promoted to Associate
Professor.
With the exception of his Army service, Dr. Rapp's entire professional
career has been devoted to the patient care, teaching and research programs
at The University of Michigan as carried out at the Veterans Administration
Hospital. He has made significant contributions to our teaching program both
in residency training and in the senior elective program. In addition, he
participated in collaborative research with his colleagues on the staff of the
Veterans Administration Hospital. As the only Chief of Radiology which
that hospital has had to date, Dr. Rapp was instrumental in opening up the
facilities and putting them into operation as well as more recently overseeing
complete revision and expansion of the radiologic facilities which are now
second to none in the Ann Arbor area. The design of the installation and
the actual installation of the first body scanner in the Ann Arbor area was
accomplished under his administration. This installation has made a significant
contribution to the patient care programs in the Ann Arbor area and to the
teaching programs in many departments of the Veterans Hospital and the
University Hospital as well.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his
dedicated service by naming him Associate Professor Emeritus of Radiology.
VII. DEATHS
Vice-President Shapiro reported the deaths of Professor Emeritus Arthur Bromage and Dean Emeritus Henry Vaughan. He said
that Dean Vaughan essentially created the School of Public Health
and was a most distinguished personality ever to be at the
University.

individuals, corporations, and even governments. One group has
asked the University not to dispense Nestle products in its dining
halls because the company is said to endanger the health of infants
by promoting the use of powdered formula in Third World countries. Other groups have urged us to divest all of our stock in
companies doing business in South Africa. Still others have argued
that we should return a gift and refuse to name a library after a
man who made a substantial part of his fortune in South African
mining. Finally, a few students petitioned us last December to
suspend a contract on the planning of a new university in Iran
and issue a declaration that we would not resume work until
martial law was lifted and a civilian government installed.
"Universities are designed to achieve particular purposes. Their
special mission is the discovery and transmission of knowledge.
In performing these functions, they may receive support from
many sources in society. Their members may have a wide variety
of relationships with public and private organizations. Their professors may affect many areas of society through teaching and
research. Nevertheless, unlike other organizations, such as political
parties, environmental associations, or civil rights groups, their
institutional goal is not to reform society in specific ways. Universities have neither the mandate nor the competence to administer foreign policy, set our social and economic priorities,
enforce standards of conduct in the society, or carry out other
social functions apart from learning and discovery.
"Since universities play such an important role in our society,
any policy that threatens their academic functions takes on a
significance that transcends the private interests of individual
students and faculty members. Although this point may seem
obvious, it has not been universally respected. In many countries
today, as in the past, individuals within and outside the university
try repeatedly to use the institution as an instrument to influence
political disputes and affect other controversies in the larger
society. These efforts have weakened universities abroad by distracting their members from teaching and learning and by inviting
outside interference to control their activities for political ends.
"All persons should be completely free to form their opinions,
communicate them openly, and join with others as individuals to
work for their adoption. This liberty includes the right to express
the most unconventional and unpopular views, even if they offend
other members of the university community or arouse the anger
of powerful groups in the society.
"Intellectual freedom is not a condition that is merely desirable.
It is essential to the progress of learning and discovery to which
the institution is committed, and any course of action that endangers it must arouse the gravest concern. This is why universities




MARCH MEETING, 1979


251


have long been skeptical of proposals that would lead them to
establish an offiical morality by taking institutional positions on
ethical and political questions.
"Proposals to have Harvard sever its connection with other
institutions and governments for political or moral reasons often
have an objective beyond merely asking the University to make its
position clear. They represent an effort to obtain precisely that
'institutional political commitment... carried into active support'
that the Governance Committee rejected so emphatically. By
inducing Harvard to break off relations, proponents hope to attract
publicity, strengthen an economic boycott, or otherwise bring
pressure to bear against those who are thought to be acting
immorally. Such objectives give rise to a second concern. For
many decades, universities have struggled to be free from pressures
exerted by other groups in the society to compromise our academic
freedom and intrude upon our right to make our own academic
decisions. This protection from outside influence is essential to the
integrity of instruction and research. It is the shield that guards
the right of all who teach and learn to express their own convictions however unorthodox or unsettling they may be.
"If we wish to preserve our independence, we should remember
that society respects the freedom of academic institutions only
because it assumes that they will devote themselves to the academic pursuits for which that freedom was extended. This does
not mean that universities cannot influence events beyond the
campus. It does mean that such influence should be exerted only
by fostering the reasoned expression of ideas and arguments.
Universities that violate this social compact do so at their peril.
They cannot expect to remain free of outside interference if they
insist on arrogating to themselves the right to use economic
leverage to influence the activities of others. As a result, universities that cherish their academic freedom should properly look
with suspicion at proposals to participate in boycotts or resort to
other forms of economic pressure.
"If the University is to act in a principal fashion, it must also
avoid dealing with moral issues on an ad hoc basis and must try
instead to apply its standards consistently. It has an obligation
to ascertain all the relevant facts and to offer each party to the
dispute an opportunity to state its views. An undertaking of this
kind can impose a heavy burden of time and effort on faculty
members and administrators, especially if the University must
take on the task of assuring itself of the ethical standards of all
donors, all suppliers, and all corporations with which it has relationships. In the end, this burden will inevitably fall on the academic work of the institution by diverting time and resources from
teaching and research.




252


MARCH MEETING, 1979


"Injustice and suffering are plainly matters of grave concern.
We may justly feel impelled to give our time and effort as individuals to the struggle against these evils. We may also expect
the University not to act deliberately to increase the sufferings
of others. But the principal issue before us is whether we should
go further and use the University as a means of expressing moral
disapproval or as a weapon in our fight against injustice even if
we threaten to injure the academic functions of the institution."
"One may still ask that the University take account of injuries
elsewhere in the world, even if its acts are only symbolic. Nevertheless, there comes a point where symbolism must give away to
real threats to academic freedom, real financial losses, and real
administrative burdens. If we do not acknowledge this point, we
will merely succeed in damaging important functions of the
University without doing anything to alleviate the suffering of
others in seeking to improve the human conditions, we may end
by only making it worse."
Turner Geriatric  The Regents received an informational item      on the Turner
Clinic,....
Geriatric Clinic.
Euctol of    Regent Nederlander moved approval of the following resoluEducation,
Resolution tion. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The Regents of The University of Michigan salute the School of Education on the occasion of its Centennial year. Established in 1879, by Regental
action, as the Professorship of the Science and Art of Teaching and organized
as the School of Education, also by Regental action, in 1921, its Faculty
has won worldwide acclaim for its contributions to the study of Education
within a university context. In Michigan the School has been a recognized
leader in the education of secondary school teachers from the time of its
inception and of elementary school teachers for the past thirty-five years.
It has played a crucial role in the development of school administration and
in the creation of a profession of teaching throughout the United States. Its
Faculty should be recognized also for the allied efforts to promote educational
process in other professions and social institutions. Over the century of its
existence the School has consistently been ranked as a graduate department
of highest quality. Its alumni occupy posts of distinction at every level.
A unique feature of the work of the School has been its close assocation
with the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, and other undergraduate
schools, in the education of teachers and with graduate departments of the
University in the award of thousands of M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. Thus,
praise for its century of contributions must include commendations to
associated schools and colleges.
The School has extended service through class instruction and consultation to citizen groups, school boards and administrators, teachers and other
educators in virtually every community in the upper and lower peninsulas.
The Regents applaud the School of Education for its leadership in
teaching, research and service to the University and to other educational
institutions and extend their commendations, congratulations and good wishes
as the School enters its second century.

Regent Nederlander then read the following resolution:               esolution
A Salute to Professor and Mrs. William Haber
Upon the Occasion of their Eightieth Birthday
One cannot conceive of The University of Michigan and the City of
Ann Arbor without the consciousness that somehow at the very center,
making the communities of town and gown revolve as harmoniously as the
planets around the sun, are Bill and Fanny Haber.
Bill, professor, dean, and advisor to successive administrations is revered
and beloved by all. Born in Milwaukee, he grew up in the slums of the
Economics Building. There he so distinguished himself that he was made
Dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Under his inspired
leadership the College grew in size and prestige, and incidentally when he was
Dean, faculty meetings were so well attended they had to be held in Trueblood Auditorium. As roving diplomat to presidents of the University, Bill,
in times of peace and war, is always keen, always witty, always indispensable.
And what a helpmeet for him and for us is Fanny! While Bill was
mastering the discipline of Economics, she walked out of the thirty-first
chapter of the Book of Proverbs-a worthy woman, her price is far above
rubies; the heart of her husband trusteth her; she doeth good and not evil
all the days of her life. Beautiful, charming, generous as wife, mother, and
hostess, Fanny is also indispensable.
During the month that Bill and Fanny Haber together reach the enviable
age of EIGHTY, we tender them this resolution in token of our esteem and
affection.
All of the above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of February totaled $2,389.50.
The Regents adjourned to meet on April 19 and 20, 1979.

APRIL MEETING, 1979
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, APRIL 19, 1979
The Regents met at 1:30 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach and Waters. Chancellors Goodall and
Moran and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger,
Radock, Shapiro and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also
were present. Regent Laro was absent.
President Smith announced that because of the large group
of people to accommodate, the meeting would relocate in the
Michigan Union Ballroom.
President Smith commented that there is on the agenda an
action item concerning a portion of the University's investment
portfolio. That item will be discussed at 10:30 A.M. on Friday,
April 20. There was also an informal meeting before the commencement of the regular formal meeting between some black
students and some Regents concerning recruitment and retention
of minority students. The Regents have suggested that this topic
be placed on the agenda for discussion immediately following the
investment discussion.
Vice-President Johnson then reviewed the financial report and
the audit report concerning Michigan Student Assembly.
In response to questions by the Regents, Vice-President Johnson indicated that the 1978-79 Michigan Student Assembly
budget did not include reimbursement to the Michigan Union
for rent; did include all but $5,000 of personnel expenditures; the
sizeable allocation to the Tenants Union reflected the six-cent
assessment approved by the Regents in July, 1978; and all
requests for funds are submitted to the budget priorities committee. Mr. Johnson noted that the general fund support for
personnel would cease and that allocation will be used for other
internal student services needs. Also, almost 180 requests for
funding were received from various organizations of which all but
a few were honored.
President Smith remarked that the term of the request for
the student fee assessment was amended to a two-year period
rather than a three-year period. In his brief exposure to Michigan
Student Assembly this year, Mr. Smith felt that the organization

performed creditably and responsibly in meeting the needs of
the students. However, problems have arisen concerning the recent
election results. Because of the challenges to the election, results
cannot be certified until a review of the procedures takes place,
and in order to maintain the integrity of MSA and the continuity
of the  fee assessment and operation, the Executive Officers
recommend that the Regents authorize and direct:
1. That the Vice-President for Student Services review the
current MSA election results and the procedures utilized
and determine whether or not the results of the election
of April 19, 1979, should be certified.
2. That the Vice-President for Student Services determine
certification, or lack of certification, of said results pending
such review.
3. That the fee allocation request for MSA be administered
by the Vice-President for Student Services until he determines whether or not MSA is in a mode of operation capable
of managing its organizational and fiscal affairs.
Regent Baker recalled his earlier request to study the feasibility of incorporating legal aid services in the University Counsel's
office.
Investment  At this point the audience interrupted the meeting for approxiPolicies in
South Africa mately five minutes shouting for divestiture of investments from
South Africa.
Regent Baker stated that the purpose and progress of the
meeting had been interrupted, and, in his judgment, a breach
of the peace had just occurred. Referring to his comments before
the interruption, he asked if this study had been completed. If not,
other suggestions or recommendations could not be considered
until that alternative was examined.
There was further discussion with respect to providing a report
noting the kinds of problems with which the legal aid services deal,
the appropriateness of imposing a burden on students for contributions to causes, organizations, and functions that all students
do not necessarily support.
Regent Roach then stated that since there was a student
scheduled to speak to this issue during the public comments
session, it would be inappropriate to take action at this time. He
moved to table action until the Friday meeting. Regent Baker
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Family Housing  Mr. Robert Hughes and Mr. Norman Snustad, director and
Rates associate director of University Housing respectively, reviewed the
recommendation to continue the family housing rates for 1979-80

at the current level and reviewed the resolution to increase the
contribution paid to the Ann Arbor Public Schools for services
to children living in the University Family Housing from $6.00
to $9.00 per apartment. After discussion, Regent Baker moved
to approve both the recommendation and the resolution. Regent
Roach seconded the motion and they were adopted. The resolution
follows.
RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF             Family Housing
MICHIGAN AUTHORIZING THE FAMILY HOUSING                Resolution
CONTRIBUTION TO THE ANN ARBOR SCHOOL
BOARD TO BE INCREASED
WHEREAS, the Family Housing contribution to the Ann Arbor School
Board has not been increased since it was instituted in August of 1970; and
WHEREAS, during that time the number of school age children living in
Family Housing has increased from 380 to 700 during the current school
year; and
WHEREAS, the Family Housing Advisory Board recognizes the high
quality of education afforded children living in Family Housing;
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the current contribution of $6.00 per
unit per month be increased to $9.00 per unit per month, effective August 1,
1979.
Regent Dunn moved to approve the recommendation to in-     Student Health
crease the student health services fee to $23.00 per student per  IncreaFee
term for the fall and winter terms; $12.00 per student for the
spring term and $12.00 per student for the summer term. Regent
Nederlander seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Vice-President Shapiro reviewed the tuition range schedules  Tuition
for 1979-80 for all three campuses. He explained that these
schedules are submitted at this time to inform the students before
leaving campus for the summer the possible tuition levels for the
next academic year. A final recommendation will be presented
to the Regents when the final budget for 1979-80 has been
determined.
Chancellor Moran reviewed the background of the Recreation  Recreation
Facility at Flint and described the preliminary plans and sche- Faciity-UMmatic design of the project. He also presented to the Regents a
proposed capital budget.
After discusion, Regent Waters moved to approve the schematic design; to authorize proceeding with the working drawings;
and to approve the updated budget. Regent Roach seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
I. MINUTES
Secretary Kennedy announced that corrections to the minutes
of April 19 and 20 were received from Regents Baker, Power and

Since 1960, Mr. Choate has been a Lecturer in the Law School, teaching
a highly regarded course in patent law. His intimate knowledge of the field,
his conscientious preparation and skilled presentation of a demanding subject, and his genuine concern for students have won for him the respect

followed him into a career in patent law, and a number have been led by
his example to teach patent law at other institutions.
In addition to maintaining an active practice and teaching at the Law
School, Mr. Choate has found time to make important professional contributions. He has delivered lectures before professional audiences; authored
articles in professional publications, including the Michigan Law Review
and the Journal of the Patent Office Society; and edited a widely-adopted
casebook on Patent Law. During 1963-64, he served as President of the

Public Comments   The Regents then heard comments from Sheila Mayberry and
Blaise Supler concerning discrimination against the women's track
team; Joshua Banner spoke on voluntary vs. mandatory MSA
funding; Richard Pace on the Open Meetings Act; and Greg Dow,
Pat Anderson, Donald Alexander, Professor Alan Wald, Professor
Daniel Fusfeld, Professor Thomas Weiskopf, Professor William
Derman and Professor Joel Samoff with respect to South African
investments. At the conclusion of this session the Regents returned
to the Regents' room to continue the meeting.
Non-Competitive   Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the request to eliminate
Purchases Report
Purchases Rport the listing of "B" items in the quarterly report on non-competitive
purchases. These items consist of the standardization or matching
material requirement of certain purchases.
Regent Roach moved to eliminate part "B" from the quarterly
report, with the exception of professional services which can be
included in the first part of the report. Regent Nederlander
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Membership    Regent Nederlander moved to approve membership in the
Approved Hospital Purchasing Service for University Hospital. Regent
Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.

APRIL MEETING, 1979


269


Northwood II and III gas line replacement; Residence Halls
emergency lighting phase I; and improvements to Fuller recreation
field. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the recommendation to  University
Terrace
appoint an architect to analyze and to determine whether it Apartments
would be economical to rehabilitate University Terrace apartments
to accommodate single student housing rather than married
student housing.
Regent Baker commented that there is underway at the
present time an overall site study of the hospital area. The site
study involves old St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, traffic approaches
and the impact on the city. Until that study has been completed,
the University ought not do anything that might be affected
by the results of that study.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that if the site study
reveals a need for this land for hospital purposes in the near
term then the University would not consider proceeding with the
project.
The Regents concurred with Regent Baker that it would be
unwise to appoint an architect at this time and the item was
deferred until the site plan studies for the hospital area are
completed.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff then reviewed the performance of Endowment
the University's endowment fund which had been stated inac- Fund
curately in a Detroit newspaper. He said the fundamental issue
is how well the University's investment program is doing in terms
of generating spendable income while at the same time keeping
the principle values abreast of inflation. It has been the practice
of the University to invest in blue chip stocks which have not
fared so well from a market standpoint, but which have done very
well in terms of producing increased spendable income. On a tenyear basis the University's total return has been better than twothirds of those endowment funds that have been evaluated. The
University's investment advisors have been instructed to emphasize
income while maintaining a portfolio of well managed companies
in which the principle value can improve over the long term.
The Regents accepted the report and urged that care be taken
to protect the capital that has been contributed to the University.
Chancellor Moran reviewed an earlier agreement with the  Conveyance of
Land Agreement,
City of Flint for the conveyance of land which called for the City  UM-Flint
to convey clear title to the University for the 42-acre riverfront
campus site and to do associate demolition and site preparation
work by the end of 1974.
By 1978 all but two parking facilities had been conveyed to




270


APRIL MEETING, 1979


the University. The City is now willing to convey the remaining
properties if the University would agree to lease back to the City
part of the parking facilities, at no cost, until March 1, 1993.
Regent Baker suggested that the University's intention to use
the facilities for its own purposes after March of 1993 be included
in the agreement.
Regent Brown concurred and moved to authorize UM-Flint
to sign the following supplemental City/University agreement for
conveyance of land and incorporate the University's intention for
uses in 1993. Regent Waters seconded the motion and it was
adopted.

ramp during the Fall, 1979 semester by the University. The University agrees
to determine by January 7, 1980 whether or not said spiral ramp can be
removed. If the University determines it can be removed without reducing
the efficiency of the structure, the University will lease said ramp side
identified as Parcel #3 on attached Exhibit B, to the City on the same terms
set forth in paragraph 8 above, and permit the City to remove the spiral
ramp. The City will, within twelve (12) months of said removal, construct
a lighted surface parking lot on said site, with a landscaped buffer of approximately twenty (20) feet along Clifford Street, and increase the landscaped

273


buffer along Harrison Street to approximately twice the size of otherwise
specified for Parcel #1 in paragraph 9 above.
12. The City and the University agree that all constructed elements and
landscaping on Parcel #1, 2 and 3 referred to above will be performed
pursuant to site development plans mutually agreed upon.
13. Until March 1, 1993, the City agrees to provide one hundred (100)
parking spaces to the University in exchange for parking places to be provided
by the University to the City on University land north of the existing
Harrison Street parking structure and south of the existing Kearsley Street
parking structure and further described as:
DCD block 23, parcel 2, 3 and 4
DCD block 22, parcel 14 and that portion of parcel #1 as described
in the attached Exhibit B-2
The City further agrees to provide these spaces within reasonable proximity
to the University campus at a mutually agreeable location. If no other
location is mutually agreeable, the one hundred (100) spaces will be provided
at the Farmers Market on days when the Market is closed, provided that the
Market's present schedule of closed days is not appreciably changed.
14. The City agrees to permit University use of the City constructed
surface parking lots described in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 above at such times
as the parking lots are not required by the manager of the City's parking
system for the system's normal operation.
15. So long as the City has the duty enforceable against it under Federal
or State law to clean out the sedimentation basin located in the Flint River
between the existing Hamilton Dam and existing Stevens Street Bridge, the
University agrees to grant the City all reasonable access to University property for purposes of cleaning out said basin, provided that the City shall
first satisfy the University that it has exhausted all other means of cleaning
said basin from other locations. Through December 31, 1983, while different
methods for removing sedimentation are being tested, the University will
permit such reasonable access within twenty five (25) feet of the riverbank
for truck and equipment service for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days
per year. Beyond 1983, the means of access will be as mutually agreed upon.
At no time shall the City be charged by the University for the use of University property for sedimentation removal.
16. The University agrees to permit public access to the Hamilton Dam
and to University riverbank property upstream from the existing Stevens
Street Bridge for fishing (but not for boat access) as long as such public
access does not unreasonably interfere with the University's use of its
property and so long as the City provides public access to the Hamilton
Dam on the north side of the river and to riverbank property upstream
from the existing Stevens Street Bridge now owned or controlled by the City,
or acquired by the City in the future, in the same manner, so as not to concentrate fishing on the property of either party.
17. So long as the City maintains a hikeway/bikeway along the Flint
River, the University agrees to permit the City to keep and maintain that
portion of the hikeway/bikeway which crosses University property on said
property, provided however, that no alterations to the hikeway/bikeway
shall be made by the City without the prior approval of the University, and
further provided that the University may, at its own expense, relocate said
hikeway/bikeway on its property so long as the continuous path of said
hikeway/bikeway is not interrupted.
18. The University agrees to allow the City reasonable access for purposes of maintaining its water and sewer utilities on University property,




274                 APRIL MEETING, 1979
provided that said access rights shall be limited to a strip of land along
the said water and sewer lines and within seven and one-half (7/2) feet
of either side of the center of said water and sewer lines.
19. This supplemental agreement shall not be construed as amending
the Agreement of November 6, 1973, or diminishing the rights thereby
created, but is intended and understood to be an addition to and statement
of the means by which the purposes of said Agreement will be finally
completed and is intended to be evidence of what both parties understand
to be the remaining obligation toward finally completing performance
under said Agreement.
20. The University's obligations as expressed in this Supplemental Agreement shall be unenforceable unless and until the conditions expressed in
paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 thereof have been met by the City.
In WITNESS WHEREOF, the City and the University have caused this Supplemental Agreement to be duly executed on the...... day of......,1979.

APRIL MEETING, 1979


275


FRIDAY, APRIL 20, 1979
The Regents reconvened at 9:00 A.M. in the Michigan Union
Ballroom.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Laro, Nederlander, Roach, Power and Waters. Chancellors Goodall
and Moran and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger,
Radock, Shapiro, and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also
were present.
President Smith commented that the next item on the agenda
was the Michigan Student Assembly fee assessment. The recommendation would continue the assessment of $2.92 per student
for a period of two years with an option to return next year should
there be a requirement for an increase. The supplemental item concerning the administration of the MSA fee was designed to provide
University responsibilty for the fee allocation pending a resolution
of the validity and effect of the election process that took place
this spring.
Regent Nederlander moved to adopt the fee assessment as
recommended.
Regent Roach said that since there was a problem of not
having a legally constituted student government at the moment,
the resolution recommended by the Executive Officers and presented to the Regents at Thursday's meeting should be acted upon
first so there would be a trustee to receive any fees levied. He then
moved to approve the resolution. Regent Nederlander seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
Regent Roach then noted that there was the question of the
proper administration of student legal aid services. A report had
been requested to determine whether the program should be administered under an independent board, the auspices of MSA, the
Office for Student Services, or the University General Counsel's
office. He asked if it would be more appropriate to continue funding the existing organization and make the final determination as
to the ultimate disposition of those funds when the report has
been received and acted upon.
Regent Baker remarked that the University should not allow
the development of an independent organization which would be
beyond the control of the University administration. The University should carefully examine the proposed concept of a separate
legal aid organization with a separate Board of Directors which
could bring suit in many ways against the University. He said
that if legal services to students was a proper function of a
university community then establishing this organiaztion under
the University's General Counsel should be considered.


Michigan Student

Assessment




276


APRIL MEETING, 1979


In response to Regent Nederlander's concern of accountability
each year, President Smith said that the suggestion of a two-year
period was to assure some position security in the legal aid office
which at present is rather tenuous.
As an opponent of mandatory fees levied upon students except
for those which are considered necessary functions, such as health
services, Regent Baker questioned the validity of legal aid services
meeting this criteria.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve the Michigan Student
Assembly fee assessment for a one-year period. Regent Brown
seconded the motion.
Vice-President Johnson responded to Regent Power's question
of job security by commenting that granting the assessment to
continue for a two-year period would certainly provide a more
secure position for the professional staff, and would also provide
more continuity for their programs.
Regent Roach then moved to amend the original motion to
establish an assessment of $1.89 for legal aid services and the
course evaluation project for a two-year period, and the remainder
of the assessment ($1.03) to MSA for a one-year period. Regent
Power seconded the motion.
Regent Baker listed several organizations which were funded
by MSA during the past year. He commented that university
communities have the freedom to support any point of view, but
this is done on a voluntary basis. The funds contributed by all
students are sometimes allocated to organizations that are not
supported by every student. No one in this community should be
forced to finance a view they do not support. That part of the
assessment which supports contributions to various student organizations should be on a voluntary basis.
Regent Nederlander indicated that if the amendment to divide
the funds is approved, it would be the first time the Regents have
dictated to MSA how their funds should be allocated. He said
that he would vote against the amendment because he did not feel
it was in the best interest of the University.
Regent Roach said he was persuaded by Regent Nederlander
and would vote against his own amendment. President Smith
then called for the vote on the amendment for the division of funding. The motion failed with all Regents voting against it.
Regent Roach moved to amend the motion to approve a $2.92
student fee assessment for a one-year period provided the Executive Officers present a report to the Regents before or at the July
Regents' meeting recommending the proper administration for the
legal aid services program, and that in the interim, student legal




APRIL MEETING, 1979


277


aid services be funded at its current rate. Regent Nederlander
seconded the motion.
Regent Baker moved to further amend the motion providing
for that portion of the fees allocated to MSA for student groups
be made voluntary. Regent Laro seconded the motion.
President Smith called for the vote on Regent Baker's amendment. The motion failed with Regents Brown, Dunn, Nederlander,
Power, Roach and Waters voting no.
President Smith then called for the vote on Regent Nederlander's motion which would include Regent Roach's amendment.
The motion was adopted with Regent Baker voting no.
Dr. Douglas Sarbach and Mr. Joseph Diederich, from the  Hospital
Replacement
Office of Hospital Planing, Research and Development, reviewed  Project
two basic forms of construction management which would be
applicable to the hospital replacement project; a lump sum contract and a multiple prime contract. Due to risks, costs, and
quality of the project it is likely that some combination of the two
methods would be the best approach. They emphasized that the
opportunity for cost savings would be in the pre-design phase.
It was suggested that whatever method of construction was used
an engineering viewpoint during this phase would be most helpful
in determining the best course of action and the best method to use.
President Smith commented that although a recommendation
for action had not been included in the agenda, the administration
would like to seek professional advice as to the best procedure,
and would like to have the Regents' comments.
Regent Baker emphasized the need for a well conceived design
before methods of construction are contemplated. He said the
University should seek the advice of the best talent available to
recommend the best procedure for the design/build concept.
Regent Laro commented that any method other than the lump
sum method involves the risk of exceeding the budget. He had
known instances where the lump sum method was preferable and
he suggested careful consideration for this method.
Regent Roach stated that utilization of a guaranteed maximum
price would provide the same protection as a lump sum price, but
would allow for fast tracking. He said he was comfortable with
the concept of considering the fast track method as long as a
guaranteed maximum price was set.
Regent Baker then moved to authorize the Hospital Executive
Board to search and retain the most qualified consultant available
to determine among all possible alternatives, the best contract
letting method with the specific condition that the consultant not




278


APRIL MEETING, 1979


be a candidate as the contractor. Regent Roach seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
Hospital Budget  Vice-President Brinkerhoff indicated that the Hospital budget
for 1979-80 was presented to the Regents at this time because it
is subject to an audit by the appropriate agencies to determine
if the cost control elements are appropriately introduced into the
budget.
Dr. Jeptha Dalston, Director of University Hospital, reviewed
the budget and said the emphasis for the coming year would be
on improvement in support services, continuity of budgeting approach, increases in patient care, and equipment replacement. The
Hospital has worked closely with the medical staff, the Medical
School, the other schools of the health professions and the University officers in the development of this proposal.
Mr. Edward Schwartz, Sr. Associate Director and Hospital
Financial Officer, reviewed the details of the proposed budget. He
said it was anticipated that 32 licensed beds, which were closed
most of this last year because of construction, would be reactivated.
An occupancy level of 83.8 percent is forecast and will be monitored carefully in conjunction with the activation of licensed beds.
Medical Geriatric  Regent Power inquired about her request for a presentation
from the Medical School and the University Hospital for a Medical
geriatric program. She urged that adequate provision be made for
this program in this budget in order to ensure the University's
leadership in this field.
In response to Regent Baker's concern regarding the escalating
room costs at the Hospital, Dr. Dalston commented that the
Hospital has a strong cost containment policy and the rates have
not been excessive comparatively.
Regent Dunn then moved to approve the Hospital's 1979-80
revenue and expense budgets, incorporating the Hospital commitments, supportive services and programs to activate licensed beds,
and to approve the daily service charge rate increase of $25.00.
Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
South African  President Smith introduced the item on the agenda concerning
Investments the status of University stock holdings in Black and Decker and
G. D. Searle companies. He noted that representatives from the
Washtenaw County Coalition Against Apartheid had been invited
to participate in the discussion. He observed that the item concerning minority student recruitment and retention would follow
this item.
The Coalition representatives asked that the Regents proceed
to vote on the issue of Black and Decker and G. D. Searle and
that their presentation would follow.




APRIL MEETING, 1979


279


President Smith commented that such action would not be
appropriate since the Regents vote on issues after they hear discussion, not before it.
A student proceeded to comment for the Coalition. She noted
that even if the Regents voted to divest University interests in
Black and Decker and G. D. Searle, the Coalition would continue
to press for total divestment. She continued that the Regents'
policy of March 1978 on divestment was not responsive to the
overwhelming support for total divestment. She expressed the view
that the Regents were not even effectively implementing their own
policy.
President Smith commented that the issue is not simply one
of total divestment. Many responsible leaders in this country have
advocated a policy similar to this University's. Large numbers
of distinguished universities have adopted similar policies or have
chosen not to become involved in the issue at all.
The issue for us is what action by what parties is most likely
to produce a change in the political and social institutions of
South Africa to which we all object. He said he found it hard to
believe that total divestment could accomplish any such changes.
The policy adopted by the Regents, in his opinion, is much more
likely to succeed in accomplishing those changes everyone wants.
Heidi Gottfried then narrated a slide presentation depicting
conditions in South Africa, the system of apartheid and its affect
on living conditions and places of public accommodation.
VicePresident Brinkerhoff then presented his recommendations
with respect to the Black and Decker and G. D. Searle stocks. He
noted that his original recommendation was to divest both stocks.
He now believed that further conversations with G. D. Searle
might result in having that company comply with the intent of the
Regents policy. Therefore, he recommended the prudent divestiture of Black and Decker stock and authorization to work with
the Searle Company for an additional thirty days to achieve complance with Regental policy.
A further representative of the Coalition then spoke on the
inadequacy of the Sullivan Principles as a basis for bringing about
change in South Africa.
Joel Samoff also representing the coalition spoke to the issue.
He expressed disappointment that now only one stock was recommended for divestment. He argued that the goals of the Sullivan
Principles and the goals of the Regents' policy have not been
accomplished. No significant changes have come about in South
Africa as a result of companies operating under the Sullivan Principles. He concluded that total divestment still appears to hold the
only real hope for change.




280


APRIL MEETING, 1979


Jemardari Kamara commented that divestiture of Black and
Decker stock would be a step in the right direction but left a long
way to go. He went on to demand the creation of a Committee
on Social Responsibility as outlined in a document given to the
Regents. (The document is on file with the Secretary of the
University.)
Regent Dunn then stated that thirteen months was long enough
to wait for an affirmation of the Sullivan Principles. He moved
to divest the stocks of the Black and Decker and G. D. Searle
companies. Regent Waters seconded the motion.
Regent Baker commented that no one on the Board of Regents
or on the University staff favored the apartheid policies of South
Africa. This issue is simply one of many possible ethical positions
on which the University could take a position. The question then
is whether or not the University should take any such position
regardless of the cause involved. Regent Baker then restated
quotations from President Derek Bok of Harvard which indicated
that the basic intellectual freedom which an academic community
enjoys can be sustained only by fostering reasonable expression
of ideas and arguments.
"Universities cannot remain free from outside interference if
they insist on arrogating to themselves the right to use economic
leverage to influence the activities of others."
Regent Baker continued by noting that there appeared to be
a group on campus which seemed to take up any cause for the
purpose of politicizing the University. This group includes people
who call themselves marxists, socialists and communists. While
no one denies that such groups have the right to operate on this
campus, when such groups attempt to subvert University processes
to their own ends, they do indeed threaten academic freedom.
Regent Baker felt that there had been attempts by this
organization to intimidate others on campus including the Regents
and that damages academic freedom at this University. This had
included attempts to discredit University faculty members and
intimidation of students in their dormitories. When these kinds
of activities are viewed by the public, they will react negatively
and this will inevitably injure the University.
Members of the Coalition then distributed to the Regents
copies of a petition calling for total divestment.
Regent Baker remarked that the Regents had to represent
the views of the nine million citizens of Michigan in addition to
those of the students and faculty.
Regent Roach expressed his disappointment that some speakers
on the issue of divestment had chosen to attack the Regents'




APRIL MEETING, 1979


281


motivation, intelligence and morality rather than discussing the
merits and wisdom of their differing points of views. He went on
to say that he saw little evidence that stock divestment on the part
of institutions like Michigan State University and Wisconsin or
disinvestment on the part of Poloroid had any impact on the
apartheid policy of South Africa.
On the other hand he does see some evidence of change in
South Africa. The Regents' policy is very similar to the one now
being pursued by our own State Department which is pressing to
have American businesses operating in South Africa improve
conditions for non-white employees and is demonstrating to the
South African government the widespread public opposition to
racial policies in that country.
He noted that some speakers advocated divestment so as to
bring on armed revolution. That position simply is unconscionable
from his standpoint.
Mr. Smith cited a recent commission report recommending
elimination of the last categories of job reservation and recognition
of unions for non-whites.
Regent Laro stated that he had supported the Regents' policy
including the divestment provision. In the case of the two stocks
now in question he was concerned that the policy may not be
flexible enough to accommodate to a circumstance where a company's policy was essentially the same as called for by the Sullivan
Principles. The Searle Company response, he felt, was certainly
in keeping with the intent of the Regents' policy, and he would
not support divestiture in that instance. The case of Black and
Decker is less clear but even here they have indicated their policy
to fill occupational positions in a fair and equitable way without
regard to apartheid. Thus, he was also opposed to divestiture in
this case. In light of the statement of President Bok of Harvard,
Regent Laro felt that the Regents' policy may be a politicization
of the University that will be detrimental. He cited agenda items
like investment performance and hospital costs that were not
getting proper Regental attention because of the enormous amount
of time being spent on the divestment problem. Regent Laro
announced that in view of the foregoing, he wished to reexamine
the Regents' policy at an appropriate time, and that he would
vote against the present motion.
Regent Waters agreed that the Regents' policy ought to be
reviewed and revised because, like the Sullivan Principles, it is
ineffective and inadequate. He noted that the Searle Company
response indicates the company complies with the laws of the
nations in which it does business, which means they would support
the apartheid policy. He concluded that all companies doing




282


APRIL MEETING, 1979


business in South Africa would be similarly inclined to support
the government to maximize their economic well being. That being
the case, he felt that the Regents' policy ought to provide for
divestiture of all stock in companies so involved in South Africa.
Regent Laro indicated that the G. D. Searle letter also stated
the company's policy to provide equal treatment and opportunity
for all its employees and avoid any discrimination based on race,
sex, national origin, religion, or other artificial barriers.
President Smith reminded the Regents that their overall policy
would be reviewed when the SACFA committee report was submitted.
Regent Brown said that a year ago he was pessimistic that
continued presence of American companies in South Africa was
going to do much good or that we could really evaluate that.
Evidence thus far seems to suggest that the companies haven't
been able to accomplish much. He concluded therefore that the
companies should withdraw from South Africa. He felt the best
way to accomplish this was through responsible stockholder actions
that would pressure companies to do this. Divesting stock would
eliminate any opportunity to help this.
Regent Dunn noted that his motion was based upon current
Regental policy and that it embodies a requirement for companies
to affirm the Sullivan Principles.
Regent Roach said he believed that the Regents' debate on the
original policy was clear, that it was not the Sullivan Principles
per se, but rather a company's action to enhance the social,
economic and political rights of employees that was intended.
Regent Waters said the policy states clearly affirmation of
the Sullivan Principles.
Regent Roach then quoted the last line of the policy which
stated that we would "sell the shares of any corporation which
does not within a reasonable period of time, take reasonable steps
to effectuate the purposes of this resolution." That does not mean
the Sullivan Principles was to have been the sole measure.
President Smith said that interpretation of the policy is for
the Regents to decide and there can be different interpretations.
It would, therefore, be possible to separate the two companies
given the different nature of their responses.
Regent Laro said it was a grave concern to have such an
apparent disagreement on the meaning of its own policy. It is
possible that a similar misunderstanding exists for companies being
asked to respond to the University's policy.
Regent Nederlander said that the Searle Company response
indicated that they were in substantial compliance with the prin



APRIL MEETING, 1979


283


ciples. He wanted to know what that means before taking action.
Black and Decker's response was disappointing but that could
have resulted from the inadequacy of the University's communication with them. Even so, he felt some action should be taken. He
then moved to separate the original motion and vote on the question of divestiture of the stocks of the two companies separately.
Regent Laro seconded the motion.
Regent Dunn urged a no vote on separation since both companies are not in compliance and the University should divest
both.
Regent Power called the question on Regent Dunn's original
motion.
President Smith clarified that the motion is to separate the
question of divesture of the two stocks.
The motion to separate was adopted with Regents Dunn and
Waters voting no.
President Smith then indicated that Regent Dunn's original
motion was now a motion to prudently sell the stock of Black and
Decker.
Regent Baker moved to table the motion.
Regent Dunn argued that he had already called his original
motion.
Considerable disagreement arose on parliamentary questions
surrounding the issue of how debate on a question is closed. This
was eventually resolved by a vote against Regent Dunn's call for
his motion.
Regent Baker then moved again to table, seconded by Regent
Laro. The motion was defeated with Regents Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Roach, Power, and Waters voting no.
Regent Roach then expressed his concern over the response
from Black and Decker. He then raised the question of whether
such a response should cause the University to sell the stock or
initiate a stockholder action to try to get Black and Decker to
move in the direction of the Regents' policy. Regent Roach then
moved that University Counsel find out the expense risk and
procedures involved in taking a stockholder action as suggested.
Regent Baker seconded the motion.
Regent Dunn protested that his motion was still on the floor
and Regent Roach's motion could not be considered a substitute
motion.
Considerable debate again ensued on parliamentary procedure.
Regent Roach conceded that his motion was out of order.




284


APRIL MEETING, 1979


President Smith then called for a vote on the motion to divest
the Black and Decker stock. The motion failed with Regents
Roach, Nederlander, Baker, Laro, and Brown voting no.
After further parliamentary debate, President Smith called for
a vote on the second half of the originally severed motion which
would cause the prudent sale of stock in the G. D. Searle Company.
That motion failed with Regents Roach, Nederlander, Baker, Laro
and Brown voting no.
Regent Nederlander then moved that University Counsel be
asked to report on alternative courses of action which might be
taken with respect to companies doing business in South Africa
other than divestiture of stock. Regent Laro seconded the motion
and it was adopted with Regents Dunn, Waters and Power voting
no.
Committee  Regent Waters then moved that the President establish a
on Social
Practices permanent University committee on socially responsible practices
to report directly to the Regents. The composition of the committee and its duties are to follow those outlined in the communication from the Black Student Union. Regent Brown seconded
the motion for purposes of discussion. He thought the idea had
merit but wondered whether it ought to be referred to the officers
for review.
Regent Baker then moved a substitute to refer the Committee
on Social Practices to the Executive Officers for recommendation
as to form and composition without restriction. Regent Roach
seconded the substitute motion for purposes of debate. He noted
that this was the third time such a committee had been proposed.
He felt this whole idea ought to be considered as a part of the
report of the SACFA committee.
After some further discussion, the substitute motion was
adopted with Regents Dunn, Power, and Waters voting no and
Regent Roach abstaining.
W. Moran   President Smith then announced that Chancellor William
Appointed
Chancellor, Moran had just been named Chancellor of the University of North
NUivertyh i f Carolina at Greensboro and expressed the University's gratitude
at Greensboro and congratulations.
Black Student  President Smith then indicated that at an earlier meeting with
Union Requesting Regent Waters and others that the Black Student Union had
requested a task force to evaluate supportive service programs and
recommend any changes.
Vice-President Shapiro expressed his support for the idea.
President Smith then introduced Randy Potts who spoke to
the need for such a task force.




APRIL MEETING, 1979


285


Regent Waters then moved that the task force requested by
the Black Student Union at a meeting prior to Thursday's Regents'
meeting be formed by the President to be composed of six minority
students, two staff members, two administrators, and two faculty
members to carry out all the purposes indicated in the Black
Student Union memorandum dated April 19, 1979. Regent Baker
seconded the motion.
Regent Power commented that she had participated in the
earlier meeting with concerned black students. She thought it was
an excellent example of administrative, student, staff participation,
and that from the discussion it was clear that the University has
some very tough problems related to recruitment and retention
of students from minority groups. She regretted not having more
time for discussion on this matter.
Regent Baker also voiced his support for the task force and
its work toward goals that the Regents and others have in common.
The motion was adopted unanimously.
For the record, Regent Power then expressed her hope that
means could be found by which deliberations of the Regents could
be accomplished more smoothly at future meetings.
The meeting was adjourned with remaining items being deferred until the meeting scheduled for May 17 and 18, 1979.
All the above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of March totaled $1,367.88.
The Regents adjourned to meet on May 17 and 18, 1979.

MAY MEETING, 1979
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, MAY 17, 1979
The Regents met at 2:00 P.M. at the Fair Lane Conference
Center at The University of Michigan-Dearborn.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Nederlander, Power, Roach and Waters. Chancellors Goodall and
Moran and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger,
Radock, Shapiro and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also
were present. Regent Laro was absent.
President Smith commented that at the April meeting a report Women's Track

submitted to the Board by Sheila Mayberry and Blaise Supler,
students of the University and members of the Women's Track
Team. The Athletic Department's response to those allegations
and a reply by the two women to those responses were now before
the Board.
The discussion that followed revolved around the issues of
unproductive efforts to arrange an informal meeting between
Ms. Mayberry, Ms. Supler and Mr. Charles Harris, Assistant
Athletic Director, as suggested last month; the inadequate scheduling of facilities for the women's track team for practice; the
budget allocations for women's vs. men's track team; and the
number of and standards for competitive varsity participants
between men's and women's teams.
It was pointed out that the formal grievance procedure involves
an informal conference as the initial step. Since a meeting could
not be arranged before Ms. Mayberry and Supler left the campus
in April, it was suggested that perhaps the three parties involved
could now set a definite time for a conference.
Regent Roach stated that he felt it was inappropriate for the
Regents to become involved in the substance of the dispute, since
the Board of Regents would be the final judicatory authority.
He urged that a time be set now for an informal conference.
If the conference failed to solve the issues, a formal grievance
procedure should be initiated. If this fails, then the Regents would
discuss the issue on its merits.
Regent Power indicated that there seemed to be some fairly
profound differences of opinion and attitude in this regard. If
287

there had been adequate communication between the parties
perhaps these issues could have been resolved, and this conversation
avoided. She felt that it was appropriate at this time to move
the establishment of an ad hoc committee, as the Athletic Department's grievance procedures provide for, to look into these specific
allegations. Regent Brown seconded the motion.
Regent Roach stated that the motion would eliminate one
step in the grievance process by removing the possibility of resolving the issue informally through discussion and investigation.
Ms. Supler insisted that they felt they had complied with the
first step of the procedure when they met informally with Mr.
Harris on two separate occasions in February. None of their
allegations had been clarified at that time. Both Ms. Mayberry
and Ms. Supler said the establishment of an ad hoc committee
was a step forward in the procedure and, hopefully, would resolve
the issue more quickly.
President Smith indicated that if the motion failed, he would
be willing to offer to the complainants paid expenses from their
home to the University to participate in an informal conference.
He then called for the vote. The motion failed with Regents Baker,
Dunn, Nederlander, Roach and Waters voting no.
The Regents then urged the women to immediately arrange a
convenient time to meet with Mr. Harris.
Hospital  President Smith reported on the status of the Hospital replaceReplacemenment project. He said that discussions between the University and
the State were proceeding satisfactorily. He explained the need
for an extension of thirty days in order to develop data for a
Certificate of Need.

Students


Regent Dunn then moved authorization of a thirty-day extension to file the certificate of Need. Regent Roach seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
Regent Baker commented that the people of Michigan should
be made aware that the University Hospital serves a state-wide
community.
Ms. Maggie Martin, Director of Program for Academic Support at UM-Dearborn, reviewed the academic support services
program at Dearborn for minority students. She indicated that the
program included special tutoring in English composition, mathematics and science. The instructors work closely with the counselors who meet with each student once a week. The program
endeavors to assist students overcome academic deficiencies.
Ms. Marilyn Rosenthal, Assistant Professor of Sociology at
Dearborn, commented on the joint venture between The University of Michigan and Michigan State University for the health

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
C. A. Eggertsen    Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of five faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted.
CLAUDE A. EGGERTSEN, Professor of Education, will retire from
active faculty status at The University of Michigan on May 31, 1979. He




MAY MEETING, 1979


301


reached the age of 70 on February 25, 1979, having served a distinguished
forty-year career in the area of Social Foundations of Education, particularly
as an expert in historical studies and in international and comparative education.
Professor Eggertsen has been a faculty member of the School of Education since his appointment as instructor in 1939. He has been a full professor
since 1953 and has been chairman of the department (later program) during
most of his tenure here. He received his B.A. from Brigham Young University
in 1930, his M.A. from that institution in 1933, and his Ph.D. from the
University of Minnesota in 1939. Before coming to Ann Arbor, he had been
a high school teacher in Price, Utah (1930-34); he had also taught both as
an instructor at the University of Minnesota (1935-39) and as a visiting
assistant professor at Brigham Young University and the University of
Colorado. He has since served as a Visiting Professor at Ohio State University,
UCLA, the University of Colorado, San Jose State College, University of
Baroda, and at the University of Sheffield, with which he has sustained a
regular and close relationship since 1957.
During 1944-46, he served as Lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve,
Pacific Theater, where he was Officer-in-Charge of Educational Services for
the 14th Naval District. He received the Bronze Star Medal in 1946 for
organizing and operating the Navy Pacific University.
Professor Eggertsen has studied public education through regular visits
to Europe over the past thirty years, also to Mexico, India, and other Asian
countries. He has published many articles on the educational history of the
U.S. in the 19th century and has supervised numerous monographs in international and comparative education, most of which have been published in
the U-M Comparative Education Dissertation Series (No. 28, 1975) and the
U-M Social Foundations of Education Monograph Series (No. 8, 1978). As
an extension of his Wednesday afternoon seminar for doctoral students in
Social Foundations, held for many years, an association consisting primarily
of his former students has been formed which carries on professional functions. He has been honored by them in a retirement dinner, and they are
preparing a Festschrift in his honor.
A pioneer in the field of international and comparative education, he
was Editor of the History of Education Journal (1950-59), founded and
edited the periodical Notes and Abstracts in American and International
Education (1961- ), was Executive Secretary of the National Society of
College Teachers of Education (1949-60), was President of the History of
Education Society in 1950 and of the Comparative Education Society in
1963, and was made a member of the European Comparative Education
Society in 1966. Through many projects and conferences he brought prominence to the Social Foundations program in international and comparative
education. Especially notable was the 1962-72 Education in India project.
Among the several foreign field experiences he arranged, those for would-be
teachers offered at the Universities of Sheffield (1960- ), Keele 1963-70)
and Edinburgh (1966- ) were the most extensive.
In 1979 a lectureship was established in his honor, to be given at annual
meetings of the International and Comparative Education Society. He has
also been a member of the Phi Kappa Phi and a Fellow of the Philosophy of
Education Society and has served the U.S. Office of Education and the
Fulbright Board in various capacities.
Special mention should also be made of Professor Eggertsen's seminal
role in the creation of the University faculty's Senate Assembly and of his
widely acknowledged and gifted leadership in University faculty governance
over the past two decades.
The Regents now salute this distinguished professor for his outstanding
service to The University of Michigan and the fields of international and
comparative education by naming him Professor Emeritus of Education.

MAY MEETING, 1979


E. T. Hooper,    EMMET T. HOOPER, Curator of Mammals in the Museum of Zoology
Retirement and Professor of Zoology in the Division of Biological Sciences retired on
May 1, 1979 after a distinguished career at The University of Michigan.
Professor Hooper did much of his undergraduate work at San Diego
State College, but received his A.B. from the University of California,
Berkeley where he remained for all of his graduate work (M.A., 1936;
Ph.D., 1939). His association with The University of Michigan began in 1938
when he accepted the position of Curator of Mammals, a post he held until
his retirement. He became Assistant Professor of Zoology in 1946 and
progressed to the rank of Professor in 1958.
Dr. Hooper spent his life in the study of the relationships and geographic
distribution of mammals, subjects about which he published nearly 90 papers.
A dozen Ph.D. students carried out studies of various aspects of the biology
of mammals under his direction, and many of these students now hold
prominent positions at outstanding institutions.
Professor Hooper was a member of several scientific societies. He served
as President and Vice-president of the American Society of Mammalogists,
the major scientific organization in his field. This society elected him as an
Honorary Member in 1976 for his service to the society and for his contributions to the study of mammals. Professor Hooper also served as a
Program Director for one of the divisions of the National Science Foundation
and was President of the University of Michigan Science Research Club.
Emmet Hooper was a pioneer in the detailed study of mammalian soft
anatomy as an aid to classification of groups, and established large specialized
collections of preserved mammals for anatomical study. Many of his publications will be lasting contributions to the science of Mammalogy.
The regents now salute this distinguished curator and professor by
naming him Curator Emeritus of Mammals and Professor Emeritus of
Zoology.
L. H. Hughes,    LLOYD H. HUGHES, Professor of Education, will retire from active
Retirement faculty status at The University of Michigan on May 31, 1979. Professor

UNESCO.
Born in Missouri, Professor Hughes received his A.B. and A.M. in
History from the University of California at Berkeley in 1931 and 1936,
respectively. Then he served as a high school teacher and administrator, and
later taught History and Spanish at Stowe Teachers College in St. Louis.
From 1942 to 1948, he was employed as an education officer at the InterAmerican Foundation, Office of Inter-American Affairs, Washington, D.C.
For the Foundation he made research studies of educational and related
problems in Latin America; these studies served as a background for the
negotiation of agreements with Latin American governments and also for
planning programs of elementary and secondary education, vocational training and teacher training in eighteen of the twenty Latin American countries.
In 1949, Professor Hughes was appointed by UNESCO as consultant
on rural education and from June of 1950, as a member of the Secretariat.
Over a period of ten years he was Deputy Director of the Regional Training
Center for Fundamental Education and Community Development, with headquarters in Mexico. Posts he held later include Chief of the Literacy Appraisal Mission to the Philippines, Chief of the UNESCO Mission and
Specialist in Adult Literacy and Adult Education in Ecuador, and program
specialist in training for literacy at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris.
During his tenure at The University of Michigan, Professor Hughes has
taught many graduate and undergraduate classes in history of education
and seminars in Latin American education. He has provided invaluable
advisory and consultation services for researchers, and teachers in Latin

American studies. His vast knowledge and profound understanding in Latin
American education have been highly regarded by his students and colleagues.
Professor Hughes is extremely fluent in Spanish, and is able to work in
French and Portuguese. He has written many articles on educational and
historical themes with particular reference to Latin America.
The Regents now salute this distinguished professor for his outstanding
service to The University of Michigan and the field of Latin American
education by naming him Professor Emeritus of Education.
WILLIAM    GEORGE MERHAB, Profesor of Romance Languages and         W. G. Merhab,

gan on May 31, 1979.
Professor Merhab has been a member of the University community for
forty-nine years, first as a magna cum laude graduate and as a distinguished
faculty member. He earned the A.B. in French in 1934, the M.A. in French in
1935, and the Ph.D. in Romance Languages in 1942. While a graduate student
he taught French and Spanish. During World War II, Professor Merhab
served his country in South America where he organized an American Cultural Center, directed and taught English language courses and was appointed
to be Director of Department of Courses of the Institute Brazil-Estados
Unidos of Rio de Janeiro. While in Brazil he organized the first Association
of Teachers of English in Brazil, which subsequently became a Brazilian
national organization, prepared text materials for teaching English, and
broadcast over B.B.C. and N.B.C. for the Brazilian Government. Upon
returning to the United States in 1946, Professor Merhab began his faculty
tenure at The University of Michigan. He was director of professional
preparation of foreign language teachers, directed NDEA institutes, conducted
seminars for UNESCO, created a Michigan Interdisciplinary Seminar on
Latin America with Literary College colleagues, worked in the TEFL program
and developed a bilingual education program.
Professor Merhab is a member of TESOL, Modern Language Association, Association of Teachers of English (honorary life member), MEA,
American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese, ASCD, American Council of the Teaching of Foreign Language, American Association for
Bilingual Education, and American Association of Teachers of French.
The breadth of experience, interest and training have enabled him to
bridge the gap between theory and practice. Schools seek his counsel as do
doctoral students in the varying interests in language acquisition. He is
presently involved in a federally funded bilingual project.
The Regents now salute this distinguished professor for his exemplary
service to The University of Michigan, in two schools, and to a variety of
fields dealing with language acquisition, by naming him Professor Emeritus
of Romance Languages and Professor Emeritus of Education.

MAY MEETING, 1979


309


Mr. Fred Mayer presented a progress report covering pre- Engineeing
liminary plans for the Engineering Building II which will be
occupied by the Chemical and Metallurgical departments on
North Campus. The building project will now move to the next
stage in the planning process.
Mr. Robert Forman, Executive Director of the Alumni Asso- Alumni Center
ciation and Mr. Clarence Roy of Johnson, Johnson and Roy
architectural firm presented the preliminary plans and design for
the Alumni Center.
Regent Baker remarked that it was his impression from previous conversations that the building would be unobtrusive and
would blend into the surrounding landscape. The proposed walls
around the courtyard would entirely change the openness of the
Central Campus. He also was concerned about the impact on the
surrounding buildings.
Mr. Roy commented that it was his belief that the position of
the building on the site gave balance to the Ingalls Mall at the
North end, and to the front of the Rackham building as well. He
felt that the design meets the criteria of fitting into its context
and minimizing its impact on the surrounding buildings.
Regents Laro, Nederlander, and Power expressed their concerns relating to the pedestrian concept of Ingalls Mall. They felt
this plan should receive further consideration.
Regent Dunn then moved to approve the preliminary design
and authorize the architect to proceed with working drawings.
Regent Roach seconded the motion.
Regent Baker indicated that since the plan significantly
changes the center of the campus, he moved to table the motion
for one month to reconsider the question of Ingalls Mall. Regent
Nederlander seconded the motion.
Regent Dunn then withdrew his original motion and Regent
Roach withdrew his second so that the matter would come back
at the next meeting.
At the April meeting of the Regents, Mr. Roderick Daane, Investment
General Counsel, had been asked to look into alternatives to sPolthesArica
divestiture in connection with the South African investment issue.
In response to that request, Mr. Daane indicated that as a shareholder, the University could vote responsibly on owned shares
and on resolutions offered by shareholders; attend and address
shareholder meetings; initiate shareholder resolutions either as a
co-sponsor or individually; actively solicit support for such resolutions; solicit proxies for the election of members to the Board
of Directors of the corporations; and institute under rather limited
circumstances shareholder derivated law suits. Another alternative




310


MAY MEETING, 1979


that might have some appeal was the possibility of a business
leader forum at which various leaders of companies doing business
in South Africa might convene to discuss the issue on corporate
responsibility by expressing their views. This might result in a
more sophisticated code of corporate responsibility.
Mr. Daane stated in more detail the implications of the
alternatives concluding that a great deal of staff time and fiscal
commitments would be involved. He also mentioned the complications that would evolve from withdrawal of funds from South
Africa.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff said that he had recently visited the
Vice-President for Corporate Relations of the G. D. Searle Company. Having made clear the intent of the March 1978 Regents'
resolution, he was assured that although the Company did not
adopt the Sullivan Principles per se, the principles, policies and
practices of the Searle Company were substantially the same. The
Company also agreed to report its activities to the University
on an annual basis.
The Black and Decker Company also was contacted to arrange
a further meeting on the subject. A reply from Black and Decker
indicated that although they would be happy to meet with Mr.
Brinkerhoff as a stockholder, their stance as stated in their communication of March 20, 1979 had not been changed.
M. Hood, State  President Smith then introduced State Representative Morris
Representative Hood, who represented the members of the Michigan Legislative
Black Caucus and concerned members of the Legislature.
Representative Hood stated that he had been invited by
Regent Dunn to address the Board to urge them to reconsider
their previous decision concerning divestiture of the Black and
Decker Company and the G. D. Searle Company stock. He was
pleased to hear that the Searle Company was willing basically to
adhere to the Sullivan plan, and felt it a travesty that the University would even consider involvement with a company such
as Black and Decker who would not provide statements of their
policies concerning social change in South Africa. Representative
Hood said he hoped the Regents would vote to divest stock in that
company which would signify to the people of the State of Michigan that the University was not willing to invest their money in
companies doing business in a country that practices apartheid
unless such companies are working to end such policies.
Regent Baker stated that Mr. Daane's presentation pointed
out a number of difficult areas involved in the overall problem.
The question the University faces concerns its mission, which is
research, teaching and public service. Should this mission be
expanded to an area in which the University is called upon to make




MAY MEETING, 1979


311


theological and ethical judgments? There are many evils in this
world, certainly apartheid is one. The University cannot right all
these evils. It is not the purpose of the University to be moral
judges of the activities or society in general and the business community in particular. This University is an autonomous institution
wherein the right of discussion and examination of any subject
is defended. A decision on any action should not be dictated by
other sources.
In continuing, Regent Baker said that of the two companies
which have caused some concern to the University regarding their
adherence to the Sullivan Principles, the Searle Company has
responded to further inquiry in a positive way, but Black and
Decker's response needs more clarification. He then suggested
that the issue of divestment be deferred until an actual meeting
between Mr. Brinkerhoff and officials of that company has taken
place.
Regent Dunn commented that all companies, except Black and  Divestiture of
Black and Decker
Decker, in which the University owns stock have agreed to adhere  Company Stock
to the Sullivan Principles. He said ample time has been given to
Black and Decker for compliance to the Regents resolution
adopted a year ago. He then moved the prudent divestiture of the
Black and Decker Company stock owned by the University.
Regent Power seconded the motion.
Regent Roach stated that he had been disturbed by the tenor
and substance of Black and Decker's response to the University's
inquiry last month, but wanted to know if there were alternatives
other than divestment that might influence and effect a change
of attitude. Based on Mr. Daane's report, Regent Roach said that
in view of the relatively minor nature of this one holding, he would
not be prepared to invest a substantial sum of money to achieve
this change. He was now prepared to vote affirmatively to the
motion.
Regent Power remarked that she feels it appropriate for the
University to review its responsibility and involvement in what
has become nationwide interest in the economic and social policy in
South Africa. She considers the endorsement of the Sullivan Principles the essential first plateau of responsible action, therefore, she
was ready to support the motion presented by Regent Dunn.
Regent Laro indicated that if the University is to adhere to
the policy the Regents adopted a year ago, it is necessary to affirm
the motion made by Regent Dunn. However, he feels that this
action will have no effect on the matter in South Africa which
everyone agrees needs correction, but this is not the method to
produce the desired results. Therefore, he will abstain from voting,
and should the matter present itself on a continuous basis, will




312


MAlY MEETING, 1979


make a motion in the future to amend dramatically or rescind in
total the policy.
Regent Nederlander commented that he was satisfied that the
University has done everything possible to determine this company's willingness to adhere to the Sullivan Principles. He would
now agree to divestiture not only because of failure on Black and
Decker's part to adopt these principles, but also in view of their
business practices.
Regent Brown commented that he agreed with much of what
Regent Baker said concerning the purposes of this University, but
perhaps the sort of companies in which the University owns stock
should be included. He said the Sullivan Principles stand for
human dignity in South Africa and the adoption of those or similar
principles by the companies doing business there indicates their
willingness to undertake social change. For an American company
not to adopt these principles is an affrontery to blacks in America
and to all Americans who are sympathetic to the principles of
equality and basic human rights and dignity around the world.
The University cannot ignore the fact that the Black and Decker
Company refuses to make a statement other than the "golden
rule" to deal with this particular problem in South Africa, therefore, he will support Regent Dunn's motion.
Regent Baker then read into the minutes the following letter
dated March 20, 1979 from the Black and Decker Company in
response to an inquiry by the University.
Mr. Norman G. Herbert
Investment Officer
The University of Michigan
5032 Administration Building
Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109
Dear Mr. Herbert:
Further to our telephone conversation of yesterday and your letter
of March 7th, let me again reiterate our Company does not subscribe to the
Sullivan Code and does not report to Dr. Sullivan's organization as we do
not believe that the Company's policies should be dictated by, nor the Company report to, any private special interest group, regardless of the merit of
the group's objectives. Having a very small business operation in South
Africa, our Company does not have any regular reports of policies and practices to publicly disclose relative to investment policies and social responsibilities in that country, and therefore cannot comply with your request.
The policies and practices followed in South Africa are similar with those
followed in other foreign countries.
As previously explained in my letter of January 9th, we pay equal wage
rates for like jobs, and contrary to local practice, when a white vacates a
job, we do not reserve that job for a white replacement. It is Company policy
to be governed by the "Golden Rule" and we insist on treating our employees
fairly.
We trust the correspondence during the past months on the South
African issue gives you the benefit of our thinking and when presented to




MAY MEETING, 1979


313


the Regents of the University of Michigan allows them to respect our views
on this issue.
Very truly yours,
E. G. Delcher
Senior Vice President

APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREES
Conferred April 28, 1979
SHIRLEY M. HUFSTEDLER, Eloquent Advocate of Justice
The career of Shirley Mount Hufstedler provides a living testimonial to
Justice Holmes's assertion that "it is possible to live greatly in the law."
Upon graduation from professional school in 1949, she embarked on a career
marked by superior achievement. In 1969, she was appointed to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and thereby became the
highest-ranking woman judge in the federal system. She is one of the most
respected of American judges, an esteem based upon her powers of thought
and articulation, her integrity and poise, and her perception of the moral
foundations upon which the rule of law ultimately rests. As one whose
judicial labors survive the most exacting professional evaluation, she serves
as an inspiring role model at a time of increasing participation by all elements
in our society in the professional life of the nation. In recognition of her past
achievements as lawyer, judge, and citizen, and in anticipation of her future
contributions to our national life, The University of Michigan confers upon
her the honorary degree Doctor of Laws.
HERBERT FRIEDMAN, Explorer of the Universe
The University of Michigan is proud to confer on Herbert Friedman the
honorary degree of Doctor of Science. We note, with equal pride, that our
sister university, Tubingen, on the occasion of her five hundredth anniversary
did likewise. He is a leader in X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction, astrophysics, nucleonics, and radio and X-ray astronomy. As a consequence of
his developing a new scientific technique, rocket-astronomy, he pioneered
the exploration of the upper atmosphere of the earth and the exploration of
the universe using X-rays, discovered the X-ray and ultra violet emission
of the Crab Nebula and its pulsar, as well as many other galactic and extragalactic X-ray sources. In these studies, he produced the first X-ray photograph of the sun.
During forty years of research, his memberships on a multitude of
government commissions, editorial boards, and scientific societies demonstrates the breadth of his service to science. His personal energy and insight
have led to half a hundred patents and over two hundred original publications, which indicate his inventiveness with instrumentation and its exploitation in pure science. Legion are the medals and citations laid upon him,
culminating in the National Medal of Science in 1969, and twice (1970 and
1978) NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Award for his work at
the Naval Research Laboratory.
Galileo wrote, "Philosophy is written in this grand book-I mean the
universe-which stands continually open to our gate, but it cannot be
understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret
the characters in which it is written." Herbert Friedman has not only helped
us to "interpret these characters," he has measured them. Our humility and
pride in Herbert Friedman's presence combine as today we honor him with
the degree Doctor of Science.
ALICIA DE LARROCHA, Master of the Universal Language of Music
We who heard Sefiora de Larrocha play with the Philadelphia Orchestra
last night will treasure for the rest of our lives the aesthetic fusion of beatuti



318                  MAY MEETING, 1979
ful musicianship and elegant pianism. Born in Barcelona, where she studied
with Frank Marshall, she was wisely encouraged by her teacher to master the
entire European repertoire of classics before she became the world's leading
interpreter of Spain's great piano music, especially that of Granados and
Albeniz.
An indomitable spirit, Sefiora de Larrocha, together with her husband,
Juan Torra, has directed the Marshall Piano Academy of Barcelona, reared
two children, and was named musician of the year in 1978 by the publication
Musical America.
She has been hailed in concerts all over the world, and many times in
Ann Arbor, and is one of the most recorded artists living today. Twice she
has been given the Grammy Award for her recordings; she is also the recipient of the Paderewski Medal, the Grand Prix du Disque, the first gold
medal of the Merito a la Vocacion; and is a member of the order of Civil
Merit of Spain and of Isabel la Catolica.
On this occasion of the one hundredth anniversary of our School of
Music and The University Musical Society, The University of Michigan
appropriately chooses to honor with the degree Doctor of Music Sefiora Alicia
de Larrocha for the passion, beauty, and authority of her performance.




JUNE MEETING, 1979
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR
THURSDAY, JUNE 14, 1979
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Laro, Nederlander, Power, Roach and Waters. Chancellors Goodall
and Moran and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger,
Radock, Shapiro and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also
were present.
President Smith remarked that this was the last meeting Judy  J. Phair
Phair, Editor for Internal Communications, would be reporting  Commended
for the University Record. He commended her for a job well done
and wished her well as she and her husband relocated in the East.
Mr. A. B. Hicks, Director of University Audits, reviewed the  Internal Audit
Report
six-month internal audit and responded to several questions concerning billing and documentation procedures.
In response to a question concerning follow-up procedures,
Mr. Hicks indicated that if the unit response to the audit recommendations was satisfactory, no further follow-up action was
taken. On the other hand, an additional audit would be scheduled
in cases where there were serious problems.
Vice-President Shapiro indicated that his office contacted all
academic units that might appear in the audit report to assure
implementation of the recommendations.
With respect to the vending machines, Mr. Hicks said that
these are owned by concessionaires. The audit department conducts an overall evaluation by studying historical data. The audit
department also recommends an audit of the vendor's books which
is generally allowed in the contracts.
Regent Roach moved to receive the six-month internal audit
report. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
President Smith reviewed the progress of the Hospital replace- Hospital
ment project. He indicated that discussion with the Michigan  Replment
Department of Public Health has continued. The MDPH mentioned some of the stipulations that will be imposed at the time
the Certificate of Need is granted. These include a reduction in the
number of beds from 923 to 900, statements showing fiscal feasibility and staffing feasibility. The representative from the Depart319




320


JUNE MEETING, 1979


ment of Public Health has appeared before the Comprehensive
Health Planning Council of Southeastern Michigan (CHPC-SEM)
in Detroit to apprise them of these discussions. The regional
planning agency indicated that the whole project should be
referred back to them. The MDPH has said that the regional
agency is an advisory group and the final decision should be made
in Lansing. There remains to be resolved the overall cost of the
project. The University has indicated certain reductions that could
be made in the total cost of the project if the 23 beds were
eliminated.
The Michigan Department of Public Health will shortly draft
a proposed letter which would grant the Certificate of Need and
identify the conditions that would be attached to the grant. A
draft copy of the proposed letter will be sent to the University
and to the Detroit regional agency for review and comment. The
University will not know, however, what action the regional group
will take before the final letter awarding the Certificate of Need
is received.
It has been suggested by the Michigan Department of Public
Health that the University request an additional thirty-day extension to handle further negotiations for the Certificate of Need,
therefore, he recommended the University do so.
President Smith continued saying that there has been criticism
by the regional group that the planning process has been circumvented for this particular application. He said this is absolutely
an incorrect assumption. The University has followed the procedures of the planning process meticulously at the local, regional,
and state level and does not want to be involved in any action
which undercuts the validity of the planning process, or the
validity of the role of the regional planning agency. Therefore,
every opportunity should be given the regional office to comment
on the proposal and its standing prior to the final award of the
Certificate.
The building division members of the Department of Management and Budget have indicated their willingness to start the
programmatic review of the project in advance of the award of
the Certificate of Need to expedite the project.
Regent Baker commented that a genuine need for the hospital
replacement has been established by the medical accrediting group
and by various public groups, and the implication that a political
effort was involved is entirely incorrect. It should be underscored
that only the proposed size of the hospital has been in question.
A visit to the Hospital will point out the state-wide nature of the
facility for you will find patients who have been referred to




JUNE MEETING, 1979


321


University Hospital by physicians throughout the State for the
treatment of critical and difficult cases.
Regent Baker then moved authorization to request a thirty-  Certificate of
Need, Extension
day extension for the filing of the application for the Certificate  Approved
of Need. Regent Laro seconded the motion and is was adopted.
In view of the adverse publicity the replacement hospital has
received on certain television newscasts, Regent Roach suggested
that the University undertake a rather agressive policy to present
the true facts to the public. The development of the project has
been very carefully studied and planned over the last few years
and implications that the University is politicizing it are erroneous.
President Smith indicated that since the State will be substantially funding the hospital project, the University is following
simultaneously the process required by the Legislature. He also
noted that a study recently completed by the Michigan Department of Public Health indicates that the service area in which
University Hospital is located is not overbedded even with our
present licensure and will clearly not be overbedded with the
number now authorized.
Vice-President Shapiro reviewed the 1978-79 and 1979-80  Budget for
1978-79 and
general fund budget for the Ann Arbor campus. He said that 197980 Report
despite the fact that the 1978-79 year started with a substantial
deficit, it was fully expected that the budget would be in balance
and without a deficit at the end of the fiscal year.
With respect to the 1979-80 budget, the Regents' resolution
to adhere to President Carter's wage-price guidelines and the
anticipated tuition revenue has made possible a modification in
the initial budget request to the State. The Governor's recommended budget for the Ann Arbor campus, however, will not meet
the University's minimal needs. If there is no relief from the
Senate appropriations committee, the University will have to
consider alternatives such as raising tuition schedules, modifying
the salary program, lowering increases for non-salary items, and
phasing down and/or eliminating certain programs. Dr. Shapiro
also noted that instructional equipment, plant renovation, and
book acquisitions have been inadequately funded in recent years
and can no longer be deprived of funds.
Regent Powere commented that the University is an institution
of exceptional excellence, but is being jeopardized by inadequate
funding. A concerted effort by the Regents must be made to
present the needs of the University to maintain its quality
programs.
Regent Roach indicated that none of the alternatives were
acceptable. In order to maintain and enhance the excellence of the




322                 JUNE MEETING, 1979
University in times of adverse budget, probably the most acceptable alternative was phasing down or elimination of certain
programs which takes enormous planning.
Vice-President Shapiro indicated tthat phasing down a program
which involves changes in staffing is a slow and difficult process.
I. MINUTES
The minutes of the meeting of April 19 and 20, 1979 and
May 17 and 18, 1979 were approved as amended by Regent Power.
II. REPORTS
Vice-President Brinkerhoff placed on file his monthly reports
on investment transactions, temporary investments, plant extension, litigation and personnel-labor relations.
Vice-President Overberger filed a listing of grants and contracts
for research.
Vice-President Radock filed his monthly report on the Office
of University Relations and Development.

Regent Nederlander moved to approve the appointment of   Board in Control
of Intercollegiate
William M. Mazur, Jr. as the alumni member to the Board in   Athletics
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics for a three-year term, effective  Appointments
June 1, 1979 to May 31, 1982, vice Roger Zatkoff, term expired;
and to approve the faculty members as recommended. Regent
Power seconded the motion.
Discussion followed concerning the absence of women nominees
for both the faculty and student membership to the Board in
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics.
Regent Power indicated that the University is committed to
affirmative action and she was concerned that no woman student
would be represented on this Board. She suggested that action
be deferred until a panel of candidates could be recommended that
would include women.
Vice-President Johnson commented that these appointments
are recommended by Michigan Student Assembly through their
process, and on inquiry learned that these were the only two candidates that surfaced.
Regent Brown felt that the ratio of women to men members
on the Board should be greater. He said athletics is currently an
important area in which both men and women have a great deal
of interest. If the recommendations of the faculty representatives
are approved, there will be one less woman than last year.
Regent Roach said he was very much opposed to setting
quotas for this or any other appointment on campus. It should be
determined, however, if SACUA, in making its recommendations,
used proper affirmative action measures to see that women candidates surfaced.
Regent Nederlander then moved to approve the committee
appointment recommendations with the exception of the faculty
and student representatives to the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics. Regent Dunn seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
In explaining the process by which SACUA recommendations
are made, Professor Arch Naylor, Vice-Chairman, said that a
letter is sent to the entire faculty early in the year asking for




330


JUNE MEETING, 1979


volunteers or nominations for a long list of committees, SACUA
then meets to consider these names for various committees. There
are more men than women faculty members on campus and this
puts a considerable burden on the women because they are approached to serve on a number of committees.
Regent Baker indicated that it was his view that there is danger
of damaging the process if the Regents begin challenging faculty
and administration recommendations. He said he is supportive of
both and felt it was inappropriate to delay the matter. He then
moved to approve the student and faculty representatives to the
Board in Control, as recommended. Regent Laro seconded the
motion.
Regent Waters indicated that approval of the recommendations
should be deferred a month so that SACUA can report on. their
selection process and to determine the availability of other women
who would be willing to serve on the Board.
Regent Nederlander moved to table the faculty and student
appointments to the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics
for one month. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was
adopted with Regent Baker voting no.

VIRGIL M. BETT, Profesor of Economics, has retired from     active  v. M. Bett

Dr. Bett received his B.A. degree from Drake University in 1942. He
received the M.A. degree in 1947, and the Ph.D. degree in 1956 from the

The Regents now salute this distinguished professor of economics for
his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Economics.

faculty status as of May 31, 1979, after a productive career as a teacher,  Retireme't

332


JUNE MEETING, 1979


Professor Carow earned a BSF in 1937 and MF in 1938 from The
University of Michigan. He joined the faculty of the School of Natural
Resources in 1947. During his 32 years here he taught forest mensuration,
timber harvesting, air photo interpretation, and forest management. For
21 years he directed Camp Filibert Roth and was involved in managing
the School's Forest Properties.
He has been an active member of the Society of American Foresters
since 1937. He has served as Chairman of the Lower Michigan Chapter
(1962), Chairman of the Wisconsin-Michigan Section (1973-75), Chairman
of the National Division of Education (1958), Deputy Chairman of the 1965
National Meeting in Detroit, as well as serving on various committees. In
1976 John was elected a Fellow of SAF and was given the Distinguished
Service Award by the Lower Michigan Chapter. He has served as SNR
Alumni Secretary since 1965, and plans to continue in this capacity after
his retirement.
The Regents now salute John Carow for his dedicated service by naming
him Professor Emeritus of Natural Resources.
G. R. Garrison,    GARNET R. GARRISON, Professor of Speech Communication and
Retirement Theatre, has retired from the active faculty as of May 31, 1979 after a
distinguished career as a teacher, administrator and broadcaster.
Professor Garrison received his B.A. degree from Wayne University in
1933 and his M.A. from The University of Michigan in 1936. While an undergraduate at Wayne, he began his career as a broadcaster and worked for a
number of radio stations in the Detroit area. In 1936 he was invited to join
the Wayne faculty as the institution's first teacher of courses in broadcasting.
In that period he also developed a system of audience measurement utilizing
diaries, a technique that is now widely used in the radio and television
industry. He left Wayne in 1942 to join the National Broadcasting Company
as a director and program administrator.
Professor Garrison became an associate professor on the Michigan faculty
in 1947 and was advanced to professor in 1950. In that same year he became
the Director of Television for the University and later became the Director
of Broadcasting. He left that position in 1972 to return to full-time teaching
in the department.
To both his teaching and administrative functions Professor Garrison
brought great vigor and creativity. His work did much to foster and develop
the curriculum in broadcasting and his activities as the director of television
broadcasting activities made Michigan a leader in the field.
On the national scene Professor Garrison served the Speech Association
of America as a member of its Executive Council; and a book he co-authored
in 1950, which is now in its fifth edition, has made his name known throughout the country.
The Regents now salute this pioneering educator and innovator in the
broadcasting field for his distinguished service by naming him Professor
Emeritus of Speech Communication and Theatre.
L. L. Okey      L. LAMONT OKEY, Professor of Speech Communication and Theatre,
Retirement has retired from the active faculty as of May 31, 1979, after a distinguished
career as a teacher, writer and national leader in the field of oral interpretation.
Professor Okey received his B.A. degree from Cornell College in 1940
and after serving as a high-school teacher and in the U.S. Navy during World
War II, he came to The University of Michigan where he earned his M.A.
in 1946 and his Ph.D. in 1951. He joined the Michigan faculty in 1947 as a
lecturer, advancing to instructor in 1948 to assistant professor in 1953, to
associate professor in 1960, and to professor in 1964.
Professor Okey, one of the department's most popular teachers, also




JUNE MEETING, 1979                         333
served as a counselor to both undergraduate and graduate students, being
member and chairman of many dissertation committees, and as chairman
of the oral interpretation committee of the department. He was active in
state, regional and national associations and carried out a number of functions
for the Oral Interpretation Interest Group of the Speech Association of
America, among them that of chairman in 1957-58. Two of the books he
co-authored have been widely used in universities throughout the country.
For his contributions to the field he was honored in 1971 by the Michigan
Speech Association with a Distinguished Service Citation and an honorary
Life Membership.
Professor Okey was not only an outstanding teacher of oral interpretation, he was also a skilled performer of that art. His services as a reader
and speaker were in great demand by groups throughout the state and in
other parts of the country.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his noteworthy
contributions to his field by naming him Professor Emeritus of Speech
Communication and Theatre.
GUSTAVE ROSSEELS, Professor of Music, has retired from active    G. Rosseels
faculty status as of May 31, 1979, after a distinguished career as violinist  Retirement
and teacher.
Known to Ann Arbor music audiences as a member of the Stanley
Quartet and the Baroque Trio, Rosseels was also a member of the Paganini
Quartet for 11 years before joining The University of Michigan faculty.
First appointed as Lecturer in Violin and Chamber Music and Second
Violinist of the Stanley Quartet in 1957, he was promoted to Associate Professor in 1959 and to Professor in 1962.
A native of Malines, Belgium, he graduated with a degree in chamber
music and violin from the Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels and later
served on that faculty. After a career in Europe as first violinist of the
Pro Nova Quartet, he came to the United States in 1946 to join the newlyformed Paganini Quartet. On that voyage, he traveled with his lifelong
friend Robert Courte, who was to be the violist of the Paganini and, later,
of the UM Stanley Quartet. As a member of the Paganini Quartet, Rosseels
made several recordings and performed more than 1,200 concerts in the
United States, Europe, and South America.
Last year he received one of the highest faculty awards which the
School of Music confers: the 1978 Harold Haugh Award for outstanding
excellence in private studio teaching. In addition to his appearances with the
Stanley Quartet and the Baroque Trio, Rosseels has perfomed frequently as
soloist and in sonata recitals in Ann Arbor and elsewhere. His repertory
included not only classical and romantic works but many contemporary
compositions, several of which were dedicated to him and first performed
in Ann Arbor.
Rosseels is listed in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Who's
Who in the Midwest, the International Who's Who in Music, and Men of
Achievement.
The Regents now salute this distinguished artist and teacher for his
dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Music.

prolonged illness. With his passing The University of Michigan has lost a
brilliant scholar in earth science and a loyal citizen of the faculty community.
Born in 1921 in Los Angeles, he received his B.A. in 1943 from Fresno
State College. He served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific
theater during the years 1943-46 and returned for graduate studies to the
University of California, Berkeley, where he received his Ph.D. degree in
geology in 1950. He joined The University of Michigan as an instructor in
1950, rising through the ranks to Professor in 1961 and serving in 1958-79
as Director of the Subsurface Laboratory in the Department of Geology and
Mineralogy. Professor Briggs was in his element when working closely with
individual students in research and in his 29 years at Michigan he directed
18 Ph.D. and 64 M.S. thesis projects.
The author of several books and numerous scientific articles, Professor
Briggs was internationally recognized as an authority on the origin of
evaporite deposits, the regional geology of the southern Rocky Mountains,
and the application of mathematics and computer sciences to both theoretical
and applied stratigraphic systems analysis. In later years, combining his
talents as mathematician and geologist, he pursued pioneering studies in the
theory and applications of information systems, developing for the Subsurface Laboratory a system of document analysis and data retrieval that
was the first kind in the field of geology.
Professor Briggs was a Fellow of the Geological Society of America and
the American Association for the Advancement of Science as well as a
member of numerous other professional organizations. Among his many
professional activities, he had served as President of the Michigan Basin
Geological Society, Chairman of the Michigan Well Data System, Chairman
of the Committee on Disposal of Radioactive Wastes in the Michigan Basin
of the Atomic Energy Commission, and Co-chairman of the Documentation
System of the Society of Economic Paleontology and Mineralogy. He was a
Visiting Professor at several universities including Louisiana State University
from 1967 to 1968 and the University of Montana in 1976.
The Regents join his colleagues in the Department of Geology and
Mineralogy and former students around the world in extending deepest
sympathies to his family.

After further discussion it was agreed to defer the matter
until Friday.
Regent Roach moved to approve the resolution that authorizes
and approves the issuance and sale of the Regents of the The

FRIDAY, JUNE 15, 1979
The Regents met at 9:00 A.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Dunn,
Laro, Nederlander, Power, Roach and Waters. Chancellors Goodall
and Moran and Vice-Presidents Brinkerhoff, Johnson, Overberger,
Radock, Shapiro and Vice-President and Secretary Kennedy also
were present.
Alumni  Mr. Robert P. Briggs, President of the Alumni Association and
Mr. Clarence Roy from the firm of Johnson, Johnson and Roy
were in attendance to present the Alumni Center project to the
Regents. Mr. Roy discussed the concerns expressed by the Regents
at the May meeting and the modifications they were now recommending.
Regent Baker discussed alternative plans for siting the project
and expressed concern regarding the drive access to the courtyard.
He also stated that to achieve the mall concept shown in the
plan Ingalls Street between North University and Washington
Streets would have to be closed.
Mr. Roy indicated that siting the building as recommended
would give the Alumni Center more identity and would not restrict
future expansion of the Mendelssohn Theatre. He said it was their
intention to retain the drive access.
Regent Power said the concept of Ingalls Mall as a pedestrian
area seemed desirable and asked what action was needed to
accomplish this.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff stated that the University has
ownership of the eastern half of Ingalls Street, but would require
vacation of the western side by the City of Ann Arbor in order
to close the area to traffic.
Regent Dunn moved to approve the preliminary design and to
authorize proceeding with working drawings subject to Regental
review prior to bidding. Regent Power seconded the motion and
it was adopted with Regent Baker voting no.
Regent Roach said he was in agreement with the mall concept
and discussed the need to acquire the west side of Ingalls Mall.
Medical Library  Vice-President Brinkerhoff commented that regarding the reand Learng quest for approval of a loan for the Medical Library and Learning
Center he had searched the files and also contacted the bank.
The provision in question is consistent with that which the University had with other loans supported by pledges and is a standard
phrase that appears in all the University's term loans. He also
noted that the bank will not permit the dropping of the paragraph.

Regent Laro moved authorization to proceed with the planning
to convert the top three floors of the 300 N. Ingalls Building
(1955 building) to wet laboratories to be used to accommodate
health-related research projects, and to appoint Eberle Smith and
Associates as architects for the project. Regent Nederlander
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Nederlander moved to approve the A & D Building
renovations; Frieze Building renovations; 400 N. Ingalls (1923
building) fire safety projects; Business Administration Building
renovations; and the development of a North Campus commuter
parking lot, as recommended. Regent Laro seconded the motion
and it was adopted.
Regent Laro moved to authorize the University to proceed
with the renovation of the Buhr Building to provide library stack
space and to appoint an architect for the project. Regent Nederlander seconded the motion.
Regent Roach questioned the cost involved in renovating the
building as against the construction of a new building. He then
moved to table the motion until July to allow preparation of an
analysis of the alternatives. Regent Brown seconded the motion
and it was adopted.
Department of  Regent Baker moved to approve the appointment of William
Ophthaloltog  Kessler and Associates of Detroit, Michigan for the development
of a master plan for consolidation of the patient care, education,
and research functions of the Department of Ophthalmology at
University Hospital from the Outpatient Building, Main Hospital,
and Clinical Faculty building to the Parkview/Turner Hospital,

Vice-President Brinkerhoff reviewed the recommendation to  Real Property
sell two acres of University owned land on Baxter Road to the
City of Ann Arbor. He said the City must have title to the
property to qualify for federal funding for developement as a
park. It was his understanding that to meet the requirements of
the grant the City must act immediately.
A discussion ensued which indicated the Regent's interest in
moving ahead more rapidly with the development of Ingalls Mall
to compliment the development of the Alumni Center. There was
therefore considerable interest in implementing the original agreement with the City which involved the City's vacation of Ingalls
Street in exchange for the North Campus park land.
Following discussion, Regent Baker moved to approve the sale
contingent upon architectural reservations on the use of the land,
the cooperation of the City of Ann Arbor to vacate the west side
of Ingalls Street for the development of a Mall, and that part of
the funds to be used for master planning. There was no second
to the motion.
Regent Roach then moved to authorize the sale of the two acres
of land on Baxter Road to the City of Ann Arbor provided the
University receives satisfactory assurances from the Mayor and
the City Council to vacate the west side of Ingalls Street between
North University and Washington Street upon the request of the
University. Regent Dunn seconded the motion.




342


JUNE MEETING, 1979


Regent Laro suggested that because of the urgency of the
mater the University could contact City Council members within
the next few hours to solicit their assurance. The Regents could
then reconvene in the evening to take whatever action was
necessary.
Regent Roach then withdrew his motion and Regent Dunn his
second.
Regent Laro then moved that the University be authorized to
negotiate with the City of Ann Arbor to provide for vacation of
the property on the west side of Ingalls Street in exchange for
valuable consideration which may be some cash, but may also
include the property on Baxter Road and that the Regents would
reconvene at 6:20 P.M. to take action. Regent Nederlander
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Microbiology and  Regent Nederlander moved to approve changing the name of
DIpamrtmnof the Department of Microbiology to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology. Regent Baker seconded the motion and
it was adopted.
Water Lines  The Regents received a progress report on the replacement of
Replacement,
UM — Dearborn the steam and chilled water lines at UM-Dearborn which indicated that the low bid of Glanz and Killian Company of Dearborn, Michigan had been accepted.
South African  Regent Baker read into the minutes the following editorial
Editorial re from Business Week, dated June 18, 1979 on "Reforms in South
Africa."
"For many years, U.S. companies that operated in South
Africa have been pressured by domestic critics to withdraw from
the African country as a way of punishing it for its discrimination
against its black majority. But most U.S. companies have decided
to stay in South Africa and work to improve conditions there for
black workers and their families. These company efforts are starting to yield real progress. Slow but significant improvements in
such vital areas to blacks as equal pay, job training, housing, and
other social conditions on and off the job are powerful evidence
that South Africa's black population will be far better off if
American companies remain in South Africa and continue to press
for reforms rather than pull out.
American business, which accounts for only 17o of foreign
investment in South Africa, faces severe limits on how far it can
go in fighting that country's pervasive system of apartheid. But
almost half the 280 companies operating there-partly under
pressure from critics in this country-have agreed to implement
the principles of the so-called Sullivan code, named for the
Reverend Leon H. Sullivan, a noted U.S. black leader and a direc



JUNE MEETING, 1979


343


tor of General Motors Corp. These principles concern desegregation of workplaces, equal pay for equal work, job training, including apprenticeships for skilled jobs, and a wide range of other
advances for blacks. By agreeing to implement them, U.S. companies are pushing the government in Pretoria toward reforms
that it otherwise would probably not make.
Sullivan himself now says he does not want General Motors to
withdraw from South Africa so long as such progress continues.
The grandstand gestures demanded by some of the groups that
descended on stockholder meetings some years ago would have
made this sort of real progress impossible."
President Smith then commented that he had asked VicePresident Shapiro and Dean Ragone to submit their statements
concerning a faculty appointment case.
Regent Roach moved approval of the following resolution.
Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted:
Chancellor Leonard E. Goodall has led The University of Michigan-  L. E. Goodall
Dearborn for eight years, a period of vigorous and dynamic growth. During  Resolution
this time, Chancellor Goodall has guided The University of Michigan-Dearborn through the transition from a two-year to a four-year institution and
increased the number of undergraduate and graduate programs. Under his
leadership, the campus has established itself as an innovative institution,
incorporating relevance with quality in its academic programs and services.
Chancellor Goodall has demonstrated a sensitivity to the needs of all
elements of the University-faculty, students, staff and alumni, while establishing a strong and consistent relationship with the state legislature, the
business community, organized labor and the general public.
He has recognized the distinctive characteristics and strengths of the
University, and applied those elements to a developing campus in a large
metropolitan area. In so doing, he has inspired and led the campus in a
direction that is both consistent with the University's heritage of academic
excellence and consonant with the social, economic and political climate of the
late twentieth century. These accomplishments have been attained through
patience, fairness and willingness for open discussion on all issues affecting
the University.
We salute Chancellor Goodall for his work at The University of Michigan-Dearborn, thank him for his dedicated efforts here, and wish him well
in his future endeavors.
The meeting was recessed.
The Regents reconvened at 6:20 P.M.
Present were the President and Regents Baker, Brown, Laro,
Power and Roach. Chancellors Goodall and Moran and Vice Presidents Brinkerhoff, Radock and Vice-President and Secretary
Kennedy were also present. Regents Dunn, Nederlander and
Waters and Vice-Presidents Johnson, Overberger and Shapiro
were absent.
Vice-President Brinkerhoff commented that the City Adminis-        Real Property
trator could not be reached and the Mayor indicated that he could




344


JUNE MEETING, 1979


not give asurance that the City would vacate the west side of
Ingalls Street without full discussion with the City Council.
Apparently, however, the City has thirty days to confirm proof of
ownership of the Baxter Road property.
Mr. Brinkerhoff then referred to the resolution approved by
the Regents in October 1977 which authorized the sale of the
Baxter Road property for $5,000 if the City agreed to vacate the
west half of Ingalls Street and Madison Street between Thompson
and Packard.
Regent Roach then moved to authorize Vice-President Brinkerhoff to convey the property in accordance with the October 1977
resolution. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
All the above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of May totaled $2,939.47.
The Regents adjourned to meet on July 19 and 20, 1979.

with the authority vested in the University by law, particularly Article VIII,
Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963.
Said bonds, including this bond, are equally and ratably secured by an
irrevocable pledge of Student Fees for tuition collected from the students
attending the University. The University has covenanted and agreed to
establish, maintain and collect Student Fees from each student, so that the
total of such Student Fees collected will be in an amount sufficient to provide
anual sums sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of and
interest on the bonds and other obligations payable therefrom when due in

2% of the par value of each bond redeemed on or after April 1, 1992,

order.
Thirty days notice of call of any bonds for redemption shall be given
by the University by publication in a newspaper or financial journal published
in the City of New York, New York, which carries as part of its regular
service notices of sale of municipal bonds. The University shall send a copy of
such notice to the registered holder of each bond registered as to principal
and to each holder of a bearer bond who has requested such notice in writing,
by certified or registered mail postage prepaid, addressed to the last known
address of such bondholder as it appears upon the bond register or list maintained by the Paying Agent for such purpose, not later than 30 days prior
to the date fixed for redemption; but failure to give any such notice by
mailing, or any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of any proceeding
for the redemption of any bond with respect to which such failure has
occurred. Notice need not be published if all bonds to be redeemed are
registered as to principal and 30 days notice is mailed to each registered
holder. Bonds so called for redemption shall not bear interest after the date
fixed for redemption provided sufficient funds are on deposit with the Paying
Agent to redeem the Bonds called for redemption on the date fixed for
redemption, and shall cease to be deemed outstanding under the provisions
of the Resolution and shall cease to be entitled to any source of payment,
security or benefit under the Resolution other than the right to receive
payment from the funds deposited with the Paying Agent.
This bond may cease to be deemed outstanding under the Resolution if
the University at any time makes provision for payment of all bonds of the
issue of which this bond is one by depositing with the Paying Agent cash
or direct obligations of the United States of America, the principal of and
interest on which when due, will be sufficient to pay the principal of and
interest on the bonds as the same become due by maturity. Notice of such
provision for payment shall be promptly thereafter sent to the registered
holder of each bond registered as to principal and to each holder of a bearer
bond who has requested such notice in writing, by certified or registered mail

interest on this bond or any claim based thereon against the State of Michigan, the University or any member of the University, or any officer or agent
thereof, as individuals, either directly or indirectly; nor shall these obligations
become lien on or secured by any property, real, personal or mixed, of the
State of Michigan or the University, other than the Student Fees, as defined
in the Resolution, which are pledged to meet or provide for the payment

of said obligations; and the liability of the University, as a body corporate,
shall be limited to said Student Fees, all other liability, except as expressed
in the Resolution, being by the acceptance hereof and as a part of the consideration for the issuance hereof expressly waived.
This bond is transferable by delivery unless registered as to principal
in the owner's name upon books to be kept by the Paying Agent for such
purpose, such registration to be noted hereon. After such registration no
transfer of this bond shall be valid unless made on said books at the request
of the registered owner hereof, or his duly authorized agent, and similarly
noted hereon; but this bond may be discharged from registration by being
in like manner transferred to bearer, whereupon transferability by delivery
shall be restored, and this bond may again from time to time be registered
or made payable to bearer as before. Such registration, however, shall not
affect the negotiability of the annexed coupons, which shall always be
transferable by delivery and be payable to bearer, and payment to bearer
thereof shall fully discharge the University in respect to the interest thereon,
whether or not this bond be registered as to principal and whether or not
such coupons be overdue.
IT Is HEREBY CERTIFIED AND RECITED that all acts, conditions and things
required to be done, to happen or to be performed precedent to and in the
issuance of this bond, have been done, have happened and have been performed in due time, form and manner, as required by law.

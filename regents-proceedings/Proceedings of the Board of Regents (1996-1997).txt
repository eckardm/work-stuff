JULY MEETING, 1996


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, July 18, 1996
The Regents met at 10:25 a.m. in the Welker Room of the Michigan
Union. Present were Interim President Neal and Regents Baker, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Provost Machen, Executive Vice
President Womack, Vice Presidents Hartford and Harrison, Acting Vice
President Neidhardt, and Secretary Palmer were also present, as were Vice
Provost Dumas and General Counsel Cole. Chancellor Nelms, Chancellor
Renick, and Vice President Kinnear were absent. Regents Deitch and Horning
joined the meeting at 10:30 a.m.
Executive Session Motion
President Neal called on Regent McFee, who read the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(e) and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in
closed session on July 18, 1996, in the Welker Room, Michigan
Union, for the purposes of consulting with our attorney regarding
trial or settlement strategy in connection with specific pending
litigation (section 8e) and of considering material exempt from
discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information
Act (section 8h). Such exempt material consists of written opinions
from the Board's legal counsel.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then continued in executive session until 12:55 p.m., at which
time the executive session adjourned.
The Regents reconvened at 1:10 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present
were Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman, Power, and
Varner. Interim President Neal, Provost Machen, Executive Vice President
Womack, Vice Presidents Hartford and Harrison, Chancellors Nelms and
Renick, and Secretary Palmer were also present. Vice President Kinnear and
Acting Vice President Neidhardt were absent.
President's Report
President Neal thanked the Board of Regents for their trust and
confidence and stated that he intended to continue the momentum of the
previous leadership and to help make possible a smooth transition for the next
president. He noted that his immediate challenge since he had assumed the
presidency had involved the transitions underway at the Medical Center. He
then commented on the unique capacity of this university to meet this
challenge and noted that very few institutions would be in the enviable
position of being able to identify, in a very quick fashion, individuals of the




July Meeting, 1996


caliber of the two individuals being recommended to fill the positions of dean
of the Medical School and executive director of University of Michigan
Hospitals.
President Neal commented on the long, distinguished service of Mr. John
Forsyth, noting that he had established the first University-owned health
maintenance organization (M-Care), and that he had overseen the significant
growth in the Medical Center that has occurred over the past decade. On
behalf of the executive officers he expressed the "tremendous appreciation we
have for the contributions that John has made to this institution." There
followed a round of applause.
President Neal called on Regent Power, who read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan salute John D.
Forsyth, president and chief executive officer of the University of
Michigan Health System, as he leaves the University of Michigan to
become president and CEO of ISAD Health Services Corporation in
Iowa.
John has spent his entire 26-year professional career at the
University of Michigan. After receiving bachelor's and master's
degrees from Michigan State University, he joined the staff of the
University of Michigan personnel office where, from 1970-76, he held a
number of progressively more responsible staff and management
positions and rose to director of Medical Center Human Resources in
1976.  He was promoted to deputy executive director and chief
operating officer of UM Hospitals in 1983 and executive director of
UM Hospitals in 1985. He has served as president and CEO of the
UM Health System since its creation in February 1996.
As executive director of UM Hospitals, John oversaw a $1.2
billion budget, representing 45 percent of the entire University
budget. During his tenure, he led the transformation of the health
system that built reserves from zero to $700 million in ten years and
led to an AA rating by Standard & Poor's. Under his leadership,
the University established M-Care HMO, constructed and activated
the $150 million Maternal and Child Health Care Center, and
implemented a statewide networking strategy. His administration
also instituted a nationally-recognized total quality program and an
employee-empowerment program, as well as cost efficiency programs
that reduced costs by more than $150 million over four years.
A relaxed, accessible, and responsive administrator, John scheduled
breakfast meetings, call-in sessions, and semi-annual open forums to
ensure the broadest possible participation by the health system's
thousands of employees as the system    underwent its steady
transformation. His top priorities have always been the UMH employees
and the patients they serve. John's wife, Rita, has also been an active
member of the University community. She serves as a member of the


2




July Meeting, 1996


Ronald McDonald House board of directors and developed and
implemented an innovative program to improve the in-patient experience
for Cancer Center patients and their families.
In recognition of his extraordinary accomplishments, the Regents
wish to convey their deepest respect, admiration, and gratitude to
John D. Forsyth for his exemplary, long-term service to the University
of Michigan, and wish him continued success as he leaves Ann Arbor
to pursue new challenges in this next phase of his career.
Regent Baker expressed support for the motion. Mr. Forsyth thanked
the current and previous executive officers and the Regents, noting that "we
couldn't have done the things we've been able to do without the support of both
the executive officers and the Regents." There followed a round of applause.
President Neal then called for a motion on the action request before the
Board to change the title of Dean Giles Bole. President Neal observed that
Dr. Bole had served as dean of the Medical School since 1990 and had spent his
entire, 38-year career at the University of Michigan. Under his leadership, the
Medical School has risen in the U.S. News and World Report rankings from
16th to 9th and to 9th in total research funding. His accomplishments also
include the redesign of the Medical School curriculum and improvement in
the school's physical facilities. President Neal expressed his deep appreciation
to Dean Bole "for his many contributions to this University. We are very
pleased that although he is leaving the deanship, he will remain on the faculty
and will continue to be a part of the University community." There followed
a round of applause.
Regent Baker moved that the title of Giles G. Bole be changed to dean
emeritus and professor of internal medicine, effective August 1, 1996. Regent
McFee seconded the motion. The motion was approved unanimously.
Regents Baker thanked Dean Bole for his role in leading the Medical
School during a time of great change in medical education. Regent McFee
observed that she had been very proud of the changes that Dr. Bole had made
in the Medical School, and that his leadership has been most appreciated.
Regent Deitch observed that "Dr. Boles' 38 years of commitment to one
institution is remarkable," and that he "had benefited from his sagacity and
his commitment to Michigan."
Dean Bole thanked the Regents and executive officers for the
opportunity to serve in the variety of roles he has filled. He observed that
academic medical centers are at a crossroads, and that the options and
alternatives for the future present a challenge for society and the public, but
especially for governing boards and officers who have a commitment to the
academic enterprise.
There followed a round of applause, after which President Neal asked
for consideration of the appointment of A. Lorris Betz as interim dean of the
Medical School and Larry Warren as interim executive director of University
of Michigan Hospitals.


3




July Meeting, 1996


Regent Horning moved approval of A. Lorris Betz as interim dean of the
Medical School; Regent Power seconded the motion. President Neal reported
that Dr. Betz is currently senior associate dean and professor of neurosurgery
and neuroanatomy at the Medical School. Provost Machen observed that Dr.
Betz is a nationally known researcher and that his appointment was
enthusiastically supported throughout the Medical School. The vote was then
taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Regarding the recommendation of Larry Warren as interim executive
director of University of Michigan Hospitals, President Neal observed that
Mr. Warren had served as the senior associate hospital director and chief
operating officer of the University of Michigan Hospitals since January 1994.
Executive Vice President Womack noted that Mr. Warren had brought a
distinguished record of service to the University, and that he has the support
of the hospitals staff to fill this position. He pointed out that Mr. Warren's
title will be interim executive director of University of Michigan Hospitals.
This was the title being used until February 1996, and reverting back to it in
no way indicates that this position is less than Mr. Forsyth's position. The
fact that the Regents Communications requesting Dr. Betz's and Mr.
Warren's appointment was signed by the University's three senior executive
officers is meant to indicate the amount of empowerment being given to them.
Regent Horning moved approval of the appointment of Larry Warren as
interim executive director of University of Michigan Hospitals; Regent
McFee seconded the motion. There being no further discussion, the vote was
taken and the motion was approved unanimously.
Regent McFee observed that it is because of the strength of Dr. Boles'
and Mr. Forsyth's leadership over the past several years that the University
is in a position to discuss how to preserve its academic health center rather
than close it down. She welcomed the two new officers to continue in this
endeavor.
Trends in U.S. Academic Health Centers
President Neal called on Mr. Geoffrey Shields, of Gardner, Carton &
Douglas, and his associate, Michael Staab, for a presentation on "Trends in
U.S. Academic Health Centers." He noted that Mr. Shields and his firm have
been involved in over 200 restructurings of hospital systems.
Mr. Shields first described current trends in health care, noting that as
HMO enrollment increases, hospital utilization decreases, and that HMO
enrollment is increasing in Michigan. He noted that the University is
currently the highest-cost provider in its market, and it must become the
lowest-cost provider in order to compete. The University most likely needs
to become part of a broader system in order to increase the number of
referrals, enhance its bargaining power, and achieve economies of scale. Mr.
Shields pointed out that as primary care physicians are absorbed by other
systems, and as the uniqueness of teaching hospitals is being eroded, the
disruption of referral patterns results in decreased volume and profit.


4




July Meeting, 1996


He went on to describe three alternative structures that the University
could consider: down sizing, selling, and expanding, and pointed out the
advantages and disadvantages of each structure.
Mr. Shields then yielded to Mr. Staab, who described what other academic
medical centers have done to decrease business risk, increase business
opportunity, and better coordinate medical school, university, and hospital
relationships. He noted that the challenge is to run the university hospital
as a business while respecting the academic and research missions of the
medical school. Mr. Staab described the advantages and drawbacks of some
of the methods that have been used by other academic medical centers,
including 1) spinning off the university hospital into a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit
corporation or public authority; 2) sale or lease of the hospital to a proprietary
company; 3) merging into a not-for-profit network with 50% or less control;
and 4) not restructuring. He noted that universities that have not restructured
report that it is important that there be central decision-making authority for
the hospital and medical school, led by one individual, preferably a medical
doctor with a business background; there is a consensus that a lay person in
charge of the medical center and medical school will not work. The drawbacks
to this system are the slow nature of the bureaucratic university decisionmaking process, the critical importance of accurate, long-range forecasting of
market trends, and the financial risk to the university if the hospital is not
financially successful.
During the presentation, Messrs. Shields and Staab responded to
questions from the Regents about the various restructuring options. It was
pointed out that none of the academic medical centers that were used as
illustrations of the various options are considered peer institutions to the
University of Michigan.
Regent Newman inquired as to whether it would be possible for the
University Hospital to change its procedures with regard to purchasing,
personnel issues, benefits, etc., if it were to retain its current structure.
Regent Deitch suggested that it might be helpful to arrange meetings for
some of the Regents with officials from Duke University, Emory, and
University of Pennsylvania to learn how they have maintained their
traditional structures while protecting themselves in their marketplaces.
Mr. Staab concluded with the observation that in the managed care
system, the fact that an institution is a top-tier academic medical center is
immaterial: costs are the bottom line.
Following the presentation and discussion, there was a five-minute
break at 3:10 p.m.
Proposed 1996-97 Operating Budgets
President Neal observed that the University appreciates the efforts of
the governor and legislature in making higher education an important
priority in 1996-97; their actions have resulted in one of the lowest
recommended tuition increases in many years.


5




July Meeting, 1996


He called on Executive Vice President Womack, who gave a slide
presentation describing the current funds revenue and expenditure budgets
for all campuses and the four funds of which they are comprised. The
1996-97 Current Funds budget totals consist of $2.733 billion in revenues
and $2.611 billion in expenditures. Revenues include $343.0 million in state
appropriations and $466.0 million in student tuition and fees. The total
revenue increase is 6.0 percent; the total expenditure increase is 6.7 percent.
The total budget revenues are comprised of the Auxiliary Activities
Fund (48 percent, consisting of 41 percent in medical activities and 7 percent
in other activities); the General Fund (32 percent); the ExpendableRestricted Fund (17 percent); and the Designated Fund (3 percent). He noted
that the General Fund represents the leverage for all of the other funds and
turned to Provost Machen to review the General Fund Budget.
Proposed 1996-97 General Fund Operating Budget
Provost Machen reviewed the fundamental budget objectives, which are
to maintain and enhance the quality of instructional and research programs;
to increase the quality of the undergraduate educational experience; to
maintain and enhance access for Michigan undergraduates; and to continue
to move toward racial and gender diversity more closely related to proportions
in the population. Major initiatives to achieve these objectives have been
Value Centered Management (VCM) (which will expand the entrepreneurial
enterprise and achieve increased efficiency through greater cost control);
M-Quality (which will improve the quality of service); and Re-engineering (to
reexamine and redesign the University's business processes).
Provost Machen pointed out that there were two key factors influencing
budget planning: 1) preparation for the implementation of VCM, in which
revenue associated with centrally-funded programs is being transferred to
the units and responsibility for these programs will be transferred from the
provost's office to the units; and 2) enrollment decline and shifts in the
composition of the student body. He noted that a reduction of 200-300
students results in millions of dollars worth of lost revenue, and that the
under-realization of FY96 enrollment projections led to a $4.8 million
shortfall in budgeted tuition revenue. Projections for FY97 indicate further
reductions in student enrollment, which are expected to have a revenue
impact of $5.1 million.
Provost Machen explained that some schools, such as the Medical School
and School of Art and Design, have planned enrollment reductions. There
has also been a change in the mix of resident and nonresident students, as
well as a reduction in the number of graduate students. At the graduate
level, this can be attributed to both the size and quality of the applicant pool
and to costs. He pointed out that an out-of-state resident can attend medical
school at Harvard for less money than at the University of Michigan. Similar
price differentials occur for other graduate and professional programs.
At the undergraduate level, the number of applicants has not
diminished, but the level of selectivity has been affected for nonresident


6




July Meeting, 1996


applicants by the high nonresident tuition rate, which is very high relative to
other state universities and within the range of private peer institutions.
Regent Deitch observed that increased costs have the potential of
diminishing the quality of the applicant pool. Whereas at one point,
out-of-state applicants would have come in part because of the significant
price advantage, as this advantage has diminished, people make different
decisions. Therefore, he raised the issue of whether the University should be
focusing on cost containment to help regain market share. Provost Machen
responded that the University has already been focusing on cost containment.
Regent Newman posed the question of why, given decreasing
enrollment, is the University increasing capacity and increasing costs for
operation and maintenance of buildings, housing, and other areas? Provost
Machen noted that the enrollment decline has been insignificant, averaging
about one percent, or 300-500 students. Fixed costs are already "in the
pipeline." The increased costs in the current budget are for new buildings
coming on line, commitments for which were made many years ago.
Regent Power pointed out that VCM allows academic units to manage
their enrollment as part of their costs and revenue stream.
In response to Regent Newman's question as to how much fixed costs
will increase for the proposed budget, Provost Machen stated that the new
added costs in the 1996-97 budget total $4.5 million. During this transition
year, these costs will continue to be managed centrally, but upon full
implementation of VCM next year, they will be managed by units within
their own budgets.
Provost Machen observed that the University's state appropriation
increase of 4.6 percent was the second lowest of all of the other state
institutions. On the other hand, the University's national leadership in
sponsored research activity is projected to yield a 6.9 percent increase in
indirect cost recovery.
The 1996-97 expenditure plan includes a base budget increase for salary
programs that will require internal reallocation by the units to assure a
merit program on the order of the rate of inflation; a nine percent increase in
student financial aid in order to meet the financial need of all Michigan
undergraduates; maintaining new and renovated spaces; and targeted faculty
hiring.
Provost Machen displayed a table detailing the categories and amounts
of revenue and expenditures that comprise the total General Fund revenue
and expenditure budget increase of $26.3 million. He also displayed a chart
illustrating that this is the smallest percent change in budgeted General
Fund revenue increase since 1962.
In response to Regent Newman's question about the financial aid
budget, Provost Machen stated that the General Fund financial aid budget
for 1996-97 will be $83.1 million, or $6.9 million more than in 1995-96. She
also asked what percentage of students receive financial aid from the
University's funds, and Associate Vice President Holbrook responded that


7




July Meeting, 1996


about 40 percent of undergraduate students receive financial aid, which
consists of a package of University funds in the form of grants, combined
with federal funds in the form of loans. A high percentage of graduate students
receive aid, in a wide variety of forms. As for the average amount of University
aid received, this is best viewed as the total amount of $83.1 million
expenditure for grants against the $405.6 million revenue for tuition and fees.
Provost Machen then displayed charts indicating the proposed FY
1996-97 General Fund Operating Budget by academic unit and by executive
officer area and a listing of the 1996-97 increases in resident undergraduate
tuition for first year students at other Michigan public universities and at Big
Ten universities.
Regent Deitch inquired as to whether the other public universities also
had a tuition differential for lower and upper division students, and what the
rationale is for this differential. Provost Machen responded that most other
institutions also employ a similar tuition differential. He noted that the tuition
differential exists because traditionally the cost for upper division courses is
greater than that for lower division courses, due to the type of courses being
taken once students begin concentrating on their majors.
Regents Deitch and Newman questioned this rationale, with Regent
Newman expressing the opinion that this is a disincentive to remaining in
school. Provost Machen responded that he was not aware that the increased
tuition rates for upper division students had any relationship to the graduation
rate. Regent Deitch wondered why, given the fact that there is an existing
differential to account for higher costs for upper level undergraduate courses,
the rate of increase wouldn't be equal for lower and upper division students,
rather than the 3 percent and 5 percent respective increases proposed for
lower and upper division resident tuition rates. Provost Machen responded
that there are many factors that go into the setting of tuition rates. He also
showed a chart illustrating the comparatively low cost for a Michigan resident
to attend the University of Michigan as compared to the top 25 nationally
ranked universities.
In summary, he announced that the recommended increases in student fee
rates for 1996-97 are three percent for lower division resident undergraduates,
five percent for all other students, and differential increases for specific graduate
programs that reflect special market or cost factors.
Regent McFee pointed out that it is important that everyone recognize
that in order to keep the tuition increase at its lowest level in many years,
many people throughout the University must work hard to keep down costs.
UM-Dearborn General Fund Budget and Student Fee Rates for 1996-97
Chancellor Renick reported that because of the 11.9 percent increase in
state appropriation for its campus, the UM-Dearborn is proposing a modest
2.8 percent resident student tuition increase, no increase in nonresident
tuition, and no increase in fees. The proposed budget will allow the campus
to maintain and enhance its mission; to establish new faculty lines in the
Colleges of Arts, Sciences, and Letters, Education, and Engineering; to fund


8




July Meeting, 1996


new facilities operating costs; and to provide a modest salary program for
faculty and staff.
He noted that UM-Dearborn expects an enrollment growth of about two
percent.
UM-Flint General Fund Budget and Student Fee Rates for 1996-97
Chancellor Nelms observed that UM-Flint has three objectives in its
1996-97 budget plan: 1) to continue moving more activities out of the
contingency budget category to the general fund; 2) to begin to implement its
recently completed academic plan by adding new faculty lines in high
demand areas, such as physical therapy and nursing; and 3) to implement a
salary program of about four percent. The campus has also begun an
enrollment management program with the intention of adjusting services to
emphasize retaining students, rather than focusing on attracting new students.
The UM-Flint budget is predicated on a 5.5 percent increase in state
appropriation and proposed tuition increases of 3.9 percent for lower division
undergraduate students and 4.9 percent for upper division undergraduate
students and varying percentage increases in graduate and professional
programs, as well as a 3.7 percent increase in registration and infrastructure
fees and 4.0 percent increase in the technology fee. He pointed out that this
will be the first year that there will be a differential fee increase for lower
and upper division undergraduate students, due to the increased cost of
providing instruction for upper division students. Chancellor Nelms observed
that even with these tuition and fee increases, UM-Flint will be eleventh of
the fifteen public state institutions with respect to cost.
Chancellor Nelms reported that although the campus is not budgeting for
an enrollment increase, it is anticipating a moderate increase in enrollment.
Vice President Hartford recognized students in attendance at the meeting
who are participating in Leadership 2017, a summer student leadership
program.
There followed a five minute recess, after which the meeting reconvened
in the Regents' Room at 4:15 p.m. to hear public comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Fiona Rose, president of Michigan
Student Assembly, about the 1996-97 operating budget and student tuition
rates; and Audrey Jackson, alumna, about affirmative action policies.
Following public comments, the meeting recessed at 4:30 p.m.
Friday, July 19, 1996
The Regents met at 9:15 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Neal and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horing, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Varner. Provost Machen, Executive Vice President


9




July Meeting, 1996


Womack, Vice Presidents Hartford and Harrison, Chancellors Nelms and
Renick, and Secretary Palmer were also present. Vice Presidents Kinnear
and Neidhardt were absent.
President's Report
President Neal called the meeting to order. He commented that at the
September meeting he planned to report on the major issues and priorities
for the coming year. Among these are the implementation of Value Centered
Management, budget issues, Hospitals and Medical School issues, and NCAA
re-certification. He said that he and the executive officers are committed to
preserving continuity and building a sense of community on campus, acting
on matters that are time sensitive, and assisting the Regents and the
University with the transition to the new president.
President Neal noted that the Supreme Court had decided not to review
a lower court's ruling that found consideration of race in admissions decisions
at the University of Texas to be unconstitutional (Hopwood v Texas). He
stated that since the University of Michigan has been a leader in broadening
access to its educational opportunities, it would be appropriate to review its
programs in light of trends that appear to be arising nationwide. He expects
there to be a report to the Board by the October meeting on the University's
programs in order to assess their status; this review may include consultation
with outside counsel.
Statement by Regent Baker. Regent Baker read from a prepared
statement, a copy of which is on file in the Office of the Secretary of the
University. He noted that it is possible that a case similar to Hopwood could
be filed against the University of Michigan. He quoted from a Detroit News
article in which University of Michigan professor Carl Cohen alleges that "The
University of Michigan appears to be operating a system strongly tilted in
favor of target minorities for admission to undergraduate school, as well as the
colleges [sic] of law and medicine." Professor Cohen believes the University's
policies would make "an excellent test case for a definitive United States
Supreme Court ruling on university policies toward affirmative action."
Given the Hopwood decision and Professor Cohen's assertions, Regent
Baker stated that "the University's president and the Regents have a duty to
subject Professor Cohen's publicly stated assertions and the Hopwood
decision to review by qualified legal counsel to determine what effect, if any,
these issues have on university admission policies." He expressed support
for President Neal's plan to subject these policies to review and suggested
that the review be conducted by independent outside counsel.
Comments from Regent McFee. Regent McFee observed that to her,
affirmative action means an effort to bring into the upward stream of
opportunity those groups against whom either discriminatory practices, or in
some instances, discriminatory legislation, have occurred. She noted that the
University of Michigan was one of the first to admit women and members of
religious groups who were banned from other schools, and that its more
recent policies, such as the Michigan Mandate and the Agenda for Women,


10




July Meeting, 1996


continue this striving to maintain upward mobility and equal opportunity.
She believes it is paramount that this upward stream remain open to all
groups; because of this, it is critical that the University's procedures comport
with the law. Therefore, she welcomes the opportunity to "thoroughly
examine our procedures and make sure that they do comport with the law
and enable us to continue these practices."
Comments from Regent McGowan. Regent McGowan stated that
she wanted to clarify that nothing has changed. Neither the Agenda for
Women, the Michigan Mandate, nor the policies of the admissions office are
being called into question. She observed that "an examination of the results
and the implementation of our policies is always welcome, but I would be
concerned if any person here were to believe this to be a signal [that it is
meant to be any more than that]." She wanted to make clear that the
University's commitment and policies are not under review and are not being
questioned by this action; rather "a responsible inquiry as to whether our
implementation is appropriate" is what is being called for.
Proposed 1996-97 Operating Budgets
Executive Vice President Womack continued his review of the proposed
1996-97 operating budget with an examination of the Designated, Expendable
Restricted, and Auxiliary Funds. The Designated Fund consists of a collection
of funds in which a number of activities designated by the Regents, such as
conferences, seminars, and continuing education programs, occur.
The largest of all of the funds is the Auxiliary Activities Fund, of which
the Clinical Delivery System comprises 63 percent, other medical activities
comprise 23 percent, and housing, athletics, and other enterprises, make up
the remainder. He pointed out that approval of the overall budget includes
approval of the budget for the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics, since that
budget is included in the Auxiliary Activities Fund. However, details of the
athletic department budget are not included in this presentation.
Regent McGowan pointed out that the Regents had previously reviewed
details of the other major budgets that make up the Auxiliary Activities
Fund, and she expressed an interest in being provided with similar detail
with respect to the athletic department budget. Vice President Harrison
observed that the Regents receive copies of minutes of the meetings of the
Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, which contain information on
all matters considered by that board, including recommended ticket price
increases. Proposed revisions to the Regental bylaw regarding this board call
for an annual report to the Board of Regents by the athletic director.
Regent McGowan stated that since the Regents are ultimately responsible
for it, she thinks the Regents should have an opportunity to review the athletic
department budget. Regent Power suggested that in the future, this should be
done prior to consideration of the overall budget. Regent Newman agreed
that in light of the amount of time that the Regents have spent reviewing
other portions of the overall budget, and given the impact that the athletic
department budget has on the University, it is important that Regents have
an opportunity to review it.
11




July Meeting, 1996


Executive Vice President Womack suggested that the Regents act on the
entire budget, subject to a full presentation of the athletic department
budget at the September Regents Meeting. In future years, this budget would
be presented earlier in the cycle to provide the same opportunity for review
and discussion that other budgets receive. The Regents expressed agreement
with this proposal.
Regent Varner left the meeting at this point, at 9:40 a.m.
Executive Vice President Womack concluded his presentation with a
review of the Expendable Restricted Fund, which is the repository for voluntary
support. Government sponsored programs comprise 63 percent of the total of
$459 million in this fund, and private gifts comprise 30 percent.
Regent Deitch moved adoption of the revenue and expenditure operating
budgets for Fiscal Year 1996-97 as presented, subject to presentation of the
detailed budget of the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics portion of the
Auxiliary Activities Fund at the September 1996 meeting. Regent McFee
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regent Power moved approval of the 1996-97 Ann Arbor General Fund
Operating Budget. Regent McFee seconded the motion. Regent McFee
observed that the incorporation of VCM into the budget makes it more
difficult to follow than in the past, but that she intends to support it. Regent
Power observed that the budget is a policy document that has VCM
embedded within it. The fact that VCM allows faculty members to behave in
an entrepreneurial fashion, knowing their costs and being in a position to
effect their revenue, is why it should be adopted.
Regent Baker commented that adoption of VCM is an important change
in process that should be carefully monitored by the administration and
about which the Regents should be kept informed.
Regent Newman commented that the Board was being asked to vote for
the budget prior to voting for its funding in the form of the student fee
increase. Regent Power then withdrew his motion and moved instead to
approve an increase in the UM-Ann Arbor student fee rates for FY 1996-97
of 3.0 percent for full-time, full-term resident lower division undergraduates;
5.0 percent for all other full-time, full-term students; and special increases
for other programs, as detailed in the Regents Communication. Regent
McFee seconded the motion.
Regent Newman stated that she has two concerns about the student fee
rates: the fact that the rates are more for upper division students than for
lower division students and that financial aid is being increased by 9 percent.
Regent Newman stated she views a financial aid increase of that dimension
as "a redistribution of wealth" and that she is unclear as to why a 9 percent
increase is necessary. She questioned whether a lesser increase in financial
aid might enable the tuition increase to stay at 3 percent for both lower and
upper division undergraduates.
Provost Machen responded that the need for the recommended level of
financial aid is very real, and he would not be in favor of any change in the


12




July Meeting, 1996


allocation of financial aid. Regent Power observed that as a public university,
the University attempts to provide "the widest possible access to the best
possible education for as many people as we can." The Board has adopted a
policy which assures that resident undergraduate students will receive
sufficient financial aid to complete their education. He noted that in the
annual budget, a portion of the tuition increase is diverted to financial aid.
He stated that the nine percent financial aid increase in the face of three
percent tuition increase is a tradeoff that he believes is appropriate.
Regent McGowan commented that her understanding of the Provost's
explanation for the tuition and financial aid increases is that in order for the
Board to continue its policy of providing sufficient financial aid for all
resident undergraduate students, the figures presented in the budget are
what is required.
Regent McFee commented that while she recognizes Regent Newman's
concerns about the fact that students who pay the full price of tuition are, in
effect, subsidizing those who receive financial aid, she has not been able to
come up with a suitable alternative. Regent Horning expressed agreement
with Regent McFee's comments and thanked Provost Machen for his efforts
at putting the budget together. He stated that although it is higher than he
would wish it to be, he would support it because "the effort is there and that
we're going in the right direction."
Regent Newman stated that she agreed with the Board's policy of
providing financial aid to all qualified resident undergraduates, but she "does
not believe that we should be putting the onus on other students to support
those students, and that there should be other ways of assisting with that."
She also believes it is inappropriate to charge upper division instate students
a higher tuition rate than lower division students. She stated that she would
have preferred a more equitable distribution of rates, and does not support
placing the burden of access to all on other students.
Regent Deitch expressed support for the budget and agreement with
some of Regent Newman's comments. He believes that in the long-term,
steps have to be taken to stop the escalation of the cost of higher education,
and that VCM is a step in that direction. He noted that the cost of a
University of Michigan education is a bargain, which is subsidized through
the state appropriation by the citizens of the state. Over the long term, he
observed that the bigger issue is "getting a hold on costs." He believes that
higher education in general has until now been insulated from some of the
cost pressures that have affected the private sector.
Regent Baker commented that tuition increases compound over the
years, to the point where the University is pricing itself out of the market for
some of its programs. Although he expressed support for the judgment of the
administration with respect to costs, he urged it to concentrate on holding
them down. Although he has opposed tuition increases sometimes in the
past, he will support this increase because of its low rate.
The vote was then taken and the recommended 1996-97 student fee
rates for the Ann Arbor campus were approved on a vote of six to one, with


13




July Meeting, 1996


Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, and Power in favor, Regent
Newman opposed, and Regent Varner absent.
President Neal pointed out that it is difficult to track the source for each
individual category of expenditure, as all revenues are pooled to form the pot
from which the expenditures are made which represent the University's
highest priorities.
Regent McGowan moved approval of the 1996-97 Ann Arbor General
Fund operating budget, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent
McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved, with Regents Baker,
Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, and Power in favor, Regent Newman
abstaining, and Regent Varner absent.
University of Michigan-Dearborn 1996-97 General Fund Budget
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved the University of Michigan-Dearborn 1996-97 General
Fund budget, as described in the Regents Communication.
University of Michigan-Flint 1996-97 General Fund Budget
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents

unanimously approved the University of Michigan-Dearborn 1996-97 student

On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents

rates, as described in the Regents Communication.
Purchasing Contract with Rebus Planning Associates
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Horning, the Regents
unanimously approved a purchasing contract with Rebus Planning Associates.
Because the owner of Rebus Planning Associates, Samuel J. Meisels, is also a
University of Michigan faculty member, this contract falls under the state of
Michigan Conflict Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the purchase contract will be the Regents of the University
of Michigan and Rebus Planning Associates, Inc.
2.  The terms of the contract to support University of Michigan research
grants include the purchase of the following from Rebus Planning
Associates, Inc.:


14




July Meeting, 1996


2,186 workshop components (notebooks, overviews,
guidelines, manuals, student materials, registrations) $139,435
159 reference/education packs                     $ 10,554
666 reports and books                             $ 18,850
$168,839
The duration will be until June 30, 1997.
3.  Dr. Meisels' pecuniary interest arises from his position as owner of
Rebus Planning Associates.
Leasing Agreement with Barron Associates
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a lease agreement with Barron Associates for a medical
office building located at 4870 Clark Road, Ypsilanti, Michigan. Because Dr.
Parvis Panahi has both an equity interest in Barron Associates and is a
University of Michigan faculty member, this agreement falls under the state
of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided
in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Barron
Associates.
2.  Terms of the contract: The duration of the contract is 24 months.
The University will lease property located at 4870 Clark Road,
Ypsilanti, Michigan. The medical office facility is 1,642 square feet, at
a rental rate of $22.50 per square foot, $36,945 annually, beginning on
August 1, 1996. This rate includes all utilities and operating expenses.
The medical center will place clericals, medical office assistants, nurses,
and physicians to provide necessary primary care services to the
community.
3.  Dr. Panahi's pecuniary interest arises from his 12.07 percent interest
in Barron Associates, the owners of the building. Through Barron
Associates, he will receive a percentage of revenues generated by the
leasing of the property to the University.
Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and
Therapeutic Systems Research Laboratories (TSRL)
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent McFee, the
Regents unanimously approved a research agreement between the University
of Michigan and Therapeutic Systems Research Laboratories (TSRL). Because
three University of Michigan employees, Gordon Amidon, John Crison, and
Elke Lipka are also, respectively, officer, director, and stockholder (Amidon),
and employees (Crison and Lipka) of TSRL, this agreement falls under the
state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and
Therapeutic Systems Research Laboratories (TSRL).
2.  Terms of the proposed letter of award conform to University policy.
The period of performance is six months and the total cost of the
project is $23,309.


15




July Meeting, 1996


3.  None of the joint University-TSRL employees has any connection
with the project on behalf of the University. Dr. Amidon's pecuniary
interest arises by virtue of his position as an officer, director, and
principal stockholder in TSRL and Dr. Crison's and Lipka's pecuniary
interest arises by virtue of their employment by TSRL.
Reassignment Agreement with John T. Lindsay
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent McGowan, the
Regents unanimously approved a reassignment agreement with John T.
Lindsay for his invention, "Semi-Insulating Bulk GaAs Semiconductor
Thermal Neutron Imaging Device." Because Mr. Lindsay is also a University
employee, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan, John T.
Lindsay, and Douglas S. McGregor.
2.  The contract terms include a payment to the University of 15 percent
of total consideration received by the inventors. There will be no use of
University facilities or services without appropriate approvals. John T.
Lindsay's pecuniary interest arises from his right to receive royalties
when this technology is licensed. This is in lieu of participation in the
sharing of royalties received by the University in accordance with
University policy.

Laboratory). He was promoted to associate professor in 1967 and professor in
1970. Within the College of Engineering, Professor Birdsall has served as
director of the Cooley Electronics Laboratory and the Communications and
Signal Processing Laboratory. He has guided a significant number of graduate
students into active research careers, some of whom continue to work as
colleagues through a research consortium.
By the time he joined the faculty, Professor Birdsall had established an
international reputation in the field of signal detectability theory. His work
proved to have applicability in several fields, including sensory psychology,
psychometrics, and underwater acoustics.   Throughout his career, his
research has focused on two basic areas: signal detection and estimation (the
statistical theory of extracting information from noisey electronic signals) and
physical measurements in underwater acoustics. Professor Birdsall has
described himself as an "interface man" for his role in helping other researchers
to apply signal processing theory to their own fields of research. In 1989, he
was elected a fellow of the Acoustical Society of America for his "contributions
to the science of acoustical signal processing."
In recent years, Professor Birdsall has become involved with an
international consortium working on global warming initiatives. His work
with this consortium on the use of underwater acoustics as a means of
estimating changes in the average temperature of the oceans has received
national attention and was described in a 1991 announcement by the National
Academy of Science as "a remarkable achievement." Professor Birdsall plans
to remain actively involved with this project after his retirement.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Theodore G.
Birdsall professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science.

University of Michigan/University of Wisconsin International Studies Program
in Florence, Italy. She was appointed director of this program in 1994.
Professor Cheng received, three Rackham Research Grants, in 1975,
1982, and 1988. The first was for the study of ancient Asian "B'iao"
techniques and rice paper as a contemporary medium; the second was for the
study of the tonality and structure of the English landscape; and the third
was for research in wax emulsion and oil painting, which culminated in a
retrospective exhibition at the University of Michigan Museum of Art in 1988.
She has also long been recognized with extensive regional, national, and
international awards, exhibitions, and solo shows. In October 1995, Professor


28

Bernard Naylor, M.D., professor of pathology, retired from active
faculty status on June 30, 1996.
Dr. Naylor attended the University of Manchester in England, where he
received his M.B. and Ch.B. degrees in 1951. He served internships and
residencies in the United Kingdom until 1954. He pursued a residency in
pathology at the University of Michigan from 1954-56, while simultaneously
pursing his M.Sc. degree in pathology from the Horace H. Rackham School of
Graduate Studies, which he completed in 1956. After completion of his
residency training, Dr. Naylor served a three-month locum tenens as assistant
pathologist at the Croydon Hospitals, London, England. Dr. Naylor joined the
faculty in 1957 as an instructor in pathology. He was promoted to assistant
professor in 1959, associate professor in 1964, and professor in 1968. From
November 1961 to November 1962, he served as acting director of the
Papanicolaou Cancer Research Institute in Miami, Florida.
Dr. Naylor was the department's specialist in the field of cytopathology.
Widely recognized as an outstanding teacher, he received the Elizabeth
Crosby Award for outstanding teaching of medical students in a basic medical
science in 1981 and commendations for excellence in teaching from the
Medical School classes of 1988, 1989, and 1990. He received a Certification of
Merit from the International Academy of Cytology in 1973 and a Certificate of
Merit from the American Society of Cytology in recognition of outstanding
services as president of the society in November 1985. He also received the
1990 Papanicolaou Award from the American Society of Cytology.
Dr. Naylor will continue to play an active role in the department's
educational programs, especially in the areas of medical student and resident
teaching. He will be actively involved in updating medical student teaching
materials and will participate in the second-year medical student teaching
laboratories.
The Regents salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming Bernard Naylor professor emeritus of pathology.
Memorials. Provost Machen reported that Sylvester Berki, professor of
health management and policy in the School of Public Health, had died on
July 10, 1996.
Degrees. Provost Machen submitted final degree lists for the June 1996
Medical School commencement and May 1996 commencements at other


34




July Meeting, 1996


schools, colleges, and divisions. He also submitted the doctoral degree list for
August 1996 and changes to previously approved degree lists.
Honorary Degrees. Noting that there were several recommendations
before the Board for the Committee on Honorary Degrees, Regent Baker
commented that he had, in the past, submitted a number of nominations to
the honorary degree committee for consideration as honorary degree recipients,
and in most cases his suggestions were rejected. Regent Baker pointed out that
most of his nominations have been of well-known people with conservative
views, and he believes there is a bias against the conservative view on the
honorary degree committee.
Regent Newman observed that she had raised the same issue when the
latest list of honorary degree recipients had been presented for approval, and
had asked to see a list of all past degree recipients. She echoed Regent
Baker's remarks and asked that other names be submitted in the future.
Regent McGowan noted that she had reviewed the same list of previous
degree recipients, and that in her view, it was a remarkably diverse list in
every sense of the word. She questioned whether the committee had a mandate
to reflect political views and commented that she believed the committee had
done a remarkable job over time in assuring that the University had honored
scholars who may or may not have had a connection to the University in the
past, as well as public personalities who are important either to the University,
the state, the country, or the world. She does not agree that the concerns
expressed are reflected by the committee's choices.
Regent Power observed that the granting of honorary degrees should be in
recognition of "distinguished scholarly or public service or remarkable career
achievements in which the terms 'conservative' or 'liberal' are meaningless."
He said he was "saddened that this polarity has entered into the discussion at
this table."
Regent Baker responded that the term "conservative" is a very broad
term and does not connote political views.
Regent Deitch observed that all degrees are granted by the Regents.
The practice of having distinguished members of the faculty reviewing
candidates for academic honorary degrees has worked wonderfully, and he
has complete confidence in it. Vice President Harrison pointed out that in
addition to faculty members, the committee also includes students, alumni,
and executive officers.
Chancellor Nelms noted that Professor Frank Richardson would be
retiring. He is the last of the original faculty members who helped to
established the Flint campus.
Consent agenda approved. On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded
by Regent Power, the Regents unanimously approved the consent agenda.
Long Term Portfolio Asset Allocation
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Norman Herbert,
university treasurer, to explain the request to amend the asset allocation
35




July Meeting, 1996


policy for the Long Term Portfolio (LTP) and to approve commodities as an
investment for the LTP.
Mr. Herbert reported that since the establishment of the board's current
asset allocation and investment management policies, the staff has worked to
refine that program by globalizing the portfolio and by investing in such
alternative areas as real estate, venture capital, oil and gas, reorganization
investments, and emerging markets debt. Strategies have included the use
of diversification as an important risk control measure, gradually increasing
the allocation to equities as the equity portfolio became more diversified; and
emphasizing the undervalued areas of the market and being prudent about
expanding investment opportunities in those asset classes that may be
expensive at a particular point in time.
The proposal before the Board is to change the asset allocation policy for
the LTP from its target ratio of 75/25 (equities to fixed income investments) to
80/20, with an allowable range of 85/15 to 65/35; that the target for alternative
assets be raised from 25 percent to 30 percent; and that commodities be
approved as an investment. Mr. Herbert described commodities as tangible
assets such as agricultural products, oil and gas, and industrial and precious
metals. He noted that they are negatively correlated with stocks and bonds
and would thus provide significant diversification to the portfolio. They have
also historically provided high returns during periods of high inflation, thus
offering inflation protection. Finally, commodities have historically performed
well in phases of the economic environment such as the one that we are
entering.
Thus, commodities are viewed as a defensive measure against inflation
and against a possible down period in financial assets, while also providing
interesting return opportunities over the near term. He noted that the
proposal is for an investment in a commodity index, as opposed to a direct
investment in any of the specific commodities. The University plans to take
a long position in futures contracts on the Goldman Sachs Commodities Index,
which would give exposure to the performance of an array of commodities.
Mr. Herbert explained that the decision has not been made as to
whether to manage it internally or use an outside manager. He requested
that the recommendation in the Regents Communication be amended to
state that if the decision is made to manage the investment externally, the
manager that would be employed would be First Quadrant.
Regent Newman moved that: 1) the asset allocation policy for the Long
Term Portfolio be amended, setting the target ratio for equities to fixed
income investments at 80/20 within a range of 85/15 to 65/35; 2) the
alternative asset target for the Long Term Portfolio be raised from 25
percent to 30 percent; 3) that commodities be approved as an investment for
the Long Term Portfolio; and 4) that First Quadrant be used as an outside
manager, if the decision is made to use an outside manager rather than
manage the investment internally. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Following some discussion, the vote was taken and the motion was
approved unanimously.


36




July Meeting, 1996


Alternative Asset Investments
Mr. Herbert reviewed this proposed investment in Intrepid Energy
North Sea Ltd., noting that it provides an important opportunity to diversify
geographically in the energy category. Regent Deitch moved that $10 million
of the Long Term Portfolio be committed to Intrepid Energy North Sea Ltd.,
pending favorable review of the documents for their legal acceptability by the
general counsel. Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Commitment of $14 million of the Long Term Portfolio to Three
Alternative Asset Investments
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents about three
follow-on investments. Two were in new funds sponsored by previously
approved partnerships, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers VIII, L.P. ($5
million), and Endowment Venture Partners III, L.P. (up to $5 million). The
third was an increase in a previous commitment, Galileo, L.P. ($4 million).
Sale of $15,700,000 Regents of The University of Michigan
Housing Revenue Bonds, Series 1996A
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that Housing
Revenue Bonds, Series 1996A, had been purchased by the low bidder, a
syndicate led by Smith Barney, Inc., at a true interest cost of 5.6%.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects: UM-Dearborn Faculty
Office Building renovation and HV improvements and air conditioning
installation in the fourth floor of the Rackham Building.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting is scheduled for September 19-20, 1996. Regents' expenses accounted
for during the month of June 1996 totaled $1,672.62.
Roberta R. Palmer
Secretary of the University

Chancellor Nelms, who was absent. Vice President Hartford was also absent.
President's Report
Interim President Neal called the meeting to order and gave a
presentation summarizing data on the new undergraduate and graduate
student populations and new faculty and deans. He also updated the Board
on major gifts that had been received since he had assumed the role of interim
president in July and reported on his goals for the interim presidency. These
include reinforcing our academic community through better communication,
through integration of research and education (Undergraduate Research
Initiative), and through deliberation and reflection on our values. To further


41




September Meeting, 1996


the communication initiative, Interim President Neal announced that he had
established the University of Michigan Advisory Panel (UMAP) and a publication, "In the Interim," as a vehicle for communication with the faculty and
staff.
Interim President Neal said that the themes for the interim period will
be to ensure a sense of campus continuity; to preserve recent advances; to
capture new opportunities that may be presented; to act on key, timesensitive, matters; to lay the groundwork for the new administration; and to
assist the Regents with the installation of the new president.
He also reported on meetings he had had over the summer with
presidents of other state universities, the governor, former University of
Michigan presidents, and others.
Provost's Report
Provost Machen reported that the Child Care Task Force has been
established and is being chaired by Dean Ada Sue Hinshaw of the School of
Nursing. The Campus Safety Task Force, chaired by Dean Paul Boylan, was
also actively working. Both task forces are expected to report to the Regents
during this academic year.
Executive Compensation
Interim President Neal observed that the September 19 Ann Arbor News
had carried an article about the issue of executive compensation at the
University of Michigan. He called on Regent Baker, who made the following
statement:
The Regents have reacted with concern to the various newspaper
articles concerning executive officer compensation agreements made
by President Duderstadt before he left office. The Regents, working
with Interim President Neal and others, will examine these circumstances as well as the University's overall policy with regard to
executive officer compensation.
University Annual Financial Statements for 1995-96
Executive Vice President Womack reported that the independent
auditors had issued a clean opinion of the University's financial position as of
June 30, 1996, with no qualifications. The separately-bound audited financial
statements are included with the agenda materials.
Year-End Financial Information for 1995-96
Executive Vice President Womack called on Associate Vice President
Randy Harris, who gave a slide presentation on the year-end financial
information for 1995-96 compared with 1986-87. Mr. Harris noted that the
Current Funds consist of the Educational and General funds (E&G) (General,
Designated, and Expendable Restricted Funds), and the Auxiliary Activities
funds.


42




September Meeting, 1996


The proportion of current funds educational and general revenues derived
from state appropriations went from 34 percent in 1986-87 to 24 percent in
1995-96, while the proportion derived from student fees increased from 26
percent to 32 percent. Total educational and general revenues during that
period increased from $729 million to $1.399 billion.
The compound growth rate adjusted for inflation (real growth rate) for
student fees for the 10 year period was 6.2 percent, compared with a 0.3
percent decrease for state appropriations. In 1976, student fees made up 34
percent of the combined revenues from student fees and state appropriations;
in 1996, student fees made up 57 percent of the total, illustrating the
continuing decline in state appropriations.
Regent Newman observed that the point is being made that students are
paying more because the government is paying less, without a discussion of
what they are paying for and why expenses are going up.
Overall Auxiliary Activities revenues totaled $1.044 billion in 1995-96,
compared to $519.1 million in 1986-87, for a 4.2 percent adjusted compound
growth rate. The Hospital, medical, and dental portions of those revenues
increased from $436 million in 1986-87 to $901 million in 1995-96 for an
adjusted compound growth rate of 4.5 percent, although those revenues
showed a 1.1 percent decrease from 1994-95.
Expenditures and transfers for the Educational and General portion of
the Current Funds totaled $718 million in 1986-87 and $1.383 billion in
1995-96, for a compound growth rate of 7.6 percent. Salaries and wages
decreased from 49 percent of this category in 1986-87 to 45 percent in
1994-95, while staff benefits increased from 12 percent to 13 percent and
scholarships and fellowships increased from 7 percent to 10 percent. Total
compensation (salaries and wages plus staff benefits) experienced an adjusted
10-year compound growth rate of 3.2 percent, increasing from $435 million to
$800 million. In 1987, staff benefits comprised about 19.1 percent of total
compensation, while in 1995-96, this proportion had increased to 22.6
percent. During this period, scholarships and fellowships grew by 8.6 percent,
from $52,998 million to $134,934 million. Equipment and plant expenditures
have decreased from 10 percent to 8 percent of the total, while supplies
expenditures have remained relatively constant, currently at 24 percent of
the total.
Total Auxiliary Activities expenditures grew from $428 million to $1.061
billion. The 1995-96 figure represents a 5.5 percent decrease from 1994-95,
most of which can be attributed to the hospital and medical area. This decrease
can be largely attributed to transfers from the Hospitals to the category of funds
functioning as endowment.
The investment in plant grew from $1.608 billion in 1986-87 to $3.384
billion in 1995-96. The endowment and other invested funds have grown
from $295 million to $1.7 billion over the same period, which is a compound
growth rate of 21.2 percent.
Total expenditures and transfers were $1.145 billion in 1986-87, compared
with $2.444 billion in 1995-96, for a total compound growth rate of 8.8 percent.


43




September Meeting, 1996


Following the conclusion of the budget report, Regent Newman moved
adoption of the annual financial statements for 1995-96. Regent Varner
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. Regent Baker observed
that the University's expenditures are of great benefit to the citizens of Ann
Arbor and Washtenaw County.
Statement Regarding the Medical Center
Interim President Neal made the following comments about the Medical
Center:
We have been working vigorously over the past several months with
the Regents and the executive officers to develop a forward-looking
governance and administrative structure for the University of
Michigan Medical Center. In recent weeks, the Regents and executive
officers have visited four representative academic health centers:
Oregon, Indianapolis, Emory, and the University of Florida. These
trips, together with advice from people within the University and from
the Regents' special counsel, have been most helpful and informative.
It has been agreed that the best solution for the University of
Michigan will be to create an executive vice president for medical
affairs, who would report to the president and to whom both the dean
of the Medical School and the executive director of the University
Hospital/Health System would report.
We expect to have more details about this to report at the October
Regents' Meeting, but the Regents felt that they were sufficiently far
along in their thinking to announce this particular decision.
Department of Athletics Budget for 1996-97
Interim President Neal called on Dr. M. Joseph Roberson, director of
athletics, to present the Department of Athletics budget for 1996-97, as had
been requested by the Regents at the July 1996 meeting. Dr. Roberson
distributed a separately-bound booklet containing reproductions of the slides
used in his presentation.
He reported that the department is in the process of developing a
five-year strategic plan that will be presented to the Regents when it is in
final form. He noted that there are currently 11 men's sports and 12 women's
sports, and the department expects to have achieved perfect gender equity
this year.
The official 1995 NCAA graduation rate of 71 percent compares very
favorably with other universities. He noted that the department's budget
equals about $32 million, and that it is currently undergoing the process of
NCAA certification. He pointed out that the program achieved a national
championship in hockey in 1996 and in men's swimming in 1995; and in
1995-96 had 5 conference championships. The department has had notably
competitive and successful teams in recent years in women's gymnastics,
swimming, softball, and other women's sports.


44




September Meeting, 1996


Dr. Roberson displayed a pie chart illustrating the sources of the
department's current funds revenues of $31.9 million. Football admissions
account for 39 percent, licensing royalties 14 percent, TV/radio revenue 10
percent, post-season revenues 8 percent, other sports admissions 7 percent, and
the remainder is derived from annual giving, facilities revenue, concessions,
and other income. The athletics department as a percentage of the University
budget has remained consistently at about 2 percent for the past several
years.
As for expenditures, in 1994-95 $6.5 million was spent on grant-in-aid
and $9.17 million for total intra-University transactions. He noted that this
type of expenditure for the University of Michigan's athletic department is
substantially higher than at any other Big Ten institution because many of
these institutions receive direct subsidies, either from the state or from the
university, often in the form of tuition waivers for the difference between
resident and nonresident tuition. The University of Michigan athletic
department receives no subsidies either from the University or the state.
Dr. Roberson explained how the process of revenue sharing works in the
Big Ten, and displayed a chart illustrating the amount of revenue each
institution gains or looses in gate receipt revenue each year. The University
of Michigan will experience a net loss due to revenue sharing for the of
$848,702 in 1995-96, compared with a net gain for Northwestern University
of $926,926. He also noted that television and post-season revenues in the
Big Ten conference are also pooled and are independent of how many times a
particular team appears on television, so that the University of Michigan's
share is the same as that for any other Big Ten school.
Dr. Roberson pointed out that the University generates more royalty
income than any other institution, but that because royalty revenues
fluctuate from year to year, the department cannot rely on it as a steady
source of income. Since 1992, royalty revenue has fluctuated from about 10
percent to almost 20 percent of the department's total operating funds.
Football season ticket revenues currently make up about 40 percent of
total operating funds revenues. Dr. Roberson noted that there is a growing
trend for institutions to tie the availability and location of season football
tickets to donations, although the University of Michigan has no plans to do
that.
In the area of expenditures, 33 percent goes toward salaries and fringe
benefits, 21 percent for grant-in-aid costs, 19 percent for sports programs, 10
percent each for administrative expenses and facilities expenses, 4 percent
for capital expenditures, and 3 percent for debt service.
Development fundraising efforts resulted in total gifts ranging from
$3,862,000 in 1991-92 to $5 million in 1995-96 and have been targeted for such
facilities as the golf course, Yost Field House renovations, and construction
of the new tennis facility. He noted that future facility needs include
renovations to the Michigan Stadium, Crisler Arena, Canham Natatorium,
and Yost Ice Arena, as well as a softball locker room, crew facilities, and a


45




September Meeting, 1996


new competition/practice facility. The department is also continuing with its
certification efforts and continuing to receive feedback on its strategic plan.
Regent McFee noted that several members of the Michigan men's swim
team had participated in the 1996 Summer Olympics. Regent Power observed
that in light of the pressures brought on by the notion of sports as entertainment, the University of Michigan not only has a tradition of competitive
success, but it is noted for following the rules. He thanked Dr. Roberson for
the presentation, noting that it had been very helpful.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted the minutes of the meeting of
July 18-19, 1996.
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted the following
reports: Investments, Plant Extension, Litigation, and Personnel-Labor
Relations. Vice President Neidhardt submitted Projects Established and
Current Research and Sponsored Projects. He noted that it would be helpful
to receive input from the Regents as to what type of information they would
like to receive regarding the University's research activities. He also distributed
a poster describing an upcoming research responsibility program sponsored
jointly by his office and the graduate school.
The Regents received the Faculty Governance Update.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear submitted reports of gifts
received for June, July, and August, 1996, and the summary for the fiscal
year 1995-96, and reviewed the current status of the capital campaign.

distinction of having taught all the required undergraduate chemical
engineering courses, as well as new graduate courses. Professor Donahue
contributed unselfishly in counseling undergraduate students. His service to
the department includes a term as associate chair. He has also regularly
presented courses for life-long learning and continuing education students.
His research has focused on two different, but related, areas. One
involves the use of electrochemical processes to study rates and mechanisms
of molecular transport-a large advance over regular electro-deposition
studies. The other area involves research into the efficient conversion of
chemical to electrical energy, such as in fuel cell and battery development,
and in the storage of electrical energy. He is a thorough researcher who
contributed significantly to the field of electrochemical reaction dynamics and
the specific areas of corrosion and electroless plating. His work demonstrates
perception; his publications are thoughtful, concise, and original.  More
recently, he collaborated with colleagues in the Departments of Physics and
Chemistry on studies involving the recent controversy surrounding cold
fusion.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming Francis M. Donahue professor emeritus of chemical engineering.

as an expert in this area and has continually received extramural funding
throughout her career to pursue her research endeavors. In recognition of
her outstanding work, in 1986 Professor Payne received the University's
Academic Women's Caucus Award for leadership, scholarship, and impact on
the betterment of women. She has been active in the Society for the Study of
Reproduction, having held a number of offices, including president from
1990-91. Professor Payne has also served on a multitude of University and
Medical School committees, and played a major role in the establishment of
the Reproductive Sciences Program.   In her honor, the Anita Payne
Lectureship in Reproductive Science was established in 1993 in the
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scientist for her dedicated
service by naming Anita H. Payne professor emerita of biological chemistry
and professor emerita of biological chemistry in the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynecology.
Wesley D. Rae, professor of English at the University of Michigan-Flint,
retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1996, after a distinguished
career as a teacher, scholar, and department and campus leader.
Professor Rae received his B.S. degree from North Dakota State
University in 1954 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of
Wisconsin in 1957 and 1961, respectively. After serving on the faculty of
Syracuse University from 1961-69, he joined the faculty of the UM-Flint as
associate professor of English in 1969. He was promoted to professor in 1972.
Professor Rae's administrative appointments include service as acting
dean and then dean of academic affairs (1974-75), dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences (1975-79), acting dean of the School of Management (1975-76),


88




September Meeting, 1996


and three terms as chair of the Department of English. He also served on the
CAS executive committee, on most standing committees of the college, and on
numerous search committees.
Professor Rae's area of specialization is the Renaissance in England, with
a secondary interest in Greek and Roman literature. For the past 27 years,
he has been an inspiration to students, who have flocked to his courses in
Shakespeare and in the classics. Students have recognized him twice with the
Distinguished Professor Award (1976 and 1986), and he received the Faculty
Award for Teaching Excellence in 1992. His interest in the Renaissance
resulted in a book-length study of Thomas Lodge. His experience in teaching
Shakespeare's history plays led to the development of a database containing
every character in the history plays, complete with their genealogy. This is a
massive undertaking which he will continue to pursue during retirement.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his
dedicated service and many accomplishments by naming Wesley D. Rae
professor emeritus of English.
Frank C. Richardson, professor of French, German and comparative
literature and acting chair, Department of Foreign Languages, College of Arts
and Sciences, University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status
on June 30, 1996, following a distinguished, 40-year career spanning the
entire history of the Flint campus.
Born in Virginia, Professor Richardson received his A.B. degree in 1950,
his M.A. degree in 1953, and his Ph.D. degree in 1960, all from the University
of Michigan. A true Renaissance scholar, he studied in Grenoble, France, in
1951-52 and Tubingen, Germany, in 1954-55. He joined the faculty of the
UM-Flint, when it opened in 1956, as an instructor in French and German.
He was promoted to assistant professor in 1960, associate professor in 1964,
and professor in 1969. He also served as chair of the Department of Foreign
Languages for 15 years.
Some of Professor Richardson's outstanding achievements over the past
40 years include a French government assistantship in Albertville, France
(1950-51); Fulbright Awards at the University of Grenoble in France
(1950-51) and the University of Tubingen in Germany (1954-55); and the
UM-Flint's Excellence in Teaching Award (1984). He served on the C.A.S.
Executive Committee for twelve years, the Curriculum Committee for 15
years, and taught general literature for ten years to nontraditional students.
He founded UM-Flint Honors Program and served as its chair for twelve
years, and also founded the Comparative Literature Program. He was a
member of the advisory committee for three chancellors, a Big Brothers
sponsor, chair of the county branch of the A.C.L.U. for five years, and
currently serves as treasurer of the A.A.U.P. He also served three times as
chair of the governing faculty assembly, chaired implementation of the
current general education requirements, and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his
dedicated service and many accomplishments by naming Frank C. Richardson
professor emeritus of French, German, and Comparative Literature.
W. Allen Spivey, professor of statistics and Clare E. Griffin Professor of
Business Administration, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1996.


89




September Meeting, 1996


Professor Spivey received his A.B. degree in 1950, his M.A. degree in
1952, and his Ph.D. degree in 1956, all from the University of North Carolina.
He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina and at
Stanford University prior to joining the University of Michigan faculty as an
assistant professor in 1957. He was promoted to associate professor in 1959
and professor in 1962 and was named to the Griffin professorship in 1978.
Professor Spivey also served as associate vice president for academic affairs
from 1981-83. He has held visiting appointments at the London School of
Economics, Harvard University, and Kyoto University.
A recipient of the University's Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award
(1971), Professor Spivey's long and distinguished career also includes being
named a fellow of the American Statistical Association, as well as membership
on the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council, chair of the
American Statistical Association's Business and Economics Statistics Section,
board membership with the International Institute of Forecasters, and
publication of numerous refereed articles and eight books.
Professor Spivey has contributed cogently to the forecasting literature
with applied and theoretical work and he has mentored many students in the
area of business forecasting and time series analysis. His interest in global
strategic management concepts and his professional contacts in Europe and
Asia have made him an invaluable asset to the school's growing presence and
interest in international business education. He was instrumental in the
development and implementation of our program in the Leonardo da Vinci
University in Paris, where he continues to play an active role. His retirement
merely signals a new phase in his relationship to the school, in which it
expects to continue to benefit from his breadth of experience and expertise.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming W. Allen Spivey
professor emeritus of statistics and the Clare E. Griffin Professor Emeritus
of Business Administration.
Edward G. Voss, professor of botany and curator of vascular plants,
retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1996.
Professor Voss received his B.A. degree from Denison University in 1950
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1951 and
1954, respectively. He joined the University in 1956 as a research associate at
the Herbarium and was appointed assistant professor of botany in 1960. He
was promoted to associate professor in 1963, professor in 1969, and has served
as curator of vascular plants since 1961.
Professor Voss' principal research project has been the preparation of his!
three-volume series, Michigan Flora, which is the first comprehensive guide
to the native and naturalized seed-plants of Michigan. To produce these books,
Professor Voss has spent over 40 years collecting extensively throughout the
state and examining essentially all of the herbarium specimens collected by his
predecessors. Interpretation of those early collections required a review of the
history of botanical exploration in the region, and the resulting publications
thus represent a significant contribution to the Michigan historical literature.
As a result of his efforts, Michigan now has the best regional flora books in
the country, as recognized by his receipt of the Henry Allan Gleason Award
from the New York Botanical Garden in 1986. The third and final volume of
the Flora series will be published late in 1996.


90




September Meeting, 1996


In his role as the leading authority on a large flora in an era of growing
awareness of and interest in threatened biological diversity, Professor Voss
has long been active in and in demand as a speaker for numerous organizations
concerned with conservation and natural history.  His enthusiasm  and
communication skills have also brought him great success as a teacher. He has
introduced generations of biologists to field botany at the UM Biological
Station at Douglas Lake, where they absorbed his encyclopedic knowledge
even as they sank into the bogs, swatted the mosquitoes, and groaned at his
puns.
Beyond Michigan, Professor Voss is known throughout the world for his
expertise in plant nomenclature, the esoteric body of rules and traditions that
govern the naming of plants. Mention his name in Paris, Berlin, or Sydney
and the smiles of recognition will be accompanied by anecdotes about his able
leadership through the thickets of thorny nomenclatural problems.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Edward G. Voss
professor emeritus of botany and curator emeritus of vascular plants.
Degrees. The president submitted recommendations for recipients of
honorary degrees.
Vice President Kinnear announced that Preston R. Tisch had made a
commitment of $7.2 million for support of the humanities wing of Angell
Hall and the Tennis Center.
Consent agenda approved. On a motion by Regent Power, seconded
by Regent McFee, the Regents unanimously approved the consent agenda.
Regent Deitch was away from the table when the vote was taken.
Investments at June 30, 1996
Executive Vice President Womack called on Associate Vice President
and Treasurer Norman Herbert to present the report on the University's
invested funds as of June 30, 1996. He expounded on the descriptions and
returns of the portfolios described in the Regents Communication; these
include the University Endowment Fund, the Business School Growth Fund,
the Donor Pooled Income Fund, the Charitable Remainder Trusts, the
University Investment Pool, the Veritas Insurance Corporation, the Long
Term Portfolio, and Funds in Trust.
Associate Vice President Herbert compared the Long Term Portfolio and
the Donor Pooled Income Fund, noting that the former had returned 17.8
percent and the latter had provided a return of 12.8 percent, and that both
had met the goal of adding real value over inflation and distribution. He
described the different investment objectives and strategies of each fund,
noting that while the Long Term Portfolio has a more aggressive and
diversified investment strategy, there have been periods when the Donor
Pooled Income Fund has yielded higher returns. Nevertheless, he reported
that the Long Term Portfolio is better positioned to weather future markets,
and it is expected that it will provide superior long-term performance.
Associate Vice President Herbert observed that "Farris Womack
deserves much of the credit for the confidence with which we face the
future." He thanked Executive Vice President Womack for the "superb
91




September Meeting, 1996


leadership" he has provided for the University's investment program. "On
his watch," he noted, "the investment program has tripled in size from $1
billion to just under $3 billion; the endowment has increased fivefold from
$300 million to $1.6 billion,..., and we have reduced endowment
distributions to a more prudent, sustainable level from 5.5 percent to 5.1
percent, and we're confident that we will achieve the goal of a 5.0 percent
distribution well ahead of schedule." Mr. Herbert concluded that "the
investment program meets the needs of the educational units while
appropriately  maximizing  the  investment  opportunities  from  a
university-wide perspective."
Regent McFee observed that she had found attending the meetings of
the Investment Advisory Committee to be a most enjoyable and educational
experience, and that the establishment of this committee and results of its
work is another tribute to Dr. Womack's leadership.
1996-97 Budgets
The Regents received the Budget Book for fiscal year 1996-97. This is a
formal compilation of the budget approved in July 1996.
Small-Capitalization Common Stock Manager
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved the appointment of Skyline Asset Management as an
investment manager. Regents Newman and Deitch were not present when the
vote was taken.
Alternative Asset Investments
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent McFee, the
Regents unanimously approved commitment of $10.0 million of the Long
Term Portfolio to Natural Gas Partners IV, L.P., pending favorable review of
the documents for their legal acceptability by the Office of the General
Counsel. Regents Newman and Deitch were not present when the vote was
taken.
Ann Arbor Township Utility Dedication and Easement
Regent Horning moved authorization for the executive vice president
and chief financial officer to dedicate the utilities for the Primary Care
Facility to Ann Arbor Township and to grant an easement to the township
for maintenance of the system, as described in the Regents Communication.
Regent Varner seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regents Newman and Deitch were not present when the vote was taken.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects: 1) renovations to
the tunnel between the Central Power Plant and the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies, as described in the Regents Communication; 2)
replacement of expansion joints and domestic hot water piping in the tunnel
serving the Michigan Union building and the West Quadrangle building; 3)


92




September Meeting, 1996


remodeling of space in the North University Building to create anthropology
laboratories; 4) remodeling of space in the Space Research Building to
establish a global change laboratory; and 5) exterior restoration of the
president's residence. Regents Deitch, Newman, and Varner were not present
when the vote was taken.
Michigan Health Corporation Business Plan
Executive Vice President Womack noted that the formation of a
business plan for Michigan Health Corporation (MHC) had been promised
when the establishment of the corporation had initially been approved by the
Regents in December 1994. This is a request to approve the concept, plan,
and process for MHC to receive initial capitalization to implement the
business plan as outlined in the Regents Communication, and to amend the
MHC bylaws to add the University of Michigan provost as a director on the
MHC board. Executive Vice President Womack also suggested that the
bylaws might have to be amended again in the future to provide for the
executive vice president for medical affairs to also sit on the board.
Regent McGowan requested that separate financial statements for MHC
be presented annually to the Board of Regents to enable them to provide
proper oversight. Executive Vice President Womack responded that the
intent is to provide financial statements in a fashion similar to those
provided for M-Care and Veritas.
In response to a question from Regent Deitch about the current status
of relationships between the Medical System and other recently formed
alliances, Executive Vice President Womack stated he would communicate
directly with the Regents in the form of a letter. Executive Vice President
Womack also noted that it had not been determined how the capitalization
would be treated. It may be treated either as an equity or as a loan to MHC;
his current thinking is that it would be a loan.
Following some discussion, Regent Baker moved approval of the
concept, plan, and process for MHC to receive initial capitalization to
implement the business plan and to have authority to take all actions
necessary and appropriate to establish and operate the proposed and future
projects, and to approve amendment of the bylaws of MHC to add the
University of Michigan provost as a director on the board of MHC. Regent
McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. The text of
the business plan can be found with the Regents Communication.
Regent Newman was not present when the vote was taken and
remained absent for the remainder of the meeting.
Regents' Meeting Schedule for 1997
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the following revised schedule of meetings for 1997:

SPECIAL MEETING, OCTOBER 1996


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
October 1, 1996
The Regents met at 7:25 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner.
Also present were Vice President Harrison, Provost Machen, Secretary
Palmer, General Counsel Cole, and Attorneys Ellsworth and Cohan. Regent
McFee, Interim President Neal, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice
Presidents Hartford, Kinnear, and Neidhardt, and Chancellors Nelms and
Renick were absent.
Regent Baker called the meeting to order and read the following
statement on behalf of the Board:
Former President James Duderstadt's execution of employment
agreements with some University executive officers without full
disclosure to the Board of Regents has attracted considerable public
interest and has raised significant issues of policy and process. At our
regular meeting on September 20, 1997, we expressed our concern
about these agreements.
Some months ago, the Regents engaged the law firms of
Dickinson, Wright and Barris, Sott, Denn & Driker to act as independent counsel to the Board on a variety of matters. The Regents
have forwarded these seven employment agreements to our independent counsel for review of their circumstances.
The Regents are also considering the policy framework within
which a modern compensation structure can be crafted, in public.
Once this has been done, the Regents look forward to working with
Interim President Neal, University human resources staff, and if
necessary, independent compensation consultants. The objective is to
continue to enable the University to attract, motivate, and retain the
best possible people to senior management positions, but at the same
time to set in place a reasonable compensation program which is
rigorous and formal and is not subject to unilateral interpretation
and execution.
The duty of the Board of Regents is to prudently and fully
examine the facts of these matters and then to take actions appropriate
to those facts. The Regents take their responsibilities very seriously.
We intend to move forward promptly to resolve these issues and to
report timely to the University community and the people of Michigan.
Regent Varner noted that the presidential search process adopted by the
Board states that "neither the PSC nor its individual members will communicate
on this subject with the PSAC or its individual members or the search
consultant (unless such communications are made public) except to offer
nominations until the PSAC submits its report to the PSC."
95




Special Meeting, October 1, 1996


In keeping with these rules, she announced for the record that she had
spoken with the search consultant following the last Regents' Meeting to see
whether he felt he could be helpful to the Board in structuring the next phase
of the search process. The consultant responded that the primary consideration
was for the Board to devise a process that works best for it, and therefore he
did not believe his input would be necessary.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Baker then called on Regent Horning, who made the following
motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended
by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed
session on October 1, 1996, for the purpose of considering material
exempt from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of
Information Act. Such exempt material consists of a written opinion
from the Board's legal counsel.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then continued in executive session.
Roberta R. Palmer
Secretary of the University

SPECIAL MEETING, NOVEMBER 1996


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
November 12, 1996
The Regents met at 2:10 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were Interim
President Neal and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Varner.
Comments by Interim President Neal
Interim President Neal called the meeting to order. Speaking for himself
as well as the University community, he thanked Jeffrey Lehman and the
Presidential Search Advisory Committee for their efforts on behalf of the
institution. He also congratulated the Board of Regents and co-chairs McFee
and Varner for their attempts to involve all of the stakeholders of the
University in the presidential search process, and for the confidence they had
placed in faculty, staff, students, and alumni. He noted that all had observed
and had been touched by how much the Regents care for the University,
especially at the meeting during which the Presidential Search Committee had
received the report of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee. Finally, he
congratulated the Regents "for having the courage to unite and do what is best
for the University."
He then called on Regent Varner to present the report of the Presidential
Search Committee.
Report of the Presidential Search Committee
Regent Varner stated, "On behalf of the Presidential Search Committee, I
submit to the Board of Regents the nomination of Lee C. Bollinger as the
twelfth president of the University of Michigan in accordance with the terms
and conditions that have been agreed upon and which will be attached to the
minutes of this meeting." (See Appendix A, page 105)
Regent McFee seconded the motion. The vote was then taken and the
motion was approved unanimously. There followed a standing ovation and a
round of applause, after which President-Elect Bollinger and his wife, Jean
Bollinger, were invited to the table.
Regent Baker commented that he wished him well and was sorry he would
not have the opportunity to serve with him. He observed that in his 24 years
on the Board, "Robben Fleming had left a great platform for Harold Shapiro,
and Harold Shapiro left a great platform for Jim Duderstadt, and all of those
have combined to leave a great platform for you to begin and expand and be the
president of this great and wonderful institution."
Regent McFee noted that she was "extremely pleased that you are going to
be with us" and that she was looking forward to at least two more years of
working with the Bollingers.


101




Special Meeting, November 12, 1996


Regent McGowan said that she "shares the joy and satisfaction with this
University in seeing you both here, and its wonderful having you both back."
Regent Horning thanked Interim President Neal and his wife Jeannie for
the leadership they've provided. He welcomed the Bollingers, noting that "its a
great day for Michigan" and offering any assistance he could provide.
Regent Newman also thanked the Neals for their continuing service,
commenting that they have been "absolutely terrific in a really tough
situation." She welcomed the Bollingers and noted the great outpouring of
emotion and excitement that had been elicited by the news that they would be
returning to the University. She thanked them for accepting and said that she
looked forward to their imminent return.
Regent Deitch associated himself with the previous remarks, and said,
"Welcome home."
Regent Power had no comment. Regent Varner told Mr. Bollinger that she
was delighted that he would be the University's next president. She noted that
this would be her last "big act" before leaving the Board, and that she "couldn't
think of anything she would rather have it be." She welcomed him back on
behalf of the entire University community, and also thanked Interim President
and Mrs. Neal for their service.
Interim President Neal told the Bollingers that he and his wife were
extremely happy for them. He welcomed them back to Ann Arbor, noting that
they will be taking charge of one of the world's greatest universities that "you
will need the love, care vision, and leadership that I think you can so uniquely
provide." He offered the assistance of all of the executive officers in making the
transition and wished them "all the luck in the world."
President-Elect Bollinger then made the following comments:
I accept this position with the deepest emotions, close to those
connected with family. And, as the years of our collective service to
this great University roll by, this abiding affection we all share
should be our bond and the source of our decisions and of our
treatment of each other. In my meeting with you just over a week
ago, I referred to an idea of Edmund Burke. Now I can quote it
accurately: 'To be attached to the subdivision, to love the little platoon
we belong to in society, is the first principle (the germ as it were) of
public affections. It is the first link in a series by which we proceed
towards a love of our country and to mankind.'
So it is that our 'attachment' to this University is a stem of all
meaningful branching relationships.  And in this increasingly
cosmopolitan world, in which loyalty to discipline rather than to
place is always in the ascendancy, Burke's idea of the spiraling
importance of affections, beginning with our feelings towards our
'platoon,' makes our love for Michigan intelligible and
consequential, a matter of public service.
There are special moments in life when we feel we see more
clearly and more deeply into the truth of things. I feel this is such a
102




Special Meeting, November 12, 1996


moment for me, and I hope it is for the University. If this is such an
occasion, then we ought to make every effort to hold onto this clarity
of understanding, as the daily cares will inevitably threaten to
overwhelm us in the years ahead. To this end we might employ as a
point of reference a little poem, 'Spring Pools,' written by the great
American-and great University of Michigan-poet, Robert Frost; a
poem, by the way, he composed in Ann Arbor.
Just after the last snow has melted, the poem says, small
pools of water form and, in the still leafless forests, they reflect 'the
total sky almost without defect.' Such near-perfect vision, however,
is fleeting, for the trees 'have it in their pent-up buds/To darken
nature and be summer woods-.' The roots will 'blot out and drink
up and sweep away' these momentary pools of sight. 'Let them think
twice,' the poem warns, before they 'bring dark foliage on' to destroy
these 'flowery waters' 'from snow that melted only yesterday.'
I would like to think that today is at least my 'spring pool,'
and with Frost's exquisite sense of poignancy I want to say to the
inevitable burdens and cares of the years ahead, 'Let them think
twice before they use their powers' 'to bring dark foliage on.'
I am grateful to you and the University for giving me this
opportunity to serve the University of Michigan.
I would like, if I might, to introduce my wife, Jean Magnano
Bollinger. Jean is originally from Seattle. She also, happily, attended
the University of Oregon, after which she did graduate work at
Columbia University (receiving a master's degree). When we moved to
Ann Arbor in 1973, Jean took classes in art and in psychology. Her
major achievement in the early 1980s was as one of the four principal
founders of the Ann Arbor Hands-on Museum, where she served as
associate director following its opening.
In the mid-1980s, Jean decided to become a full-time
practicing artist, which she has pursued ever since (including a period
of time as a special student in the art school at the University). Before
leaving Ann Arbor in 1994, she had a studio in Dexter, and now she is
located in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Her awards and shows are 'too
numerous to mention,' if I may say so.
There followed a round of applause, after which the meeting was
adjourned at 2:30 p.m. Following the meeting there was a press conference and
public reception at the Michigan Union.

APPENDIX A
November 12, 1996
Lee C. Bollinger
614 Bragg Hill
Norwich, VT 05055
Dear Lee:
This letter is to confirm the terms and conditions of your appointment as president of
the University of Michigan.
*    You will take office at the first year salary of $275,000.00. Subject to
satisfactory performance, your initial appointment shall be for a term of five

performance will be made prior to a renewal determination after five years.
You will perform all duties and services and receive all benefits traditionally
associated with the presidency of the University of Michigan.
*    In addition to direct compensation, you will be eligible for the Academic
Administrative Benefits package which is the same package which you
participated in while dean of the Law School.
*    It is anticipated that you and your family will live in the presidential
residence on South University Avenue. The University will continue to
undertake all repairs and renovations and to retain such housekeeping staff
as is necessary and reasonable to maintain the house and carry out official
University functions.
*    You will receive an automobile provided in accordance with University
guidelines for your business and personal use. A driver will be available
through Transportation Services with service billed on an hourly basis to
the President's Office.
*    At any time during the term of your presidency or, if you return to the
faculty in Ann Arbor, within three months of the end of your term, the
University will pay for allowable moving expenses related to your relocation
to Ann Arbor up to a maximum of one month of your beginning base salary.
In addition, the University will provide a one-time payment to cover
transition expenses in the amount of $30,000.
*    It is expected that you will utilize the University mortgage program at the
same rates available to other University employees to cover the mortgage of
your current home in Norwich, Vermont. It is understood that should you
leave the University, the balance of the mortgage will be due within 180
days.
*    Although Jean, as the spouse of the president, will not receive direct
compensation, in recognition of her contribution to the University, when
she travels on behalf of the University, her travel expenses will be fully
reimbursed.
*    Acceptance of external assignments involving service on corporate boards
shall be accepted only after discussion with and approval by the Board of
Regents. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.


105




Special Meeting, November 1996 - Appendix A


*    As president of the university, you will have two funds available for your
use, The Presidential Initiatives Fund, which is subject to certain guidelines,
and The Presidential Discretionary Fund. Although these funds are part of
the Presidential Office budget and are subject to normal annual review and
annual audit reports which are provided to the Regents, they are earmarked
to carry out the objectives of the President.
*    Upon acceptance of the presidency, your tenure in the Law School and the
associated rights and privileges will be restored. Should you step down from
the presidency at any time after five years of service, you will be eligible for
a one-year leave paid at the presidential salary at that time. Thereafter, you
may return to the Law School as a faculty member receiving compensation

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1996


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, November 14, 1996
The Regents met at 1:15 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were Interim
President Neal and Regents Baker, Homing, McFee, McGowan, Newman,
Power, and Varner. Also present were Executive Vice President Womack,
Provost Machen, Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neidhardt,
Chancellor Renick, and Secretary Palmer. Provost Robert Desmond attended in
the stead of Chancellor Nelms, who was absent. Regent Deitch was also absent.
Interim President Neal called the meeting to order and acknowledged
the presence of Regent Elect Olivia P. Maynard, whose tenure will begin on
January 1, 1997. Ms. Maynard received a round of applause.
Ernst & Young LLP Management Report With University Responses
Interim President Neal called on Executive Vice President Womack, who
introduced Mr. Bob Emde, the engagement partner for Ernst & Young, along
with Harold Miller of Ernst & Young and George Johnson, managing partner
of George Johnson and Company. Mr. Emde also recognized the efforts of
University Auditor Carl Smith, who has worked closely with Ernst & Young
in performing the audits.
Mr. Emde noted that the management report expresses an unqualified
opinion, and that there were no unadjusted audit differences that would have
had a material effect on the financial statements of the several funds that
comprise the University's financial statements. Mr. Emde noted that Ernst &
Young LLP had also audited and issued unqualified reports on the separate
financial statements for the Clinical Delivery System, Dental Faculty Associates,
the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, the Executive Education Center
of the School of Business Administration, M-Care, and Veritas, as well as three
units not included in the University's combined financial statements: the Alumni
Association, the William Davidson Institute, and the University Musical Society.
Mr. Emde noted that the 1996 Management Letter concludes that the
review of the internal control structure in use at the University of Michigan
disclosed no material weaknesses in procedures and control. In fact, he
observed that Ernst & Young believes that procedures and controls "are pretty
good," and the recommendations set forth in that letter are intended as
constructive suggestions to further strengthen the University's procedures and
controls. He noted that in each instance, the University has concurred with the
recommendations, and that the auditors believe the responses are appropriate.
He pointed out that Ernst & Young also reviews the regular six month report of
internal audits, and that they are comfortable that appropriate follow-up action
has and continues to be taken on important control and procedural matters.
Regent Power noted that the major issue in the management letter had to
do with nonmonetary matters and asked for more information about these


107




November Meeting, 1996


transactions. Mr. Emde responded that the single largest such transaction
that came to the attention of the auditors had to do with the Department of
Intercollegiate Athletics' contract with Nike. The nonmonetary aspects of that
contract have been appropriately reported and accounted for in the financial
statements.
Regent Power told the auditor that he and his colleagues should not
hesitate to contact any of the Regents at any time if they deem it necessary.
Mr. Emde responded that to date there has been no situation that has required
such contact.
1998 State Budget Request-Ann Arbor Campus
Provost Machen reported that the 1996-97 budget request was actually
submitted last year as part of a proposed biannual process. The current request
is in response to a request to provide a supplement to that submission.
The document requests an increase at a rate at least equal to the rate of
inflation; it describes the University's ongoing cost-containment efforts; and
it requests two supplemental appropriations: $3 million to strengthen the
undergraduate educational programs by providing faculty-directed research
projects for undergraduate students and $1.5 million for improving undergraduate science and technology education.
Regent Newman commented about the format of the request, noting that
it might be helpful if it were more specific in terms of dollar amounts
requested. Provost Machen and Vice President Harrison responded that the
directions given for submission of the request were very general, and that
dollar amounts are provided in other documents submitted to the legislature.
1998 State Budget Request-Dearborn Campus
Chancellor Renick reviewed the Dearborn Campus' budget request,
noting that it reflects three priorities: 1) maintenance of quality educational
programming; 2) enhancement of technology-based programs; and 3) increase
in faculty to support growth. The total incremental amount requested is
$3,015,000.
1998 State Budget Request-Flint Campus
Provost Desmond noted that the Flint Campus is requesting an increase
at the rate of inflation to maintain current operations ($570,000), as well as
three other priorities: 1) improvements in information technology capabilities
($860,000); 2) managing and improving enrollments ($275,000); and 3) the
development of new graduate programs that are responsive to community
needs ($480,000).
Report of the Child Care Task Force
Provost Machen observed that as a result of a June 1996 student
referendum supporting an increase in student fees for the purpose of child
care for students, the Board had requested the formation of a task force to
study the child care needs of faculty, students, and staff. The complexity of
the issue precluded the development of a comprehensive plan in time for this


108




November Meeting, 1996


meeting, so the interim report addresses only student issues. He then called
on Dean Ada Sue Hinshaw, chair of the task force.
Dean Hinshaw noted that the charge to the committee had been to develop
a University-wide approach to child care for faculty, staff, and students and to
recommend a priority for this approach in terms of resource allocations. The
interim report addresses the charge focusing on child care for student parents:
1) to review the proposed student child care fee suggested by the Michigan
Student Assembly and to recommend a plan to both utilize and leverage the
funds generated by that fee; and 2) to assess the needs of student parents for
accessible and affordable child care. Dean Hinshaw emphasized the priority the
task force had placed on being responsive to the leadership taken and concerns
evidenced by students in their March 1996 vote to assess a child care fee.
Dean Hinshaw noted that the task force focused specifically on student
scholarship or assistance programs at other major, public universities. The
two programs studied most closely were those in place at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Iowa, and after comparing all of
the variables, task force members came to the conclusion that the program at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison matches most closely the needs and
situation at the University of Michigan.
The recommendation being proposed by the task force, patterned after
the scholarship program in place at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is a
one-one match of the funding that students have voted to assess themselves,
with the match being drawn from the University's General Fund. Based on
an enrollment of at least 36,500 students, the proposed fee of $1.00 per student
per term, combined with an equal match from the General Fund, would yield
about $145,000-$150,000 per year for child care assistance for student parents.
The program would be administered by the Office of Financial Aid and
the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, and distribution of the
scholarships would be need-based. Payments would be made directly to the
child care provider, which would be required to be state-licensed or registered.
An advisory committee would be appointed to oversee the program. It is
anticipated that 140-150 scholarships of $900-$1200 each could be awarded
per year. Dean Hinshaw emphasized that the magnitude of the need at the
University of Michigan, both in terms of the number of student parents who
need assistance or the type of care needed, is unknown. Therefore, it is
important to remain flexible in setting the exact scholarship amounts.
Dean Hinshaw commented that the Office of Financial Aid is prepared
to implement this program for student parents during the winter term, 1997.
The Task Force would continue to study the issue with the ultimate goal of
recommending a University-wide approach to child care that would address
child care needs for faculty, staff, and students.
Vice President Hartford observed that there is a real need among students
for child care, and that it addresses the issue of access to the University. She
noted that the issue had received wide discussion in MSA, had been approved
by students in a campus-wide plebiscite, and is wholeheartedly endorsed by the
Office of Student Affairs.


109




November Meeting, 1996


Vice President Hartford called on Ms. Fiona Rose, president of Michigan
Student Assembly. Ms. Rose observed that she had spent the past several
months further studying the issues facing student parents at the University and
is convinced that adopting the proposal is the right thing to do. She observed
that the University is strengthened by embracing nontraditional students, staff,
and faculty, and she described her own background as having been born to a
single mother who was a sophomore in college at the time, and she had been the
beneficiary of quality child care. She herself is a product of public housing, the
public welfare system, and public schools, which has caused her faith in the
public university system to be "innate and unshakable." She noted that
students view approval of this recommendation as "a step on the journey towards
opening our University family to students, staff, and faculty with children."
Regent Varner indicated that she intended to support the recommendation.
She recalled speakers at public comments sessions having reported that the
cost for child care is higher than the cost for tuition, and said that she
suspects there is a disparate impact on female students. She noted that the
University endeavors to meet the needs of various of its constituents and
that child care assistance is needed very badly and should be seen in that light.
Regent McGowan spoke in support of the proposal, noting that it would
leverage monies obtained through student fees and is the first step in a
University-wide, coordinated plan. She characterized the program as a "simple
and sensible first step" which provides financial assistance that, while guaranteeing quality by requiring licensed care, at the same time gives parents freedom of
choice in finding the best care for their individual situations. Embarking on
this program will expand our knowledge about the scope of the need at the
University, and this knowledge will be critical to resolution of the larger issue.
In response to a question from Regent Homing, Dean Hinshaw stated
that the proposal makes a clear distinction between the amount of assistance
provided for full-time and part-time students. Likewise, it differentiates between
the type of child care needed, such as infant care versus after school care. In an
effort to keep administrative costs to a minimum and to keep it simple for
students, these are the major variables considered in the program.
Regent Horning asked if thought had been given to having this program
not become an increasing burden on the General Fund as the program
expands. Provost Machen responded that this program would only be the
first in what will eventually become a multifaceted proposal involving faculty,
staff, and students. Once the whole program has been established, it will be
important to evaluate it annually as it moves forward. Regent Horning
commented that he expected any further expansion of this program to be
brought back to the Regents for approval.
Regent Newman observed that as the mother of two young children, she
is well aware of the need for quality child care. Although she believes it is
appropriate for the University to be involved in child care assistance, she
does not agree that this particular program, which involves use of the General
Fund and student fees, will solve the problem. Her major concerns are 1) the
use of the General Fund for a program that will affect fewer than one percent
of students; 2) restriction of payments only to licensed providers; 3) the


110




November Meeting, 1996


addition of another administrative burden to the University which could lead
to increased personnel costs; 4) the fact that this proposal "does not begin"
to solve the infant care problem, which probably represents the biggest need.
Regent Newman said she had hoped the task force would have addressed
different alternatives, such as privatization of facilities with University support,
or private companies that might work with the University, or fundraising
alternatives. While she agrees that there is a need, she believes that parents
need a choice which is not being provided by this program. Therefore, she
concluded that she supports the concept but not this program.
Provost Machen observed that access is as important a priority for a public
university as is quality and pointed out that a significant portion of the General
Fund is currently designated for financial aid. He believes that the child care
matching funds is another form of financial aid, which also increases access to a
particular segment of the student body, namely women. Therefore, he believes
that reallocation of a portion of the General Fund for this purpose is
appropriate and consistent with the University's mission. He also observed
that while he is aware of the administrative cost of this program, he believes it
is acceptable and that the scholarship model is the simplest way to administer
it. Administrative costs will be monitored as well as the cost of the scholarships
themselves, so that the total cost to the University can be calculated.
Dean Hinshaw pointed out that nontraditional students bring an
unusual richness to the environment. She said that the requirement for
licensed child care is there to monitor quality, and that registered home care
is another means to monitor quality as well. She also noted that the funds
would be paid retroactively, once a semester.
Regent Newman observed that adoption of this proposal would only be a
starting point in dealing with all of the issues involved in child care for
faculty, students, and staff and would therefore inevitably lead to increased
costs. She expressed regret that private fundraising or other forms of
privatization were not part of the proposal.
Dean Hinshaw responded that privatization issues had received
consideration in the task force's deliberations, and they would continue to be
discussed during deliberations about other child care issues in the future.
The initial proposal was meant to respect the initiative that had been taken
by students in addressing their need for child care.
Regent Baker expressed the view that the small percentage of students
who voted in the election did not represent the views of the entire student
body. However, he did understand from personal experience that child care
is a problem for many parents. He expressed disappointment that the task
force report seemed incomplete and said that it should be possible to produce
an estimate of costs and funding mechanisms spread out over a period of
years.
Provost Machen responded that because the extent of the demand is
currently unknown, it would be difficult to set forth comprehensive cost
estimates.


111




November Meeting, 1996


Regent McGowan noted that the Regents' original instructions to the
provost were to begin a process for construction of a University-wide program,
but specifically to present to the Regents in November a viable plan which
could best be used to leverage the money that would be generated by the
$1.00 per student per term fee that was approved in the March 1996 student
referendum. The task force was not expected to have devised a full-blown
plan to deal with all child care issues.
Regent Baker noted that he had at that time requested an estimate of
costs over time.
Regent Varner pointed out that the proposal under consideration is
merely a modest first step that will not be creating any new facility or office.
It will be utilizing the already existing resources of the Office of Financial
Aid. Regent Varner expressed her view that the proposal represents "a very
positive response to an initiative that was taken by the students," and it
deserves the Regents' support.
Provost Desmond observed that the Flint campus has a dire need for
child care for nontraditional students. He noted that a study quoted in the
Task Force report found that undergraduate students who received financial
aid for child care had significantly higher grade point averages and much
higher retention rates than students who did not receive this aid. Child care
assistance is both a form of tuition discounting as well as a means of retention
of students who otherwise would not be attending college.
Regent McFee pointed out that providing child care assistance as a form
of financial aid allows the University to deal with a real need without creating
a new bureaucracy. She noted that "meaningful and affordable child care,"
particularly for infants and preschool children, has been recognized as one of
the biggest unmet needs at all levels of society and is recognized as a desirable
option for children from loving homes. She pointed out that besides fulfilling a
need for parents, daycare also can be seen as filling a need for children by
providing a stimulating environment for them prior to entering school. She
believes that child care is an issue for employers and businesses as well as
schools, and that as a major employer, it behooves the University of Michigan
to expend time and resources trying to grapple with it. Regent McFee
concluded that she fully supports this effort as a first step toward addressing a
specific need, but she hopes that the University can also use its resources to
contribute to the solution of nationwide problems in the area of child care.
Regent Newman reiterated that she "absolutely supports" the need for
child care. However, she does not believe that the match for the student fees
should come from the General Fund, as proposed by the task force. She
pointed out that costs for attending the University are a problem for many
students, not just parents, and that this cannot be solved by continuing to
raise tuition and asking for more state funds. Rather, ways have to be found
to contain costs. She said she would be willing to support the program if it
contained a private sector component.
Regent Power raised the question of what would happen if next year
students were to vote to withdraw their contribution: Would the University


112




November Meeting, 1996


still be committed to the General Fund match? Ms. Rose and Dean Hinshaw
responded that if that were to happen, the program would have to be
reconsidered.
In response to concerns that enactment of this program would become
only the first step towards increased spending, Regent Power noted that as a
pilot program, it would provide an opportunity to learn the nature of the
demand and the cost of meeting the demand and would serve as a testing
ground for devising creative approaches, as suggested by Regent McFee. He
emphasized that child care assistance is one component of addressing the
question of access to the University.
It was noted that the vote on this question would not take place until
the following day. There followed a short break.
Annual Report of Research Activity, Fiscal Year 1996
Acting Vice President Neidhardt gave a slide presentation in which he
presented an overview of the functions of the Office of the Vice President for
Research (OVPR), reviewed special initiatives being undertaken by the office
during 1996-97, and described the state of research at the University of
Michigan in 1996. He noted that research expenditures for 1996 totaled
$441.3 million, which represents a steady increase over the past ten years.
He displayed charts illustrating the research portfolio by fields of study,
research expenditures by University unit, by sponsor group, and by federal
agency for 1996, as well as the ten-year trend in research expenditures by
federal and nonfederal sources.
Acting Vice President Neidhardt noted that federal spending on nondefense research and development is projected to decrease by 20-30 percent
by 2002. In conclusion, he observed that in 1995-96 federal support of UM
research and scholarly activities continued to increase, industrial and
foundation support showed signs of increase, and support from UM funds
remained constant while continuing to decline as a fraction of total expenditures
for these activities. University of Michigan faculty members continue to be
competitive in securing externally sponsored funds.
Regent McFee pointed out that the research conducted at the University
of Michigan and other research institutions provides far-reaching benefits to
society, and we need to continue to emphasize to the general public that research
is a fundamental part of a university's contribution to society.
Report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs
(SACUA)
Interim President Neal called on Professor Thomas Dunn, chair of the
Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs, to present the committee's
annual report.
Professor Dunn expressed great satisfaction on behalf of the faculty for
the selection of Lee Bollinger as the University's twelfth president. He also
observed that many faculty believe that although the court's interpretation
of the Open Meetings Act created unnecessary restrictions, there are many


113




November Meeting, 1996


reasons to continue most of the public aspects of the open process in the
future, even if the University's court challenge is successful.
Professor Dunn also expressed the faculty's appreciation for the service
of Regents Nellie Varner and Deane Baker for their dedication to the
oversight of the University. He commented that "Both have represented the
voices of their constituencies very well indeed, and this is essential if the
University is to remain strongly connected to the ideas and aspirations of the
citizens of the state, both for themselves and for their children."
Professor Dunn announced that 14 members of the Faculty Senate have
been assembled to form The Faculty Senate Committee on the Future of the
University, whose purpose will be to "confront the challenge of the variety of
ideas, concepts, and initiatives which will be essential to the vitality of the
University of Michigan in the years ahead."
Professor Dunn then described the faculty governance system and
commented on several of the issues that are currently of concern. These
include the future of the University of Michigan Hospitals; the role of the
intercollegiate athletics program; how to attain a greater diversity of faculty
within the legal constraints of the Hopwood and Bakke limitations; grievance
procedures; concerns regarding some aspects of value centered management.
Professor Dunn concluded that problems are best solved when all segments
of the University work together in a spirit of collaboration and noted that
faculty are "anxious and willing to join with the Regents in even greater
collaborative achievements under our twelfth president."
Michigan Virtual Automotive College (MVAC) Update
Interim President Neal called to the table Douglas Van Houweling, vice
provost for academic outreach and information technology and dean for
academic outreach. Vice Provost Van Houweling gave a presentation on
academic outreach, the virtual university movement, and three new University
programs: the University of Michigan Online, UAW/Ford Program, and the
Virtual Automotive College.
Vice Provost Van Houweling reported that academic outreach exists to
expand the University's ability to deliver academic resources to new people
and organizations beyond the campuses, with resources being customized to
industry and personal needs. This is accomplished by exploiting opportunities
provided by advances in digital and information technology. The "Virtual
University" movement is becoming the model for 21st century distance learning;
it complements campus-based programs and institutionalizes lifelong learning.
He described three current academic outreach programs:.University of
Michigan Online, which provides Internet access to University alumni,
parents, retired faculty or staff, and their spouses; the UAW/Ford Program,
which is a nationwide academic program for members of the United Auto
Workers Union employed by Ford Motor Company; and the Michigan Virtual
Auto College (MVAC), which responds to the education and training needs of
the automotive industry. He also introduced Mr. Timothy G. Quinn, director
of MVAC.


114




November Meeting, 1996


Regent Newman complimented Vice Provost Van Houweling and his
colleagues on the work that has been done in the area of academic outreach.
Regent Power observed that he "can't think of anything more significant
that this institution is doing than exploring the potential of distance learning
and digitized information transmittal, which I think is the most significant
technological change in human history since the invention of moveable type."
Consent Agenda

November Meeting, 1996


Professor Churchill received her B.A. and M.S.W. degrees from the
University of Minnesota in 1949 and 1954, respectively, and her Ph.D. degree
from the University of Chicago in 1970. Following completion of her M.S.W.
degree, she worked as a senior psychiatric social group worker in a child
guidance center and as a clinical instructor in child development at the
University of Pittsburgh. She joined the faculty of the School of Social Work
as an assistant professor in 1964. In 1967, she left the University to pursue
her doctoral studies, returning in 1970. She was promoted to associate
professor in 1971 and to professor in 1976.
Professor Churchill has contributed enormously in the area of group
work, specifically with children and adolescents, adoption, and the counseling
of minors. She was a pioneer in the field of child abuse and neglect. She
regularly taught courses on working with children and adolescents and has
published on the rights of female adolescents, children's groups, and the
disruption of adoption placements. She was an active member of the
Interdisciplinary Project on Child Abuse and Neglect. Her commitment to
children has been unfailing, as demonstrated by her academic and research
activities and extensive volunteer work. Professor Churchill has also been
one of the school's most beloved teachers-encouraging, inspiring, and
supporting the students who have known her as a teacher, researcher,
clinician, and humanitarian. Students cite her ability to make concepts come
alive through her clear explanations of theory and through illustrations
drawn from her rich practical experiences. The 1996 graduating class honored
her at its graduation ceremony, noting that "...we are proud to say we were
lucky enough to have attended the University of Michigan School of Social
Work before Sallie Churchill retired."
Professor Churchill is an esteemed faculty member who has had a
significant impact on the lives of many students and who has worked
diligently to improve human service programs. In recognition of her many
contributions, she was presented with the Distinguished Faculty Award by
the School of Social Work Alumni Board of Governors in October 1995.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Sallie R.
Churchill professor emerita of social work.
D. Roger Glass, research scientist, Department of Aerospace Engineering,

dispersion of exhaust stack gases from large buildings. He has conducted
extensive studies of the performance of automotive air bags and cooling
systems and a wide variety of subsonic wind tunnel experiments. He also
made significant contributions to the design of supersonic nozzles for blowing
oxygen into molten iron as part of the steel-making process.
As associate head of the Gas Dynamics Laboratories, Mr. Glass has
played a crucial supporting role in all experimental activities within the
Department of Aerospace Engineering. He has been a leader in ensuring the
operation and improvements of laboratory facilities and has been responsible
for the supervision of the technical staff. A significant portion of his activities
has included teaching, advising, and working with students involved in
experimental research. His kind and expert advice and assistance have helped
to smooth the path for many Ph.D. students. In recognition of his outstanding
service, he received the Departmental Service Award in 1995. Mr. Glass's
retirement following his 50-year commitment to the Department of Aerospace
Engineering leaves a gap that will be difficult to fill.
The Regents now salute this research scientist by naming D. Roger Glass
research scientist emeritus.

November Meeting, 1996


Helen F. Meranda, senior associate librarian at the Taubman Library,
retired on June 30, 1995, after 45 years of service.
Ms. Meranda received her A.B. degree in 1949 and her A.M.L.S. degree in
1951, both from the University of Michigan. She began her career as a
student assistant and was appointed a junior circulation librarian at the
General Library (now the Graduate Library) when she finished her degree;
later that year she became junior medical librarian and in 1953 junior
divisional librarian (medical). Through the years, she has been a circulation
librarian, a serials librarian, and a reference librarian. At retirement, with
the rank of senior associate librarian, she had been for several years the
collection development officer at Taubman and also bore responsibility for the
management of the Rare Book Room and its collections-her first love.
During her career, Ms. Meranda participated in two moves of the library,
from the General Library (now the Graduate Library) to the Kresge Building
and then to the Taubman Medical Library. She was involved in and
contributed to the increasing automation of library procedures, in particular
the introduction of the MEDLARS system in the 1960s, which was the
beginning of the electronic era in health sciences libraries. Ms. Meranda
accepted with grace those changes which increased library "efficiency" at the
expense of personal contact with the users. She worked with a total of seven
library directors, all of whom benefited from her wise counsel.
Ms. Meranda has made a significant contribution to the library. Her
extensive knowledge of the collections and her high standards in selecting
materials for them have made the library one of the country's best. She
mentored and advised both subordinates and supervisors throughout her career.
The Regents now salute this distinguished staff member by naming
Helen F. Meranda senior associate librarian emerita.

147




November Meeting, 1996


Comments from Vice President Harrison
NCAA Certification. Vice President Harrison reported that he had
chaired the NCAA certification committee, which undertook the most
comprehensive review of the intercollegiate athletic program ever undertaken
by the University. The review was done in the form of a self study and a
draft of the final report has been completed. After the report has been
submitted, an external review team will visit the campus and complete a
separate report. He thanked everyone who had participated in the review.
Michigan Radio (WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM). Vice President Harrison
announced the Michigan Radio had just completed the most successful fundraising drive in its history. He called on Mr. Donovan Reynolds, director of
broadcasting, who commented on the success of the fundraiser. Mr. Reynolds
introduced Ms. Shelley MacMillan, the station's promotions director who had
organized the campaign, and Ms. Joan Siefert-Rose, the new program director.
Mr. Reynolds described some of the new initiatives that the stations'
improved financial position will enable it to undertake.
Admissions Programs
Interim President Neal noted that it had been suggested at the July
meeting that the University review its programs designed to broaden access
to its educational opportunities and report back on the status of these
programs at the October meeting. It was also suggested that the review
include consultation with outside counsel. The University has consulted
with Martin Michaelson, a national expert in the area of affirmative action
law, and due to the cancellation of the October meeting, he was reporting
back to the Regents at this time.
Report to the Regents on the Status of Admissions Programs
At the beginning, let me say that the University of Michigan, like
other leading universities, has long valued the maintenance of a
diverse student body, including women, underrepresented minorities,
and students of other diverse backgrounds and life experiences. It is
our abiding conviction that the quality of the educational experience of
all students at the University is enhanced by living and learning in
such a community. In its landmark Bakke decision, the United States
Supreme Court approved promotion of student diversity. As Justice
Powell said in his opinion, it is proper to take race or ethnicity into
account as a "plus" in considering applicants for admission, but racial
or ethnic quotas are not permissible. We are committed to having our
admissions programs conform to these sound principles of educational
policy and law.
To ensure our compliance with current law, we have asked the
University's deans and directors of admissions if, in the admissions
process for their schools or colleges, an applicant's membership in an
underrepresented minority group is considered.  To those who
responded it is, we then asked the following questions:


148




November Meeting, 1996


* In making admissions decisions, does your school or college
compare minority and non minority candidates with each other?
* Does your school or college administer goals for admission of
underrepresented minority students in a flexible manner? That is,
we asked if the goals are used only as desired outcomes for which
to strive and not as quotas.
We asked:
* Are the admissions policies and procedures of your school or
college intended to create a diverse educational environment?
and finally:
* Are all students who are admitted to your school or college
academically qualified for admission?
I am pleased to report to you that the responses to these questions
were "yes. "
Vice Provost Lester Monts has been chairing a committee since
April charged by Provost Machen to review all affirmative action
activities of the University. Through that mechanism and other efforts
we shall continue to review the various outreach, admissions, aid, and
other activities of the University to ensure that we are proceeding
properly, fairly, and effectively to serve our mission in the public
interest and in compliance with the law.
Regent McFee commented that this statement places the issue in
appropriate perspective.
Establishment of Position of Executive Vice President for Medical
Affairs
Regent McFee moved creation of the new position of executive vice
president for medical affairs, as described in the Regents Communication,
and authorization to begin the search to fill this position. Regent Varner
seconded the motion. Regent McFee observed that all of the Regents have
given a great deal of thought to the creation of this position, and she looks
forward to its being filled.
Regent Baker observed that it will be important that the person selected
for the position have a broad understanding of the business side, as well as
the medical side, of the medical affairs enterprise.
Regent McGowan commented that this position is "the best job in academic
medicine in the country, and I fully expect we will have a very competitive,
outstanding 'A' list of candidates." Regent Deitch commented that his vote
would be "an enthusiastic yes."
The vote was then taken and it was approved unanimously.

Regent Newman returned to the table at this point.
Research License from Metabolic Solutions, Inc. (MSI)
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
unanimously approved acceptance of a research license by the University
from Metabolic Solutions, Inc., for use of the Erythromycin Breath Test
(EBT) in sponsored research projects, as described in the license. Because
Paul B. Watkins is both a University of Michigan employee and the owner of
the patented technology described as EBT, this agreement falls under the
state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the Agreement are Metabolic Solutions, Inc., and the

project without first disclosing same to the appropriate University
Conflict of Interest committee for review and approval.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan
and Rebus Planning Associates, Inc.
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
unanimously approved a license agreement with Rebus Planning Associates,
Inc. Because the co-owner of Rebus Planning Associates, Samuel J. Meisels,
is also a University of Michigan employee, this agreement falls under the
state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Rebus
Planning Associates, Inc.
2.  Contract terms include a yearly license fee to the University for

Various Private Dental Practices
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved agreements between the University of
Michigan and four private dental practices for conduct of a clinical study by a
faculty member in the dental school. Because the owners of the private
dental practices from which the study subjects will be drawn are also
University of Michigan faculty members, the agreements fall under the state
of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.  The following information is

Analysis, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved agreements between the University of Michigan and
Automated Analysis, Inc. under which Automated Analysis would fund two
research projects at the University of Michigan.  Because William  J.
Anderson is both an officer of Automated Analysis and a University of
Michigan employee, these agreements fall under the state of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in

University of Michigan Ann Arbor Campus FY98 State Budget
Request
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved the FY1998 state budget request for the Ann
Arbor campus.
University of Michigan-Dearborn 1997-98 State Budget Request
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Varner, the
Regents unanimously approved the University of Michigan-Dearborn
1997-98 state budget request.
University of Michigan-Flint 1997-98 State Budget Request
On a motion boy Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved the University of Michigan-Flint 1997-98
state budget request.
Child Care Task Force Report and Recommendations
Regent McGowan moved approval of a student fee increase of $1.00 per
student per term plus matching funds from the General Fund on a one to one
basis for the purpose of providing child care scholarships for student parents, as
described in the Regents Communication. Regent Varner seconded the motion.
Regent Newman stated that she feels strongly that matching funds
should not come from the General Fund, and believes that she can raise the


155




November Meeting, 1996


matching funds from private sources for this one-year pilot program. She
offered to make a substantial contribution of her own and to take it upon
herself to raise the matching funds by the end of the year.
Regent McGowan noted that this is not to be a one-year pilot program;
rather it is to establish a program for assessing a fee of $1.00 per student per
term with a General Fund match, on an ongoing basis, to continue indefinitely
unless the student vote is rescinded.
Provost Machen agreed with Regent McGowan's interpretation of the
action request.
Regent Newman stated that she would like a guarantee that if the
matching funds are raised privately, matching money would not come out of
the General Fund.
Regent Horning observed that his understanding was that this is to be a
pilot program, and that he had been prepared to support the proposal for one
year based on that understanding. He also emphasized that his support is
for students only, not for faculty and staff. By the end of the one-year pilot
period, he expects the task force to have come forward with a plan as to how
to generate the matching funds outside of the General Fund.
Regent McFee pointed out that no General Fund expenditures are ever
made in perpetuity, and that whether or not a program is designated as
being a pilot, its status would be reviewed and voted on every year. She
suggested that the motion could state that private funds would be used for
the match to the extent that private funds are available, but that beyond
that, General Funds would be used.      Regent Newman expressed
disagreement with that proposal.
Vice President Hartford observed that the student referendum was not
for a pilot program. Provost Machen reiterated that "the commitment to
child care is not a pilot commitment." The proposal now before the Board is,
in effect, an interim proposal as part of a comprehensive plan that will be
coming forward at a later date.
Regent Power clarified that the issue is whether General Fund money
should be spent on child care. He believes the answer is yes, because
General Fund money is already being spent on a variety of other activities
designed to maximize access to the University. Regent Newman has raised
the issue of whether or not private fundraising should be substituted for a
policy commitment to expend General Fund money on a regular, annual,
reviewed basis, for child care. Although he believes that child care would be
a worthwhile vehicle for which to raise private funds, that issue should not
be confused with the Board's policy decision to expend General Funds money
for the purposes of child care.
Regent Baker cautioned that passage of this motion would be the
equivalent of the "camel's nose under the tent," citing other examples of
student-approved fees for support of such programs as PIRGIM, the Ann
Arbor Tenants Union, and Student Legal Services that expanded in scope
and continued to draw money from students many years after initially being


156




November Meeting, 1996


approved. He suggested that rather than approve the funding at this point, a
study should be conducted and a comprehensive plan should be devised for
dealing with the whole issue of child care.
Regent Deitch made the following points in support of the motion: 1) It is
important to support a referendum that was initiated by students, and that
takes a more perceptive view of access than has been taken in the past. 2) He
believes this is an issue of access involving making the University more available to nontraditional students. As a public university, the question of access
is a public responsibility and thereby is a policy question. 3) Regarding the
issue of private funding, he believes that although the creation of an
endowment for child care is a positive notion, it should not dictate whether
or not the Board commits to this program. Funds should be committed
because the notion was approved by students and to address the access issue.
He cautioned against having policy decisions dictated on an ad hoc basis by
an individual Regent's desire to raise private funds in lieu of not having an
otherwise worthwhile program go forward.
Regent Newman clarified that her intent is that if she is not successful
in raising the funds, General Funds could then be used. She is only asking
for the opportunity to see whether or not this program could be funded
privately.
Regent Varner noted that the key issues are that students did vote for
this; that student aid is already being provided from the General Fund and
thus precedent is not being set; and that this program is another means of
maintaining accessibility. The issue of fundraising should not affect these
efforts.
Following further discussion, Regent Baker offered a substitute motion
adding language to the current motion that the program be terminated in
one year unless there is a comprehensive overview of long term costs.
Regent McFee suggested that if the proposal goes forward, some of the
funds could be used to explore what the need is and what is being done to
meet these needs and what private funds can be developed to support the
ongoing need. A clear statement of need would enhance the opportunity for
private funding. When funding for the child care fee comes up for renewal,
the program will have been reviewed to see what progress has been made in
developing the statement of need.
Regent Deitch expressed that he did not agree that child care for
students must have private support in order to be justified. Rather, it should
be viewed as a continuation of the institutional commitment to access and
diversity, while recognizing that it is also institutional policy to defray
expenditures through endowments wherever possible.
Regent Baker restated his substitute motion that the program would
terminate in one year. Regent McFee stated that she would second Regent
Baker's substitute motion if the language stated that at the end of one year,
before the fee is renewed, all of the details of what has happened and what
plans have been made be reviewed by the Regents. Regent Baker accepted
that alternate language, so his substitute motion was seconded.
157




November Meeting, 1996


Regent McFee restated the substitute motion as being the original
motion with the additional language that at the end of a year, the program
will be thoroughly reviewed. Regent McGowan noted that the task force is
already charged with such a review. Regent McFee clarified that her motion
is restating that.
Interim President Neal pointed out that Provost Machen already is
charged with making budgetary decisions regarding competing demands for
financial aid requests, and perhaps such decisions should be left to him, with
the policy decision left to the Board.
Regent Newman responded that although she wants to support the
students and access to the institution, she is personally not ready to create a
new category of fee at this time.
Regent McFee withdrew her second to Regent Baker's substitute
motion, since it appears that it is only restating what is in the original
motion.
The vote was then taken on the original motion, and it was approved,
with Regents Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, Power, and Varner in
favor, and Regents Baker and Newman opposed. Regent Baker stated his
opposition was based on the fact that the proposal had come before the
Board not having been fully studied by the administration as he had
previously requested. Regent Horning noted that his support is based on the
fact that he had believed that the matching portion of the proposal was to
have been a one-year pilot program. Therefore, he would not automatically
support the program  again in one year.  Regent Newman stated her
opposition was based on the fact that she does not believe that the General
Fund should be used for this purpose.
Recommendations for Appointments to Medical Staff Membership
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Power, and on the
recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board,
the Regents unanimously approved certain specified appointments to medical
staff membership.
Henry Russel Lecturer
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved the appointment of William E. Bolcom, the
Ross Lee Finney Distinguished University Professor of Music, as the Henry
Russel Lecturer for 1997.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Baker read the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(e) and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in
closed session on November 15, 1996, in the Regents' Room, for the
purposes of consulting with our attorney regarding trial or settlement
strategy in connection with specific pending litigation (section 8e) and


158




November Meeting, 1996


of considering material exempt from discussion or disclosure by the
Michigan Freedom of Information Act (section 8h). Such exempt
material consists of a written opinion from the Board's legal counsel.
Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then continued in executive session, beginning at 12:10 p.m.
Adjournment
The meeting adjourned at 4:30 p.m. The next meeting is scheduled for
December 19-20, 1996. Regents' expenses for the month of September 1996
totaled $767.60 and for October 1996 totaled $6,917.92.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1996


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, December 19, 1996
The Regents met at 1:50 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
Interim President Neal and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Also present were Executive Vice
President Womack, Provost Machen, Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford,
and Kinnear, Chancellors Nelms and Renick, and Secretary Palmer.
Assistant Vice President Judith Nowack attended in the stead of Vice
President Neidhardt, who was absent.
Provost's Report. Interim President Neal called the meeting to order
and called on Provost Machen. Provost Machen introduced Ms. Heather
Stoll, a University student who has been selected as a British Marshall
Scholar for 1997-99. He reviewed her accomplishments that had led to her
selection for this honor, and Ms. Stoll received a round of applause.
Community Family Health Center
Provost Machen introduced Ada Sue Hinshaw, dean of the School of
Nursing, and Beverly Jones, associate hospital director/chief of nursing affairs
and associate dean of the School of Nursing, to describe the proposed
Community Family Health Center. Provost Machen observed that this program is viewed as an educational venture sponsored by the Office of the Provost,
with support from the University of Michigan Health System.
Dean Hinshaw described the health center as a community-based
educational and service unit intended to provide high quality primary care
through a partnership model, in which health care is delivered primarily
through nurse practitioners working with collaborating physicians and other
health care providers. Dean Hinshaw and Associate Dean Jones reviewed
the center's objectives and described the type of health care to be provided
and collaborations that are envisioned with community organizations.
With respect to funding, Dean Hinshaw said that the center would be
established with a $400,000 award from the University of Michigan Health
System and the School of Nursing and a gift from a donor of $100,000. The
business plan provides that this funding plus revenues from the operation of
the center would allow it to break even and begin to earn money by the
beginning of year five.
Following the discussion, Regent McGowan moved approval of the
Community Family Health Center, as described in the Regents Communication.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

December Meeting, 1996


M. Kent Jennings, professor of political science in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts and research scientist in the Center for
Political Studies at the Institute for Social Research, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 1996.
Professor Jennings earned his B.A. degree from the University of
Redlands in 1956 and his Ph.D. degree from the University of North Carolina
in 1961. After spending three years at the Brookings Institution, he joined
the University of Michigan faculty in 1963 as assistant professor and was
promoted to associate professor in 1966 and professor in 1969. At the
Institute for Social Research, he was a research associate from 1964-68,
program director from 1968-70, and has been a research scientist since 1970.
Since 1984, Professor Jennings has held a half-time appointment at the
University of Michigan and a half-time appointment at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, actively teaching at both institutions.
Professor Jennings made major contributions to the development of the
field of political socialization. His landmark study of the intergenerational
transmission of attitudes through the study of parents and children in 1981
initiated whole new areas of research, and has become an ongoing panel
study, with the fourth wave to be done next year. Professor Jennings has also
made important contributions to our understanding of comparative politics
across a range of topics on local elites and mass publics in a number of
countries. He has trained a large number of scholars in the areas of American
politics and methodology, and has been a devoted and engaged teacher of
graduate and undergraduate students.
Professor Jennings is president-elect of the American Political Science
Association and will serve as its president in 1997-98. He has received a
Guggenheim Fellowship, been a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences, and has received numerous awards for published
works.   He has won prizes from    both the Western Political Science
Association (for the best paper on the topic of women and politics) and from
the International Society of Political Psychology (for the best paper presented
at the 1992 meeting). He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences in 1982.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming M. Kent
Jennings professor emeritus of political science and research scientist
emeritus.
Frank B. Livingstone, professor of anthropology, will retire from
active faculty status on December 31, 1996.
Professor Livingstone received his B.A. degree in mathematics from
Harvard (1950) and came to the University of Michigan where he earned his
M.A. (1955) and Ph.D. (1957) degrees in anthropology.   After a NSF
postdoctoral fellowship, he joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
assistant professor of anthropology in 1959. He was promoted to associate
professor in 1963 and professor in 1968. He served as chair of the Department
of Anthropology from 1983-86.
Professor Livingstone has played a key role in maintaining the presence
of biological anthropology in the "four field" approach that serves as the core
of the anthropology curriculum at the University of Michigan. For a full
generation, he served as faculty advisor to entering graduate students in


175




December Meeting, 1996


biological anthropology, and he has served on more doctoral committees than
any other biological anthropologist in the department. At the same time, he has
served as counselor to the undergraduates in the anthropology-zoology B.A.
program, the principle avenue for students aspiring to enter medical school after
graduation.
The pioneering work that Professor Livingstone began during his
graduate studies has paved the way for an understanding of the relationships
between falciparum malaria, sickle-cell anemia, ecology, and cultural history.
This earned him the Martin Luther King Award from the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference for Contributions to Research on Sickle Cell Anemia.
It was his model that demonstrated why the concept of "race" simply
prevents us from understanding the nature and meaning of human biological
variation. His seminal contributions to the literature on this matter have been
republished time and again and have provided one of the reasons why the
Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan has repeatedly
been ranked first in the nation.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Frank B.
Livingstone professor emeritus of anthropology.
Harry R. Pape, Jr., D.D.S, associate professor of dentistry in the
School of Dentistry, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1996.
Dr. Pape received his D.D.S. degree in 1961 and his M.S. degree in
restorative dentistry (operative) in 1974, both from the University of
Michigan.  He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a clinical
instructor in 1971. He was appointed assistant professor of dentistry in 1974
and was promoted to associate professor in 1979. He has served as director of
several of the dental clinics in the University and School of Dentistry during
his term.
Dr. Pape has participated in the department's teaching and clinic activity
and has served on the pathology committee, the preventive dentistry
committee, the community dentistry committee, and the interdisciplinary
coordinating committee on prevention and nutrition. He has also served the
school as a member of the library committee, the appointments, promotions,
and tenure committee, and as chair of the table clinic committee from
1989-94. His community service includes participating in the preventive
dentistry committee of the Washtenaw District Dental Society from 1974-77.
Dr. Pape's publications have focused on streptococcus mutans; most recently,
he has studied the effect of xylitol (a sugar alcohol) on dental caries.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health sciences educator by
naming Harry R. Pape, Jr., associate professor emeritus of dentistry.
Richard L. Patterson, professor of natural resources in the School of
Natural Resources and Environment, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 1996.
Professor Patterson earned his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in 1954,
1959, and 1963, respectively, all from the University of Michigan. He served
on the faculty of the University of Florida from 1963-70 prior to joining the
University of Michigan faculty in 1970 as professor of natural resources and
coordinator of mathematical modeling on the Sea Grant Program.

December Meeting, 1996


Professor Patterson's doctoral research was in queuing theory under the
direction of the well-known queuing theorist A. B. Clarke. He published 33
papers on theory and applications of stochastic networks, statistics, and
applied mathematics related to problems arising in industrial engineering,
resource management, and environmental science, and has held memberships
in 15 professional and honorary societies.
From 1970 until his retirement, Professor Patterson was active in
teaching, research, counseling, and service in the School of Natural Resources
and Environment. He was principal investigator on many sponsored research
grants and was a consultant to numerous organizations, including the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and the Army Missile Command.
Within the SNRE, he served as chair of the graduate policy and management
program, acting associate dean, and as a member of a number of school and
campus-wide committees.
Professor Patterson introduced courses into the SNRE curriculum in
resource management and environmental science emphasizing the use of
operations research and applied mathematics in environmental problem
solving. Many of his former students now occupy responsible positions in
academia, government, and industry in the U.S. and abroad. For many years,
Professor Patterson was coordinator of master's projects in SNRE. He was an
effective motivator of graduate students and enjoyed excellent one-on-one
working relationships with them.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Richard L.
Patterson professor emeritus of natural resources.
Susan I. Seger, senior associate librarian, retired from the University
Library on October 11, 1996, after 32 years of dedicated service.
Ms. Seger received her B.S. degree in dental hygiene at the University of
Michigan in 1957 and practiced as a dental hygienist from 1957-61. She then
returned to the University to study for a teacher's certificate and a master's
degree in library science. Upon completing her A.M.L.S. degree in 1964, she
spent one year as an assistant librarian at the Business Administration
Library. In July 1965, Ms. Seger became assistant librarian in the Dentistry
Library, and in January 1966 she was promoted to head librarian.
In 1971, the library, which had been scattered in five locations in the
school's vintage 1907 building, moved to the new clinic building and research
tower. Following the move, the dramatic growth of the student body and the
implementation of a new curriculum put Ms. Seger's abilities to the test. This
she surmounted admirably, and her collection-building efforts really got
under way.
Ms. Seger managed the implementation of the MIRLYN computerized
catalog and circulation system at the Dentistry Library during the '80s. Since
1989, she has established and continued to improve a curriculum-integrated
educational program for the MEDLINE health sciences bibliographic database
that is a model for the other health science libraries on campus.
Building on the achievements of her predecessors, over the past thirty
years Ms. Seger has created what is arguably one of the largest and most
varied dental collections in the country, one that has a national and even
international reputation. Through her devotion to service and her willingness


177




December Meeting, 1996


to expend maximum effort to complete the tasks assigned to her, Ms. Seger
has attracted a legion of supporters among students, faculty, and staff of the
School of Dentistry.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming Susan I.
Seger senior associate librarian emerita.
Dorothy Huntwork Shields, associate librarian, retired from the University Library on August 31, 1996.
Ms. Shields earned her B.S. degree from the University of Michigan in
1959 and her M.S.L.S. degree from Wayne State University in 1976. She held
a number of positions elsewhere in Michigan and in Ohio before joining the
staff of the University Library as an administrative assistant in 1982. She
was promoted to assistant librarian in 1983 and associate librarian in 1991.
Dorothy Shields has contributed to the library profession on several
levels throughout her career. Her accomplishments include helping to oversee
the addition of a campus computing site to the Art and Architecture Library
in 1985 and its later expansion in 1988. In her role as slide librarian, she
doubled the size of the Art and Architecture Library's image resources. She
was an active participant in helping to plan the Art and Architecture Library's
merger with the Media Union. Of particular importance was her role as
facilitator in helping staff and faculty make the transition to the Media Union.
Ms. Shields has been an active member of the Art Libraries Society, both
nationally and locally. She served four consecutive terms as secretary-treasurer
of ARLIS/Michigan, in which she was instrumental in revising chapter
bylaws. She served on the editorial committee of the Visual Resources Bulletin
and was a member of the Ann Arbor Sister City Delegation to Juigalpa,
Nicaragua, where she distributed books donated by the University of Michigan
to schools and colleges in that city.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming Dorothy
Huntwork Shields associate librarian emerita.

Mary Margaret Jender Trust
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved a leasing agreement between the University
of Michigan and the Mary Margaret Jender Trust for leasing of a medical
office suite. Because Mary Margaret Jender is both the trustee for the trust
that owns the office suite and will be employed by the University as a
medical office supervisor in the office, this agreement falls under the state of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided
in compliance with statutory requirements.

Mary Margaret Jender Trust.
2.  Terms of the contract include a duration of 24 months.  The

utilities. The medical center will place clericals, medical office
assistants, nurses, and physicians to provide necessary primary care
services to the community.

Joseph G. Jender, M.D., P.C.
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
unanimously approved a purchase agreement between the University of
Michigan and Joseph G. Jender, M.D., P.C. Because Dr. Jender holds a zero
percent appointment at the University of Michigan Medical School and is
also a party to the agreement by virtue of his position as president of the

month, and the University will be reimbursed in accordance with the
external user recharge rate established by the University. In the
event that any person has concurrent employment with the
University and MuLex, it is agreed that Regents' Bylaw 2.10 will
govern the disposition of any intellectual property which is generated
by such person during and under this agreement.
3.  Dr. Liu's and Dr. Pronko's pecuniary interest arises by virtue of
their co-ownership of MuLex. The amount of the contract will not

Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan
and Michigan Microsensor, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Power, the
Regents unanimously approved a license agreement between the University
of Michigan and Michigan Microsensor, Inc. Because Seldon B. Crary is both
a University employee and a party to the agreement by virtue of his

Resolution in Honor of Farris W. Womack
Regent Power read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend Farris W.
Womack as he retires from his position as executive vice president and
chief financial officer on December 31, 1996.
A dynamic, visionary leader, Farris Womack has served with
great distinction since arriving at the University in 1988. Under his
guidance, the University's endowment has grown five-fold, to more
than $1.7 billion; Michigan has become the only public university to
earn an Aal credit rating; and it is now completing a $1.5 billion
program to rebuild, renovate, and update most of the buildings on the
Ann Arbor campus.
Through the use of employee empowerment, cutting-edge
computer technology, and Total Quality Management, Dr. Womack
has created an exciting climate in the University's business and
finance areas in which staff continually strive to identify and exceed


183




December Meeting, 1996


expectations. Always gracious and generous to staff at all levels, he
has developed new staff recognition programs and, through venues
such as the Business and Finance Management Institute, has created
opportunities for staff members to develop leadership skills and foster
their careers.
Dr. Womack's wife, Ann, has been an equally committed and
devoted leader in a wide array of University activities. Most recently,
she organized the annual Town Hall Lecture Series, sponsored by the
UM Alumnae Club of Ann Arbor's Waterman Group, and serves on the
75th Anniversary Committee of the Faculty Women's Club, having
previously served on the club's board.
With admiration and gratitude for their numerous contributions, the Regents extend their warmest wishes to Farris and Ann
Womack as they embark on this new phase of their lives.
Regent Baker thanked Executive Vice President Womack for his
"stupendous contribution to this institution." He observed that "none of the
growth that occurred in the last eight years under James Duderstadt's
presidency could have taken place without the financial foundation that he
prepared," and that he also had prepared the University for further growth
under the new president.
Regent Varner thanked Executive Vice President Womack and recalled
that her role in helping to recruit him to campus is one of the
accomplishments that she is most proud of during her tenure as Regent.
Regent McFee observed that she has learned a great deal from working
with Executive Vice President Womack, and that during her six years on the
Board, the University's endowment has increased about 200 percent. She
also noted that he had also introduced innovative types of financing
strategies during his tenure.
Regent Power noted that during the presidential search he had spoken
to a number of chief financial officers at leading universities across the
country. Each had inquired about Farris Womack, and each had expressed
regard for his performance at the University of Michigan. He believes it is a
fair assumption that "Farris is widely regarded in this country as the leading
chief financial officer at any university in the United States."
Regent Horning observed that "it is comforting to sit on a board that I
know is probably as financially sound as any public university in the
country."
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
There followed a round of applause.
Interim President Neal noted that one of the important testaments to
Executive Vice President Womack's accomplishments will be the thousands
of students in the years ahead who will have financial aid or who will sit in
buildings that would not have existed without him.


184




December Meeting, 1996


Resolution in Honor of Regent Nellie M. Varner
Regent Deitch read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend their deep
appreciation and warmest personal regards to their colleague and
friend, Nellie M. Varner, as she completes 16 years of exemplary
service as a member of the Board of Regents.
A prominent Detroit businesswoman, Regent Varner holds
bachelor's and master's degrees from Wayne State University and a
doctoral degree in Russian studies from the University of Michigan.
She is currently president of N. M. Varner Company, a real estate
brokerage firm, and vice president of Atwater Entertainment
Associates.
Regent Varner's background as a University of Michigan faculty
member and administrator has served her well as she has tackled the
broad array of challenges that has faced this complex institution
during her tenure. With compassion, courage, and wisdom, Regent
Varner has helped set the University's course in such important areas
as affirmative action and the expansion of educational and career
opportunities for women.
As co-chair of the Presidential Search Committee, Regent Varner
skillfully guided the Regents' efforts that culminated in the election of
Lee C. Bollinger as the University's twelfth president.  Her
wide-ranging commitment is also demonstrated by her service as
national co-chair of annual giving for the successful $1 billion
Campaign for Michigan.
Regent Varner's "Michigan connection" runs deep. Many of her
family members are University of Michigan alumni, and her
daughter, Janniss L. Varner, attended the UM-Dearborn.  The
Regents look forward to her young grandson, Alvin Norwood, joining
the ranks of the maize and blue at the appropriate time.
The Regents will miss Regent Varner's soft-spoken warmth and
good humor but look forward to her continued guidance and counsel
as they name Nellie M. Varner Regent Emerita of the University of
Michigan.
Regent Power supported the motion. Regent Deitch commented that
"one of the great things that has happened to me in my life was that I earned
Nellie Varner's friendship." He noted that she had been a mentor and a role
model to him in many ways. He pledged that "on all the tough questions
while I'm here, particularly the ones that involve judgment and sensitivity
and resolve, before I vote I'm going to ask myself, 'what would Nellie do' on
this one?"
Regent Baker observed that he had served on the Board with Regent
Varner for 16 years. Among the memories he will never forget is having


185




December Meeting, 1996


shared with Regent Varner the experience of former Regent Sarah Power's
death, and said that he appreciated her service and thanked her for it.
Regent McFee noted that the six years she had served with Regent
Varner had been a real learning experience in terms of working with people
and dealing with issues, and that she was glad to have had an opportunity to
relate to such a "tremendous human being" as Regent Varner.
Regent McGowan commented that she would miss working with Regent
Varner as her close colleague and would ask of her only one thing, and that is
"to leave behind a little of her backbone."
Regent Power noted that Regent Varner had been a friend and a model
to many people, and that she had been an "enormous support to Sarah
[Power] before she became a Regent," and that after her election to the
Board, Sarah had often commented on Nellie's effectiveness. On many
occasions, he noted, "Nellie has contributed that unique quality of grace and
good sense to this University and to her colleagues, to everyone's very great
benefit."
Regent Horning stated that "the greatest compliment he could give"
Regent Varner is that "when you have spoken, I have truly listened. It has
been not only a privilege and an honor to have served with you, but I am
proud to call you my friend."
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
There followed a round of applause.
Regent Varner thanked everyone for their kind remarks and noted
"what a tremendous experience this chapter of my life has been. It has been
a great odyssey for me to come from the student body and then to the Board
and to serve with so many wonderful people. I'm the one who has truly been
honored," she noted, "and I'll always have a great affection for the
University."
Interim President Neal said to Regent Varner, "when I think of you, I
think of love, care, dedication, commitment, vision, warmth, approachability,
sensitivity, and gracefulness."
Resolution in Honor of Regent Deane Baker
Regent Horning observed that the four Regents who will have departed
from the Board during his first two years on the Board represent collectively
88 years of service. He then offered the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan warmly salute their
friend and colleague, Deane Baker, as he concludes 24 years of
dedicated service as a member of the University of Michigan Board of
Regents.
First elected in 1972 and reelected in 1980 and 1988, Regent
Baker is the only Regent to hold the distinction of having served with
three presidents and three interim presidents. During his tenure, he
186




December Meeting, 1996


has witnessed extraordinary changes in every area of the University,
some highlights of which include the development of the Flint and
Dearborn campuses and of the North Campus, and the rebuilding and
expansion of the University of Michigan Medical Center.
Regent Baker has never shied away from representing his own
views and those of his constituents and has often participated in
spirited debates on a wide range of issues. Always a gentleman,
Regent Baker has argued his views persuasively and with heartfelt
eloquence and passion. A staunch supporter of the expansion of
educational opportunities for young people, he has kept a watchful eye
on University budgets, mindful of the need to control costs and to keep
tuition increases to a minimum.
Regent Baker and his wife, Marilyn, have four children: Jamie
Knauss, Wendy Baker Barg, Betsy Roben, and John Deane Baker.
Each holds an advanced or professional degree from Michigan, with
John also having earned his undergraduate degree at the University.
For more than two decades, Deane Baker has been a resolute
presence on the Board, providing prudent oversight while always
maintaining his strongly-held principles.  In recognition of his
dedicated service, the Regents now name Deane Baker Regent
Emeritus of the University of Michigan.
Regent McFee supported the motion. She observed that she had worked
with Regent Baker in a variety of activities over a period of many years, and
that he had always been dedicated to very strongly held principles, both
within the Republican Party and on the Board of Regents. She noted that
even when his ideas have not been supported by the Board, he had always
backed the Board's decisions wholeheartedly. She added that "he has been a
true public servant on this Board, and I will be sorry to see him leave."
Regent Varner observed that she had served with Regent Baker for 16 of
his 24 years on the Board, and that even though they differed on a number of
issues, both of them came to whatever position they held out of love for the
institution. He had served a very special role in terms of balancing the views
held by the Board.
Regent Power noted that although he and Regent Baker had not always
agreed, he had never doubted his sense of actively held, deeply felt principles,
nor doubted his concern, affection, and loyalty for the University. He also
recalled Regents Baker's and Varner's kindness following Sarah's death and
thought it reflected in both of them "a sense of compassion and grace and
civilization that is rare today but important to cultivate.
Regent Deitch also noted that he would miss Regent Baker, noting his
"enormous contribution" of 24 years of service to the University was unlikely
ever to be duplicated again. He observed that "everything you approached,
you approached with integrity." He noted that he had enjoyed his
engagement with Regent Baker during his time on the Board, and that "on
all the big issues, we stood shoulder to shoulder together."


187




December Meeting, 1996


Regent McGowan commented that Regent Baker's being on the Board
had caused her to think harder and work harder than she might otherwise
have had to do, and that she would miss him.
Regent Newman recalled that she first met Regent Baker during her
campaign for election as Regent. She was told that he was a kind, wonderful
gentleman, devoted and dedicated to the Board. After she met him, she
found him to be exactly as people had described him. She said that although
she and he had not always agreed, she has learned a lot from him, one of
which is that disagreements in public or private should not impact personal
relationships. She expressed the hope that she would see Regent Baker often
in the future.
Regent Horning observed that Regent Baker truly has a passion for the
University of Michigan.
The vote was then taken, and the resolution was approved unanimously.
There followed a round of applause.
Comments by Regent Baker. Regent Baker noted that he had some
prepared remarks he wished to add to the record:
To serve on the University of Michigan Board of Regents for 24
years is a humbling and enriching experience.  The honor of
participating in guiding one of the world's great educational
institutions as a servant of the people of Michigan is enriching indeed.
I thank the people of Michigan for that opportunity.
It is both best and wise for a retiree to say as little as possible on
occasions such as this. However, I do ask your indulgence in hearing
three short comments:
The historic, but not formalized "Regent's Credo" is that each
Regent should always vote for "what is best for the University of
Michigan." Consider posting that credo in a prominent place in this
hallowed room.
It is each Regent's duty to protect and defend, in the courts if
necessary, the constitutional autonomy of the University of Michigan if
it is to continue to be a free, great, and world-leading university.
Finally, I want to thank all of those individuals employed by the
University of Michigan, no matter what their rank or duty, for coming
to work each day and cheerfully doing their best to make this
institution the magnificent wonder that it is.
Interim President Neal commented that on behalf of the executive
officers, he wished to convey to Regent Baker their great respect for his
integrity, for his love and passion for the institution, his dedication, and
special thanks for his support during this delicate transition period.
Chancellor Nelms then presented Regents Baker and Varner with
stuffed Wolverine toys as personal gestures of appreciation from him.


188




December Meeting, 1996


Executive Session Motion
Regent McFee made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed session
on December 19, 1996, for the purpose of considering material exempt
from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information
Act. Such exempt material consists of a written opinion from the
Board's legal counsel.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then recessed at 3:40 p.m. while the Regents met in executive

The meeting reconvened at 4:15 p.m. Present were Interim President
Neal and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman,
Power, and Varner.    Also present were Vice President Harrison and
Secretary Palmer.
The Regents heard comments from Professor Gayl Ness about Regent
Baker's service on the Board of Regents, and from Michael J. Kinnucan,
member of the Steering Committee of Citizens for Quality Care, about
privatization of the University of Michigan Medical Center.
Request for Investigation with Attorney Grievance Commission
Regent Deitch made the following motion:
I move that the Board of Regents ("Board") file a request for
investigation with the Attorney Grievance Commission into the
conduct of Jonathan D. Rowe, and the law firm of Dykema Gossett,
and Bruce T. Wallace and Charles W. Borgsdorf and the law firm of
Hooper, Hathaway, Price, Beuche & Wallace, and take other related
action as proposed for the following reasons:
On April 4, 1991, the Board and the law firm of Dykema Gossett,
P.L.L.C. ("Dykema Gossett") executed a contract under which Dykema
Gossett agreed to provide services to the Board, which was renewed on
a periodic basis.
The parties executed a new contract in August, 1994 ("Contract").
Dykema Gossett provided lobbying and legal services for and on
behalf of the Board from April 4, 1991, through the present.
In its Contract with the Board, Dykema Gossett represented that
there was no actual or potential conflict of interest between it and the
Board, and Dykema Gossett further agreed to notify the Board in the
event of potential conflicts of interest.
On October 11, 1996, while the Contract was in effect and while
Dykema Gossett continued to perform services and bill the Board for


189




December Meeting, 1996


its services, Dykema Gossett, by Jonathan D. Rowe, filed an action
against the Board on behalf of the Herald Company d/b/a Booth
Newspapers, Inc., and the Ann Arbor News, the Detroit Free Press,
and the Detroit News, Inc. (the "Newspapers"), Washtenaw Circuit
Court No. 96-7822-CZ.
Michigan Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7(a) provides that a
lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client
will be directly adverse to another client, unless (1) the lawyer
reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the
relationship with the other client; and (2) each client consents after
consultation.
The Board was not consulted with respect to Dykema Gossett's
potential representation of the Newspapers whose interests were
directly adverse to the interests of the Board, nor did the Board
consent to that representation.
The Board, through counsel, requested that Dykema Gossett
withdraw from its representation of the Newspapers based upon its
conflict of interest. Dykema Gossett did not withdraw as requested,
but continued with the litigation, and the University of Michigan filed
a motion to disqualify Dykema Gossett in the pending litigation.
After the Board filed the motion to disqualify Dykema Gossett,
Dykema Gossett retained the services of Hooper, Hathaway, Price,
Beuche & Wallace ("Hooper Hathaway") to represent the interests of
Dykema Gossett.
Hooper Hathaway, by Bruce T. Wallace and        Charles W.
Borgsdorf, filed a brief in opposition to the Board's motion to
disqualify Dykema Gossett from its representation of the Newspapers.
Hooper Hathaway previously represented the Board in a
substantially related matter with respect to litigation filed against the
University by Booth Newspapers, Inc., and the Detroit Free Press, Inc.
(See Booth Newspapers, Inc. v. Board of Regents, 444 Mich. 211
(1994)). In its capacity as counsel to the Board in the previous related
litigation, Hooper Hathaway   was provided with sensitive and
confidential information concerning the general subject matter of this
litigation.
In addition, at the time of its retention by Dykema Gossett, Hooper
Hathaway represented the Board with respect to two appellate
litigation matters.
Michigan Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7(a) provides that a
lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client
will be directly adverse to another client, unless (1) the lawyer
reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the
relationship with the other client; and (2) each client consents after
consultation.


190




December Meeting, 1996


In addition, Rule 1.9 provides that a lawyer who has formerly
represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another
person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that
person's interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former
client unless the former client consents after consultation.
The Board, through counsel, requested that Hooper Hathaway
withdraw from its representation of interests adverse to the interests of
the Board; Hooper Hathaway responded by asserting that it had met
its ethical obligations by terminating its relationship with the lawyers
handling the Board's matters.
Hooper Hathaway, by Messrs. Wallace and Borgsdorf, neither
consulted with nor obtained the consent of the Board to represent
clients with interests adverse to the interests of the Board.
Therefore, I move that the Board take the following action:
That the Board file requests for investigation with the Michigan
Attorney Grievance Commission into the conduct of Jonathan D. Rowe
and the law firm of Dykema Gossett, and the conduct of Bruce T.
Wallace and Charles W. Borgsdorf and the law firm of Hooper
Hathaway for the reasons stated herein;
That the Board direct its legal counsel to provide the Michigan
Attorney Grievance Commission a copy of this motion, as approved,
evidencing the action of this Board.
That the Board's legal counsel also provide the Attorney
Grievance Commission copies of all motions, briefs, affidavits, and
other related papers filed by all parties in Washtenaw Circuit Court
No. 96-7822-CZ.
Regent Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
President's Report
Interim President Neal announced that the search committees for both
the executive vice president and chief financial officer and the executive vice
president for medical affairs had been appointed and had begun their work.
He also noted that the articles of incorporation had been signed for the
Michigan Virtual Auto College.
Interim President Neal acknowledged the efforts of Vice President
Harrison and his staff in the passage of the revised Open Meetings Act and
Freedom of Information Act legislation related to the conduct of presidential
searches at public universities. He also announced the appointment of Lisa
Tedesco to work in the President's Office on issues related to the Michigan
Mandate and the Michigan Agenda for Women.
Interim President Neal announced the names of the Executive Vice
President for Medical Affairs (EVPMA) Search Advisory Committee, noting
that it was to be chaired by Professor Max Wicha. He observed that the


191




December Meeting, 1996


committee will need the assistance of outside groups, as it will be searching
broadly, inside and outside of academia, for candidates.
Regent Newman observed that she had assumed the committee would
include individuals with expertise from outside the University, and expressed
concern that the current committee is composed of only internal members.
Interim President Neal responded that it was assumed that the committee
could consult with already existing external advisory groups.
Regent Newman also noted that the Regents had not been consulted
about the makeup of this committee prior to its appointment, unlike what
had occurred with the EVPCFO search committee. Regent Deitch expressed
agreement with Regent Newman's sentiments, noting that the position will
require a person with excellent business skills as well as credentials in
academic medicine. Regents McFee and Power expressed similar sentiments.
Interim President Neal reiterated that the plan was to involve
individuals from outside of the University who currently serve on the visiting
committee, but a more formal involvement by outside individuals might be
desirable. Regent Newman asked for follow-up on this matter.
Interim President Neal noted both search committees had begun joint
discussions about the choice of search firms.
The meeting then recessed at 4:40 p.m. to resume meeting in the closed
session.
Adjournment
Following the closed session, the meeting was adjourned at 6:15 p.m.
The next meeting is scheduled for January 23-24, 1997. Regents' expenses
for the month of November 1996 totaled $1,173.62.
Roberta R. Palmer
Secretary of the University

JANUARY MEETING, 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, January 23, 1997
The Regents met at 9:45 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
Interim President Neal and Regents Deitch, Homing, Maynard, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Taylor, and Secretary Palmer.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Horning read the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed session
on January 23, 1997, for the purpose of considering material exempt
from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information
Act. Such exempt material consists of a written opinion from the
Board's legal counsel.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting continued in executive session until 11:50 a.m., at which time it
recessed.
The Regents reconvened at 1:55 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present
were Interim President Neal and Regents Deitch, Homing, Maynard, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Interim Executive
Vice President Matthews, Provost Machen, Vice Presidents Harrison,
Hartford, Kinnear, and Neidhardt, Chancellors Nelms and Renick, and
Secretary Palmer.
Opening Remarks - Interim President Neal
Interim President Neal noted that Regents Olivia P. Maynard and S.
Martin Taylor were attending their first Regents' Meeting and welcomed
them to the table. He also acknowledged the presence of Chandler W.
Matthews in the role of interim executive vice president and chief financial
officer. There followed a round of applause.
President Neal observed that a University student and faculty member
had recently been killed in a plane crash and offered the following statement:
It was less than two weeks ago that we learned of the tragedy
that took the lives of two valued members of our University
community, Betty Jean Jones and Arati Sharangpani. We were
saddened by the loss of Professor Jones, Arati, and the other 27
people on that flight, including Dexter Adams, a Proctor & Gamble
employee, who was, I believe, a U of M alum, who was coming to
Ann Arbor to recruit.
Vice President Hartford, Provost Machen, and I had the
privilege of attending a memorial service yesterday for Arati in the


193




January Meeting, 1997


Michigan Union Ballroom. The crowd of more than 350 provided a
stirring testimony to the impact this talented and compassionate
young woman had on so many lives. She was committed to her
studies and scheduled to graduate in May with concentrations in
German and political science. A bachelor of arts degree will be
awarded to her posthumously She also was an enthusiastic campus
leader-active in the Indian American Student Association and the
21st Century Program, in addition to serving as a resident adviser.
As Vice President Hartford noted yesterday, Arati represents the best
of our student community.
In the same vein, Professor Jones represents the talent and
commitment of our top faculty. Although Professor Jones was with
us only a few years, she quickly endeared herself to students, faculty
colleagues, and staff members across the University. Theatre Department Chair Erik Fredricksen and Dean Paul Boylan were the first to
recognize the talent and warmth, energy and passion that Betty
Jean would bring to our students and to our academic community.
Betty Jean also brought with her from the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro excellent academic credentials as a scholar
of theater plus her proven talents as an actress and director.
Betty Jean was someone special, someone with great energy,
kindness, enthusiasm, and love for life. Later this afternoon Betty
Jean's many friends will gather to celebrate her life at a memorial
service in Rackham Amphitheater, followed by a reception at Trueblood Theatre.
There are those whose lives death cannot diminish because
their love radiates in the hearts of friends and family; their light
shines on in the lives they've touched. Betty Jean and Arati were
those kind of people. Although we're saddened by their passing, the
University of Michigan is a better place because they have been part
of our community.
Search Committees. Interim President Neal observed that progress
was being made on adding a person external to the University people to the
search committee for the executive vice president for medical affairs. He also
noted that the search committee for the executive vice president and chief
financial officer has identified a consulting firm and is making good progress.
Committee on the Use of the University's Name. Interim President
Neal announced that a Committee on the Use of the University's Name will
be formed soon. Among its charges will be to determine under what
conditions the name of the University of Michigan will be allowed to be
associated with commercial activities. It is anticipated that the committee's
recommendations will be brought to the Board.
Wiesner Symposium. Interim President Neal called on Associate Vice
President Julie Ellison, who described plans for the second annual Jerome B.
Wiesner Symposium, to be held February 24, 1997. She noted that the
theme of the symposium, public policy regarding the humanities and arts,
194




January Meeting, 1997


will set the stage for the University's Year of the Humanities in 1997-98, an
initiative of the Office of the Vice President for Research.
New Century Fund. Interim President Neal announced the creation
of the New Century Fund, which will be used to support the advancement of
the University's Agenda for Women and the Michigan Mandate.     Lisa
Tedesco, associate dean of the School of Dentistry and coordinator of these
activities in the president's office, has been charged with developing the
guidelines for the New Century Fund.
NCAA Accreditation. Vice President Harrison announced that as
part of the external phase of the NCAA certification process, a site visit team
will be visiting campus in the coming week. This team will review the
University's recently completed self-study and make recommendations to the
NCAA regarding certification.
Presidential Transition. Interim President Neal noted that he and
President Elect Bollinger have been working to assure a smooth transition
for the start of Bollinger's term on February 1, 1997.
White House Visit. Interim President Neal noted that Ms. Fiona
Rose, president of the Michigan Student Assembly, had appeared with
President Clinton at the White House for the announcement of new
government programs for student aid. He showed a videotape of the event.
The Future of Research Support
Vice President Neidhardt presented a report on the outlook for federal
investment in university research for the next five years and beyond,
including implications of these projections for the University of Michigan,
and the University's response to this situation. He observed that it is likely
that federal support for university-based research will decline. He noted that
because only 64 percent of the University's total research expenditure of
$441,294,540 is from federal sources, it is somewhat less dependent on
federal support than most of its peer institutions.  However, major
reductions in federal research support would have serious consequences for
the University, since this support provides tuition and stipends for students;
salaries for faculty, technicians, and students; assistance in purchasing
equipment and books; and funds for building renovation and construction.
In addition, the knowledge produced with this federal support contributes to
the reputation and prestige of the institution.
Vice President Neidhardt noted that the University's response to this
situation has included working to modify the federal research support
environment, increasing the University's competitive edge in vying for
decreasing federal resources, increasing the support faculty gain from other
sources, and increasing the efficiency of the University's research enterprise.
There followed some discussion about these issues. Assistant Vice
President Marvin Parnes noted that a group has been formed to determine
how the University can strengthen its relationships with industry.

Retirement Memoirs. Secretary Palmer submitted seven retirement
memoirs.
Richard J. Allen, M.D., professor of pediatrics and communicable
diseases and professor of pediatrics, Department of Neurology, Medical
School, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1996.
Dr. Allen received his B.A., M.D., and M.S. degrees from the University
of Michigan in 1945, 1949, and 1953, respectively, and completed his pediatric
residency at the University of Michigan Medical Center in 1952. From
1955-56, he held a National Cerebral Palsy Fellowship in Pediatric Neurology
at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. He joined the faculty
of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Michigan in 1957 as an
instructor. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1958, associate
professor in 1962, and professor in 1968. He has held a joint appointment
with the Department of Neurology since 1980.
The primary academic focus of Dr. Allen's career has been on
understanding the pathophysiology and improving the treatment of neurometabolic diseases of children. He established a state-funded program to
provide optimal treatment for children with several inherited neurometabolic
diseases that are detectable in the neonatal period by newborn screening. He
has also served as an important advocate for children with these rare
disorders.
Dr. Allen is the author of numerous publications and has been an invited
speaker at many scientific meetings. He was a founding member of the Child
Neurology Society and hosted the first meeting of this group in Ann Arbor 25
years ago. His contributions to the Child Neurology Society, which has grown
exponentially since its inception, are being recognized at this year's national
meeting. Dr. Allen is also a member of the Society for Pediatric Research
(emeritus), Society of Inherited Metabolic Disease, the Midwest Society for
Pediatric Research, and the International Society for Neonatal Screening.
Within the University of Michigan Medical Center, Dr. Allen served as
director of the Division of Pediatric Neurology (1968-79), director of the
Pediatric Neurology and PKU clinical and laboratory programs (1968-80), and
has been director of the Pediatric Neurology Metabolic Clinic and Laboratory
since 1980.
In recognition of his distinguished career as a clinician, scholar, and
teacher, the Regents name Richard J. Alien professor emeritus of pediatrics
and communicable diseases and professor emeritus of pediatrics in the
Department of Neurology.
James L. Daws, Jr., associate research scientist in the Department of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, retired from active faculty
status on June 10, 1996, after 39 years as a researcher and lecturer.

his Ph.D. degree in 1969, all from the University of Michigan. He was


214




January Meeting, 1997


appointed assistant research engineer in 1959, became associate research
engineer in 1970, and associate research scientist in 1974. Dr. Daws has also
served as a lecturer on both the Ann Arbor and Dearborn campuses.
Most of Dr. Daws' research     involved the  interplay  of digital
communications systems and pseudo random sequences, now known as
"spread spectrum" systems. He also developed control systems for automatic
processing of underwater acoustic scientific experiments. Dr. Daws is the
author of several journal articles and has written many technical reports as a
researcher in the Cooley Electronics Laboratory and the Communication and
Signal Processing Laboratory. He is noted both for building systems that
work and for understanding them. Dr. Daws also contributed in other areas,
including his work with the Space Physics Research Laboratory on the design
and development of a microprocessor-controlled instrument for use on an
unmanned spacecraft. He was a member of a consulting team on the overall
internal communications system for the University of Michigan Replacement
Hospital Project and consulted with urban planning researchers for the City
of Detroit's radio communications and control systems.
Between 1974 and 1996, Dr. Daws taught over 3,200 students on both
the Ann Arbor and Dearborn campuses. Balancing applications with theory,
he focused on areas that directly supported local industry. His courses ranged
from graduate courses on modem control and digital communications to basic
undergraduate courses in instrumentation, network synthesis, automatic
control, computer languages, electromechanical energy conversion, and linear
systems.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming James L. Daws,
Jr., associate research scientist emeritus.
Rose C. Gibson, professor of social work in the School of Social Work,
faculty associate in the Research Center for Group Dynamics, Institute for
Social Research, and faculty associate in the Institute of Gerontology, retired
from active faculty status on December 31, 1996.
Professor Gibson received her B.A. degree in 1946 from Wayne State
University and her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees, in 1968 and 1977, respectively,
from the University of Michigan. She joined the Institute of Gerontology as a
research investigator in 1979.  She was promoted to assistant research
scientist in 1982 and associate research scientist in 1984. She joined the
faculty of the School of Social Work in 1985 as an associate professor. She was
granted tenure in 1988 and was promoted to professor in 1992. She has been a
faculty associate in the Institute for Social Research since 1987.
A nationally and internationally recognized scholar on the subject of race
and aging, Professor Gibson is known for her empirical models of race
differences in the aging process. She was the first to identify a black-white
morbidity crossover in national data and to identify race differences in the
meaning and measurement of self-reported health in national surveys. She
has published numerous articles and book chapters, as well as several books,
including Different Worlds: Inequality in the Aging Experience, Blacks in an
Aging Society, Health in Black America, and Aging and the Life Course. Her
textbooks on inequality in aging are widely used in undergraduate sociology
courses.


215




January Meeting, 1997


Professor Gibson is editor-in-chief of The Gerontologist, the largest
multidisciplinary peer-reviewed research journal on aging. She chaired the
Governor's Task Force on New Work and Retirement Arrangements for the
Older Worker and was vice chair of the Governor's Task Force on
Employment Opportunities for Older Citizens. Her awards include the Wilbur
J. Cohen Award for outstanding contributions to aging research and the Ida I.
Beam Distinguished Professorship. Her groundbreaking work on racial
differences in mortality rates, retirement, and health status has brought her
international acclaim and has brought distinction to the School of Social Work
and the University of Michigan.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Rose C. Gibson professor emerita of social work.
Walton M. Hancock, professor of industrial and operations engineering
in the College of Engineering and professor of health services management
and policy in the School of Public Health, retired from active faculty status on
January 2, 1997.
Professor Hancock received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in 1951,
1952, and 1954, respectively, all from The Johns Hopkins University. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1959 as a lecturer. He was
promoted to associate professor in 1960 and professor in 1962. Professor
Hancock served as associate dean of the College of Engineering and director
of the Center for Research on Integrated Manufacturing from 1985-89.
Professor Hancock's pioneering studies in the 1960s of direct labor
planning demonstrated how human performance data could be statistically
analyzed and used to predict plant staffing requirements. One of his many
original contributions was the "learning curve," a statistical method for
forecasting how quickly workers could be expected to learn new skills. In the
1970s, Professor Hancock recognized the need for cost containment within
the health care industry. Using advanced industrial engineering tools, he
demonstrated conclusively how various patient scheduling schemes affect
hospital staffing requirements and described how surgical units could use
industrial engineering methods to improve patient care and efficiency. This
work led to a joint appointment in the School of Public Health, two
highly-regarded books, a series of short courses for practicing industrial
engineers in hospitals, and a joint master's program in industrial and hospital
administration. In the 1980s, Professor Hancock turned his attention to the
problem of quality assurance in manufacturing systems, developing concepts
that have been widely adopted by the automotive industry.
Professor Hancock has chaired or co-chaired 34 Ph.D. thesis committees,
and many of his former students are now leaders in academia and industry.
He has co-authored 3 books and published numerous journal articles, book
chapters, and technical reports. During his career, he has received numerous
awards, including the College of Engineering's prestigious Stephen S. Attwood
Award in 1981 and the Gilbreth Medal in 1982. He was named the first
William Clay Ford Professor of Product Manufacturing in 1989.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Walton M.
Hancock professor emeritus of industrial and operations engineering and
professor emeritus of health services management and policy.

January Meeting, 1997


John C. Mathes, professor of technical communication, College of
Engineering, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1996, after 33
years of service.
Professor Mathes received his B.A. degree in 1952, his M.A. degree in
1953, and his Ph.D. degree in 1965, all from the University of Michigan. He
joined the College of Engineering as an instructor in 1963. He was promoted
to assistant professor in 1966, associate professor in 1970, and professor in
1975. Professor Mathes served as chair of the Department of Humanities
from 1976-81. Within the University, he has also been affiliated with the
Center for Research on Economic Development; the Urban, Technological,
and Environmental Planning Program; and the Engineering for Public
Systems Program.
Professor Mathes has had a major influence on the development of the
current theory and practice of technical communications, having authored 8
books and more than 70 other publications. His book, Designing Technical
Reports, co-authored with his colleague Dwight W. Stevenson, became the
model for many of the important current textbooks in the field. His
subsequent work explored the relationships among technical communication
and such previously unexplored cognate areas as organizational behavior,
management communication, multinational communication, and social
decision analysis.  With his process-based approach to organizational
communication and his multidisciplinary scholarship, he broadened the scope
of technical communications and helped to establish a research agenda for the
future.
Professor Mathes' research interests include social decision analysis,
socioenvironmental impact analysis, and technology and society. A member of
numerous professional organizations, he has consulted widely in the United
States and Japan. Professor Mathes is co-chair of the Technical English
Proficiency Test, a certification program for Japanese managers and
engineers carried out under an agreement among the University of Michigan,
Waseda University (Japan), and the Tokyo Center for Language and Culture.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming John C. Mathes
professor emeritus of technical communication.
Roy Penchansky, professor of health management and policy, retired
from active faculty status on December 31, 1996.
Professor Penchansky received his B.A. degree from St. Peter's College,
Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1956. He completed graduate work in industrial
and labor relations at Cornell University, where he received his M.I.L.R..
degree in 1958; and then went to Harvard University, where he received his
D.B.A. degree from the School of Business Administration in 1962. He was
assistant professor of administration in medical care at Harvard from 1963
until joining the University of Michigan faculty in 1966 as associate professor
of medical care organization in the School of Public Health. He was promoted
to professor in 1972.
Professor Penchansky was an innovator in the education of community
leaders and health care professionals. He worked with the U.S. Office of
Economic Opportunity to educate leaders in minority populations in the management
of community health centers. In the 1970s, Professor Penchansky developed and
instituted the nation's first executive master's degree program in health care


217




January Meeting, 1997


administration in the Department of Medical Care Organization. This
program has served as the model for five executive programs in other
departments in the School of Public Health and has been emulated by
numerous universities across the county.
Professor Penchansky was a pioneer in research on health maintenance
organizations. His work with colleagues in the 1970s remains some of the
most important research on HMO enrollment choice. He has also authored a
number of papers and research monographs.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Roy Penchansky professor emeritus of health management and policy.
Dwight W. Stevenson, professor of technical communication, College of
Engineering, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1996.
Professor Stevenson received his B.A. degree in 1955 from the University
of Kentucky and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees, in 1957 and 1965, respectively,
from the University of Michigan. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an instructor in 1959 and was promoted to assistant professor in
1965, associate professor in 1970, and professor in 1976. He served as chair of
the Department of Humanities from 1981-84, as director of instructional
television from 1984-89, and as assistant dean for continuing education from
1989-95.  In 1988-89, Professor Stevenson also held the post of acting
executive director of the Michigan Information Technology Network, a
private, nonprofit corporation formed for professional outreach purposes by
the four research universities in Michigan.
Professor Stevenson has authored or co-authored seven books and
numerous journal articles in the areas of technical communication, legal
communication, business communication, and composition. He has concentrated
his research and teaching on making the design of written technical
information meet the needs of diverse users within specific corporate
contexts.  He has also worked extensively on teacher training and the
development of new teaching materials. For eleven years (1975-85), he
co-chaired annual conferences, "Teaching Technical and Professional
Communication," which attracted more than 450 university faculty from all
over the world. In 1993, he received the College of Engineering Excellence in
Teaching Award.
Professor Stevenson has served regularly as a consultant to corporations,
government agencies, and academic institutions in the United States and
abroad. He is the co-author of the Technical English Proficiency Test, which
has been administered to professionals nationally in Japan since 1984 under
an intellectual property agreement among the Regents of the University of
Michigan, Waseda University (Japan), and the Tokyo Center for Language
and Culture. In association with this test, Professor Stevenson regularly
visits Japan, consults with Japanese companies, and co-hosts visitors to the
University of Michigan from Japanese corporations.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Dwight W.
Stevenson professor emeritus of technical communication.
Memorials. Provost Machen noted that a memorial statement for
Professor Betty Jean Jones would be included with the February agenda.
Degrees. There were no actions with respect to degrees this month.

January Meeting, 1997


Consent agenda approved. On a motion by Regent Power, seconded
by Regent Newman, the Regents unanimously approved the consent agenda.
Regent Deitch was away from the table when the vote was taken.
B III Capital Partners, L.P.
Interim Executive Vice President Matthews informed the Regents that
the University had committed $10 million to B III Capital Partners, L.P., as
described in the Regents Communication.
Trinity Investment Management Corporation
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Power, the
Regents unanimously approved adoption of the ValuePlex Strategy offered
by Trinity Investment Management Corporation, as described in the Regents
Communication. Regent Deitch was away from the table when the vote was
taken.
University Housing: Hill Area Community Commons
Vice President Hartford observed that as a residential campus, the
University is committed to providing quality housing and dining facilities for
students to support their academic programs.  In keeping with that
commitment, construction of a new dining commons is being proposed which
would replace four older facilities in the four "Hill area" residence halls. She
called on Mr. William Zeller, director of housing, to present the rationale for
this facility.
Mr. Zeller noted that the proposed facility would fulfill needs in six key
areas: 1) it would eliminate the need for $2-3 million in renovations required
for the current dining facilities; 2) it would require fewer student employees,
alleviating the conditions created by the shortage of students seeking
employment; 3) consolidating four dining centers into one would accrue
savings that would allow amortization of the project cost to be made without
raising room and board rates; 4) the air conditioned new dining center would
enhance summer school and conference programs; 5) it would facilitate
Housing's ability to address changing student dietary needs and eating
habits; 6) consolidation would free up 40,000 - 50,000 square feet of space
which could be used to meet student resident needs.
Mr. Fred Mayer, university planner, then made a presentation
describing the proposed site. He noted that the central location would be
immediately connectable to Mosher Jordan and Alice Lloyd residence halls,
and that it would be possible also to make enclosed connections to Cousins
and Stockwell Halls.
Following Mr. Mayer's presentation, Regent Newman said that if
Cousins and Stockwell were not connected via an enclosed walkway she
would not be able to support the project. She also expressed concern that the
costs for renovating the space that would be vacated by this project had not
been addressed.
Vice President Hartford said that she agreed that there should be
covered walkways to the new facility, and that this would be included in the
219




January Meeting, 1997


instructions to the architects. Mr. Mayer pointed out that an underground
enclosed connector could be readily incorporated in the plan.  Regent
Newman stated that she would not be willing to support the project unless
interior connections with all four residence halls were incorporated as
required aspects of the project.
With regard to use of the vacated space, Vice President Hartford noted
that there are a number of options available. Renovation into student rooms
would pay for itself from the housing revenue that would be generated.
Merely opening the dining halls for study or programmatic space would
engender practically no costs. She stated that there will be no new costs as a
result of this project.
Regent Newman stated that she did not want to be asked in the future
to raise room and board rates to pay for the vacated space. Vice President
Hartford said she understands that and does not plan on making such a
request.
Regent Newman moved approval of the Hill Area Community Commons
Project (residence hall dining facility), including the proposed site and
appointment of Hobbs + Black Associates, Inc., of Ann Arbor as architect
working in association with Perry Dean Rogers & Partners of Boston,
Massachusetts, subject to the understanding that enclosed, indoor connectors
between all of the affected residence halls be included as part of the design.
Regent McFee seconded the motion.
Regent Newman also noted that although it would not be part of her
motion, the record should reflect her comments that there should be no
increase in room and board rates as a result of renovation of the vacated
space.
Regent Power observed that it is important that there be student input
in order to achieve the new facility's goal of having an improved dining
experience for students. Vice President Hartford observed that student
input and decision-making had been sought throughout the development of
this project. She noted that the president of the student Residence Halls
Association was planning to speak in favor of the project during the public
comments session.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Michigan Health Corporation
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved an amendment to the articles of incorporation
for the Michigan Health Corporation in order to comply with a request from
the Internal Revenue Service, as described in the Regents' Communication.
Contract or Purchase Order with TEN Arquitectos
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a contract or purchase order with the architectural
firm of TEN Arquitectos. Because the principal architect and 80 percent owner
of TEN Arquitectos, Enrique Norten, is also a University employee, this


220




January Meeting, 1997


contract is subject to the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and the

on a lump sum payment which will not exceed $200,000. University
personnel will be involved in coordinating the work, supplying
support services and representing the best interests of the University.
3.  The pecuniary interest to Professor Norten is the amount paid for
the services as stated above, because of his ownership interest in
TEN Arquitectos.
Agreement between the University of Michigan and M-Vision, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved an agreement with M-Vision for a
subcontract to assist in a project for which M-Vision has received funding
through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.
Because Sridhar Lakshmanan is both a University of Michigan employee
and the sole owner and shareholder of M-Vision and will also be participating
in this project on behalf of M-Vision, this agreement falls under the state of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided
in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and
M-Vision, Inc.
2.  Terms of the agreement are that Dr. Yi Lu Murphey will receive
$3,000 of her University salary and a graduate student research
assistant will receive salary and tuition support in the amount of
$9,340. The amount of the subcontract to the University is $15,340.
The period of performance is one year.
3.  Dr. Lakshmanan will not play any role in the University's
performance of this agreement.
Agreement between the University of Michigan and Public Data
Queries, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Deitch, the
Regents unanimously approved an agreement between the University of
Michigan and Public Data Queries, Inc., (PDQ) for continuation of the
University's participation as a subcontractor of PDQ for work involved in a
NIH Small Business Technology Transfer (SBTT) award received by PDQ.
Because William Frey is both a University employee and also the vice
president for educational development of PDQ, this agreement falls under
the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information
is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:


221




January Meeting, 1997


1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Public
Data Queries, Inc. (PDQ).
2.  The amount of the subcontract from PDQ is $150,000 and the period
of performance is two years. There are no University employees who
are officers and/or shareholders in PDQ who will play any role in the
University's performance of this agreement.
Revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 11.08
Regent McFee moved approval of a change in Regents' Bylaw Section
11.08 that would expand membership of the executive board of the Horace H.
Rackham School of Graduate Studies so as to include one representative each
from the Flint and Dearborn campuses. Regent Newman seconded the
motion, and following some discussion, it was approved unanimously.
The following is the text of the new bylaw:
Sec. 11.08. The Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies:
The Dean and the Executive Board
The executive function of the graduate school shall be performed by a dean
assisted by an executive board. The executive board shall consist of the dean and
fourteen members to be appointed by the Board upon recommendation by the
president. One of the fourteen shall be from the University of Michigan-Flint and
a second shall be from the University of Michigan-Dearborn. The length of service
for the Flint and Dearborn representatives shall be determined by the campus
provost. The other appointed members shall hold office for terms of three years
each, so adjusted that four vacancies shall occur each year. The dean shall be chair
of the board.
The executive board is empowered to establish divisional boards in the interests
of the subject matter divisions in particular and the graduate school in general.
Henry Russel Awards for 1997
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Power, the
Regents unanimously approved the selection of Kamal Sarabandi, associate
professor of electrical engineering and computer science, and Carla M.
Sinopoli, associate professor of anthropology and associate curator of Asian
archaeology, Museum of Anthropology, to receive Henry Russel Awards for
1997.
Proposed Benefits Reductions at University of Michigan Hospitals
Executive Vice President Matthews informed the Regents that a
proposal for benefits reductions was discussed at the most recent meeting of
the Hospitals Executive Board. He noted that no action had been taken on
this proposal, and no action would be taken prior to Regental review of such
a proposal.
Interim President Neal: Concluding Remarks
Interim President Neal observed that this was the last Regents' Meeting
in which he would be serving as interim president. He thanked the Regents,
executive officers, and the rest of the University community for the
opportunity to serve the University of Michigan during the transition period.
He commented on some of the memorable experiences he'd had as interim
president.
222




January Meeting, 1997


Interim President Neal observed that he had accomplished many of the
goals he had established at the beginning of the transition period. These
include assuring a sense of campus continuity; preserving recent advances
that had been made on campus; capturing new opportunities that may be
presented; acting on key, time-sensitive matters; laying the groundwork for
the new administration; and assisting the Regents with the installation of
the new president.
He said that he and his wife, Jeannie, had a deep passion for the
University of Michigan, and it had been an honor to have been able to serve
his alma mater during the delicate period of transition.
He noted that there is no reason the University of Michigan should not
be the first major research university in the United States to guarantee
research opportunities to all of its students, nor for it not to become the
leader in determining the appropriate structure for academic medical
centers.
Among the challenges that he identified as facing the University are the
identification of shared values and where the University should be going in
the next decade; increasing collegiality; medical center restructuring; paying
attention to the vulnerabilities of the research enterprise; paying attention to
the level of student support; careful implementation of the new value
centered management budgeting system; implementation of the new MIS
("Peoplesoft") system; continuing to look for realistic cost savings within the
university; and redoubling efforts to encourage ethical behavior in the
academy.
Interim President Neal then showed a humorous videotape capturing
his experiences as president.
Following presentation of the videotape, Regent McGowan called
Interim President Neal and his wife, Jeannie, to the table and read the
following resolution:
Resolution in Honor of Homer A. Neal
The Regents of the University of Michigan express their deepest
appreciation to Homer A. Neal as he completes his seven-month term
as interim president on January 31, 1997, and turns his attention to
his first love-high energy physics research.
A recipient of both master's and doctoral degrees in physics from
Michigan, Dr. Neal has served the University with distinction as
professor of physics since 1987, chair of the Department of Physics
from 1987-93, vice president for research since 1993 and, most recently,
as interim president. He has brought to each role his considerable
intellect, integrity, personal warmth, and unfailing good humor.
During his service as interim president, Dr. Neal has been
committed to maintaining Michigan's momentum and ensuring that
the University remains a national leader in higher education. He
has vigorously pursued a number of initiatives, among them an effort


223




January Meeting, 1997


to redefine the nation's government-university research partnership.
On campus, he has presided over a reorganization of the Medical
Center and launched an effort to expand dramatically opportunities
for undergraduate students to work with faculty on research and
other creative endeavors. He has also reaffirmed the University's
commitment to diversity and strengthened communications between
the administration and the University's broad array of internal and
external constituents.
Dr. Neal's wife, Donna Jean, has been equally committed to
Michigan, fostering collegiality and a sense of community by hosting
scores of ceremonial and social events at the President's House and
Inglis House. She also has served on the Faculty Women's Club board
and been active in the community as a member of the Washtenaw
County Advisory Board of the United Negro College Fund, the Ann
Arbor chapter of Links, Inc., and the Ann Arbor Women's City Club.
With admiration and deep gratitude for their numerous
contributions to the University, and particularly for the insights and
solid leadership they have provided during the period between the
administrations of Michigan's eleventh and twelfth presidents, the
Regents extend their congratulations and best wishes to Homer and
Donna Jean Neal.
There followed a round of applause.
Regent McFee told Interim President Neal that
You have performed the interim function with extraordinary
sensitivity and capability. Not knowing how long the interim would
be, you came forth with enthusiasm and energy, held us all together
and gave us a sense of steady as she goes through the several
months of the search for a permanent president. Throughout these
months, you have served this University with creativity and grace,
ably assisted by Jeannie, and have been exceptionally helpful in
communicating with Lee Bollinger to provide continuity and
ongoing initiatives and yet maintain an open door through which
Lee can pass as he begins his administration. I add my individual
thanks to our collective thanks.
Regent Newman expressed thanks to Interim President Neal and
Jeannie Neal for taking over during a difficult time and doing an
extraordinary job.
Regent Horning added that "the job was done with a great deal of grace
and dignity, and we appreciate it."
Regent Power observed that
This University couldn't have been better served by you and
Jeannie with the grace and dignity and good humor and warmth
and integrity which you brought to the delicate matters of continuity
and of maintaining momentum, and the delicate matters of
facilitating the transition to a new administration, and especially
224




January Meeting, 1997


for the special quality that both of you have of very carefully
disguised passionate loyalty and goodwill for this university.
Regent Deitch recounted a scene in the Old Testament between
Abraham and his son, Isaac, in which God asked Abraham to make a great
sacrifice, to which Abraham replied, "Here I am." He said there is always a
time when great people step up in the service of great institutions. "You and
Jeannie have done that and we are very grateful to you."
Interim President Neal thanked everyone for their comments. There
followed a ten minute break, after which the meeting reconvene to hear
Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following people, on the topics
indicated: Elaine Simms, staff member, speaking on behalf of the UM
Commission for Women about the benefit redesign proposal at University of
Michigan Hospitals; Ilona Cohen, student and president of the campus
chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, on the practice of giving
invocations and benedictions at campus ceremonies; and Randall Juip,
student president of the UM Residence Halls Association, on the proposed
consolidated dining center for the Hill area residence halls.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 4:30 p.m.
The next meeting is scheduled for February 20-21, 1997. Regents expenses
during the month of December 1996 totaled $4,192.00.

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, February 20, 1997
The Regents convened at 2:40 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Horning, Maynard, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Interim Executive Vice
President Matthews, Provost Machen, Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford,
and Kinnear, Acting Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellors Nelms and
Renick, and Secretary Palmer. Regent Deitch joined the meeting at 4:05 p.m.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and noted that Regent
Power had an item of business to bring forward. Regent Power read the
following statement:
At their meeting on October 1, 1996, the Regents stated that they
had forwarded the various employment agreements executed between
former President Duderstadt and various executive officers to independent counsel "for review of their circumstances." The Regents have
been informed by counsel that these agreements are legally binding
undertakings by the University of Michigan. The Regents intend to
respect this legal opinion.
Two executive officers, Dr. Harrison and Dr. Kinnear, have
informed the Regents they intend not to exercise the provisions having
to do with administrative leave that were contained in the employment
agreements executed between them and Dr. Duderstadt. Dr. Womack
has announced that his retirement furlough from the University will
begin on March 1, 1997, ending with his retirement from the University
on February 28, 1998. The Regents look forward to working with
President Bollinger to develop a modern and explicit compensation
policy for executive officers.
Regent McGowan observed that she had not had an opportunity to
formally join in the statement, which appeared to have been made on behalf
of the full Board. Regent Power responded that he had not meant to suggest
that any individual Regents were either associated with the statement or not
associated with it.
Regent McFee associated herself with Regent Power's statement and
observed that this year marks the beginning of the seventh year of her
eight-year term as Regent. She noted that during this time many University
officials and Board colleagues have come and gone. She recognized the
people with whom she has served and with whom she anticipates continuing
to serve, especially her colleagues on the Board and the current executive
officers with whom she has worked most closely. She recognized Vice
President Hartford, Chancellors Renick and Nelms, Secretary Palmer, Vice
President Harrison, Vice President Kinnear, Provost Machen, and Vice


227




February Meeting, 1997


President Neidhardt, thanking them all for continuing to serve the
University. She also welcomed President Bollinger.
Regent Power said that he appreciated Regent McFee's recognition that
during a difficult and complicated time of transition, the University had
continued to move forward thanks in great part to the executive officers and
others, and thanks also to Interim President Homer Neal, who had
"managed his responsibilities with grace and dignity."
General Remarks: President Bollinger
President Bollinger noted that he would be addressing two issues:
executive compensation and Medical Center issues.
Executive   Compensation.      President Bollinger distributed the
following statement regarding executive officer compensation and noted that
he would be requesting Regental endorsement of the statement:
I set forth below the general principles I intend to follow in
making contracts with executive officers. These principles may perhaps
seem stringent, but I can assure you they are perfectly normal in the
academic world. I present these to you to seek your endorsement.
The University of Michigan is prepared to compensate executive
officers at the general market rate. To the greatest extent possible, all
compensation should be in the form of salary and benefits. The
administration must be alert to public misunderstandings arising
from non-salary forms of compensation. Normally, executive officers
should serve at the pleasure of the president, with terms designating
times for review of performance. With respect to paid leaves, there is a
marked difference between faculty and non-faculty administrators.
Non-faculty administrators are not entitled to receive such leaves.
They are, however, entitled to notice of termination (generally up to six
months), provided they are not being terminated for cause. For faculty
administrators the situation is more complex. Upon assuming an
administrative office, faculty administrators should retain whatever
sabbatical rights they may have accrued. In order for faculty administrators to return successfully to teaching and research at the
conclusion of their administrative service, it may also be desirable to
provide a sabbatical leave for that purpose. Under no circumstances,
however, should the amount of paid sabbatical leave, including both
accrued sabbatical time and leave added during administrative
service, exceed one year. With respect to paid leaves, it is important to
remember at all times that these are extended solely for traditional
University purposes, namely to allow time for development and
completion of research and preparation for teaching.
When a non-faculty administrator is reassigned within the
University, he or she should be compensated at the market rate for that
position. If the new salary is significantly less, the administration
may gradually adjust the salary downward for up to a period of three
years. With respect to faculty administrators returning to their
academic positions, they should be compensated at the level they would
228




February Meeting, 1997


be at if they had not entered administrative service. Here, too, when
the new faculty salary is significantly less, the administration may
gradually adjust the salary downwards for up to a period of three
years.
Finally, there are two policies that, while self-evident, probably
require restatement: annual raises should be awarded only for
meritorious performance; and I will discuss with the Regents all
contracts and annual salary increases before they are executed.
President Bollinger observed that this policy follows the basic principle
that in order to hire the best people, the University must be prepared to
compensate them accordingly. To the greatest extent possible, compensation
should be made in terms of salary, as opposed to other forms of
compensation. He noted that almost always, he will want an executive
officer to serve at the pleasure of the president, as is the case at many other
institutions. He pointed out that leaves are difficult because it is too easy
outside the academic world to see sabbaticals as paid time off, and this is not the
case. To have a general paid leave policy causes confusion; therefore a
distinction is made in the policy between faculty and non-faculty administrators,
and the latter are not entitled to paid leaves.
Faculty members who become administrators will not lose accrued
sabbatical time, and they also may need to have additional sabbatical time
extended to them when they leave the administration. The maximum
amount of sabbatical time for such a faculty member, however, should be one
year. Following their administrative service, faculty members would return
to the faculty compensation scale at which they would have been had they
remained fully productive faculty members, with a three-year period being
allowed to adjust the scale downward if that were indicated. The same would
apply for non-faculty administrators who are reassigned within the University.
In response to a question from Regent McGowan on whether employment
agreements would be made public, President Bollinger noted that he had not
consulted with legal counsel on this issue. However, his intent would be to
make the specifics of agreements with executive officers available to the
public on the assumption that they legally would be subject to FOIA; that is,
to be forthcoming in making them publicly available. He emphasized,
however, that because he had not consulted with counsel on this question, he
was hesitant to commit the University at this point to such disclosure.
Regent McGowan stated that her own preference would be to be as
forthcoming as possible. President Bollinger concurred.
Regent McFee raised the issue as to whether the compensation policy
should be in the form of a Regental policy or whether it should be
incorporated into the Regents' Bylaws. President Bollinger expressed the
view that it would be better kept at the level of a policy rather than as part
of the bylaws.
Regent Newman expressed her complete support for the compensation
policy. She noted that the current bylaws grant the president the authority


229




February Meeting, 1997


to establish such a policy, and that her preference would be to retain the
policy as a policy, rather than as a part of the bylaws.
Regent Horning also expressed support for the policy as having clearly
defined the notions of furloughs, sabbaticals, and leaves and their use in a
public university.
Regent Power clarified that according to this policy, the phrase "administrative leave" has no place. President Bollinger agreed, noting that leaves can
only be given for the purposes of research and teaching, as is the case with
sabbatical leaves. He also pointed out that this practice has a long history at
the University of Michigan.
Regent Power moved endorsement of the executive officer compensation
policy, as set forth by President Bollinger. Regent Horning seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan Medical Center Academic Plan. President
Bollinger reported that he has met with a number of groups and individuals
associated with the Medical Center and has also talked with individuals
outside the University about medical issues. One major issue involves whether
the University should continue to work on developing a marketing strategy for
the Medical Center. He believes that this work should continue while the
search for the executive vice president for medical affairs (EVPMA) is
underway. He has emphasized to individuals within the Medical Center that
they should be making judgments about academic quality and trying to
retain and recruit good faculty members. To that end, a $3 million fund has
been set aside to be used for developing an academic plan to retain and
recruit the best faculty, which he believes is extremely important from an
academic perspective.
Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs (EVPMA). President
Bollinger observed that the major question regarding the EVPMA is the
relationship of this position to the chief financial officer (CFO) and to the
provost. He stated that the EVPMA will have power over the business
operations and the academic side of the medical center, giving the person
"enormous authority and responsibility from both parts of the institution."
Regarding the relationship with the CFO, he noted that the EVPMA will
have no responsibility for matters such as managing the Medical Center's
endowment. However, the person will be responsible for decisions encompassing
which business courses are to be taken by the Medical Center. In these
matters, the EVPMA will report to the president, while maintaining ongoing
discussions with the CFO and keeping the CFO informed of the actions
taken. Thus, an important qualification for EVPMA candidates will be the
ability to work collegially with other administrators.
President Bollinger emphasized that the CFO would be involved in
issues brought to the president by the EVPMA regarding the Medical Center,
because of the CFO's University-wide responsibilities and expertise.
Regarding the EVPMA's relationship with the provost, President
Bollinger stated that the EVPMA will report to the provost on promotions,
tenure, appointments, and other academic matters, with the provost reporting
230




February Meeting, 1997


to the president on those matters. Responsibility for the Medical School
budget allocation would remain with the provost. On matters of academic
direction, the EVPMA would function much like a dean, retaining almost
exclusive authority. Issues regarding the duplication of administrative functions
and offices in the Medical Center and the rest of the University, i.e., the extent
that the Medical Center will become a separate institution, have not yet been
determined. The other major issue that remains undecided is whether the
EVPMA should also be dean of the Medical School.
Regent McFee requested that the Regents continue to be kept informed
and involved in discussions of these issues. President Bollinger reiterated
that this is his intention.
Report on University of Michigan Radio and Television Stations
Vice President Harrison called on Mr. Donovan Reynolds, director of
broadcasting at Michigan Radio. Mr. Reynolds reported that in the past twelve
months, Michigan Radio's income, audience, and morale have improved.
Following the change to a news and information format in July 1996, the station
has achieved a positive operating balance, has had the most successful fund
drive in its history, has greatly expanded its contributor base, and has received
a number of new, externally-funded grants. Mr. Reynolds concluded the report
by giving a slide presentation about Michigan Radio.
Following Mr. Reynold's presentation, Chancellor Nelms noted that there
will be a presentation about WFUM-TV, the public television station that
broadcasts from the Flint campus, at the May meeting on the Flint campus.
Audited Financial Reports for WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM and WFUMTV for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1996; WFUM-TV and WUOM/
WVGR/WFUM-FM Statements of Support, Revenue and Expenditures
(Operating Fund) for the Years Ended June 30, 1996 and 1995
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved the audited financial reports for WUOM/
WVGR/WFUM-FM and WFUM-TV for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996.
Vice President Harrison noted that the University also has two active
student broadcast stations: WCBN radio and WLLV television.
School of Nursing Faculty Practice Plan
Provost Machen introduced Dean Ada Sue Hinshaw, who noted that the
purpose of the practice plan is to create practice opportunities for the full-time
faculty of the School of Nursing, as described in the Regents Communication.
Regent Horning moved approval of the Nursing Faculty Practice Plan.
Regent Taylor seconded the motion. Regent Power requested that the
Regents be kept informed as various aspects of the faculty practice plan are
implemented, and Dean Hinshaw agreed. The vote was then taken, and the
motion was approved unanimously. Regents Newman and Maynard were
away from the table when the vote was taken, and Regent Deitch was absent.

February Meeting, 1997


There followed a ten minute break, beginning at 3:55 p.m. Regent
Deitch arrived at 4:05 p.m.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the
topics indicated:  Elaine Simms, staff member and co-chair of the UM
Commission for Women, on the proposed paid time off plan for the
University Health System; Dorma Burnside, student, on the high cost of
tuition; Chetly Zarko, citizen, personal views on University issues; and Derek
Faust, student and general manager of WCBN radio, on the campus broadcasting network.
The meeting resumed following Public Comments.
Leave of Absence for Professor John D'Arms
Provost Machen observed that there is a Regents Communication
requesting a two-year leave of absence for John H. D'Arms, Gerald F. Else
Professor of Classical Studies and History. The purpose of the leave is to
allow him to serve as president of the American Council of Learned Societies,
which he described as "the preeminent private humanitarian organization in
the United States." Provost Machen said it is an honor for both Professor
D'Arms and the University of Michigan for him to have been selected for this
position.
Regent Power moved approval of a two-year leave of absence for
Professor John H. D'Arms, effective September 1, 1997. Regent Newman
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan Health System Paid Time Off Program
President Bollinger called on Executive Vice President Matthews, who
observed that the purpose of this proposal is to bring the University of
Michigan Health System more in line with other health centers with regard
to the issue of paid time off. He called on Ms. Laurita Thomas, director of
medical campus human resources, to describe the proposal.
Ms. Thomas gave a slide presentation comparing the University's
current and proposed plans with those at other area health centers. She
noted that the objectives of the paid time off plan are increased flexibility,
increased productivity, decreased costs, and fewer unscheduled absences.
She reviewed the components of the proposed program, noting that it
would replace the current vacation, sick and season day plans with a
comprehensive Paid Time Off (PTO) program of 20-32 days per year,
depending on seniority and exempt/nonexempt status. It would allow staff to
"sell back" 5-10 unused days per year and require that the extended sick
time plan be used only for illnesses lasting longer than 10 days or those
which are chronic or recurring, including pregnancy. She noted that the
extended sick time plan is unique in the health care arena. The PTO proposal
is slightly better than other plans in the market area, and is expected to save
$1 million to $3 million, depending on how many days people sell back.


249




February Meeting, 1997


Following her presentation, Ms. Thomas responded to questions from
the Regents about the proposal. Then, there being no further questions,
Regent Deitch moved authorization for the University of Michigan Health
System to modify employee paid time off plans as recommended by the
UMHS Combined Paid Time Off Project Team. Regent Newman seconded
the motion, and several Regents complimented Ms. Thomas for having given
an excellent presentation. Regent Maynard observed that she had had
serious reservations about the program, but that the presentation had
clarified the issues and responded to her concerns. The vote was then taken,
and the motion was approved unanimously.
Executive Session Motion
Regent McFee read the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202 and 1996 PA 464, I move that the Board of Regents meet
in closed session on February 20, 1997, in the Regents' Room, for the
purpose of consulting with our attorney regarding trial or settlement
strategy in connection with specific pending litigation.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then continued in executive session.
Friday, February 21, 1997
The Regents convened at 9:10 a.m. in the Regents Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Deitch, Horing, Maynard, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Interim Executive
Vice President Matthews, Provost Machen, Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford,
and Neidhardt, Chancellors Nelms and Renick, and Secretary Palmer. Regent
Horning arrived shortly after the start of the meeting; Vice President Kinnear
was absent.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and called on Vice President Hartford.
1997-98 University Residence Hall and Family Housing Rates
Vice President Hartford introduced William Zeller, director of housing.
Mr. Zeller and Vice President Hartford gave a slide presentation describing
the University housing operation and the distribution of the Housing
Division's $62.3 million budget. He noted that 30 percent of the budget goes
toward wages and salaries, 25 percent for dining services, 15 percent for
building services, and the remainder is distributed across a variety of
categories.  He also pointed out that the Housing Division provides
employment for more than 1,500 students.
The recommended residence hall and family housing rates call for an
average rate increase of 4 percent for residence halls and 3.9 percent for
apartments, which includes a 3 percent inflationary increase to maintain
current programs and services and an additional 1 percent increase to meet
debt service requirements for residence hall and family housing projects
250




February Meeting, 1997


previously approved by the Regents. He displayed a chart indicating that
the proposed rates are second highest among Big Ten institutions and in the
middle of those at the University's peer institutions.
Following the presentation, Vice President Hartford and Mr. Zeller
responded to questions from the Regents. Regent Newman noted that last
year she had requested that the Housing Division identify ways in which it
was conserving costs and asked for a review of what has been done in this
regard. Vice President Hartford responded that the division has been
working actively to reduce costs and noted that utilities is one area in which
good progress has been made. Mr. Zeller noted that his department has
undergone a strategic planning process which has actively addressed issues
of cost, particularly in the areas of staffing, utilities, and financing. Regent
Newman noted that privatization was another area which they had agreed to
investigate.
Vice President Hartford reported that they have looked into
privatization in the area of food service. But this proved to be unworkable
due to security issues created by the desire of private companies wanting
their services to be available to the public. She noted that Housing staff has
been cutting costs in another way by funding renovations internally without
passing these costs on to students.
Regent Deitch asked what the goals are for making the residence hall
experience more meaningful. Vice President Hartford responded that among
their goals are to reduce crowding in residence halls and to create more
opportunities for active learning. Regent Deitch raised the issue of working
with the private sector to create additional student housing opportunities.
Vice President Hartford noted that student affairs staff have begun exploring
this option as a means of expansion.
Regent Deitch suggested that because the crowding issue is acute, it
would be advisable to give more thought to the private sector approach, and
he would like to have the issue discussed with the Board at the appropriate
time. Regent Power expressed agreement with this, and said he would
welcome a session in which the Board could discuss with Housing Division
personnel long-term objectives related to such issues as quality of life,
alleviating overcrowding, costs, and privatization.
Regent McFee pointed out that the current food service operation
provides a large number of employment opportunities for students.
Regent Taylor observed that the ratio of residents to employees in the
residence halls is about five to one, and there is no way to evaluate this
figure and other information without benchmark data to compare it against.
Vice President Hartford responded that they would try to provide as much
data as possible, although it isn't readily available. Regent Taylor said that
with benchmark data, it would be possible to set goals in each area, and then
evaluate costs against these goals. The information being provided currently
provides no basis for comparison.
Vice President Hartford noted that the field of higher education is just
beginning to incorporate bench marking as a tool in financial analysis, but
251




February Meeting, 1997


that her office would provide this information as it becomes available.
Regent Taylor responded that he would need to see such data when being
asked to support fee increases in order to be able to assess whether sufficient
efforts have been made to decrease costs.
Regent Deitch moved approval of an average rate increase of 4 percent
for residence halls and 3.9 percent for apartments for the 1997-98 academic
year, according to the schedule in the Regents Communication. Regent
Power seconded the motion, and it was approved, with Regents Deitch,
Maynard, McFee, McGowan, Power, and Taylor in favor and Regents
Horning and Newman opposed.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted minutes of the January 1997
meeting and revised minutes of the September 1996 meeting. Associate Vice
President Herbert explained the reason for the proposed revision of the
September 1996 minutes, noting that the original version had been silent on
the treatment of capitalization for the Michigan Health Corporation Business
Plan, which had been explicitly stated at the meeting, and it is important
that the minutes reflect this.
Reports. Executive Vice President Matthews submitted the following
reports: Investments, Plant Extension, Litigation, and Personnel-Labor
Relations.
Vice President Neidhardt submitted Projects Established and Current
Research and Sponsored Projects. Vice President Neidhardt also announced
that the University had received one of ten awards from the National Science
Foundation recognizing universities that have outstanding records of
achievement in the integration of research and undergraduate education in
science, mathematics, and engineering. The Faculty Governance Update was
also submitted.
Voluntary Support. The Report of Voluntary Support had been
submitted the previous day by Vice President Kinnear.
Personnel Actions/Personnel Reports. Provost Machen submitted
a number of personnel actions and personnel reports. He noted that among
the personnel actions were seven recommendations for Thurnau Professorships.

Her extensive knowledge of the basic sciences enabled Ms. Mahony to be
an especially effective medical reference librarian. She understood the nature
and complexity of users' questions and often responded not only with the
information that was requested, but also with a mini-lesson on the use of the
medical literature. Ms. Mahony served as the liaison to the College of
Pharmacy and worked on the development of the pharmacy collection within


258




February Meeting, 1997


the library. Her wide-ranging skills also led to temporary assignments as
acting head of interlibrary loan and as assistant dentistry librarian. She is
known for her commitment to users, her flexibility and willingness to do
whatever tasks needed to be done, and her consistent dedication to excellence.
Drawing on her background in small libraries, Ms. Mahony served as
extramural coordinator for the Kentucky-Ohio-Michigan region of the
national medical library network, providing outreach to the region's hospital
libraries. She was certified by the Medical Library Association and was
awarded membership in the MLA Academy of Health Information
Professionals.
During her twenty years at Taubman, Ms. Mahony approached each
challenge with grace and good humor, setting a positive example for her
colleagues. Her commitment to excellent service and her broad-ranging
understanding of the library have long benefited campus scholars and
co-workers alike.
The Regents now salute this dedicated staff member by naming Doris D.
Mahony associate librarian emerita.
Alfred L. Nuttall, professor of otorhinolaryngology, retired from active
faculty status on July 31, 1996, after a most productive career as a teacher
and researcher.
Professor Nuttall received his B.S.E.E. degree from the Lowell
Technology Institute in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1965, and his M.S.
(bioengineering), M.S.E.E., and Ph.D. degrees from the University of
Michigan in 1967, 1968, and 1971, respectively. He joined the staff of the
University of Michigan in 1964 as an instructor in otorhinolaryngology and
was promoted to assistant professor in 1976, associate professor in 1981, and
professor in 1987. Professor Nuttall has earned an international reputation
as a superb and careful scientist, having developed major new programs of
research that have received continuous support through NIH and private
foundation grants.  Since 1994, his NIH award has been designated a
"Claude Pepper Award" by the National Institutes for Deafness and Other
Communication Disorders.
Professor Nuttall's creativity, persistence, and motivation led to the
development of major new technological advances for intravital microscopy
studies of the inner ear which allowed the application of image enhancement
and computerized analysis of inner ear blood flow. His studies have identified
major neural systems that control inner ear blood flow, and have led to new
treatment regimes to improve inner ear blood flow and to prevent
vascular-based sensorineural hearing loss. Professor Nuttall also developed
the technology of intracellular recording in outer hair cells of the inner ear, as
well as new systems for analysis of the active micromechanical characteristics
of the inner ear. His work has clearly defined the range of limits of linearity
of inner ear function and has shed new light on the mechanisms underlying
active processes that are essential for the sensitivity and dynamic range of
hearing in mammalian systems. He has published more than 250 papers and
chapters based on his research, and his work has received international
recognition.
Professor Nuttall is leaving the University of Michigan to become the
director of a new research program in Oregon. His career has reflected most


259




February Meeting, 1997


favorably on the training he received and the research environment he helped
to create at the University of Michigan.
The Regents now    salute this distinguished health educator and
investigator for his dedicated service by naming Alfred L. Nuttall professor
emeritus of otorhinolaryngology.
Daniel Sinclair, professor of physics, retired from active faculty status
on May 31, 1996.
Professor Sinclair received his B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees, in 1954 and 1957,
respectively, from the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He came to the
University of Michigan in 1957 as an instructor in physics and was promoted
to assistant professor in 1959, associate professor in 1962, and professor in
1966. He served as chair of the Department of Physics from 1972-77.
Professor Sinclair has collaborated with Professor John C. van der Velde
and others on a number of outstanding experiments, including research on
muon-electron universality in K decays using the liquid xenon bubble
chamber and studies of proton-deuteron and pi-proton, pi-deuteron
interactions. Beginning in 1960, Professor Sinclair and his colleagues worked
on the design and construction of the 40-inch freon bubble chamber, which
had a productive lifetime at the Argonne. Following completion of the
Fermilab accelerator, he and his colleagues joined others working with the
hydrogen bubble chamber on the study of high energy neutrino-proton and
anti-neutrino nucleon interactions.
In the 1980s, Professor Sinclair was a founder of the IMB collaboration,
which built a detector in a salt mine near Cleveland to search for proton
decay. No proton decay was seen, which was a significant result, and the
experiment established important lower limits to the proton lifetime. In
February 1987, the IMB detector observed signals from the interaction of
neutrinos from the 1987A Supernova, and in 1989 Professor Sinclair was a
co-winner of the Rossi Prize from the American Astronomical Society. The
detection of neutrinos, one of the outstanding astrophysical observations of
recent years, was the first observation of anything other than electromagnetic
radiation from a source outside the solar system, yielding the first
experimental confirmation of the theory of supernova production and stellar
collapse.
Recently, Professor Sinclair has been collaborating with colleagues on
cosmic ray studies with the CASA-MIA Extensive Air Shower Array in Utah.
An objective of this cosmic ray program is to seek evidence for point-sources
of cosmic rays. This work is still underway.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physicist and educator by
naming Daniel Sinclair professor emeritus of physics.
Memorial Statements. Two memorial statements, including one for
Professor Betty Jean Jones, were submitted for adoption.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death on January 9, 1997, of Betty Jean Jones, associate dean
for recruitment and support at the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies and professor of theatre, School of Music.
Dr. Jones was born on December 11, 1949, in Albany, Georgia. She
received her B.A. degree in English and drama from Bennett College in


260




February Meeting, 1997


Greensboro, North Carolina, earned her M.F.A. degree in drama from the
University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1978, and in 1983 was awarded
her Ph.D. degree in American theatre and drama by the University of
Wisconsin. From 1982 until August, 1994, Dr. Jones served as director of
graduate studies for theatre and coordinator of teacher education in theatre
at the University of North Carolina. In the fall of 1993, she was guest
professor in the Department of Theatre and Drama at the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas. From the fall of 1994 until the time of her death, Dr.
Jones was professor of theatre at the University of Michigan, with a focus on
teaching, directing, dramaturgy, and American theatre studies.
Dr. Jones was a much-loved faculty member. Theatre department chair
Erik Fredricksen has described her as "a remarkable, energetic, and
passionate teacher, director, and friend of students...a most first-rate, honest,
and valued colleague." An active theatre professional, Dr. Jones directed over
two dozen stage productions. In April 1996, she directed a production of The
Tooth of Crime by Sam Shepard for the UM's Department of Theatre and
Drama. A specialist in American theatre and drama with an auxiliary
emphasis in American film studies, she had numerous articles published in
major books and journals in the United States and abroad. Dr. Jones was also
an invited panelist at noteworthy symposia in Belgium, the People's Republic
of China, Germany, and Sweden. Most recently, she had been working
toward mounting a major production of a Eugene O'Neill play at the UM in
conjunction with the Jiangsu Art Theatre of China.
In her administrative role at Rackham, Dr. Jones was the first associate
dean to be charged with representing the arts and humanities. As associate
dean, Dr. Jones had particular responsibility for oversight of the graduate
school's programs for recruitment and retention of students and for student
support. She led and actively participated in the graduate school's efforts to
recruit underrepresented students, assisting staff in developing contacts with
other colleges and universities and with Rackham alumni. Her colleagues in
Rackham appreciated her many personal attributes, her theatrical expertise,
and her fine leadership. Even more critical was her sure leadership during a
period in which affirmative action was being questioned and programs
scrutinized. To this, Dr. Jones brought great moral courage, a clear sense of
long-term goals, and a refreshing combination of candor and political
sensitivity.
Dr. Jones will be sorely missed by those who had the privilege of
knowing her. She had a remarkable and wide-ranging presence in the
theatre department, the graduate school, and in the many places she touched
in the University. She compellingly merged a voice for social justice and
inclusiveness with the scholarly agenda of the University in the arts and
humanities, never forgetting the road she had traveled and reaching out to
bring others with her on the path to achievement. She was a model and a
leader for students, faculty, and staff. Her sudden and premature death is an
incalculable loss for the University community. As we mourn the loss of this
distinguished scholar and gifted artist, we unite in extending our condolences
to Dr. Jones' father, Silas; her sisters, Anita, Mildred, and Patricia; and the
rest of her family.


261




February Meeting, 1997


The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death on February 2, 1997, of Kenneth Allin Luther, professor
of Persian studies.
Professor Luther was born on January 22, 1934, in Denver, Colorado.
He obtained his B.A. degree at the University of Florida in 1955, his M.A.
degree at Princeton University in 1959, and his Ph.D. degree from Princeton
University in 1964. He was a reserve officer in the military from 1955-63 in
Army intelligence and security. He began his professorial career in 1962 as
an assistant professor of Persian and Arabic at Portland State University. In
1963, he joined the faculty of the University of Michigan as an assistant
professor in the Department of Near Eastern Studies; he was promoted to
associate professor in 1969 and professor in 1973.  His career at the
University included service as director of the Center for Middle Eastern and
North African Studies, membership on numerous University committees, and
outstanding service as the director of admissions and fellowships in the
Department of Near Eastern Studies from 1981-91. In 1969, he was honored
with the University's Distinguished Service Award.
His international stature was evidenced by his election as president of
the American Institute of Iranian Studies. He was also a coordinator for
Peace Corps training, a contributing editor in the area of Saljuq history for
the authoritative Encyclopedia Iranica, and served on many national and
international advisory committees.  During the Iranian crisis, he was
committed to helping Iranian students who were studying in the United
States, and in so doing was instrumental in getting adverse visa regulations
rescinded. He played an important role in educating the public about the
Iranian revolution and gave many free public lectures to local and national
organizations.
Professor Luther focused his scholarship on matters and topics that
filled important gaps in the history of Iran. He cared very much about
details and accuracy in his scholarly contributions. This was reflected in his
teaching, in which his demands for linguistic and historical rigor were
legendary but were also coupled with a gentleness and humaneness that
earned him respect and enormous affection. His former students hold major
positions in leading universities in this country. He lived to help others who
shared his passions, as noted by his weekly Sunday afternoon meetings of the
Persian Poetry Group. We are united in extending our condolences to
Professor Luther's wife Marjory, daughters Anne and Katherine, and son
Kenneth.
Degrees. Provost Machen submitted final degree lists for the December
1996 commencements and changes to previously approved degree lists.
Consent aganda approved. On a motion by Regent Newman,
seconded by Regent Horning, the Regents unanimously approved the
Consent Agenda.
Michigan Minority Business Council Award

The Regents were informed that a commitment of $7.5 million of the
Long Term Portfolio has been made as a follow-on investment in Battery
Ventures IV, L.P., as authorized in May 1994 and as described in the
Regents Communication.
C.C. Little Building
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent McFee, the
Regents unanimously approved renovation of the second floor of the C.C.
Little Building, as described in the Regents Communication.
Herbert H. Dow Building Addition
Executive Vice President Matthews noted that the College of Engineering
is proposing to erect a three-story addition to the Herbert H. Dow Building
to accommodate research laboratories and faculty offices needed by the
Departments of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering.
He introduced Dean Stephen Director, who gave a presentation illustrating
features of the proposed project and describing its rationale. He noted that
although funding for the building is available, the facility nevertheless
presents a good opportunity for donor support. Mr. Frederick Mayer,
university planner, then presented drawings of the site plan and renderings
illustrating how the structure will fit in with the current building.
Regent Horning pointed out that the facade of the south side of the old
G.G. Brown Building does not match any of the buildings in the surrounding
area and requested that an effort be made to bring that building more into
conformity with the others. Dean Director and Mr. Mayer responded that
they would review the available options.
Following the discussion, Regent Power moved approval of the Herbert
H. Dow Building Addition, as described in the Regents Communication.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
President Bollinger noted that he intends to pay very close attention to
architectural and landscaping issues during his presidency.


263




February Meeting, 1997


Engineering Research Support Building
Mr. Mayer gave a presentation about this proposed building, whose
purpose is to house heavy equipment used in manufacturing-related research
projects in the College of Engineering. He noted that it is to be a utilitarian,
pre-engineered, masonry and steel structure to be constructed on a site
adjacent to other service operations on North Campus.
Following the presentation, Regent Deitch commented on the notable
commitment of Mr. Mayer, Mr. Spradlin, and other staff toward the
improvement of the campus. Regent McFee moved approval of proceeding
with the construction of the Engineering Research Support Building. Regent
Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Parking Services Building
Executive Vice President Matthews stated that this will be a
multiple-use building. It will be used for Parking Services offices currently
housed in other buildings; storage of buses, maintenance, and plowing
vehicles; and Utilities Department shop operations. He called on Mr. Mayer,
who gave a brief presentation about the proposed building.
Following the presentation, Regent McFee moved approval to proceed
with the project for construction of the Parking Services Building, as
described in the Regents Communication. Regent Maynard seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan-Dearborn General Campus Renovation Project
Phase II College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters Building
Executive Vice President Matthews noted that this is a request for the
appointment of the architect for the previously approved College of Arts,
Sciences, and Letters Building. Regent Newman asked for an explanation of
how architects are chosen for University projects. Chancellor Renick and Mr.
Paul Spradlin described the architect selection process, noting that it begins
with a committee that often considers as many as 20-25 architects. This list
is narrowed down to three-five who specialize in the type of building to be
constructed, each of whom is invited to make a presentation to the committee.
Following the presentations, the committee chooses a finalist who is then
recommended to the chief financial officer. The architects must be willing to
work within a fixed fee schedule. All projects are monitored from the start,
usually by the University architect.
Regent Horning moved approval of the appointment of Smith,
Hinchman & Grylls Associates, Inc., as architects for the University of
Michigan-Dearborn College of Arts, Sciences and Letters Building segment of
the General Campus Renovation Project Phase III. Regent McFee seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously. Regent McGowan was away
from the table for this vote and the following two votes.

MARCH MEETING, 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, March 13, 1997
The Regents convened at 1:40 p.m. in the Music Room of the Henry
Ford Estate-Fair Lane. Present were President Bollinger and Regents
Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also
present were Interim Executive Vice President Matthews, Provost Machen,
Vice President Harrison, Vice President Hartford, Acting Vice President
Neidhardt, Chancellors Nelms and Renick, and Secretary Palmer. Regent
McFee and Vice President Kinnear were absent.
President's Report
Searches. President Bollinger called the meeting to order. He noted
that there are a number of searches underway, that he and Provost Machen
are in frequent contact with the search committee chairs, and that good
progress is being made.
Medical Center. Regarding the Medical Center, he reported that the
interim leadership is doing a "tremendous job" and that his goal is to ensure
that there are sufficient resources for the Medical School to be protecting
and building the academic program. It is very important that concerns about
the financial well-being of the hospital not lead to harming "one of the great
academic centers on the campus."
State Relations. President Bollinger also noted that he has been
meeting with legislators and had attended a reception in his honor at the
state capital. He noted that he has found there to be a tremendous love of
the University in Lansing, as well as a sense of the University as one of the
state's great achievements, and a desire on the part of legislators to make
sure it is protected.
Board Issues. President Bollinger noted that at the last meeting, the
Regents had suggested that more data be provided on policy questions. He
announced that Vice President Hartford would respond to this suggestion
with regard to questions raised about residence hall and housing policies at
the last meeting. In reflecting on the more general problem of the Board
obtaining sufficient information to make informed decisions about policy
matters that come before it, he suggested that the Regents consider visiting
another campus once a year to meet with other trustees to see how they
handle issues of common concern and to compare each other's facilities.
Basketball Program. President Bollinger observed that "a thorough,
comprehensive, good faith effort has been made by the University to see
whether there are indeed any violations [of NCAA rules];" that a report and
an investigation to that end, backed by the Big Ten as an independent
observer, has been filed with the NCAA; and that it is now in the hands of


267




March Meeting, 1997


the NCAA. He stated that it is "extremely important that the University be
receptive and open to investigating any credible allegations of wrongdoing on
the part of the athletic program or any other part of the University. We
should be extremely forthcoming when we are faced with challenges to our
behavior, when they are credible." However, he noted that "It is impossible
to respond in that way when the allegations are from unnamed, anonymous
sources." President Bollinger concluded that he wanted to assure the
Regents that a thorough job had been done to this point in trying to uncover
any improper actions.
Vice President Harrison responded to questions from the Regents about
the University's investigations into allegations about the basketball program
that have been made in the press. He emphasized that the University wants
to be absolutely certain that it is running a program that has as high a
degree of integrity as any in the country.
Comments from Chancellor Renick
Chancellor Renick welcomed the executive officers and Regents to the
Dearborn campus. He reviewed some of the campus' accomplishments
during the past twelve months, including the success of the capital campaign
in exceeding its $20 million goal, the presence of a significant number of
construction and renovation projects, record enrollments, externally-funded
grant awards, and national accreditation of the School of Management.
Center for Corporate and Professional Development (CCPD)
Chancellor Renick observed that the campus' noncredit continuing
education efforts have been significantly enhanced by being housed in the
new Center for Corporate and Professional Development. This change
represents a significant aspect of the Dearborn campus' institutional strategy
and is a great source of potential growth. He called on Ms. Saundra Mull,
senior program associate at CCPD, who gave a presentation describing the
CCPD.
Establishment of "Master of Arts in Liberal Studies" Degree Program
at UM-Dearborn
Chancellor Renick noted that the proposed Master of Arts in Liberal
Studies degree program would be the first graduate degree program in the
College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters on the Dearborn campus. In response
to a question from Regent Power, Associate Dean Gerald Moran noted that
the executive committee of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies on the Ann Arbor campus had approved the program.
On a motion by Regent Homing, seconded by Regent Deitch, the
Regents unanimously approved establishment of the Master of Arts in
Liberal Studies degree program at UM-Dearbom.
1996 Report of Investments
Executive Vice President Matthews called on Associate Vice President
Norman Herbert. Mr. Herbert noted that the Long Term Portfolio (LTP)


268




March Meeting, 1997


had been established in 1995 as the investment pool for the University's
long-term, core assets. He pointed out that the assets of the University
Endowment Fund had immediately been transferred into the LTP, and the
other core assets from the University Investment Pool (UIP) and the Veritas
Insurance Corporation had gradually been transferred into it. He noted that
the decision to establish the LTP and to invest all of the University's core
assets into it was the single most important investment decision the
University made in the last decade, and that it will have a significant,
positive, economic impact for the University.
Mr. Herbert reported that in 1996 the UIP and Veritas portfolios had
returned 8.4 percent and 8.1 percent, respectively, and that the LTP had
returned 16.7 percent. He reviewed comparative statistics of the assets and
performance of the University's investment portfolio over the past five years,
and noted that recent alternative asset investment initiatives have begun to
bear fruit. He pointed out that while venture capital and emerging markets
debt investments represent 10 percent of the LTP, in 1996 they accounted
for about one-third of the performance return for the fund as a whole. The
separately-managed Charitable Remainder Trusts had a return of 19.2
percent, and the Donor Pooled Income Fund returned 10.3 percent, which is
consistent with other similar funds with income orientations.
Mr. Herbert then called on Ms. Mary Cove, of Cambridge Associates, the
University's investment consultant. Ms. Cove noted that her comments
would be directed toward the separately distributed report prepared by
Cambridge Associates.
Ms. Cove reviewed the University's long-term portfolio strategy with
regard to asset allocation, common stock management, and alternative asset
investments, as outlined in the handout. She reviewed the achievements of
1996, which included the hiring of several common stock and bond
managers, establishing positions in high quality alternative assets funds, and
increasing investment in inflation-hedging assets.  Initiatives for 1997
include continuing commitments to alternative asset funds, possibly
increasing the University's allocation to alternative assets, continuing to
further diversify the overall portfolio and continuing to focus on real estate,
oil and gas, and commodities as inflation-hedging assets.
Ms. Cove reviewed a chart illustrating how the University's asset
allocations have changed since 1991, and another chart illustrating
investment performance for each of the past five calendar years. The total
return for the Long Term Portfolio for 1996 was 16.7 percent, as compared
to the endowment median of 14.8 percent. The five-year annualized LTP
return of 12.4 percent is greater than the endowment median of 12.2
percent.
President Bollinger noted that the University of Michigan's performance
is modest compared to that of peer institutions, as illustrated on another
chart, and asked whether that was due to structural or policy reasons. Ms.
Cove and Mr. Herbert responded that the University has less exposure to
alternative assets (15.7 percent) than the other institutions (35.9 percent
group mean), largely due to the fact that the others began investing in this


269




March Meeting, 1997


asset class years before the University of Michigan did. They also explained
that although the University has authorized the investment of 30 percent of
the LTP into alternative assets, it takes time to identify opportunities and
then to actually move the funds into these investments. They said that at the
present time, there are no risk-taking, policy-related, or structural issues in
which the University differs from its peer institutions. President Bollinger
noted that none of the peer institutions used for comparison were public
institutions and suggested that it might be worthwhile to have data from
some public institutions as well.
Ms. Cove and Associate Vice President Herbert also responded to questions
about how Cambridge Associates works with its various client institutions.
They noted that institutions have different goals and come from differing
financial situations. They utilize different investment strategies based on a
number of factors, so that they might not want to invest in areas, such as
alternative assets, that are of interest to other institutions. These preferences
all have an impact on the type of advice given by the company. Ms. Cove and
Mr. Herbert assured the Regents that opportunities for the University are not
limited by its association with Cambridge Associates; Mr. Herbert pointed out
that University staff occasionally hear of opportunities independent of
Cambridge, and these individual relationships are important to cultivate and
maintain.
Ms. Cove then reviewed the data in the Cambridge publication about
inflation-hedging investments, noting that commodities tend to outperform
traditional stocks and bonds in times of high inflation and under perform
during times of low inflation. The role of commodities is to serve as a hedge
against inflation and as a means of diversification and to generate short-term
returns. She reviewed the types of investment vehicles available for passive
and active exposure to a commodities index. She also described the structure,
advantages, and disadvantages of real estate investment trusts (REITS) and
responded to questions about this type of investment.
Following the discussion, Regent Power recalled that in the early 1980s,
the University's investments were managed by the trust department of a
bank, with asset allocations weighted very conservatively. He commented on
the enormous change that had occurred since then in the manner in which
the University manages its investments and complimented the treasurer and
his staff for guiding the Board to the point where they are today.
The Regents and president thanked Ms. Cove and Associate Vice President
Herbert for an excellent presentation.
Provost Machen: General Remarks
Provost Machen reported that a lifesaving liver transplant had been performed on a local adolescent the previous day at the University of Michigan
Medical Center.
He also announced that the University had recently received a
significant award from the National Science Foundation to develop its
undergraduate research program. He further noted that the University
intends to participate in the "America Reads" program, which has been
270




March Meeting, 1997


established by President Clinton to provide jobs for work/study students
teaching elementary-aged children how to read.
Provost Machen reported that he and President Bollinger are in the
process of reviewing over 130 requests for promotion and tenure which will
be submitted to the Regents in May.
Co-Interim    General Counsel
President Bollinger called to the table the two individuals recommended
for appointment as the University's new interim co-general counsel: Daniel
Sharphorn and Elizabeth Barry. He noted that Mr. Sharphorn would be in
charge of the day-to-day operation of the office and that Ms. Barry would be
working directly with him and the Regents.
Regent Deitch moved approval of the appointment of Daniel Sharphorn
and Elizabeth    Barry as interim    co-general counsel.    Regent Newman
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

March Meeting, 1997


Retirement Memoirs. Secretary Palmer submitted two retirement
memoirs.
William W. Coon, M.D., professor of surgery, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 1996, after a most productive, 40-year career
as a teacher, clinician, and researcher.
A native of Saginaw, Michigan, Dr. Coon attended The Johns Hopkins
University from 1943-45 and received his M.D. degree from The Johns
Hopkins University Medical School in 1949. From 1949-56, he completed his
internship and surgical residency training at the University of Michigan
Hospitals. During that time, he also spent two years (1953-55) as chief of
surgery at the U.S. Army Hospital in Augsburg, Germany, returning
subsequently to complete his surgical residency.
Dr. Coon joined the University of Michigan faculty as an instructor in
surgery in 1956. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1959, associate
professor in 1962, and professor in 1967. From 1956-62, he was also an
attending surgeon at the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration Hospital, and
thereafter, he served as a consultant. From 1956-64, he was medical director
of the Blood Bank at the University of Michigan Medical Center, where he
continued on as a consultant until 1980. Dr. Coon also served as assistant
director of the Clinical Research Center at the University of Michigan Medical
Center from 1962-86 and was chair of the Institutional Review Board (IRB)
for 25 years, retiring from the position in December 1995.
During his illustrious career, Dr. Coon was a member of many
professional societies and served for 10 years as a member of the editorial
board of the Journal of Surgical Research. He was involved in 122
peer-reviewed publications, 83 of which he was primary author. He was also
the primary author of 28 book chapters.
Dr. Coon has distinguished himself as a nationally recognized authority
in clotting disorders of blood and thromboembolism. His research efforts
were seminal in establishing clinical standards for anticoagulation of
thrombotic venous disorders. He is also a recognized authority on the
management of hematologic diseases with splenectomy.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his
dedicated service by naming William W. Coon professor emeritus of surgery.
Ralph F. Knopf, M.D., professor of internal medicine, Division of
Endocrinology and Metabolism, retired from active faculty status on June 30,
1996, following a long and outstanding career as a teacher, clinician, and
researcher.
Dr. Knopf received his B.S. and M.D. degrees in 1951 and 1954,
respectively, from the University of Michigan. He completed his internship
and a year of medical residency at Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle,
Washington, in 1954-56, where he received the Pfizer Resident Award in
1955. He returned to the University of Michigan in 1956, where he completed
his residency in 1959. He was a fellow in the Division of Endocrinology and
Metabolism from 1959-62 and was appointed instructor in internal medicine
in 1962. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1963, associate professor
in 1967, and professor in 1973.


282




March Meeting, 1997


Dr. Knopf has been a superb clinician and teacher, who is widely
recognized for his extensive knowledge of endocrinology and his teaching
efforts. He has provided endocrinology care to patients in the high risk
pregnancy clinic, has served as co-director for the endocrine diagnostic
laboratory, and was the endocrine sequence coordinator for sophomore
medical students. His outstanding commitment and efforts as a clinician have
provided excellent care to large numbers of patients with diabetes and other
endocrine diseases.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physician for his dedicated
service by naming Ralph F. Knopf professor emeritus of internal medicine.
Memorials. No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees. There were no actions with respect to degrees this month.
Consent agenda approved. On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded
by Regent Maynard, the Regents voted unanimously to approve the consent
agenda.
Audit Report: The University of Michigan Donor Pooled Income
Fund for Years Ended December 31, 1996 and 1995
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved the audit report for the University of Michigan Donor
Pooled Income Fund for Years Ended December 31, 1996 and 1995.
Supplemental Information to the Certified Audited Financial Report
of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics of the University
of Michigan for the Year Ended June 30, 1996
The Regents received supplemental information to the certified audited
financial report of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics of the
University of Michigan for the Year Ended June 30, 1996.
Appointment of Auditors for 1996-97
Interim Executive Vice President Matthews submitted a recommendation
for the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 1996-97, which
would be the eleventh year of this engagement. Regent Newman pointed out
that for each of the past two years the Board had been told that that year
would be the last for this firm, because sound operating procedure dictates
that auditors be rotated every several years. She emphasized that she had no
reservations about the quality of the services provided by Ernst & Young, but
was responding to the administration's own, previously-stated recommendation
and said that she would like to learn the rationale for being asked to go
against this advice.
Interim Executive Vice President Matthews responded that he would
like to present to the Regents an explanation of the search and analysis
process used to choose a new auditor, as well as a plan for moving forward.
Regents Power and Deitch expressed agreement with Regent Newman.
Regent Deitch suggested that a report be presented about the auditor
selection process at the earliest opportunity. Regent Power suggested that it


283




March Meeting, 1997


might be prudent to wait until the new chief financial officer is in place;
however, Regent Newman expressed that she feels strongly that this decision
should not wait until then.
Regent Deitch suggested that since the Board of Regents does not have
an audit committee, it would be prudent for the Regents to understand the
process of audit as it relates to an institution of this magnitude and
complexity. Regent Newman suggested that a subcommittee of Regents
might work with the auditors and then seek advice and input from the rest of
the Board. Interim Executive Vice President Matthews said that he would
respond to the Regents' concerns and suggestions.
There being no further discussion, Regent Power moved approval of the
reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 1996-97. Regent
Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Semiannual Report for Designated Fund, Auxiliary Activities
Fund, and Expendable Restricted Fund
Interim Executive Vice President Matthews submitted a schedule
summarizing the activity in the Designated Fund, Auxiliary Activities
Fund, and Expendable Restricted Fund for the six month periods ending
December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995.
The meeting then recessed at 4:00 p.m. to hear Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Ilona Cohen, student, about the use
of invocations at campus ceremonies, and Matthew Shankin, student and
part-time staff member, about the effect of the proposed UM Health System
benefits redesign proposal on part-time employees.
Friday, March 14, 1997
The Regents met at 9:55 a.m. in the Regents Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McGowan,
Newman, and Power. Also present were Interim Executive Vice President
Matthews, Provost Machen, Vice President Harrison, Vice President Hartford,
Acting Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellors Nelms and Renick, and Secretary
Palmer. Regents McFee and Taylor and Vice President Kinnear were absent.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and noted that Regent
Taylor's absence was due to the crisis conditions created for his employer,
the Detroit Edison Company, by the previous evening's ice storm.
R. Chaney & Partners III, L.P.
Interim Executive Vice President Matthews reported to the Regents
that a follow-on investment of $20.0 million had been made in R. Chaney &
Partners III, L.P., in accordance with previously approved guidelines.


284




March Meeting, 1997


Oak Investment Partners VII, L.P.
Interim Executive Vice President Matthews reported to the Regents that
a follow-on investment of $5.0 million had been made in Oak Investment
Partners VI, L.P., in accordance with previously approved guidelines.
Regents Design Approval Process for Major Projects
Interim Executive Vice President Matthews brought forth a proposal to
enhance communication involving the design of major new projects, under
which a list of design objects would be presented as an "item for
information" in time to allow reaction and receive Regents' comments prior
to the presentation of the final design for approval.
Regents Power and Deitch expressed agreement with the revised
approval process. Regent Deitch observed that new building construction
decisions have important, long-term impacts on the campus, and that this
procedure should aid in the process.
University of Michigan Hospitals Emergency Medicine Office
Renovation
Regent Newman moved approval of the Emergency Medicine Office
renovation, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent Maynard
seconded the motion. Regent Power asked how many square feet the project
involves and the cost per square foot. Interim Executive Vice President
Matthews said that he would obtain that information. Regent Power
requested that in the future, projects such as this include data regarding
square footage and cost per square foot. The vote was then taken, and the
motion was approved unanimously.
Lease Agreement with Brighton Land Group
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved a lease agreement between the University of
Michigan and Brighton Land Group.
Because Dr. Donald Beser and Christine Beser have a 50 percent equity
interest in Brighton Land Group and will also be University employees, this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  The parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and
Brighton Land Group.
2.  Terms of the contract: The duration of the contract will be through
April 30, 2000. The University will lease real property located at
5728 Whitmore Lake Road, Brighton, Michigan 48116. The medical
office facility is 6,210 square feet, at a rental rate of $18 per square
foot, $111,780 annually (for year 1 starting on May 1, 1997). The
Medical Center will place clericals, medical assistants, nurse, and
physicians there to provide necessary ophthalmology medicine
services to the community.


285




March Meeting, 1997


3.  Dr. and Mrs. Besers' pecuniary interest arises from their 50 percent
equity interest in Brighton Land Group. Through Brighton Land
Group, Dr. and Mrs. Beser will receive revenues generated by the
leasing of the property to the University.
Lease Agreement with Barron Associates
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved a lease agreement with Barron Associates.
Because Dr. Parviz Panahi is both a University employee and also holds a
12.7 percent ownership interest in Barron Associates, this agreement falls
under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute, although Regental
approval has already been received for a lease agreement for space in the
same building involving Dr. Panahi. However, Dr. James Adams also holds
an equity interest in Barron Associates and will be a University employee.
Therefore, this agreement is subject to the state of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.  The parties to the agreement will be the University of Michigan and
Barron Associates.
2.  Terms of the contract: The duration of the contract will be through
April 30, 2000. The University will lease real property located at
4810 Clark Road, Ypsilanti, MI. The medical office facility is
approximately 1,700 square feet at a rental rate of $22.50 per square
foot, $38,250 annually (for 3 years starting on May 1, 1997). The
Medical Center will place clericals, medical assistants, nurses, and
physicians there to provide necessary ophthalmology medicine
services to the community.
3.  Dr. Adams' pecuniary interest arises from his 20 percent equity
interest in Barron Associates. Through Barron Associates, Dr.
Adams will receive revenues generated by the leasing of the property
to the University.
Technology Management Program
Regent Newman suggested that a presentation be made to the Regents
about products that have been commercialized through the technology
management program, the revenues that have come back to the University,
and whether there is a potential for improvements.
Vice President Neidhardt responded that his office has formed the
"Industrial Initiative" whose purpose is to review the University's relationship
to industry, both in general and in particular with respect to contract research
and technology transfer. Phase I of the study has been completed, and the
next phase will engender determining how to proceed with the information
gained from Phase I. He also noted that the Technology Management Office is
currently under periodic review, so that the information requested by Regent
Newman is readily available.
President Bollinger suggested that a comprehensive presentation and
discussion of these issues should be scheduled at a later date, after the


286




March Meeting, 1997


completion of the current initiative underway by the vice president for
research.
Proposed    Research    Agreement     between   the   University    of
Michigan and PORT Systems, LLC
Regent Horning moved approval of a research agreement between the
University of Michigan and PORT Systems, LLC ("PORT"). PORT is a joint
venture between the BF Goodrich Company and TSRL, Inc. ("TSRL").
Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Dr. Gordon Amidon is a University employee who also is a director,
officer, and stockholder in TSRL and a director and stockholder in PORT.
John Crison, Elke Lipka, and Yasahiro Tsume are both TSRL and University
employees. Therefore, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the Agreement are the University of Michigan and PORT
Systems, LLC.
2.  The terms of the proposed research contract conform to University
policy. The period of performance is three years at a total cost of
$1,059,656, which amount includes full recovery of the University's
indirect costs.
3.  The work will be performed under the direction of Gordon Amidon,
whose pecuniary interest arises by virtue of his position as director,
officer, and stockholder in TSRL and director and stockholder in
PORT. None of the TSRL employees with University appointments
has any connection with the project on behalf of the University.
Proposed License Agreement with MiTex Solutions, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved a license agreement with MiTex Solutions,
Inc. to practice and commercialize a patented invention developed and owned
by the University of Michigan known as the Generic Cell Controlling Method
and Apparatus for Computer Integrated Manufacturing System ("GCC").
Because James R. Moyne is a University employee and also holds an equity
interest in MiTex Solutions, Inc., this agreement falls under the state of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided
in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and MiTex
Solutions, Inc.
2.  Contract terms include a license issue fee of $zero (i.e., no issue fee is
required). Royalties to the University of 12.5 percent of net sales of
the software that was developed at the University (not less than
$750.00/copy) and 3 percent of net sales of software independently
developed by or for MiTex that implements the patented aspect of
GCC (not less than $200.00/copy). These rates are the same as
included in an agreement in which the same technology has been
licensed to another small corporation that is located in another state.
So long as MiTex has its headquarters and principal place of business


287




March Meeting, 1997


in the state of Michigan, the royalty rates shall be reduced
respectively to 6 percent (not less than $250.00) and 1.5 percent (not
less than $100.00).
Royalty of 20 percent on sublicense revenue.
Non-exclusive right to practice and commercialize the technology.
The University retains ownership.
Minimum annual royalties of $100.00 for 1998 and for 1999; and
$500.00 for 2000 and each year thereafter during the term of the
agreement.
Term of the agreement is for the life of the patent and the copyright,
as applicable.
No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of
University employees, is obligated under the agreement.
3.  Dr. Moyne's pecuniary interest arises from his ownership interest in
MiTex Solutions, Inc. He has waived any personal participation in
the sharing of royalties received by the University from that
company.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan
and Hays-Fisk, L.L.C.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Maynard, the
Regents unanimously approved a license agreement between the University
of Michigan and Hays-Fisk, L.L.C., to practice and commercialize a patented
invention owned by the University of Michigan, known as the Circle to Line
Interferometer System (TMO File #357). Because Professors Paul B. Hays
and Lennard A. Fisk hold an equity interest in Hays-Fisk, L.L.C., this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and
Hays-Fisk, L.L.C., a company in which Professors Paul B. Hays and
Lennard A. Fisk hold an equity interest.
2.  Contract terms include:
A license issue fee of $2,000.00, payable in four $500.00 installments.
Royalties to the University for each system using the Circle to Line
Interferometer System built by or for Hays-Fisk, L.L.C., its affiliates
and sub licensees, varying from $50.00 per system up to $42,500.00
per system, depending upon the system sales price.
Exclusive right to practice and commercialize the technology, subject
to certain rights reserved by the University to practice it for research
and educational purposes. The University retains ownership.
Minimum annual royalties of $500.00 for 1997; $1,000.00 for 1998;
and $2,000.00 for 1999 and each year thereafter during the term of
the agreement.
Term of the agreement is for the life of the patent.


288




March Meeting, 1997


No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of
University employees, is obligated under the agreement.
3.  The pecuniary interest of Professors Hays and Fisk arises from their
ownership interest in Hays-Fisk, L.L.C. Professor Hays is the sole
inventor of the Circle to Line Interferometer System and he has
waived any personal participation in the sharing of royalties received
by the University from the company.
University of Michigan Health System Expansion of Primary Care
Network in Brighton
Regent Newman moved approval of the purchase of six acres of land in
Brighton that will include a new, 41,000 square foot facility to house the
Brighton Health Center, as described in the Regents Communication.
Regent Horning seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
5631 Sugar Bush, Flint, Michigan
Executive Vice President Matthews explained that property located at
5631 Sugar Bush in Flint, Michigan, had been offered to the University by
the estate of Margaret Winegarden, pursuant to a trust agreement executed
by Mrs. Winegarden prior to her death. Regent Maynard observed that the
property is in a marketable location, and said she was pleased that it is
finally coming before the Board because it will be beneficial to the Flint
campus.
Following further discussion, Regent Horning moved that the Regents
accept and authorize the sale of the property at 5631 Sugar Bush, Flint,
Michigan, subject to the environmental due diligence described in the
Regents Communication.    Upon acceptance of this gift property, the
University will obtain its own independent appraisal and sell the property at
or above the appraised value.  The sale proceeds, less any Realtor's
commission, will benefit the Flint Campus. Regent Deitch seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Establishment of the Center for University Outreach at UM-Flint
Chancellor Nelms informed the Regents about the establishment on the
Flint campus of the Center for University Outreach. The purpose of the
center is to utilize University resources to meet the needs of the community
in ways which contribute to the University mission of teaching, research, and
service.
University Housing
Vice President Hartford stated that she and her staff are planning a
number of presentations in response to the concerns that had been expressed
at the last meeting about the need for bench marking data with respect to
University Housing issues. These presentations will include bench marking
data as well as comparable data from other institutions and will cover the
general topics of facilities, occupancy, and financial issues. The presentation
on facilities, which was to have been today, will be delayed due to the
absence of two Regents.


289




March Meeting, 1997


There followed a general discussion about topics which should be
considered, including the situation with regard to rooms that house more
than the intended number of students, the relationship between the
University's housing program and the Ann Arbor housing market, and the
relationship between student housing and the quality of undergraduate
education.
President Bollinger noted that this is a very complicated issue which is
best responded to in several ways, including scheduling discussion times at
meetings, visiting other campuses, perhaps visiting residence halls.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Power made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8e of the Open Meetings Act, as amended
by 1984 PA 202 and 1996 PA 464, I move that the Board of Regents
meet in closed session on March 14, 1997, in the Regents' Room, for
the purpose of consulting with our attorney regarding trial or
settlement strategy in connection with specific pending litigation.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The public portion of the meeting ended at 10:30 a.m. The meeting
continued in executive session, beginning at 10:35 a.m.
Adjournment
The meeting was adjourned at 10:55 a.m. The next meeting is scheduled
for April 17-18, 1997. Regents expenses for February 1997 totaled $2,662.07.
Roberta R. Palmer
Secretary of the University


290




APRIL MEETING, 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, April 17, 1997
The Regents convened at 1:15 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Homing, Maynard, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Interim Executive Vice
President Matthews, Provost Machen, Vice President Harrison, Vice President
Hartford, Acting Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellors Nelms and Renick,
and Secretary Palmer. Regent Deitch arrived shortly after the start of the
meeting; Vice President Kinnear was absent.
Death of Susan Lipschutz
President Bollinger observed that Susan Lipschutz, associate provost, had
died on Sunday, April 13. He said that he had known Susan Lipschutz since his
earliest days at the University, and that he had never met anyone "who was
wiser, who understood the values of the University better, anybody more loyal
to the institution and to the people she worked for, than Susan." He noted that
her death was a huge loss to the institution, and that she had suffered with
enormous dignity the disease she had had for the past several years.
Provost Machen also commented on the extent of Dr. Lipschutz's impact
on the University. He noted that she was to have been recommended for
reappointment for another term as associate provost at this Regents'
Meeting. He said her death "was a great loss to the University and a great
loss to me personally." He noted that a memorial service was being planned
by the University for a later date.
Regent McGowan said that she had been pleased to learn earlier in the
month that Dr. Lipschutz was to be recommended for reappointment. She
recounted that she always looked to Dr. Lipschutz at every Regents' Meeting
for direction, because her judgment was impeccable. Regent McGowan
observed that Susan Lipschutz "was truly one of Michigan's treasures," and
"that we are just beginning to realize how extensive the loss of Susan will
be." She expressed sympathy on behalf of the Board of Regents to Dr.
Lipschutz's husband Dan, their two children, Debbie and David, and her
parents, who survive her.
President's Report
Value Centered Management (VCM). President Bollinger noted that
in a public lecture the previous week, he had said he would be recommending
that the VCM model be modified to incorporate a "tuition follows enrollment"
rule, rather than a "tuition follows credit" rule. This change is being made to
remove some of the tensions and difficulties that have emerged so far in the
implementation of the new system. He observed that although there are still
issues that will need to be addressed as the system is implemented, this type
291




April Meeting, 1997


of budgeting system is widely used in academic institutions and the
University intends to stay with it for the foreseeable future.
Fleming Administration Building. President Bollinger observed
that he had expressed publicly a desire to move his office out of the Fleming
Administration Building. He has asked Mr. Paul Spradlin, interim associate
vice president for business operations, to review the available options. In
due course, he expects to have a proposal to present to the Board of Regents.
Regent McGowan expressed a desire for the Regents to move to the same
location as the president.
Report on Housing Facilities
Vice President Hartford commented that this discussion on housing
facilities would be one of several discussions intended to give the Regents
background to enable them to make informed decisions on major issues that
will be arising in the future. Future discussions will focus on fiscal issues,
such as privatization and cost containment efforts; and occupancy issues,
including the philosophy used for making residence hall assignments, the
minimum acceptable square footage per student, and staffing issues. Benchmarking information will be presented as appropriate.
Vice President Hartford distributed a publication containing facts about
University Housing ("University Housing Fact Kit") and a handout entitled
"Capital Improvements and Facility Renewal" to which she referred for the
remainder of her presentation. She noted that the implementation of the
infrastructure renewal fee has begun to have an effect on the maintenance of
the buildings supported by the General Fund, and that the Campaign for
Michigan has been identified as a means for building new facilities. However,
the Housing Division has not been a recipient of either of these sources of
revenue because it is considered an auxiliary enterprise, which by definition is
to be self-sustaining.
She reported that the Housing operation includes about 4.2 million square
feet of space, which represents about 18 percent of the total University
building space. About $6.5 million per year is allocated to facilities renewal
(1.65 percent of the value of the facilities), including $1 million for furniture.
Industry-wide standards dictate that the renewal budget should be within a
range of 2 percent to 4 percent of the replacement value, depending on the
age of the facilities. For the University of Michigan, this range would be
from $7,860,000 to $15,720,000. The University has requested corresponding
information from eight peer institutions; this data is as yet incomplete.
Vice President Hartford observed that the renewal funds only go toward
keeping the buildings in their current state; they do not address possible
changes that might be made in the use of the space to improve the living/
learning environment. The average age of the residence halls is 39 years; she
noted that these facilities are among the most heavily used on campus. She
also pointed out that construction costs are higher in Ann Arbor than in all
but two other Big Ten cities. She noted that student preferences for lower
density would lead to a reduction in the overall revenue potential in Housing.


292




April Meeting, 1997


In addition, room and board rates cannot be continually increased as a
means of generating funds for improvements in housing facilities.
Vice President Hartford concluded by noting that there are several
possible sources for building renewal: internal cost containment efforts;
budgeted renewal funds; room and board rates; and central University funds,
such as the infrastructure renewal funds.
President Bollinger emphasized that this is only the first of what is
intended to be a continuing, open series of discussions about housing issues,
and opened up the floor for questions.
Regent Newman expressed that she was interested in issues involving
benchmarking and privatization. She also stated that she would like to have
private institutions included in comparison figures. She is interested in
seeing data that demonstrates "why we're getting the best value for the
dollar, and if we're not, where we can get it." She commented that "What I'm
looking for are ways to maintain, improve, or construct new facilities-do
whatever we need to do-on a basis that makes sense from a cost standpoint."
As yet, comparative figures that would allow such an evaluation have not
been obtained.
Vice President Hartford responded that it makes the most sense to use
comparative figures from public institutions, because private institutions do
not compare in size to the University of Michigan.  Regent Newman
emphasized that "we also need to look at innovative things that other
campuses have done or that private industry has done, and compare and
contrast what works for us."
In response to a question from Regent Deitch, Vice President Hartford
stated that surveys have been done of student satisfaction with residence
halls and she would provide that information to the Regents. Regent Deitch
noted that we compete with private universities and that overcrowded
residence halls may not be conducive to good learning and growth experiences.
He believes that improvements are needed in this area, and that innovative
solutions are called for.
Vice President Hartford observed that another issue is how the residence
halls fit into the larger community picture. Discussion is needed about whom
the halls are meant to serve, how students' needs vary as they progress
through the University, and how the residence halls can accommodate those
needs.
President Bollinger observed that the first step in addressing all of these
issues is to gather data, and this discussion is a first attempt at that. He
noted that nearly all major institutions around the country, public and
private, have overcrowded residence halls.
Regent Deitch commented that he doesn't accept that argument.
President Bollinger agreed, but noted his point was only that Michigan was
not unusual in its residence hall situation.
Regent Power called attention to the financial aspects of University
housing, asking why Housing is viewed as a self-contained entity within the
293




April Meeting, 1997


institution rather than as one that pervades every aspect of student life.
Consideration ought to be given to the "basic institutional and financial
arrangements under which housing has been run" for many years at the
University.
Vice President Hartford responded that at Michigan and many other
institutions, General Fund support for housing has been gradually reduced
and then cut entirely, turning the operation into an auxiliary enterprise.
Regent Power pointed out that perhaps looking at the subject of housing in
an entirely different way, rather than as isolated from the rest of the
concerns of the institution, will be beneficial.
Regent Newman observed that she had been hoping that this presentation
would have contained more detailed information, noting that room and board
is a substantial portion of the financial aspect of attending the University.
Following some discussion about plans for upcoming presentations, Vice
President Hartford said that she could present the financial and occupancy
information together.
Regent Deitch stated that he believes the residence halls are "too
crowded and too expensive," and that the crowded conditions run at
cross-purposes to the University's educational mission. Strategies need to be
identified to address this and the whole totality of issues related to it, and it
is time to move forward.
Regent Horning agreed that now is the time to face these issues and
develop strategies to deal with them.
Regent Newman urged that staff should think "out of the box," using
creativity to come up with unique solutions rather than pursue what other
institutions have done.
Regent Taylor added that it will be important to see benchmarking data
based on square footage and costs, along with a vision of what the ideal
would be.
Vice President Hartford observed that it has been difficult to obtain this
information from other institutions, because it has not traditionally been
compiled in the field of higher education.
Michigan Student Assembly Biannual Report
Ms. Fiona Rose, outgoing president of Michigan Student Assembly
(MSA), addressed the Regents about MSA's accomplishments during her
tenure and about issues that are important to students. Among these are
high tuition costs and the need for increased grant and scholarship support
for poor students; the concerns of student parents; the need for faculty to
teach as well as do research; and the increasing size of the freshman class,
which directly impacts the quality of student life.
Following her remarks, the Regents expressed their admiration for Ms.
Rose's accomplishments during her tenure as MSA president.


294




April Meeting, 1997


Vice President Hartford then introduced Mr. Michael Nagrant, newly
elected president of MSA. Mr. Nagrant addressed the Regents about the
need to keep tuition increases to a minimum; to include the "student voice"
in decision-making; to establish an ex officio position for a student regent;
and to increase funding for student groups. He urged the Regents to
continue the partnership that has been developed with MSA to continue to
improve student life on campus.
Executive Session Motion
President Bollinger noted that Public Comments would be held at 4:00
p.m. in the Michigan Union, following the executive session.
Regent Power made the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(c), 8(e), and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act,
as amended by 1984 PA 202 and 1996 PA 464, I move that the Board
of Regents meet in closed session on April 17, 1997, in the Regents'
Room, for the following purposes: conducting strategy and negotiation
sessions connected with the negotiation of a collective bargaining
agreement in which either negotiating party has requested a closed
hearing [Sec. 8(c)]; consulting with the Board's attorney regarding
trial or settlement strategy in connection with specific pending
litigation [Sec. 8(e)]; and considering material exempt from discussion
or disclosure by state or federal statute [Section 8(h)]. Such exempt
material consists of a written opinion from the Board's legal counsel.
There followed a short recess, after which the meeting continued in
executive session from 2:15-4:00 p.m.
Public Comments
The Regents reconvened in the Kuenzel Room, Michigan Union, and
heard comments from the following individuals on the topics indicated: Elaine
Simms, co-chair, Commission for Women, on proposed benefits redesign at
the University of Michigan Medical Center; John Farley, staff member and
Frank Williams, chief steward of UM skilled trades unions, about problems
caused by budget reductions at the Medical Center; Michael A. Edwards,
president, and Elaine McDaniels, bargaining chair of AFSCME 1583, about
concerns with the UMH Laundry Services labor contract; Donald H. Gray,
faculty member, Robert Oppenheimer, citizen, Ronald Holzhacker, student,
and David R. Bassett, emeritus faculty member, about use of the Arboretum
for ROTC training; Audrey Jackson, citizen, about hate speech and racial
intolerance; Paul Marquardt, faculty, about issues regarding the
non-reappointment of visiting and adjunct faculty members; Saboorah
Amatu-Rahmann, citizen, about the "Naked Mile" and the sculpture on the
corner of Glen and Catherine Streets; Jonathan Kazmierski and Angie

The meeting then recessed until the following day.


295




April Meeting, 1997


Friday, April 18, 1997
The Regents met at 9:45 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Bollinger and Regents Deitch, Homing, Maynard, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Taylor. Also present were Interim Executive Vice
President Matthews, Provost Machen, Vice President Harrison, Vice President
Hartford, Acting Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellors Nelms and Renick,
and Secretary Palmer. Vice President Kinnear was absent.
Honorary Degrees
President Bollinger announced that the Honorary Degree Committee
has recommended that honorary degrees be awarded to the following
individuals: Mary Frances Berry, chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
(Doctor of Laws); Robert B. Fiske, Jr., noted trial lawyer (Doctor of Laws);
Sergei Godunov, renowned mathematician (Doctor of Science); and Eugene
Roberts, managing editor of the New York Times (Doctor of Laws). These
degrees are to be awarded at the Spring 1997 Commencement.
Commencement speaker. On behalf of the Regents, Regent Power
invited President Bollinger to give the commencement address at the Spring
1997 commencement, noting that this would be the first commencement
during the first year of his presidency. President Bollinger responded that
he was honored to be asked and would be pleased to accept.
Regent Power moved that honorary degrees be awarded to Mary
Frances Berry, Robert B. Fiske, Jr., Sergei Godunov, and Eugene Roberts.
Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regents' Resolution in Honor of Donald H. Postema
Regent Deitch offered the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate the
Reverend Dr. Donald H. Postema on his retirement as pastor of the
Christian Reformed Campus Chapel. For more than three decades,
Dr. Postema has ministered to thousands of University students,
faculty members, and staff and has served as a persuasive advocate for
social justice, the contemplative life, and the arts. His message has
always been one of hope.
Dr. Postema, a graduate of Calvin College, Calvin Theological
Seminary, and the Free University of Amsterdam, began his pastoral
duties in 1963. He is only the second pastor to serve the Campus
Chapel in its 57-year history.
Deeply rooted in his own faith, Dr. Postema reaches out to others
from a wide range of religious traditions. A wise and compassionate
counselor, he has mentored many of his colleagues in campus ministry
and currently chairs the University's Council for Ethical, Religious,
and Spiritual Dialogue, which advises the vice president for student


296




April Meeting, 1997


affairs. He has raised funds for Michigan's '"Visiting Professor of
Religious Thought" program and has served several terms as
president of the Association of Religious Counselors and as president
of the Christian Association of Psychological Studies.
Throughout his ministry, Dr. Postema has been active in the
Ann Arbor community. Under his leadership, the Campus Chapel
co-founded the Ark coffee house in 1965 and also has provided food
and shelter to Ann Arbor's homeless.
In gratitude for the many ways Dr. Postema has contributed to
the spiritual and intellectual life of the University, the Regents of the
University of Michigan extend their heartfelt thanks and best wishes to
Donald H. Postema upon his retirement as pastor of the Campus
Chapel.
The resolution was adopted by acclamation, after which Dr. Postema
expressed his gratitude to the Regents for having had the opportunity to
serve as pastor of the Campus Chapel and for the honor of the resolution.
Provost Machen: General Remarks
Provost Machen distributed copies of an article from the Wall Street
Journal announcing that Professor Ned Gramlich, dean of the School of Public
Policy, was to be nominated to the Federal Reserve Board. Confirmation of
the appointment would require that Dean Gramlich resign his position as
dean, but it is a great honor for Dean Gramlich and for the University.
Provost Machen also introduced Ms. Pamela W. Fowler, new director of
the Office of the Financial Aid.
University of Michigan Hospitals Comparative Statistic Report
President Bollinger announced that the Comparative Statistic Report,
which had originally been scheduled to be presented at this meeting, has
been withdrawn and will be presented at the May meeting.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Power moved that the Regents resume the executive session
which had been recessed the previous day. Regent McFee seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously. The executive session resumed at
9:55 a.m.
Public Meeting
The public meeting resumed at 11:30 p.m. Regent Deitch was absent for
the remainder of the meeting; Regent Newman was away from the table, and
Provost Simpson attended in the stead of Chancellor Renick.
Repatriation of Native American Materials
President Bollinger called on Vice President Neidhardt, who noted that
when the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act
(NAGPRA) was passed in 1992, the University was required to take a


297




April Meeting, 1997


number of steps in order to comply with the dictates of the act. He noted
that in November 1993 the Board of Regents had pre-approved repatriation
of Native American burial remains, grave goods, sacred objects, and objects
of cultural patrimony when culturally affiliated Native American groups
requested them.   He called on Professor John O'Shea, professor of
anthropology, director of the Museum of Anthropology and curator of Great
Lakes archaeology within the Museum of Anthropology, who has been in
charge of the University's efforts to comply with NAGPRA.
Professor O'Shea reviewed the University's response to the act since it
was passed in 1992, noting that the University has committed almost
$500,000 to do the compliance work, which includes an inventory of all
Native American artifacts held by the University. He noted that when the
Regents had pre-approved the repatriation process where cultural affiliation
could be established, they had also recognized that claims would be made
that the University would not be able to uphold because they do not meet the
criteria of cultural affiliation.
The inventory resulted in the identification of 35 sites and 354
ethnographic specimens that were culturally affiliated under the standards of
the law, and negotiations are being carried out with 38 federally-recognized
tribes. He noted that the University made the determinations of cultural
affiliation and notified the tribes in 1993, two years ahead of the
federally-mandated deadline. The final inventory, which primarily includes
unaffiliated remains, was submitted on time in November of 1995, making
the University of Michigan one of the few major institutions that completed
the work on time.
The remainder of the work, for which there is no statute of limitations,
will involve responding to requests for information and repatriation claims.
Professor O'Shea distributed information related to an outstanding claim
from Emmet County, Michigan. It has been determined that the Little
Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians were the most likely affiliated people,
and plans are being made to proceed with the repatriation.
The University has received one repatriation request involving a site in
Ontario, Canada. Vice President Neidhardt reported that his office has
advised the president and executive officers that this request cannot be
complied with because there is significant doubt about the cultural affiliation
of the materials in question to the group that has requested it (Whitefish
River First Nation). In addition, because NAGPRA does not apply outside of
the United States and there is no established framework to govern these
negotiations, the Canadian government would have to become involved. It is
understood that Canadian authorities do not wish to repatriate, nor do they
recognize the tribe's claims to the materials.
Regent Power expressed admiration for the University's diligence in
complying with the terms of NAGPRA and for the sensitivity with which
those responsible have carried out this task.
Regent Newman returned to the table at this point (11:50 a.m.).

April Meeting, 1997


Robert L. Ellison, D.D.S., professor of dentistry in the School of
Dentistry, will retire from active faculty status on April 30, 1997.
Dr. Ellison received his D.D.S. degree in 1960 from Meharry Medical
College and his M.Sc. degree in oral pathology in 1975 from the School of
Dental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He has been a Diplomat
of the American Board of Endodontics since 1965. Dr. Ellison joined the
faculty of the University of Michigan as an associate professor in 1971 and
was promoted to professor in 1979.
Known for his dedication to teaching, Dr. Ellison has served as a member
of over 30 master's thesis committees throughout his tenure in the School of
Dentistry. He has been course director for several undergraduate and graduate
courses in endodontics. He has presented numerous lectures on endodontics to
professional organizations both nationally and internationally. Dr. Ellison has
served the school through membership on a number of committees, including
the Appointments, Promotions, and Tenure Committee, the Admissions
Committee, and the Executive Committee. His publication record includes
over 30 articles, and he is coauthor of four clinic manuals used in the dental
curriculum. He is currently involved in research which will lead to his writing
a book on distinguished African American educators and outstanding
contributions of African Americans to the dental profession.
Dr. Ellison is a member of Omicron Kappa Upsilon and Kappa Sigma Pi
honor societies. He is a member of numerous local, state, and national
professional societies, and has served both the Wolverine Dental Society and
the Detroit District Dental Society in several capacities, including president.
He has also served on the Endodontics Programs Accreditation Commission
for the American Dental Association, as a volunteer special lecturer for the
American Cancer Society, and as an editorial consultant or board member to
several journals.
The Regents now salute his distinguished health sciences educator by
naming Robert L. Ellison professor emeritus of dentistry.
Gayl D. Ness, professor of sociology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts and professor of population planning and international
health in the School of Public Health, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 1996.
Professor Ness received his B.A. (1952) and Ph.D. (1961) degrees in
sociology from the University of California at Berkeley. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor of sociology in 1964. He
was promoted to associate professor in 1966 and professor in 1972 and.
received his appointment in the School of Public Health in 1979.
Professor Ness has a distinguished record in elucidating the relationships
between population and development, and he has been a pioneer in studying
the relations between population and the environment. As director of the
Population-Environment Dynamics Project and as the key force in the Global
Change Project, he has produced important research results himself and has
drawn numerous other faculty members and students into his field. The solid
foundation of his research on southeast Asia has led to consideration of
questions that are key in all parts of the developing and developed world.
In addition to his scholarly accomplishments, Professor Ness has been
active in faculty governance, culminating in his service as chair of SACUA in


310




April Meeting, 1997


1989-90. Professor Ness has given outstanding service to the University, the
Department of Sociology, the School of Public Health, and the PopulationEnvironment Project. Each unit has benefited from his exceptional insight
and commitment to excellence, interdisciplinary work, and the integration of
scientific and policy concerns.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Gayl D. Ness
professor emeritus of sociology and professor emeritus of population
planning and international health.
James A. Taren, M.D., professor of surgery, retired from active faculty
status on March 31, 1997, after a highly-productive career as a teacher,
clinician, and researcher.
A native of Toledo, Ohio, Dr. Taren served with distinction with the U.S.
Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater from 1943-46. He received his B.S. degree
from the University of Toledo in 1948 and his M.D. degree from the
University of Michigan Medical School in 1952. He served his internship and
residency at the University of Michigan Medical Center in surgery and in
neurosurgery from 1952-55 and then undertook additional training in Boston
and at the University of Michigan from 1955-57. Dr. Taren joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1957 as an instructor in the Medical School,
Department of Surgery, Section of Neurosurgery. He was promoted to
assistant professor in 1958, associate professor in 1963, and professor of
surgery in 1969. Dr. Taren also served with distinction as associate dean for
academic programs from 1978-87, after which he returned to full-time clinical
activities. He also was director of the Office of Integration of Information and
Computer Technology for the Medical Campus from 1988-1989.
Dr. Taren was a member of many professional societies during his career
and was an officer in several. His research activities focused on the problem
of chronic intractable pain, on obsessive-compulsive disorders, and on
Parkinson's disease. He authored fifty-three articles in peer-reviewed journals,
in addition to coauthoring two neurosurgical textbooks and seventeen book
chapters.
Dr. Taren's career was marked by innovative approaches to difficult
neurosurgical problems. He is known for his expertise in the management of
chronic intractable pain states and the control of involuntary movement
disorders, including those seen in Parkinsonism and spasticity.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his
dedicated service by naming James A. Taren professor emeritus of surgery.
Memorials. No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.

Purchasing Contract with CMS Technologies
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Power, all seven
Regents present unanimously approved a purchasing contract with CMS


311




April Meeting, 1997


Technologies. Because a University employee, Marshall Cummings, also
holds a 29 percent stockholder's interest in CMS Technologies, this contract
falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the purchasing contract will be the Regents of the
University of Michigan and CMS Technologies.
2.  The terms of the contract are to support ISR's need for a security
system of the Institute's computer network, for a total one-time cost
of $2,433.36, deliverable in total by April 30, 1998.
3.  Mr. Marshall's pecuniary interest arises from his financial interest in
CMS Technologies, as a stockholder.
Research Agreement with Tal Materials, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Power, all seven
Regents present unanimously approved a research agreement between the
University of Michigan and Tal Materials, Inc. ("Tal") to enter into a subcontract under its Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project.
Because two University faculty members, Richard Laine and David R.
Treadwell, are also officers and employees of Tal, and another University
employee, Dr. Anthony Surik, is likely also to become a part-time employee
of Tal soon, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement will be the University of Michigan and Tal
Materials, Inc.
2.  Terms of the agreement will be consistent with University policy
regarding research subcontracts. Intellectual property rights will be
governed by the terms of the research agreement. The research
project is proposed over a six month period at a total cost of $7,999.
The budget does not include indirect cost, since this is an SBIR
Phase I project.
3.  Drs. Laine and Treadwell will receive direct compensation from Tal
but will not have a portion of their University effort supported by
this research project. Dr. Surik will be supported by the subcontract
but will receive no compensation for this project through Tal. Dr.
Albert Yee will be technically and fiscally responsible for the conduct
of the subcontract.
Small-Capitalization Common Stock Manager
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved the appointment of Qualivest Asset Management as a small-capitalization common stock investment manager.
Lowe, Brockenbrough, & Tattersall Strategic Advisors, Inc.

April Meeting, 1997


invest a portion of the University's portfolio in closed-end bond funds,
including term trusts, as described in the Regents Communication.
Report of Sale of University-Owned Real Estate
Executive Vice President Matthews informed the Regents of details of
the transactions concerning the previously-approved sale of three Universityowned parcels of real estate: Shady Trails Camp; Camp Filibert Roth; and
7.26 acres in Putnam Township, Livingston County, Michigan; as described
in the Regents Communication.
Regarding the Shady Trails Camp transaction, Regent McGowan
commented that she appreciated the respect and sensitivity that was shown
to Ms. Marie Clancy Hagerman, the daughter of the camp's founder, in
allocating the benefits that accrue to the University from the sale of that
land.
Renovation Projects
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Horning, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects: Administrative
Services Building renovation; replacement of a unit substation in the School
of Education Building; retrofitting of the existing lighting in the School of
Public Health II Building as an energy conservation measure; and
installation of a year-round cooling system in the School of Education and
School of Social Work buildings. Regent Newman was away from the table
when the vote was taken.
University of Michigan-Flint Professional Studies and Classroom
Building
Chancellor Nelms noted that the proposed construction of a new
building on the former AutoWorld site is a change from the original plans
that involved renovating the State Office Building. Completion of this
project will mark the first time that all academic programs will be located at
a common site.
In response to a question from Regent McGowan, Chancellor Nelms
noted that JJR, the University's planning consultant, is currently involved in
updating the Flint Campus master plan to include the AutoWorld site.

Executive Vice President Matthews described this proposal, which has
been recommended by the M-Care Board of Directors and the Michigan
Health Corporation Board of Directors, and for which the details can be
found in the Regents Communication. Regent Newman made the following
motion: That M-Care acquire 8.33 percent of NorthMed, Inc. stock and one
permanent seat on the NorthMed, Inc. Board of Directors for $1.6 million.
Additionally, that the Michigan Health Corporation (MHC) acquire 28,000
shares of Class B stock in Northern Physicians Organization (NPO).
Furthermore, that the M-Care president be named as the University
representative on the NorthMed, Inc. board of directors and that the

On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent McGowan, and on
the recommendation of the UM Hospitals executive board, the Regents
unanimously approved several appointments to medical staff membership.
Appeals Under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act
Vice President Harrison commented that as a result of recently enacted
amendments to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, a new appeals
procedure was created that allows individuals whose FOIA requests have
been denied by the FOIA officer to appeal this decision to the head of the
public body. Regent McFee moved approval of delegating authority to the
president to decide appeals submitted to the University under the Michigan
Freedom of Information Act, in accordance with the procedures outlined in
the Regents Communication.
Regent Newman seconded the motion, but requested that language be
incorporated into the appeals procedure regarding conflict of interest when
the FOIA request pertains to the president or the Board of Regents.
The vote was then taken, and the motion, including Regent Newman's
modification, was approved unanimously.

MAY MEETING, 1997


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, May 15, 1997
The Regents convened at 1:15 p.m. in the Johnson Rooms of the Lurie
Engineering Center. Present were President Bollinger and Regents Horning,
Maynard, McFee, McGowan, Newman, and Power. Also present were
Provost Machen, Vice President Harrison, Vice President Hartford, Vice
President Kinnear, Acting Vice President Neidhardt, Chancellor Renick, and
Secretary Palmer. Regents Deitch and Taylor and Interim Executive Vice
President Matthews were absent. Chancellor Nelms arrived at 2:40 p.m.
Associate Vice President Herbert attended in the stead of Interim Executive
Vice President Matthews. Chancellor Renick left shortly after the start of
the meeting and was replaced by Provost Simpson.
President Bollinger: General Remarks
Faculty Awards. President Bollinger announced that Professors
Jonathan Freedman and Douglas Richstone had received Guggenheim
Fellowships, and that Professor Joyce Marcus had been elected to the
National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences. He noted that University of Michigan faculty have received a total
of 157 Guggenheim Fellowships.
Professor Bollinger also announced that the Cancer and Geriatrics Center
had opened on May 5, 1997, and that a groundbreaking ceremony for Sam
Wyly Hall had been held on May 2nd.
Presentation by Dean Director
Stephen Director, dean of the College of Engineering, gave a presentation
about the College of Engineering, noting that this is a period of change in
which the college has a unique opportunity to reevaluate past decisions and
make strategic choices about future directions. He noted that a major
curriculum change was to be implemented in the fall and reviewed some of
the major accomplishments in research that have recently emerged from
research centers in the college. He noted that the capital campaign had
exceeded its goal, and that future efforts will concentrate on increasing the
number of endowed professorships.
North Campus Master Plan Update
President Bollinger called on Mr. Fred Mayer, university planner, who
gave a presentation reviewing the history of the development of the North
Campus, beginning with acquisition of the land following World War II. He
noted that renowned architect Ero Saarinen had been the University's first
campus planner and had developed the original master plan for the North
Campus. To allow him to design the School of Music, he relinquished his
position at the University and was replaced by the firm of Johnson Johnson
& Roy (JJR) in the 1950s. The last North Campus master plan was developed
317




May Meeting, 1997


by JJR in the mid-1980s. Mr. Mayer concluded his presentation with an
overview of the current status of the development of the North Campus.
Regent Newman inquired whether parking was included as part of
campus planning. She noted that units are often unable to hold conferences
on campus due to lack of parking facilities. Mr. Mayer responded that the
University's Parking Services office can make special arrangements for
parking for large conferences, and that planners do take parking availability
into account. Regent Newman said that it is important for the University to
provide sufficient parking to allow visitors to have access to the campus.
Regent McGowan observed that during the discussion of plans for the
construction of Wyly Hall, there was discussion of presenting a "parking/
environmental impact statement" to the Board concurrent with the
presentation of building design plans. Mr. Mayer observed that there are
sites available on campus for the construction of additional parking facilities.
Regent Newman suggested that there be another presentation describing the
overall parking situation on campus and how parking is coordinated among
the various campus buildings and facilities.
Regent Power noted that the Regents would like to have parking impact
statements accompany the discussion of all new building construction, so
that each presentation would include a discussion of the -relation of the
building to the master plan, programmatic issues, and parking issues.
President Bollinger inquired whether there exists an overall master plan
for the Ann Arbor campus. Mr. Mayer responded that the tendency has been
to develop plans for the several Ann Arbor campus areas individually (North
Campus, Medical Campus, Central Campus, Athletic Campus), and that
perhaps it would be worthwhile to develop a concept that links all of the
plans.
Following this discussion, there was a recess, during which the Regents
were taken on a tour of the Lurie Engineering Center. The meeting reconvened
at 2:40 p.m.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted the minutes of the April 17-18, 1997,
meeting. Regent Newman pointed out an error which was noted and will be
corrected.
Reports. Associate Vice President Herbert submitted the following
reports: Investments, Plant Extension, Litigation, and Personnel-Labor
Relations.
Vice President Neidhardt submitted Projects Established and
Summaries of a Selection of Current Research and Sponsored Projects. Vice
President Neidhardt observed that the University of Michigan reviews all
research involving human subjects through five standing institutional review
boards, and he then described how the review process operates. He noted
that the principles guiding the review boards were set forth in a 1979
document known as the Belmont Report. The three fundamental principles


318




May Meeting, 1997


guiding the review are respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. He
distributed copies of the Belmont Report to the Regents. Vice President
Neidhardt also noted that the state Senate had passed a bill prohibiting the
exploitation and photographing of human remains on shipwrecks, which
validates the University's earlier decision not to allow the use of its M-Rover
vehicle for this purpose. He also noted that while only one-third of the
research performed in the United States is funded by the federal
government, three-fourths of the scientific papers backing up the patents
driving industry have emerged from publicly supported research.
The Regents received the Faculty Governance Update.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear submitted a report of gifts
received for the month of April 1997. He reported that the capital campaign
had surpassed $1 billion in gifts and pledges, not counting bequests.

Kurt Brandle, professor of architecture in the College of Architecture
and Urban Planning, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1997.
Professor Brandle was born in Binningen, Switzerland, and later moved
to Germany, where he received his Dipl. Ing. (1958) and his Dr. Ing. (1967)


337




May Meeting, 1997


degrees in architecture from the Technical University of Berlin. He was an
associate professor and then professor of architecture at the University of
Utah from 1969-81. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as professor
of architecture in 1981.
Within the college, Professor Brandle has taught graduate-level courses
in environmental technology, building design, and energy conservation. He
has also served as chair and co-chair on many dissertation committees and has
been an active member of many program, college, and University committees.
Professor Brandle is professionally registered in the state of Wisconsin
and has been a member of the board of the Huron Valley Chapter of AIA since
1996. He is a member of a number of professional societies and is a board
member of the Washtenaw Affordable Housing Corporation (WAHC). He has
designed a chancel area in the First United Methodist Church of Ann Arbor
and has designed prototypes for energy efficient housing for WAHC. He has
also been an expert witness in many cases related to roof construction and
thermal systems.
Professor Brandle consults as a member of the University's Energy
Conservation Committee and has recently completed a research project on the
cost effectiveness of energy conservation measures related to the Model
Energy Code in Michigan. In 1986 and 1987, he received the ASHRAE Energy
Award. Professor Brandle has clearly had an impact on the building systems
and energy management, performance, and applications of many buildings,
especially on the University of Michigan campus. Under his guidance,
students have become passionate in their respect for the environment and in
their desire to promote energy conservation.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Kurt Brandle
professor emeritus of architecture.
C. Tristram Coffin, professor of physics, will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 1997.
Professor Coffin received his B.S. degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in 1951 and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Washington in
1956. After working for two years at the Columbia University Nevis
Cyclotron, he joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
professor in 1959. He was promoted to associate professor in 1964 and
professor in 1974.
Professor Coffin's early work involved experiments on a number of
particle reactions using spark chamber and counter techniques. Between 1963
and 1975, he worked on a number of experiments at the Argonne Zero
Gradient Synchrotron involving pion-produced reactions. From the midseventies through 1981, Professor Coffin collaborated with a group at
Fermilab investigating neutrino interactions with the large bubble chamber.
The results from this program established neutrino interactions cross sections
and many parameters of the weak interaction.
In the early 1980s, Professor Coffin joined a collaboration at Fermilab
studying neutrino production from the decay of "charm" particles by running
the high-energy proton beam into a solid target. The collaborators built a
large detector and developed a sophisticated beam system which caused
interactions among energetic protons and thus swept away all particles save
the neutrinos. They were able to quantify the cross section for "charm"


338




May Meeting, 1997


production from various element targets. In a second group of Fermilab
experiments, he and his collaborators studied production of charmed particles
by 800 GeV protons on protons.    Professor Coffin's work contributed
significantly to the important results of this collaboration.
In the late 1980s, Professor Coffin turned to biophysics, using electron
paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectrometers to study the active
sites of metal proteins. Professor Coffin is developing a high sensitivity
M6ssbauer spectrometer. This device obtained the first precision spectrum on
a natural abundance mammalian protein.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming C. Tristram
Coffin professor emeritus of physics.
Lewis Hugh Cooper, professor of music (bassoon), will retire from
active faculty status on May 31, 1997.
Born in Pontiac, Michigan, on New Year's Eve, 1920, Professor Cooper
received his B.Mus. degree from  the University of Michigan in 1955.
However, in 1945 he had joined the faculty of the School of Music as a
part-time instructor in bassoon. He was promoted to assistant professor in
1961 and associate professor in 1963, at which time his appointment was
increased to full-time status. He became professor of music in 1966. With his
extraordinary 52-year record of service, Professor Cooper is the longestserving member currently on the faculty at the University of Michigan.
Professor Cooper was a member of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra from
1946-64, performing in approximately 2,500 concerts. He was the bassoonist
on more than 30 distinguished recordings made by the orchestra during that
time, under the direction of Paul Paray. He is the author of several
influential articles on bassoon technique. Perhaps his major contribution to
the bassoon world lies in his study of the acoustics of the bassoon, the fruition
of which, in a longtime collaboration with Puchner bassoons, is the "Cooper
Model" that has been widely acclaimed for its musical excellence.
Professor Cooper has served multiple terms on the faculty Senate
Assembly, and within the School of Music he has been a guiding force in the
school's Council of Departmental Representatives. Most of all, he has been an
enthusiastic teacher of young bassoonists, for which he received the Harold
Haugh Award for Excellence in Studio Teaching in 1980.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his longtime record of
distinguished service by naming Lewis Hugh Cooper professor emeritus of
music (bassoon).
George W. Ford, professor of physics, will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 1997, following forty years of service.
Professor Ford received his A.B. (1949), M.S. (1951), and Ph.D. (1955)
degrees from the University of Michigan. After working at the National
Bureau of Standards and the University of Notre Dame, he returned to the
University of Michigan in 1958 as an assistant professor. He was promoted to
associate professor in 1961 and professor in 1966.
A theoretical physicist, early in his career Professor Ford built an
international reputation in the field of statistical mechanics. He then made
significant contributions to beta decay and electromagnetism, both classical
and quantum. He is known for his command of mathematical techniques for


339




May Meeting, 1997


the analysis of complex problems in electromagnetism. He has lectured and
published on topics in special and general relativity, biophysics, fluid
mechanics, and nonlinear mechanics. He has also had fruitful collaborations
with experimental colleagues in solid state physics and atomic physics.
Despite a demanding schedule of working and lecturing, he has always had
time to interact with a wide and diverse group of friends and colleagues.
Professor Ford's Ph.D. thesis was an important work on the application
of linear graphs in statistical mechanics, with applications to the equation of
state of gases. After his thesis, Professor Ford became involved in studies of
electromagnetism.  He next began a fruitful contribution to the g-2
experiments, and mentored the first of his Ph.D. students as they engaged in
an analysis of the motion of the spin of a classical relativistic particle. His
work was vital to the data analysis of his famous experimental program. He
later contributed to the positronium studies centered in the department. He
became known for his work in the 1970s on helicon oscillations of conducting
spheres and on the modes of an axisymmetric cavity resonator. He has also
written seminal papers on such diverse topics as energy balance in binary star
systems, instabilities in injected electron-hole plasmas in semiconductors, and
the rotation-vibration quantum states of floppy molecules. He continues to
work in statistical mechanics, dissipation in quantum systems, atomic physics,
and quantum electrodynamics.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming George W. Ford
professor emeritus of physics.
David Goldberg, professor of sociology and research scientist,
Population Studies Center, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will
retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1997.
Professor Goldberg received his B.A. (1952), M.A. (1953), and Ph.D.
(1958) degrees from Wayne State University. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an instructor in 1956 and was promoted to assistant
professor in 1958, associate professor in 1963, and professor in 1969. His
active research career resulted in his appointment as associate director
(1961-72) and then director (1972-76) of the Population Studies Center, and
director of the Detroit Area Study from 1977-81.
His numerous publications on differential fertility are considered seminal
by population researchers, and his emphasis on the importance of gender
roles in fertility predates current interests by decades. Professor Goldberg
was also one of the early users of substantive regression procedures for
population estimation and projection, his publications for the Governor's
Commission and the Great Lakes Regional Commission appearing well before
the federal government adopted those techniques. In addition to publications
in demographic and sociological journals and books, some of Professor
Goldberg's joint research can be found in American Anthropologist (urban
kinship) and The Lancet (comparative multiple sclerosis).
Although Professor Goldberg had a distinguished research career, he
seems most pleased with his role as an educator, where he could demonstrate
and communicate the excitement of compressing truth from empirical data.
Much of his teaching was with first-year graduate students, and in more
recent years he taught a large share of undergraduate courses. He chaired
the dissertation committees of 28 Ph.D. students. Those students can now be


340




May Meeting, 1997


found at leading universities in a variety of teaching and administrative roles,
following the pursuit of productive research careers advancing what we know
through multivariate data analysis.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming David Goldberg
professor emeritus of sociology and research scientist emeritus.
Rolf Hartung, professor of environmental toxicology, Department of
Environmental and Industrial Health, and research scientist, Institute of
Environmental and Industrial Health, School of Public Health, will retire
from active faculty status on May 31, 1997.
Born in Breman, Germany, Professor Hartung immigrated to the United
States in 1952. He studied wildlife management and toxicology at the
University of Michigan, earning his B.S. degree in 1960, his M.W.M. degree in
1962, and his Ph.D. degree in 1964. He was appointed lecturer in what is now
the Department of Environmental and Industrial Health in 1964; he was
promoted to assistant professor in 1965 and associate professor in 1969. In
1973, he was promoted to professor of environmental toxicology and research
scientist in the Institute of Environmental and Industrial Health.
Professor Hartung was a noted teacher of toxicology and was
instrumental in the development of the program of graduate studies in
toxicology. He chaired the Interdepartmental Program in Toxicology from
1974-80. Professor Hartung was among the first to be nationally recognized
for his expertise in toxicology when he was board certified in toxicology in
1980 by the American Board of Toxicology. He has conducted seminal
research on the application of quantitative models to the environmental
toxicology of pesticides and heavy metals, with ultimate applications to risk
assessment. From 1993 to his retirement, he directed the Program in
Environmental Health Sciences.
Throughout his career, Professor Hartung has served as a consultant for
the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, the
Science Advisory Board of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the
state of Michigan. He has also chaired or been a member of numerous
national and international scientific advisory committees.
In recognition of his lengthy and productive career, the Regents now
salute this faculty member by naming Rolf Hartung professor emeritus of
environmental toxicology and research scientist emeritus.
Karl T. Hecht, professor of physics, will retire from active faculty status
on May 31, 1997.
Professor Hecht received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degree in 1948, 1949,
and 1955, respectively, all from the University of Michigan. He joined the
faculty as an instructor in 1955. He was promoted to assistant professor in
1957, associate professor in 1961, and professor in 1965.
Early in his career, Professor Hecht worked on the study of infrared
spectroscopy and molecular structure, achieving national recognition as one of
a handful of theorists who had brought the theory of molecular structure to a
nearly final, rigorous, and self-consistent form. He then turned his attention
to nuclear physics and quickly achieved international recognition for the
comprehensiveness of his understanding of nuclear physics and for the
precision and elegance of his theoretical formulations. Professor Hecht is now


341




May Meeting, 1997


among the leading nuclear theorists in the world and is widely considered the
leader in the application of group theoretical methods to problems of nuclear
structure. His work often stands as the final word on complex theoretical
problems.
Professor Hecht has made many contributions to experimental work as
well. While the experimental program in nuclear physics was developing at
Michigan-with M. Wiedenbeck's charged particles-Professor Hecht's
theoretical insight consistently played important roles in the success of these
programs. He has been a member of every dissertation committee in
experimental nuclear physics since the 1960s.
Widely considered one of the best teachers the physics department has
ever had, Professor Hecht has mentored several younger scientists who have
themselves become well-known in nuclear physics. He has chaired 13 Ph.D.
committees and supervised 11 postdoctoral physicists. In addition to having
held a number of distinguished fellowships, Professor Hecht has served twice
as Alexander von Humboldt senior fellow at the Max-Planck Institute in
Heidelberg, and is a fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
He has published over 100 articles, edited nearly two dozen conference
proceedings, and has given scores of invited talks throughout the world. In
1991, the Karl T. Hecht Symposium was held in Ann Arbor, bringing together
the leading nuclear physicists in his honor.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Karl T. Hecht
professor emeritus of physics.
Lois W. Hoffman, professor of psychology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1997.
Professor Hoffman received her B.A. degree in 1953 from the State
University of New York at Buffalo, her M.A. degree in 1954 from Purdue
University, and her Ph.D. degree in 1958 from the University of Michigan.
From 1954-60, she worked at the Institute for Social Research, first as an
assistant study director and then as a research associate. From 1960-67, she
was an independent scholar and co-editor of the Review of Child Development
Research. In 1967, she joined the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer
in the Department of Psychology. She was promoted to associate professor in
1971 and professor of psychology in 1975.
Professor Hoffman has had an impact on thousands of students through
her teaching and through her landmark textbook, Developmental Psychology
Today, which is now in its sixth edition. She has received numerous awards,
including the Child Study Association Outstanding Book Award (1966), the
J.F. Lewis Award form the American Philosophical Society (1978), an
Outstanding Teaching Award from the Department of Psychology (1981), and
the LS&A Excellence in Education Award in 1994.     She has been a
distinguished scholar at Radcliffe College and a scholar in residence at
Rockefeller Center in Bellagio, Italy. In 1989, the American Psychological
Association included her in its listing of "Eminent Women in Psychology."
Within the University, Professor Hoffman helped to establish the
Women's Studies Program and chaired the developmental area in the
psychology department. She served as president of two divisions of the
American Psychological Association: the Psychological Study of Social Issues
Division (1983-84) and the Developmental Psychology Division (1990-91).


342




May Meeting, 1997


Professor Hoffman's current research is an examination of how
socioeconomic conditions and work patterns affect family interaction and
children's socialization experiences, and how these affect the child's
development. Her work has been continuously marked by her concern with
sociocultural variables and the social setting as they affect family interaction
and parent-child relationships, and as variables that moderate effects on the
child.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Lois W.
Hoffman professor emerita of psychology.
Robert T. Lenaghan, professor of English, will retire from active
faculty status on May 31, 1997.
Professor Lenaghan received his B.A. degree (1949) from the University
of Iowa and his M.A. (1952) and Ph.D. (1957) degrees from Harvard
University. He served on the faculty at UCLA from 1957-61 and came to the
University of Michigan as an assistant professor in 1961. He was promoted to
associate professor in 1965 and professor in 1973.
At Michigan, Professor Lenaghan's work evolved along three major lines
of interest: medieval and early modem literature; composition studies; and
faculty governance, both within and beyond the University of Michigan. His
major editorial contributions include Caxton's Aesop, published in 1967, and
(as coeditor responsible for the short poems in the Chaucer canon) The
Riverside Chaucer, published in 1987. He also published a number of journal
contributions that range from philological studies to the analysis of social
patterns among those members of medieval society who would have
constituted part of Chaucer's audience.
As one of the coeditors of The Norton Reader, which went through seven
editions between 1965 and 1987, Professor Lenaghan helped to shape the
content of literally thousands of college composition classes throughout the
United States. He also served the College Board as a reader for the Advanced
Placement Examination and directed the Sarah Lawrence-University of
Michigan Summer Program in London. In 1988, he won the University
Teaching Award.
In the area of faculty governance, Professor Lenaghan's contributions
were unusually wide-ranging. He was active in the Senate Assembly, in
SACUA, and in the state conference of the AAUP. In the early seventies,
during a marked decline in the academic job market, he organized a major
conference focused on exploring the nonacademic job market for graduating
Ph.D. students; he remained active in this pursuit for several years
afterwards.
Professor Lenaghan was an engaging and positive presence in the
department, who welcomed newcomers and made them feel that the
department was a genuine intellectual home. He cared deeply about the
academy and personified a model of service to its central ideals.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Robert T.
Lenaghan professor emeritus of English.
William G. Lockwood, professor of anthropology, will retire from active
faculty status on May 31, 1997, after a distinguished career as a scholar and a
teacher.


343




May Meeting, 1997


Professor Lockwood received his A.B. degree from Fresno State College
in 1955 and his Ph.D. degree from the University of California at Berkeley in
1970. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor
of anthropology in 1969. He was promoted to associate professor in 1975 and
professor in 1995.
Professor Lockwood has played an essential role in anchoring the
University's presence in the anthropology of Eastern Europe and is probably
best known for the solidity and high quality of his descriptive ethnography.
His well-known book, European Moslems: Ethnicity and Economy in Western
Bosnia, remains an essential text for contemporary understanding of the
region. Professor Lockwood has been an instrumental figure in the department; he has directed the Honors Program for undergraduate majors, served
as associate chair, and served as a valued member of the executive committee.
In addition to his descriptive ethnography of Bosnian Muslims, Professor
Lockwood has also contributed to the scholarly literature on the historical
development of ethnic identity. Using comparative materials from his more
recent research with Gypsy populations in the Balkan region, other parts of
Europe, and the United States, he has demonstrated the need to place
contemporary boundaries and relations between dominant and subordinate
groups into a dense historical and political economic context. While his
ethnography of Bosnian Muslims is regarded as the single best study on this
group in English, this later work on theoretical issues related to identity
formation among ethnic groups is regarded as an important addition to the
descriptive ethnography of the Balkan anthropologists. Professor Lockwood's
contributions in these areas continue to be referred to by all serious scholars
of this region; his accumulated scholarship is among the foundational work
for courses on ethnicity in Eastern Europe and will retain its importance,
based on its descriptive rigor, for years to come.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming William G.
Lockwood professor emeritus of anthropology.
Donald I. Meyer, professor of physics, retired from active faculty status
on December 31, 1996, following 40 years of service.
Professor Meyer earned his B.S. degree in 1946 from the Missouri School
of Mines and his Ph.D. degree in 1953 from the University of Washington. He
taught at the University of Oklahoma from1952-55 and then joined the
research staff at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. He joined the faculty
at the University of Michigan in 1957 as assistant professor of physics. He
was promoted to associate professor in 1961 and professor in 1966.
Professor Meyer's initial work at the University of Michigan involved
bubble chamber experiments. Later, he collaborated in work on strong
interactions and the associated production of strange particles. During this
period, he worked on a technique for modulating the voltage on the cathode of
a photomultiplier as a means of achieving very good time resolution. He also
collaborated on the development of a spectrometer magnet and on optical
spark chambers.
Through the 1970s and early 1980s, Professor Meyer collaborated on
hadronic physics experiments at Fermilab. Later, he and colleagues helped
initiate the multi-university high resolution spectrometer collaboration at the
positron-electron collider storage ring at the Stanford Linear Accelerator


344




May Meeting, 1997


Center.  In the 1990s Professor Meyer collaborated in a gamma ray
astronomy program at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona. Using Cerenkov
radiation from g-ray air showers, the group employed a large mirror with a
matrix of photomultipliers as its focus to observe photons with energies
10,000 times higher than could be studied by satellites. This resulted in
detection of the first extra-galatic source seen at these energies,
Markarian-421.
Professor Meyer initiated a joint program between the Department of
Physics and the College of Engineering to train Ph.D. students in practical
applications of modern physics technologies, which led to the highly successful
Program  in Applied Physics.  He also took leadership roles in the
recently-completed renovation of the Randall Laboratory and West
Engineering buildings and helped design the new    Physics Research
Laboratory. In recognition of his role in helping to create the physics
department's outstanding physical facilities, the physics meeting room in 335
West Hall has been named the Donald I. Meyer Commons.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Donald I. Meyer
professor emeritus of physics.
Bradford Perkins, professor of history, will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 1997.
Professor Perkins received his A.B. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard
University in 1947 and 1952, respectively. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as professor of history in 1962, after having taught for ten
years at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Professor Perkins is recognized as one of the leading historians of
American foreign relations in the United States. The author, editor, or
coeditor of seven books and scores of other publications, his works have been
distinguished by their path-breaking character, the meticulousness of their
author's research, the sharpness of their insights, and an engaging literary
style. Professor Perkins' three volumes covering Anglo-American relations
from 1795-1823 were recognized immediately as the definitive works on their
subject. The last of these, Castlereagh and Adams: England and the United
States, 1812-1823, won the Bancroft Prize, the most prestigious award for a
book in American history.  His most recent book, The Creation of a
Republican Empire, 1776-1865, has been widely praised as a powerful
synthetic treatment of the crucial formative years of American foreign policy.
At Michigan, he has been an excellent teacher and a major force in the
shaping of the history department's curriculum. He was instrumental in the
establishment of the department's popular course on the war in Vietnam and
was a key figure in the development of the two-term introductory course on
the literature of American history that is now required of all incoming
American history graduate students. He has been chair of the history department, served numerous times on the department's executive committee, and
was a long-time chair of the history department graduate advisors.
Professor Perkins has won numerous awards and honors throughout his
long and productive career, culminating in the Norman and Laura Graebner
Career Achievement Award from the Society for Historians of American
Foreign Relations (1992). Within the University, he was twice the recipient of


345




May Meeting, 1997


the Department of History's competitive Hudson Research Professorship, and
in 1986 he received the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Bradford
Perkins professor emeritus of history.
Frank A. Raymond, professor of mathematics, will retire from active
faculty status on May 31, 1997.
Professor Raymond received his A.B. degree (1953) from Syracuse
University, his M.A. degree (1954) from Harvard University, and his Ph.D.
degree (1958) from the University of Michigan. From 1958-60 he was a
post-doctoral fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, and from 1960-62 he
was an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1962 as associate professor of mathematics;
he was promoted to professor in 1966.
Professor Raymond's research has been concerned with both algebraic and
geometric topology. His early work in generalized manifolds found immediate
applications to the theory of transformation groups. While at Wisconsin,
Professor Raymond worked out the theory of the symmetries of 3-dimensional
manifolds. This led to his interest in Seifert manifolds, which play an
important role in many geometric studies. The key was a method for
studying higher dimensional Seifert manifolds (geometric objects on which
one can do calculus) using Lie groups (the symmetries of Euclidean spaces)
and lower dimensional manifolds. The techniques developed here led to many
applications, one of which found long-sought-for examples of manifolds
without any finite symmetries. In 1972, the higher dimensional Seifert
fiberings took on a complex analytic flavor, and he wrote one of his most
important papers, "Holomorphic Seifert Fiberings." This led to exploiting
more and more the geometric aspects of Seifert fiberings in dimensions three
and higher. He delighted in working with others on his research, and he
authored or co-authored more than 75 journal articles.
Professor Raymond takes a keen interest in the development of graduate
students, having directed 25 dissertations over the last 30 years. Almost all of
his former students maintain active programs of mathematical research in
this country or aboard. In his teaching, Professor Raymond worked hard to
be innovative, seldom using the same material or same format for a repeated
course. He gave his time generously to his students and colleagues.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Frank A.
Raymond professor emeritus of mathematics.
Art J. Schwartz, associate professor of mathematics, will retire from
active faculty status on May 31, 1997.
A native of Michigan, Professor Schwartz received his B.Sc., M.A., and
Ph.D. degrees at Wayne State University in 1954, 1958, and 1960, respectively.
He served with the U.S. Army in Korea from 1955-57. Professor Schwartz was
an instructor at Wayne State University from 1960-61 and at Princeton
University from 1961-63. From 1963-65 he was a research associate and then
assistant professor at Columbia University.  He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1965 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1968.


346




May Meeting, 1997


In 1962, Professor Schwartz solved an open problem in dynamical
systems theory, extending to all compact surfaces the well-known work of
Deujoy which applied only to the torus; namely that all minimal sets are
trivial if the flow is C2. In addition to further work on dynamical systems, he
turned his attention to studying the political and social uses of technology.
For several years, he consulted at the CAD/CAM department of Ford Motor
Company. This work led to an interest in the analytical and algebraic
geometry of real surfaces of low degree, applying abstract theory to study
such practical surfaces as a windshield. Several mathematical publications of
interesting graphical content ensued.
Professor Schwartz has always been interested in pedagogy and spent
much of his energy in this direction. In recent years, this was particularly
evidenced by his active participation in the First-Year Seminar Program.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Art J. Schwartz
associate professor emeritus of mathematics.
William E. Sharp, research scientist, Space Physics Research
Laboratory, College of Engineering, retired from active faculty status on
March 31, 1997, after a most productive career.
Dr. Sharp received his B.S. degree from William Jewell College in 1962,
his M.S. degree from the University of New Hampshire in 1965, and his Ph.D.
degree from the University of Colorado in 1970. He joined the University of
Michigan as a research associate in 1970; he was promoted to associate
research scientist in 1975 and research scientist in 1977.
Dr. Sharp's research activities focused mainly on the study of the earth's
upper atmosphere, using experiments conceived, designed, and built by him
and his students and launched on sounding rockets. His path-finding work
has long been considered the standard for the field of experimental aeronomy
using sounding rockets. His pioneering measurements of atomic oxygen
concentrations in the atmosphere in the early 1970s, for example, stimulated
the entire science community to reach a greater quantitative appreciation of
the role of reactive odd oxygen species in upper atmospheres. Dr. Sharp later
expanded these investigations to include comprehensive studies of a whole
panoply of chemical and radiative processes in the earth's aurora. These
investigations drew him into productive collaborations with the world's best
theorists and with other experimental teams, producing a highly prized body
of work.
Although his responsibilities were centered on research, Dr. Sharp has
held a lifelong interest in teaching. He has taught on both the Ann Arbor and
Dearborn campuses. Most recently, he served for six years as the director of
the Research Opportunities for Undergraduates site within the Space Physics
Research Laboratory, helping to train more than 15 students per year in
experimental and theoretical work. He has also chaired several Ph.D.
committees.
Dr. Sharp was assistant director of the Space Physics Research
Laboratory from 1986-91 and was a program director for aeronomy at the
National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1985-86. During his tenure at NSF, he
conceived and launched the highly successful Coupling, Energetics, and
Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) Program that has powered


347




May Meeting, 1997


intensive collaborative work in upper atmospheric science in the United
States for over ten years.
The Regents now salute this staff member by naming William E. Sharp
research scientist emeritus.
Yuzuru J. Takeshita, professor of health behavior and health
education in the School of Public Health, will retire from active faculty status
on May 31, 1997.
After graduating from high school in a California war relocation center in
1945, Professor Takeshita received his B.A. degree from Park College
(Missouri) in 1951. He received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of Michigan in 1952 and 1962, respectively. From 1958-62, he
served on the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles. From
1962-64, he was associate director of the Taiwan Population Studies Center.
He returned to the University of Michigan in 1964 as an assistant professor of
sociology, and in 1967 joined the School of Public Health as a research
associate in population planning. He was promoted to associate professor of
population planning in 1968 and professor in 1972. He was appointed
professor of health behavior and health education in 1977 and held a joint
appointment in population planning and international health until 1996.
Professor Takeshita has had a distinguished international career,
concentrating on fertility surveys and evaluation of population and healthrelated programs in the Third World, primarily in Southeast Asia and East
Asia. He served as a consultant to many projects under the auspices of major
U.S. and international organizations and was a senior staff member of the
World Fertility Survey, one of the largest survey operations in history. He
also served as senior advisor to Malaysia's national family planning board for
nearly a decade. He has contributed to the improvement of evaluation
research methodology in developing countries and to the utilization of
behavioral science perspectives in the study of family planning in China,
Korea, Japan, and elsewhere.
Within the University, Professor Takeshita provided academic leadership
to the Department of Population Planning and International Health, serving
terms as chair of the department and director of the Center for Population
Planning. He was also a long-time member of the Center for Japanese
Studies. He brought to the classroom a rare combination of expertise,
teaching skill, and respect for students who sought his guidance inside and
outside of the classroom. He chaired some twenty doctoral dissertations and
was a member of many dissertation committees.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming Yuzuru J. Takeshita professor emeritus of health behavior and
health education.
Martinus J. Veltman, John D. MacArthur Professor of Physics, will
retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1997.
Professor Veltman received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in theoretical
physics from the University of Utrecht (The Netherlands) in 1956 and 1963,
respectively. He was a fellow at CERN from 1961-66 and was professor of
physics at the University of Utrecht from 1966-81. He joined the University
of Michigan in 1981 as the John D. MacArthur Professor of Physics.


348




May Meeting, 1997


Professor Veltman is known worldwide for his pioneering work on the
renormalizability of gauge theories. The discovery that these theories are
renormalizable has revolutionized the field of particle physics.  All
interactions-weak, electromagnetic, and strong-are described by a gauge
theory, and the precise understanding of these theories has made it possible
to extract precise predictions and quantities to be observed experimentally.
Professor Veltman was the first to start a systematic analysis of the
calculation of radiative corrections. The methods developed by him and his
students are the basis for that branch of research. Precision measurements
have since confirmed the results in great detail, establishing firmly the
principles of gauge theories and their renormalizability. Professor Veltman
was also the first to develop a general-purpose computer program that can do
algebra. The underlying principles of that program are used in all modern
algebraic programs commonly found in software used by researchers
everywhere.
Professor Veltman is a member of the Dutch Academy of Science and is a
fellow of the American Physical Society. He has served on policy committees
at all of the world's major high energy physics laboratories. Among his many
honors are the Alexander von Humboldt Award (Germany); Doctor Honoris
Causa from SUNY-Stonybrook; and the Fifth Physica Lezing (The
Netherlands). In 1992, he was knighted into the Dutch Order of the Lion in
honor of Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands. He received the 1993 High
Energy Physics Prize from the European Physical Society. He has been a
towering presence in world physics and an invaluable colleague at the
University of Michigan.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Martinus J.
Veltman the John D. McArthur Professor Emeritus of Physics.
Joseph Veroff, professor of psychology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts and research scientist, Survey Research Center,
Institute for Social Research, will retire from active faculty status on May 31,
1997.
Professor Veroff received his B.A. degree in 1950 at Wesleyan University
and his M.A. (1952) and Ph.D. (1955) degrees at the University of Michigan.
He was an instructor at Princeton University in 1955-56, then returned to the
University of Michigan in 1956 as a study director at the Survey Research
Center in the Institute for Social Research (ISR). He became a lecturer in the
Department of Psychology in 1957 and was promoted to assistant professor in
1958, associate professor in 1962, and professor in 1967. He was named
faculty associate at ISR in 1975 and research scientist in 1985.
At Michigan, Professor Veroff co-directed what is certainly one of the
landmark studies in American social science: a national interview study of the
adult population's adaptation and satisfaction in work, marriage, and
parenthood and their use of various resources when they are confronted with
problems or crises. In 1976, he was principal investigator on a repeat of the
original study that documented changes in the American population's values,
attitudes, and behaviors over the crucial decades from 1957-76. The books
that resulted from these two studies have been widely used and
enthusiastically reviewed over the last 40 years.


349




May Meeting, 1997


Professor Veroff approached his teaching with the same excitement and
pleasure that he brought to research.    He involved graduate and
undergraduate students in his research activities, always seeking to win new
recruits for scientific inquiry and the life of the mind. Dozens of graduate
students benefited from his intuitive gifts and analytic sophistication as he
guided them through their dissertation research. He has a generosity of spirit
that marks all great teachers.
Within the University, Professor Veroff served on the Senate Assembly
and on a number of college and University committees. From 1991-96, he
distinguished himself as graduate chair of the Department of Psychology, all
the while continuing to supervise a large research project and a whole cadre of
graduate students. Professor Veroff is revered by his students and colleagues
for his lively mind, excited spirit, and unfailing generosity.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Joseph Veroff
professor emeritus of psychology and research scientist emeritus.
Glenn E. Watkins, the Earl V. Moore Professor of Music (music history/
musicology), will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1997.
Raised in Kansas, Professor Watkins enlisted in the army on his
seventeenth birthday and later served in MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo.
Following discharge, he earned his A.B. (1948) and M.Mus. (1949) degrees
from the University of Michigan and his Ph.D. degree in musicology from the
Eastman School of Music in 1953. He was a Fulbright Scholar in London and
Oxford during 1953-54, after which he taught at Southern Illinois University
(1954-58) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1958-63).
Professor Watkins joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1963 as
associate professor of music and was promoted to professor in 1966. He has
held the title of Earl V. Moore Professor of Music since 1984.
Professor Watkins' honors include an award from the American Council
of Learned Societies (1962), a National Book Award nomination for Gesualdo:
The Man and His Music, and a Pulitizer Prize nomination for Pyramids at
the Louvre. He has received distinguished alumnus achievement awards from
both the University of Michigan (1986) and the Eastman School of Music
(1996).
In his earliest scholarly work, Watkins edited four volumes of the sacred
music of Carlo Gesualdo. This served as impetus for his now-famous book on
Gesualdo. In May 1995, an opera based on the life of Gesualdo (by the
Russian composer Alfred Schnittke, with whom Watkins collaborated in 1992)
premiered at the Vienna State Opera. This afforded Watkins, who spoke from
the stage of the opera house at a matinee, yet another opportunity as
protagonist for the composer who has loomed large in much of his scholarly
career.
Professor Watkins is also a scholar of 20th century music. His panoramic
survey of 20th century music, Soundings, has become a standard text in
universities and conservatories throughout the country. His most recent
book, Pyramids at the Louvre, examines, among other things, "the subtlety
and power of interdisciplinary collusion between music and the other arts."
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Glenn E.
Watkins the Earl V. Moore Professor Emeritus of Music (music history/
musicology).

May Meeting, 1997


Memorial Statements. Secretary Palmer submitted two memorial
statements.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death on April 27, 1997, of Robert Lyons Danly, professor of
Japanese language and literature, award-winning writer and translator, and
former director of the Center for Japanese Studies.
Born on January 3, 1947, in Oak Park, Illinois, Professor Danly received
his bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1969 and spent three years as a
copywriter for the Asian Advertising Agency in Tokyo before returning to
Yale to complete his doctorate in 1980. He joined the University faculty in
1979. A popular teacher, Professor Danly received the Class of 1923 Award
for outstanding teaching of undergraduates in 1984. He was also dedicated to
training graduate students, some of whom now teach in important institutions
across the country. From 1982-86, he directed a popular translation workshop
for the Program in Comparative Literature. He also served as director of the
Center for Japanese Studies from 1987-93 and was instrumental in
transforming the center's publications program into one of the most highly
regarded American publishers for studies of Japanese literature, culture, and
history.
A leading expert in Japanese literature, Professor Danly achieved
distinction when his first book, In the Shade of Spring Leaves: The Life and
Writings ofHiguchi Ichiyo, A Woman of Letters in Meiji Japan, published by
Yale University Press in 1981, won the 1982 National Book Award for
translation. He edited selections of Japanese literature for The Norton
Anthology of World Masterpieces, writing introductions to guide Western
readers. At the time of his death, Professor Danly had completed a book
manuscript titled Worldly Reckonings, an annotated translation of Seken
munezan'yo (1692) by Ihara Saikaku. Shortly before he became ill in the fall
of 1995, he had begun a new translation for Norton Press of the Tale of Genji,
the great masterpiece of Japanese prose fiction written by Murasaki Shikibu
in the eleventh century.
Professor Danly will be greatly missed as a scholar, teacher, colleague,
and friend. As we mourn the loss of this distinguished colleague, our
condolences go to his parents, Donald and Mary Danly, and his three sisters,
Christina Denton, Beth Burtt, and Catharine Zoufal.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death on March 22, 1997, of Takaharu Yamakawa, associate
librarian in the University Library.
Mr. Yamakawa was born in Japan in 1937. He received his B.A. degree
from Aichi University of Education in Nagoya, Japan, his M.A. degree from
Southern Illinois University, and his A.M.L.S. degree in 1977 from the
University of Chicago. He joined the staff of the University Library as an
assistant librarian in 1977.
During his tenure at the University of Michigan, Mr. Yamakawa worked
in the Asia Library, the Map Library, and in Special Formats Cataloging. He
is recognized for the excellence of his work in the cataloging of Japanese
materials, rare maps, and the Shakespeare Collection and in the provision of


351




May Meeting, 1997


reference services. In addition, he contributed to the strength of the Library's
collection by serving as the selector for the field of linguistics.
Mr. Yamakawa, known to his friends and colleagues in the library and on
campus as Yama, brought to his work his sincere dedication to the well-being
of the library as well as wit, humor, and a sense of camaraderie. As we
mourn the loss of this distinguished librarian, our condolences go to his wife,
Karen, and his daughter, Ellie.
Degrees. There were no actions with respect to degrees this month.
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Horning,
seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the
consent agenda.
Six Month Report on University Audits
Mr. Carl Smith, director of University audits, submitted the regular Six
Month Report on University Audits.
Federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133
Audit Reports and Schedules for the Year Ended June 30, 1996
and Summary of Recommendations and Responses to Nonmaterial
Findings as reported by Ernst & Young LLP
Associate Vice President Herbert submitted the Federal Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 Audit Reports and Schedules
for the Year Ended June 30, 1996, and the summary of recommendations and
responses to nonmaterial findings as reported by Ernst & Young LLP.
Active Commodities Investment
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the MS Commodity Investment Portfolio II, L.P., as
an actively managed commodity investment vehicle, pending favorable legal
review of the documents by the general counsel's office.
Alternative Asset Investments
Wind Point Partners III, L.P. Associate Vice President Herbert submitted a recommendation for commitment of $15 million of the Long Term
Portfolio to two venture capital investments: Wind Point Partners III, L.P.,
and Advent International Global Private Equity III Limited Partnership. He:
pointed out that negotiation is ongoing regarding covering the costs for
establishing the Wind Point office in the state of Michigan. The desire on the
part of the partnership is that those costs be covered by the Michigan investors.
Regent Newman expressed concern about the University being required
by the state to help fund the cost of establishing a Wind Point office in the
state, since it was state officials who chose an out-of-state firm. In response
to her question about the benefit of having an office in Michigan, Mr.
Herbert responded that the presence of a venture capital firm would enhance
the state's image in this area, and that this is critical to increasing the
amount of venture capital funds available.


352




May Meeting, 1997


President Bollinger observed that the University is participating with
the state in this as a willing partner in helping to achieve a goal that has
been set by the state. Regent McFee pointed out that this would facilitate
the University's technology transfer efforts.
Advent International Global Private Equity Ill Limited Partnership. Associate Vice President Herbert described the proposed investment in
this fund, noting that it seeks to invest in profitable companies in Europe,
North America, and Asia.
Regent McGowan moved that $5.0 million of the Long Term Portfolio be
committed to Wind Point Partners III, L.P., and $10.0 million be committed
to Advent International Global Private Equity III Limited Partnership,
pending favorable review of the documents by the general counsel's office.
Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Pledge of General Revenues to Replace Specific Revenues for Tax
Exempt Debt
Associate Vice President Herbert noted that as a constitutionally
autonomous body constituting a coequal fourth branch of state government,
the Regents are empowered to structure the University's debt. In the past,
this debt has been covered by pledges of specific revenue streams. It is now
proposed that the University improve this structure by financing its projects
using tax exempt debt backed by a general revenue pledge instead of a
specific revenue pledge. The proposed general revenue pledge will include
student fees; revenues from athletics, housing, Institute of Continuing Legal
Education, Management Education, and parking; and unrestricted gifts,
grants, and investment earnings. It will not include state appropriations,
Hospital gross revenues, and Medical Service Plan revenues.
Benefits of the general revenue pledge are that it will simplify the
approach to the issuance of debt and offer more broadly-based security for
the bondholder. It will afford greater flexibility for the University, will
minimize SEC disclosure requirements, and lower costs.
Following some discussion of the differences between the debt practices
of public and private institutions, President Bollinger requested that a legal
analysis be performed at some point in the future.
Regent McFee moved adoption of the following resolution:
Be it resolved that the Regents intend to use a general revenue
financing pledge for all future projects of the University, excluding
projects of the Hospital or Medical Service Plan. The general revenue
pledge will not include state appropriations, Hospital gross revenues,
and Medical Service Plan revenues.
Regent Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Renovation Projects
Regarding the State Street Park N Ride project, Associate Vice
President Herbert noted that this agreement parallels a previous agreement


353




May Meeting, 1997


with the city of Ann Arbor for the Green Road Pilot Park N Ride project, in
which the city funds construction of a parking lot and the University
assumes responsibility for maintaining the lot. This will help the city as it
implements recently announced plans for parking structure renovations that
will result in the temporary loss of a number of city parking spaces.
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved the Central Campus Recreation Building
Direct Digital Controls retrofit project and the State Street Park N Ride
project, as described in the Regents Communication.
Canham Natatorium Building Renewal
Associate Vice President Herbert reviewed the problems that have
developed in the Donald B. Canham Natatorium involving water quality, air
quality, and the building envelope, as well as the solutions that have been
proposed to solve these problems (details are contained in the Regents
Communication).
In response to a question from Regent Newman regarding possible
liability on the part of the firm that designed the facility, Associate Vice
President Herbert stated that the University has determined that there is no
responsibility or liability for this situation on the part of the design firm.
Regarding the revenues to be used to pay for the project, he noted that the
financing would be secured by a pledge of general revenues but internally
paid from intercollegiate athletics revenues.
Regent Newman stated it was her understanding that football prices had
been raised partially to fund this project. It was noted that this was one of
several projects contemplated by the Department of Athletics for these funds
because of the ongoing need for physical facilities renovation in that
department.   Associate Vice President Herbert noted that specific
authorization for approval of the financing plan will be sought once the
renovation plan and timing has been specified. The project is not slated to
begin until April 1998; financing will not be necessary until closer to that
time.
It was also pointed out that temporary adjustments have been made to
alleviate any potential health risks associated with the current condition of
the facility.
Following further discussion, Regent Horning moved approval of the
Canham Natatorium Renewal Project, as described in the Regents Communication.  Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
University of Michigan Hospitals Relocation and Expansion of
Radiology Services at Briarwood
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Power, the
Regents unanimously approved a project for relocation and expansion of UM
Hospitals Radiology Services from its current location in the Briarwood Mall
area to larger quarters in that area, as described in the Regents


354




May Meeting, 1997


Communication. Regent McGowan was away from the table when the vote
was taken.

the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM)
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Maynard, all six
Regents present unanimously approved a research subcontract between
University of Michigan and the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan
(ERIM). Because two ERIM employees working on this subcontract (Robert
G. Onstott and Kenneth W. Fischer) are also employees of the University of
Michigan, this subcontract falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and the
Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, International, Inc.
(ERIM).

Naval Research to the University of Michigan is for $333,504. The
total subcontract from the UM to ERIM is for $23,500. The ONR
funding will come to the UM, and then the amount of the
subcontract would be paid by the UM to ERIM in two separate
increments.
3.  Neither Robert Onstott nor Kenneth Fischer will be working at the
University of Michigan on the ONR award.

Friday, May 16, 1997
The Regents met in public session at 11:25 a.m., following the
conclusion of their executive session. Present were President Bollinger and
Regents Deitch, Maynard, McFee, Newman, and Power. Also present were
Provost Machen, Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford, and Neidhardt,
Associate Vice President Herbert, and Secretary Palmer. Regents Taylor,
Horning, and McGowan, and Chancellors Nelms and Renick were absent.
UM Hospitals Comparative Statistic Report
President Bollinger called on Mr. David Southwell, associate hospital
director for finance, who presented a comparative statistic report for
University of Michigan Hospitals for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996.
The report included financial ratios covering three major components of
financial performance: profitability, liquidity, and capital structure, and
compared the UM Hospitals' ratios to the average of Standard & Poors "AA"
rated hospitals, teaching hospitals, and all hospitals.  The report also
included patient activity statistics comparing UM Hospitals' activity levels
with those of other teaching hospitals and all hospitals.
In general, profitability ratios were lower than they have been in the
past; liquidity and capital structure statistics were generally favorable; and
patient activity statistics were very favorable.
Following the presentation, Regent Power asked when the statistics for
fiscal year 1996-97 would be available. Mr. Southwell responded that
year-end information would be available in late July, and that a preview of
the forecast would be included as part of the Health System budget
presentation to the Board at its June meeting. Regent Power observed that
the Board and president are very interested in financial conditions both at
UM Hospitals and within the health care industry, and that it would be very
helpful to them to be kept current in these areas.

May Meeting, 1997


Report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty
(CESF)
President Bollinger called on Professor Robert Lindsey, chair of CESF,
who presented the annual CESF report. The report concentrated on three
areas:  compensation policy, benefits, and faculty compensation levels.
Professor Lindsey noted that the committee has drafted a set of faculty
compensation guidelines which will be submitted to the Faculty Senate for
wider debate and then discussed with the provost. Regarding benefits, the
committee believes that the University benefits program is strong and
endorses the increasing range of choices being made available through the
flexible benefits program. He urged that faculty continue to be included in
discussions of contemplated benefits changes.  With regard to faculty
compensation, Professor Lindsey noted that the University's salaries lag
behind those of the top private universities, but are competitive with those of
the best public institutions.
Regent McFee observed that the total compensation package involves
much more than simply the salary figure.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 12:00
noon. The next meeting is scheduled for June 12-13, 1997. Regents' expenses
for April 1997 totaled $1,425.90.

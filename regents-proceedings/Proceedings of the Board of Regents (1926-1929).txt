On the report of the Secretary of the resignation of Mr.
Paul Buckley as Assistant Secretary of the University, the
committee appointed to be Assistant Secretary of the University Herbert G. Watkins, A.B., of the class of 1912, to
date from September I, or such day near that date as Mr.
Watkins shall begin his duties. This appointment is on the
following terms: $4,000 per annum to January i, I927, then
$4,250 to July I, 1927, then $4,500 for the fiscal year I927 -1928, with an increase July I, I928, to $5,ooo, all these increases being conditioned on development and efficiency.

The committee approved issuing an eighth edition of
"Michigan Trees" at an estimated cost of $4,5II for ten
thousand cloth-bound copies, which are to be sold at seventyfive cents each. Twenty thousand copies of this book have
been sold; an edition of fifty-five hundred published during
the last University year is nearly exhausted. A continuing demand necessitates issuing this new edition.
July 23, I926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
On the recommendation of Dean Cooley and Professor
Sadler the committee approved certain rearrangements in the
salary account of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering, necessitated by the fact that Mr. Ralph Upson will be
unable to give as much time to his course of lectures during
the University year I926-1927 as in previous years. Under
the approved arrangement Mr. Upson will receive $250 as
lecturer and the $250 remaining in the amount allowed in the
budget for his compensation will be added to the salary of
Assistant Professor Edward A. Stalker, who has worked
with Mr. Upson during the past two years and who will take
charge of the general course in "Lighter than Air Craft."

Sawyer.
The committee approved the appointment of Mr. Fred
Link as instrument maker in the Department of Physics from
July I, 1926 to June 30, 1927 with salary of $2,000, twelvemonths basis. As only $1,900 was provided in the budget for
this position, the committee directed a transfer of $0oo from
the account for new equipment in the departmental budget to
the salary account.
On the recommendation of Dean Cabot, Associate Professor Frederick A. Coller was granted leave of absence with
pay for the months of October and November. Professor
Coller is to visit clinics in England, France, and Italy.
July 28, 1926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and   Regent

On the recommendation of Dean Effinger and Dean
Lloyd, the committee approved the promotion of Mr. Adelbert Ford, Instructor in Psychology, to be Assistant Professor
of Psychology, with an increase in salary for the University
year I926-I927, from  $2600 to $2800.   This action adds
$200 to the salary account of the departmental budget. Doctor
Ford has refused a call to an Assistant Professorship in another University in order to remain in Ann Arbor.
July 30, 1926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent

Honorable Carmi A. Thompson, head of the U. S. Commission now engaged in investigations on behalf of the Federal Government in the Philippine Islands, having cabled requesting the University to authorize Professor J. R. Hayden
to remain in the Philippines through the month of September,
since Professor Hayden was needed in the survey of the
Philippines, the committee authorized Professor Hayden to
remain as requested.
August 6, 1926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee granted leave of absence with salary to
Dr. F. G. Novy for the month of October. Dr. Novy had
given up his vacation time in order that he might superintend the moving of his department into the new East Medical Building.
The committee approved payment to the widow of Tracey
Thompson, carpenter foreman, who died July 25, of the salary of her late husband for ninety days from the date of his
death. It is understood that there will be no increase in the
budget of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.
The committee also approved making available for Professor H. W. Miller of the Department of Mechanism and
Engineering Drawing the sum of $200 which was realized
during the year I925-I926 from the sale of a multigraph machine, surplus property in the department.
The request of Professor H. H. Bartlett for an additional appointment for a three-fourths-time instructor and an
increase in said instructor's salary was also granted. Under
this action Mr. Carl O. Erlanson, now holding a threefourths-time instructorship in Botany with compensation of
$I,200, is also appointed Research Assistant at the Botanical
Garden on full time for the three summer months and on onefourth time during the academic year, at an addition of $800
to his present salary. This additional amount is to be made
up as follows: a balance carried over from the I925-1926
salary account, $400; from the current expense fund of the
garden, $400.

August II, I926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee approved leaves of absence, indeterminate,
but probably not to exceed the first three weeks of the coming
University year for Messrs. Robert B. Hall and Preston E.
James of the Department of Geography. Professor James
and Mr. Hall are to be in Haiti, the Virgin Islands, and
Porto Rico in government service for approximately one
month after the close of the Summer Session. As they are to
travel on a transport, there is some uncertainty as to the
date of their return. Arrangements have been made to care
for their courses in the department.
The committee further approved the request of Dean
Bates to add the unassigned item of $500 in the salary account
of the budget of the Law School for I926-I927 to the salary of
Professor Burke Shartel.
August I4, I926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee appropriated $I,400 for the continuation
of the University broadcasting during the year 1926-1927.
This sum is to be divided as follows:
Piano rental from October I926 to June, 1927    $200
Compensation to Mr. Waldo M. Abbot as Program
Director                                     300
For the printing of the bulletin containing the radio
addresses                                    400
For incidentals, stationery, postage, equipment, and
so forth                                     I00
To provide for possible royalty claims at a maximum
charge of $25 per hour by the Association of
Composers and Publishers                     400
The officials of the "Detroit News" point out that by a
recent court decision it would be necessary for the University
to be prepared to pay these royalty charges in case music is
used which is copyrighted by the above Association. The
"Detroit News," in placing the facilities of its excellent station at the disposal of the University, does not feel that it
should be called upon to pay any royalty claims which may
be raised.
It was necessary that action should be taken previous
to the September meeting in order that arrangements might
be made with the "Detroit News" for the coming year.




8             SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1926
August 25, I926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee appointed Professor James B. Pollock
Acting Chairman of the Department of Botany during the
absence of Professor Harley H. Bartlett. Professor Pollock
was nominated for the position by the staff of the department.
The salary of Assistant Professor Norman L. Willey of
the Department of German, for the University year I926 -1927, was increased from $2,700 to $3,000 and a transfer of
$300 authorized from the salary account in the budget of the
Department of Public Speaking.
August 29, I926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee approved the appointment of Genevieve
A. Sproat, A.B., as Secretary to the Registrar to date from
September 13, 1926, with salary at the rate of $I,8oo per
annum, twelve-months basis. Miss Sproat's appointment is
vice Miss Virginia Tryon who resigned as of October I.
It was desired to have Miss Sproat on duty for approximately
two weeks before Miss Tryon actually left. As Miss Tryon's
salary has been at the rate of $1,600 per year the above action
adds the sum of $372.84 to the Salary budget of the Registrar for the fiscal year. While it was desired that some
engagement for an increase of salary for Mis's Sproat in
I927-I928 should be made, the committee expressly stated that
no responsibility for such promise of increase could be involved.
The Secretary filed the following report in behalf of
the Buildings and Grounds Committee, which report was
approved and confirmed, including appropriation of $10,900
recommended for tunnel construction.        (R. P. I923-I926,
pages 909-910):I beg to report for Regent Clements that a contract has
been executed with the Henry C. Weber Construction Company of Bay City for the erection of the building for the
College of Architecture under the following conditions:



SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1926.9


General Contract, Weber Construction Co.  $303,052.60
Trades to be done by the University estimated
as follows:Electric Wiring             $1;o,o65.93
Plumbing                     10,854.63
Heating                      20,983.56
Temperature Control           4,855.00
Sheet Metal Work             12,535.00
59,294. I2
Cost of drafting plans and of inspection (the
latter estimated)                        18,000.00
Electric fixtures, estimated                 4,650.00
Delivery cost of gravel from our own pit     2,0Io.00
Total                                     $387,095.72
From this should be deducted the following:Special allowances by stone
contractors             $ 2,440.00
By temperature control contractor                    365.00
By Crane Company              1,200.00
Options on four certain omissions provided for in the
contract                 I 1,474.oo
$; 15,479.00
Net                                       $371,617.72
Thus the estimated cost at which this building could be
completed and used is $371,617.72. The margin within the
$400,000 appropriated for the building is thus $28,382.28.
Professor Lorch expects to.use his old equipment and
agrees that he can get on with it in the new building, even
though this arrangement is not ideal. It was absolutely necessary to make most drastic cuts in order to get the building
in usable condition, under any circumstances.
It is very important that the Regents should realize that
the above arrangement and estimates contemplate the provision by the University at the expense of the general funds of
the heating tunnel and service connections. These estimates
are $Io,9oo.  Connections to other buildings, with the exception of the University Hospital, were made by the University out of general funds. This appropriation should be
made at once if the Board approves.




IO            SEPTEMiBER MEETING, 1926
Grading, sidewalks, landscaping, and window shades are
not included in the estimates.
No contractor's bond has been taken.
Plans and specifications were approved by Mr. George
D. Mason, the architect, of Detroit, satisfactorily to Regent
Clements.
The date of the completion of the building is August
15, I927.
The. Secretary filed a report for the committee, consisting of Regent Beal and the Secretary, for the acquirement
of land for the Architecture Building and Museum         Building sites, as follows:I beg to report for the committee consisting of Regent
Beal and myself, appointed (R. P. 1923-I926, page. 603)

In addition there was bought out of this appropriation,
just across the street from the Women's Athletic Field, lot
14, block I, R. S. Smith's Addition, $8,500.
Miscellaneous legal, survey, and appraisal fees, and one
commission have been paid to a total of $2,980.23.
The grand total thus expended from the legislative appropriation of $500,000 is, to date, $455,575.48.
One certain check has not been delivered because of the
dispute between the sellers as to the division of the check
between them. This will ultimately be cleared up. There is
no question about the purchase.
All of the above land has been acquired by purchase with
the exception of the two pieces acquired by condemnation and
reported to the Board in March (R. P. I923-I926, page 838).
There thus remains an unexpended balance in the Legislative appropriation for land of $44,424.52.
Out of this balance there are payable commissions to
Mr. Charles Brooks of an amount not in excess of $4,500.
Your committee, with the President, hope to be able to
make certain recommendations for the use of this balance at
the meeting of September 23.
With regard to the closing of Volland Street as a necessary part of the provision of a site for the Museum Building:
we would report that in accordance with authority given at
the May meeting (R. P. I923-1926, page 895), we took up
this matter with the City Council, taking the necessary legal
steps. In due course the Common Council of Ann Arbor at
a meeting held July I9, I926 took the following action:"In accordance with the Regents' proposal the Council agreed to close Volland Street from Fourteenth Street
to Washtenaw Avenue at such time as the City should
receive from the Regents a warranty deed to a strip of
land at least 66 feet in width extending from North
University Avenue easterly to Fourteenth Street, without
cost to the City. It was understood and agreed between
all concerned that the University would at its expense
grade and' gravel North University Avenue to Fourteenth Street in accordance with grade to be established
by the City Engineer and in a manner satisfactory to the
Ann Arbor Board of Public Works, and upon condition
further that the University would build a curb, gutter,
and sidewalk on both sides of North University Avenue




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1926


I3


from its present eastern end to its intersection with Fourteenth Street."
This was all in accordance with your committee's understanding with the City with the exception that in accordance
with a letter filed with the City Clerk by the undersigned
under date of July 24 it is our understanding that the City
will pay the same share of the curb and gutter cost that it
pays in other cases,-that is, the University will stand the full
proportion and no more, of the cost of curb and gutter, that
any other propertyholder would stand. I have been advised
orally by Mr. Campbell, as Mayor of Ann Arbor, that such is
the City's intention. The entire cost of extending North University Avenue as well as of the extension of Forest Avenue
to Fourteenth Street is estimated by Superintendent Pardon
at $20,220 and this expense is already provided for by the appropriation made for extending Forest Avenue a year or two
ago and still carried in the budget.
I should include in this report the fact that five houses
were moved from the Architecture Building site to land which
the University has for sale on South State Street; three 'of
these five houses have now been sold on contract; the contracts are being turned over as investments of University
trust funds. When the two remaining houses are sold a
detailed report will be made giving definite figures throughout.  Authority to move these houses was given by the
Board (R. P. I923-I926, page 785).
From the Museum Building site four houses are being
moved for similar sale as a means of realizing from these
houses considerably more than could be realized by selling
them for wrecking or by selling them to persons who would
remove them intact. Five other of these houses are being
moved to locations where they can be easily heated from the
central heating plant and used by the University Hospital as
employees' residences, thus relieving the hospital from the
expense of paying rent to private owners for such accommodations. The hospital's expense of this nature at present
amounts to about $3,00o per month, and it is agreed by Dr.
Haynes that the hospital will on a monthly rental basis reimburse the general University funds for the expense of moving these houses and that after these expenses are thus fully
paid the hospital will have the benefit of the savings in
rent. Full, detailed report will be made when the transaction
is completed.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1926


The following regulations were adopted in accordance
with the By-Laws, chapter III-B, sections 8 and 9:i. All keys to University buildings, except the University
Hospital, at present in hands of any person whatsoever, are
hereby called in for (I) checking, or (2) exchange for proper
keys, or (3) surrender if in accordance with provisions below
they should not be reissued or exchanged.
2. Keys shall hereafter be issued only by the office of
the Buildings and Grounds Department, or its authorized
representatives.
3. Keys other than master keys shall be issued on proper
receipt (including agreement to report loss promptly and to
return when use is ended) to all applying members of the University staff on permanent or indeterminate appointments, on
approval of their department heads in cases where such heads
have requested no issues except on such approvals. Members
of the University staff on annual or shorter appointments may
secure keys, with approval of department heads, and on deposit
of 50c per such key. Master keys will be issued under the
same general conditions, but only on deposit of $2 per key,
for all alike. Exchanges of master keys under (I) above will
not require deposit. Keys for strictly office rather than individual use may be issued without deposit. Deposits will be
returned in all cases on return of keys, duplicate receipts for
deposits being held in the office of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, as evidence in case of loss of original
receipts.
4. Every key issued shall be stamped with a special
distinguishing University mark.
5. It will hereafter be regarded as contrary to University
policy for any one to have in his or her possession any key
to University buildings or parts of buildings if such key is
not stamped as provided in (4) above. If such unauthorized
keys are found, the case shall be referred to the dean or other
proper head of the University division involved for his action
in accordance with this principle. Any watchman or other
proper representative of the Buildings and Grounds Department, or any dean, department head, or other proper University official shall have the right to inspect keys believed to
open University buildings, at any reasonable time or place.
6. No keys, cylinders, or locks shall be ordered and
none shall be placed except by the Buildings and Grounds
Department, which will employ an expert in general charge of




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1926

such matters. His headquarters, except during the preliminary period mentioned in (I) above shall be in the office of
the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. For any individual to order, have made, or permit to be ordered or made,
any duplicate of his or her University key, through unauthorized channels, must be regarded as a special and wilful
disregard of the safety of University property.
The Secretary filed a copy of the last will and testament of Walter E. Emery, class of         i907, of   Oakland
County, Miichigan, who died January 3, 1926, under item
IV of which the University was made a contingent beneficiary.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1926


The   Secretary   transmitted   the  resignation  of   taul
Buckley as Assistant Secretary as follows:My Dear Mr. Smith:I hereby tender my formal resignation as Assistant Secretary of the Regents and of the University to take effect
August 31 next.
For your many kindnesses and consideration shown me by
the Regents and Presidents Hutchins, Burton, Lloyd, and
Little, I am deeply appreciative. To me our relationship has
been uniformly pleasant and profitable, and in my new position with the Union I trust I may continue to have your cooperation in serving the University.
The opportunity for service to the University and the
chance to remain in close connection with its officials appeal
strongly to me, and in a way reconcile me in severing our
present relationship.
Sincerely yours,
Paul Buckley

The committee granted permission to Dean John R. Effinger to be absent from Ann Arbor during the month of
October in order that he might inspect a considerable number of universities on the Pacific coast and elsewhere in the

October 5, 1926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee granted leave of absence, with salary, to
Professor S. Lawrence Bigelow for the first half of the first
semester of the present academic year. This action was taken
in view of the serious illness of Mrs. Bigelow which necessitates Professor Bigelow's absence. Arrangements have been
made to carry on his work in his absence.
The committee also approved the establishment of a
Naval Reserve Aviation Unit at the University of Michigan,
with the understanding that no additional expense to the University is involved. The plan is to give at the -University the
ground training specified by the Government in the Uniform
Syllabus for Training of Student Naval Reserve Aviators.
Some of the instruction will be given in courses already included in the curriculum and the remainder will be given
by instructors furnished by the United States Navy Department.
October 8, I925
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee approved the suggestion of Professor Van
Tyne of the Department of History to use $Ioo from the
$5,000 which stands in the budget of that department, still
unused. It is desired to invite Professor Ramsay Muir, who
is one of the most distinguished historians in the field of
Modern European History, to lecture here some time betwveen
October 24 and November 12, and the sum involved is to be
his honorarium.
October 8, I926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee approved the addition of $3,700 to the
budget of the Department of Literature, Science, and the
Arts. It is understood that this sum involves the expenditure
of certain specified amounts as follows:Geography, $300, to take care of an extra two-hour
section to be allotted to Mr. Edward Prophet thereby
increasing his salary from $700 to $900. In addition to
this amount $Ioo is to be added to the amount specified
for assistants, making a total of $700 for that purpose.
Geology, $200, in order that the department may

have one more assistant, at $I50, than was provided for.
The budget is at present $50 overdrawn so that this additional amount will be used to balance the appointments
made thus far.
German, $I,500, to be used for the salary of another
instructor made necessary by the unexpectedly large numbers of elections in elementary German which are I50
more than last year. It is expected that Mr. H. A. Gnatkowski will be appointed to this instructorship.
Psychology, $800, to be used for the appointment of
a. Half-time Instructor, Mr. Leon B. Slater.
Zoology, $goo, in order that the status of Mr. Frank
E. Eggleton may be changed from Half-time Instructor

October 9, I926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The Executive Committee added $9oo to the Salary budget of the Department of Mathematics of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, as made necessary by the enrollment of additional students. This addition is intended to
be used for the appointment of Mr., William R. Jones as
Half-time Instructor.
The committee also accepted the resignations of Clair
Reid and Maurice Johnson, and approved the promotion of
Mr. L. WV. Cohen to Instructor from Half-time Instructor
thereby increasing his salary from $900 to $I,8oo. The appointment of Mr. J. Hobart Bushey as Instructor at $I,8oo
was approved.
Appointments of the following part-time assistants were
made for the University year:Guy H. Amerman                      $300
Donald B. Dahn                      $300

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1926


October I4, I926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
Professor Thieme communicated the fact that Mr. Michael De Filippis had developed tuberculosis and that an immediate leave of absence was necessary in his case. The committee granted this leave with half salary, to begin October
i6 and to continue if necessary for the remainder of the
present University year. Mr. De Filippis's work can be cared
for during his absence by the assumption of a portion of it,
gratis, by other members of the Faculty, and by the following two changes in appointments:Frank A. Bonasi changed from Half-time Instructor in Romance Languages at $750 to full-time at $1,500
to date from October I6.
Earl A. Resweber changed from Half-time Instructor in Romance Languages at $750 to Three-quarterstime Instructor at $I,I25 per University year to date
from October I6.
The reverting one-half of Mr. De Filippis's salary after
October I6 will provide for these increases to Messrs. Bonasi and Resweber.
October 15, 1926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
At their meeting September 23 the Regents approved the
assignment of a fellowship in Physics, of $i,ooo, to David
Dennison provided that this sum were available for Physics
through the earnings of the Department of Engineering Research, and provided Regent Hanchett on investigation approved. Regent Hanchett approved the fellowship and approved the plan, but it did not appear with any certainty that
actual earnings would he collected before June 30, 1927, sufficient to meet this fellowship. Under the circumstances and
with approval of Regent Hanchett and also, it is believed,
with the approval of all concerned in the Department of
Physics and the Department of Engineering Research, the
Executive Committee approved the assignment of a fellowship to David Dennison, the stipend of $I,ooo to be provided
out of funds available from the proceeds of the WVoodward
Avenue Lease, a trust fund.
The Secretary placed on file a copy of the letter of
Professor Emil Lorch as architect of the newr Architecture

"This scholarship is to be available for freshman and
sophomore students in the College of Engineering of the University of Michigan, and I also specify that there shall be a
committee of three members of the faculty of that College,
of which the Dean should be one, who shall determine the
student to whom the scholarship is to be awarded.
"My desire is that the scholarship should be granted to
students of general worthiness and deserving character. I
do not care to have the money used as a loan or as a prize
for excellency in scholarship.
"Following your suggestion I will leave it in the hands
of the committee to determine the number and size of scholarships to be awarded in any given year.
"Previous correspondence has given in detail my wishes
as to the use of the income. My preference is, if one young
man of worthy and deserving character needs all the income
he should have it, otherwise distribute the amount as the committee sees best."

as they are taken away, which will be replaced by a correct
catalogue as soon as you have time to make one.
We are happy to place this fine material in such good
hands where it will really serve a useful purpose, but naturally we must all be true to our obligations to the donor.

care of this property by the Detroit Trust Company (R.P.
I923-1926, page 8i ) was directed by the Regents to be
cancelled, and the Secretary was empowered to negotiate
at his discretion a contract of the same general nature with
another trust company.

it was the intention of the Board not to promulgate any
terms on which the property owned by the Regents on Elizabeth Street, Detroit, between Witherell and John R streets,

Secretary was instructed to report to the Board any offers
which might be made for purchase or lease and in the

be feasible.
Leave of absence for the second semester of the year
1926-I927, without salary, and with the privilege of extending the leave through the first semester of the year I927 -1928, was granted to Martha Guernsey, Instructor in Psychology.
The President reported correspondence with Drs. Burrett and Boyd of the New York Homoeopathic Mledical College and Flower Hospital suggesting that in view of the discontinuance of Homoeopathic medical courses in the University of Michigan, the Homoeopathic medical library
might well be presented to or loaned to the library of this

In accordance with a letter from Miss Mary Turner,
donor of the Jane Turner loan fund, the terms of this fund

Women should have authority, at the discretion of the Dean
or those acting in the capacity of Dean of Women, to use
not to exceed $500 per annum, so long as available funds
in the Jane Turner loan fund shall permit, for outright
allowances or gifts to individual students in cases of emergency meriting such assistance and promising good resulti
therefrom (R.P. I9I4-19I7, pages 748-749).

Communications were received embodying the action of
the Michigan State Federation of Women's Clubs in convention in Ann Arbor October 21 and 22, I926, by which

that an annual report shall be submitted to the Federation,
(R.P. I90o-I906, pages 320-322, and R.P. I901-I906, page
557). It was voted that if the counsel of the Board should
certify that such changes in the terms and conditions of
these two funds could be legally made, the action requested
by the Michigan State Federation of Women's Clubs should
be taken in each case.
The Board authorized the Engineering Shops as a laboratory course in production method to manufacture for Mr.
F. Knowlson of Ann Arbor Io,ooo steel rivets at $5.80 per

desired could legally be made in the former of these funds
and by previous action of the Board these changes in the
terms and conditions of this fund are now to be regarded
as having been made. For the following reasons set forth
by Cavanaugh and Burke the terms of the Alice Freeman
Palmer Scholarship loan fund are to remain unchanged:The Alice Freeman Palmer Scholarship loan fund is
purely a loan fund. No authority exists to change it from
this character to that of a gift fund. It was apparently
created by the Students Lecture Association by action of its
Board dated May 31, 1905.
The language of the first and second paragraphs of the
agreement creating the fund and designating its purpose is
so clear and definite that no other interpretation can be
placed upon it.
It must also appear that there were many other donors
to this particular fund. Each donor, of course, made his gift
subject to the limitations imposed by the original agreement




DECEMBER MEETING, 1926

creating the fund and with the right to assume that the purpose of the gift would not be changed.
Another handicap to the proposal of the State Federation of Women's Clubs, so far as this particular fund is
concerned, is the fact that the fund as at present constituted
is not limited merely for the benefit of women students.
We are of the opinion that the change requested in the
administration of this fund should not be granted.
The Secretary reported the following resignations and
appointments and other changes in the University staff as

with thanks.




00oo        DECEMBER        MEETING, 1926
The thanks of the Regents were voted to Mr. Cecil

The Secretary filed the financial report of the Secretary
and the Treasurer in the usual form for the University
fiscal year ended June 30, 1925. A copy had been mailed
to each member of the Board. Regent Stone presented the
report and certificate of Price, Waterhouse, and Company,
public accountants, covering the audit of the report and of
the books of record for the year upon which the report is
based. Price, Waterhouse, and Company's report was as
tollows:Honorable Ralph Stone,
Chairman of the Finance Committee,
The Regents of the University
of Michigan,
Detroit, Michigan.
Dear Sir:In accordance with instructions received and in continuation of our previous audits we have made an examination of the books and accounts of the University of Michigan
for the year ended June 30, I926. Conforming with the procedure adopted in our previous examinations, our investigation has been directed to the verification of the balance sheet
of the University at June 30, 1926. In addition we have
compared the joint report of the Secretary and Treasurer
with the relative records of the University and have found
that the report has been prepared in accordance with the
records. It will be understood that our examination did not




DECEMBER MEETING., 1926


I 01


include a detailed check of the cash and other transactions
for the period, such as would tend to disclose irregularities
in the accounts of the University should any exist and this
report is submitted subject to this general reservation.
In view of the comprehensive nature of the report of the
Secretary and Treasurer we have not prepared any financial
statements other than a certified balance sheet of the University on a cash basis at June 30, 1926. We are now supplementing this statement by comments and recommendations of
a general nature relative to the accounting procedure of the
University.
UNIVERSITY ACCOUNTS
With reference to our verification of the balance-sheet of
the University at June 30, 1926, we have the following comments to offer:Assets for Current and Special Purposes $1,530,I63.51:
The cash in the custody of the Treasurer at June 30,
1926, amounted to $263,965.4I. The funds on hand were
verified by actual count as of the close of business June 30,
1926, while the cash on deposit at that date was reconciled
with certificates obtained from the depositaries.
The imprest funds of the Hospital and Dental Clinic
aggregated $I,379.50 and the amounts were verified by a
count of these funds. Our verification of the imprest fund
at the University Hospital disclosed the fact that this fund
includes checks amounting to approximately $270 which had
been accepted in settlement of patients' accounts and which
were subsequently protested for non-payment and returned by
the bank. These checks were brought to the attention of the
officers at the Hospital and the University and their inclusion
as a part of the cash fund was thoroughly discussed. We
believe that protested checks should be carried in a separate
account properly designated and not included as a part of the
imprest fund.
Physical inventories of all consumable materials and
supplies were taken as of June 30, 1926, and the value thereof
amounted to $747,I24.96. We have tested the clerical accuracy of the extensions and footings of the inventory sheets
and we have verified the basis of pricing adopted for the
inventories at the general, chemical, and hospital storehouses
and the coal inventory, the values of which aggregated
$425,695.69.




1 02


DECEMBER MEETING, 1926


Furthermore we have been furnished with a certificate
from an official of the University as to the general correctness of the inventories.
The cash in the hands of the State Treasurer for special
purposes at the close of the fiscal period amounted to $5I7,693.64. We have reconciled this amount with a certificate
from the State Administrative Board showing' the balances
of the unexpended appropriations at that date.
Investments-$550,384.4:The balance owing by the State of Michigan to the University at June 30, 1926, amounting to $548,384.40 was confirmed by a letter from the Auditor General. The amount of
the investment in the Treadwell Free Bed Fund has not
changed during the period under review.
Educational Plant-$27,6I8,432.28:The net additions to the University lands during the
year ended June 30, 1926, amounted to $628,960.25 in which
amount were included land purchases of $517,I62.75 and land
gifts of a stated value of $II4,544.00. We have examined
recorded deeds conveying all lands acquired to the Regents
of the University of Michigan.   The property acquired
from Mrs. Alice M. Flook at 1223 Washtenaw Avenue was
encumbered by. a mortgage for $3,800 at June 30, I926.. This
mortgage was discharged during July 1926, but because the
accounts of the University are kept on a cash basis no record
of this obligation was reflected in the statements at the close
of the year.
During the month of June I926 the land account has
been credited with $5oo representing the first payment on a
land contract for the sale of two vacant lots to Earl G. and
Martha L. Fingerle for $5,ooo. At June 30, I926, the balance
owing to the University on this contract was $4,500, although
the only evidence thereof was the reduction of the land account by the amount of the down payment. We understand
that since the close of the year this contract has been purchased by one of the trust funds held by the Treasurer and
the transaction thus closed on the books of the University.
The net additions to buildings for the year amounted to
$495,076.41. We have examined receipted vouchers in support
of the expenditures for these additions.  The charge for
additions to the Physics Building in the amount of $3,412.I7
is an error. The item represents a transfer from one appro



DECEMBER MEETING, 1926


1o03


priation to another in connection with the building program.
We have been informed that the necessary correction will be
made during the current year.
Land improvements and equipment have been increased
$39,I25.I8 and $920,214.12 respectively during the year. The
expenditures in respect of the additions to these accounts
were substantiated by reference to vendors' vouchers which
in all cases had been properly receipted.  The equipment
additions at the University Health Service include a duplicate
charge of $ioo for a clock donated by Mr. M. G. Billingslea.
This clock was purchased with the funds provided by the
donor on a trust fund voucher and was also listed as a gift
received during the year.
Investments, Trust Funds-$3, 26,332.45:The securities held in trust by the Treasurer of the
University at June 30, 1926, at a carrying value of $2,483,859.09 have been verified by an inspection of all securities in
the custody of the Treasurer and by certificates obtained
from the various depositaries holding securities for collection.
All purchases and sales of securities during the year under
review have been properly accounted for.
In verifying the proration of income from the securities
our' examination disclosed the fact that the James B. Angell
Fund and the Cornelius Donovan scholarship had not been
credited with the proper income accruing thereto during the
year to an amount aggregating approximately $300. This
deficiency in the income assignable to these funds had been
allocated in error to the other trust funds. We understand
that an adjustment giving effect to the proper proration of
this income will be made when the income from the trust
funds is apportioned at December 31, 1926.
The mortgage of John C. Wahr belonging to the
Alumnae Council Fund is held at the Ann Arbor Savings
Bank for collection. The interest due on this mortgage on
March 24, 1926, in the amount of $300 was collected by the
bank but had not been turned over to the Treasurer of the
University at June 30, 1926, nor had it been received from
the bank at the time of our examination. We would recommend the keeping of some record in the Treasurer's office
which will insure tle prompt remittance of receipts from collection agents for securities of the deposit accounts as well
as the trust funds.
The trust fund real estate at June 30, 1926, amounted to




io4          DECEMvBER MEETING, 1926
$485,703.68. There has been no change in this investment
since the date of our last examination. The mixed properties
of the trust funds consisted of the uncollected principal'of a
land contract which was examined at the office of the collection agent.
The cash balances of the various trust funds and deposit
accounts amounted to I$55,0I3.I4 at June 30, 1926, and the
respective amounts have been verified by or reconciled with
certificates obtained from the banks where the funds are
deposited.
At the present time disbursements from the trust funds
and deposit accounts, are recorded on a voucher differing
from the voucher on which disbursements from the general
funds are recorded although all receipts, irrespective of their
source, are recorded on uniform tickets. As the trust funds
and deposit accounts increase in numbers and amounts the
proper accounting procedure in respect of the transactions
relative to the administration of these funds will be more
complicated and voluminous.  It will, therefore, in  our
opinion, be advisable for the records of these funds to be
kept entirely independent of the general funds of the University. This will necessitate a separate form for receipts
from trust fund transactions as distinguished from the form
used to record receipts of the general funds. We believe
that this distinction in the classification of the record of
receipts can be affected in a manner which will assist materially in recording the transactions and in eliminating the
errors in distributing receipts between general and trust
'funds which may be expected to arise under the present
methods with the continued increase in the volume of the
trust funds.
We are informed that the Treasurer of the University
acts as the custodian for the funds of such institutions as
Martha Cook, Helen Newberry, and Betsy Barbour Dormitories and other related organizations of the University. In
view of this relationship we believe that the operations of the
institutions of this nature should be audited periodically and
copies of the reports of these examinations furnished to
Regents and the interested officers of the University.
GI ENRAL
In considering the annexed balance sheet of the University at June 30, 1926, it should be understood that it is based
on the cash actually received and disbursed by the University




DECEMBER MEETING, 1926


105


to that date. To the extent that vouchers covering disbursements remained unpaid and charges for service rendered
were uncollected together with items of accrued income not
yet payable to the University at the close of the year, this
balance sheet is incomplete.
The books and accounts at the   University have been
accurately and carefully kept during the period under review.
It will be apparent that the errors referred to in the foregoing comments are of a relatively minor nature and considering the voluminous transactions of the institution the
effect of these adjustments on the results from the operations
of the University would be negligible.
UNIVERSIT'Y HOSPITAL
At June 30, I926, the accounting system in force at the
University Hospital was incomplete and inadequate. There
were no proper controls for the patients' accounts although
the transactions in each patient's account had been legibly
recorded. It was, therefore, impossible for us to determine
the aggregate of amounts owing to the University Hospital
from patients at that date. We are informed that this condition has been attributable to the fact that the installation
of a proper accounting system has been a much greater task
than was originally contemplated. It has been necessary to
educate the entire staff, both clerical and hospital, in the revised accounting procedure. In addition, the opening of the
new hospital with the immediate increase in the number of
patients has introduced additional complications. The result
of these conditions has been that at June 30, I926, the system
of accounting at the Hospital failed to set forth the correct
information regarding the financial position of that institution
or the results from its operation.
However, we are convinced that the proposed system
of accounting as outlined for the Hospital is basically sound
and that with proper administration it can be made effectively
operative.
In conclusion we wish to acknowledge the courtesies and
assistance which were extended to our representatives for the
purpose of this examination.
Yours very truly,
PRICE, WATERHOUSE, AND COMPANY

CERTIIICATE
We have examined the accounts of the University of
Michigan for the year ended June 30, I926, and certify that
the above balance sheet has been correctly prepared therefrom on a cash basis and, in our opinion, is properly drawn
up so as to show the financial position of the University on
that basis at that date. We further certify that the relative
financial statement annexed hereto and forming a part of
the annual report of the University are in accordance with the
books of account.

The report of the Secretary and Treasurer was accepted
and adopted by the Regents as the report of the Board to
the Governor of the State, and the report and certificate of
the auditors were received and placed on file, and ordered
printed in the proceedings.  The usual number of copies
of the financial report was ordered printed.
The Board approved a further change-in the by-laws of
the Lawyers' Club (page 74) by which the President of the
University should be ex-officio a member of the Board of
Governors of the club.
Two tenders of appointments to professorships in legal
research were voted. The salaries are to be later determined, and one-half of each is to be reimbursed to the University treasury by the Lawyers' Club.
In view of the invitation which had been extended to
Professor Campbell Bonner to accept the annual professorship in Greek literature at the American School of Classical
Studies in Athens, for the University year I927-1928, this
position providing a net financial compensation of only $5oo
per year, the Regents granted leave of absence to Professor
Bonner for the year stated at full salary, with the expectation that the sum of $1,000 would be provided in the budget
of 1927-1928 to secure additional assistance in the Department of Greek during Professor Bonner's absence.
A communication from Dean Cabot relative to full-time
service in the Medical School (page 76) was referred with
full power to Regent Sawyer and the President.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1926


107


The President appointed as the President's Committee
on Special Needs of the University, Librarian Bishop, chairman, for a term of four years, Professor Huber and Professor Randall for terms of three years, Dean Bates and Dean
K(raus for terms of two years, and Professor Reeves and
Professor Sadler for terms of one year. The term in each
case begins with the fiscal year 1926-I927. The Assistant
to the President is to be permanent secretary of this committee, with full committee membership (page 116).
A proposal was received from the University Senate
including the following recommendations:i. That the two semesters of the University year be
made of equal length, with appropriate changes in the present
dates for beginning and closing of the University year;
and that there be a convocation for the conferring'of degrees
at the close of the first semester.
This communication contemplated- the continuance of
the plan of holding the June Commencement exercises on
Monday.
The Board took action approving the general plan of
equalizing the two semesters with such changes in dates
for the University year as might be required, but asked the
Senate or its proper committee to revise the Commencement
date so as to return to the former plan of holding Commencement exercises on Thursday and also to eliminate the
proposal for a Commencement convocation at the end of
the first semester.
The Board adopted the detailed budget of the Summer
Session of 1927 as submitted totaling $235,824.44 (page 75).
It was specifically understood that amounts provided in the
budget for clerical salaries should not be regarded as in any
respect effective until action on this class of salaries in general could be taken with respect to the general budget of the
University.
The. Regents approved the request of the Board in Control of Athletics for all cinders from the Power Plant except
such as might be needed for other University use, on condition that the cinders be removed at the cost of the Board
in Control of Athletics and in a manner approved by the
Secretary.




I0o8


DECEMlBER MEETING, 1926


The Board declined to assume any part of the traveling
expenses of Professor H. H. Higbie, now on sabbatical
leave, as President of the Illuminating Engineering Society.
The sum of $500 was added to the Current Expense
account of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology.
The Board approved the expenditure of $Ioo from funds
already provided for the Summer Session, for advertising
in five consecutive numbers of the Michigan Education
Tournal.
The Board added the sum of $550 to the salary account
of the University Museum to provide an assistantship with
salary at the rate of $I,ooo per year from December 15 for
the work in Michigan Anthropology carried on by Professor
Wilbert B. Hinsdale.
The Secretary gave notice that the case of the SeldenBreck Construction Company vs. the Regents (R. P. I920 -1923, page 727) had been set for trial January 3, next, but
that it would presumably have to be postponed to a later
date because of the prospective absence of Mr. Albert Kahn
in Europe.
Traveling expenses of members of the Board were approved as follows:Regent Gore from January 28, I925 to September 24,
1926, $144.82
Regent Murfin from December 3, 1925 to October 22,
I926, $I79.I9
Regent Hubbard from May I8, 1926 to November 14,
1926, $457.58
Regent Beal from June I, I926 to November 30, I926,
$I27.49.
A communication was received from Professor Ralph
WV. Aigler as chairman of the Board in Control of Athletics,
stating that with the approval of the Regents and with the
understanding that the Regents would authorize the use of
property now owned by the Board within the limits noted
in the communication, the Board in Control of Athletics
would acquire seven additional lots in the vicinity of Palmer
Field, and, further, if the Regents would procure from the
City the closing of all or the necessary portion of Belser
Street, the Board in Control of Athletics would proceed to

delevop. the present Palmer Field and the University-owned
land in the block immediately south thereof as an enlarged
and improved outdoor recreation field for the women of
the University. This intention on the part of the Board in
Control of Athletics would include the erection of a suitable
field house. The Regents approved the program advanced
in this communication and assured the Board in Control of
Athletics that the land desired by this Board and now within
the ownership of the University would be devoted to the
purpose suggested.
The Regents approved the use of Hill Auditorium by the
Ann Arbor High School for its commencement exercises
of June, 1927, with the usual provision that the high school
authorities would meet any expense involved and that the
use desired would not conflict with the University's own
needs at that time.
A  communication was received from    Mrs. Floyd E.
Bartell as secretary of the Faculty Women's Club thanking
the Regents for redecorating the rooms assigned to this club.
The Secretary reported that in accordance with the authority of the Board (page 84) property at 631 Haven Avenue
had been purchased from Mary E. Meston at a cost of $II,904.72. This property is legally described as follows:Commencing at the southwest corner of lot No. 6 in
block 6 south, range 13 east, according to the recorded plat
of Chauncey H. Millen's purchase of the southeast part of
the Ann Arbor Land Company's Addition to the City of Ann
Arbor, and running from thence north 55 feet; thence east
8 rods to the east line of said lot; thence south 55 feet;
thence west to the place of beginning, and being a part of lot
No. 6 in block 6 south of Huron Street, range No. 13 east,
intending to convey the south 55 feet of said lot 6.
On recommendation of the President, Regent Beal, and
the Secretary the Regents authorized the purchase of an
additional piece of property, chargeable to the special appropriation for the purchase of land. This purchase, if and
when completed, is to be reported to the Board (page 84).
The Secretary reported that the sum of $I6,666.66 had
beenireceived from the Receiver of the Detroit Mortgage
Corporation as proceeds of the sale of the lease of.the

The Regents accepted the proffer of the American Petroleum  Institute of a fund of $2,500 for research in the
determination   of physical properties     of petroleum    and
petroleum products, provided that the terms of the contract
proposed 'by the American Petroleum Institute should in all
respects, including provision for publication of the results
of the research, receive the approval of the Regents.
The Board agreed to include in the Chemistry budget
of I927-1928 all allowance of $3,000 to provide for the
appointment of Professor H. R. Kruyt of the University of
Utrecht, Holland, as special lecturer in Chemistry for the
first semester of that year.
The Board authorized the payment to the Michigan
Union of the sum of $Ioo to cover in part the expenses of
the reception for students on the occasion of the recent visit
of the Bishop of London, England.
Dean Bates filed the following letter outlining a proposal
by members of the Law Faculty:To the Honorable Board of Regents
Gentlemen:The members of the Faculty of the Law School are
convinced that many students in this school are prevented
from doing the grade of work of which they are capable,
because of a lack of funds. Their financial condition necessitates many hours of outside work-invaluable hours which,
if devoted to study, would in many instances produce results
of at least comparative brilliance.
To the end that, in so far as our efforts may make it
possible, no worthy student in this school may be prevented
from doing his best because of financial difficulties, the members of this Faculty plan to establish a "Faculty-Alumni
Scholarship Fund."
Our plan contemplates annual voluntary pledges by members of this Faculty. For the years I926-I927 and I927-I928
these pledges approximate $500 per year. We are positive
that' many of the recipients of these scholarships will, in
later years, contribute to this fund; and, further, that alumni
of this school and friends of the University may also become
interested in the plan. Many men who would not find it
possible to establish or endow a scholarship are able and




I I2


DECEMBER MEETING; 1926


willing to make annual, or occasional, contributions to a collective scholarship fund.
The proposed fund would be administered by our scholarship committee. This committee will determine the conditions of all awards, and, with the advice of the Law School
Faculty, will select the recipients thereof.
Contributions will be made direct'to the committee and
the committee will, from time to time, forward the sums so
collected to the Treasurer of the University of Michigan.
We respectfully ask that this Honorable Board of
Regents approve the plan herein proposed, and that the
necessary action be taken to authorize the Treasurer of this
University to receive from the committee the funds above
mentioned and to disburse them upon the written authority
of the committee.
Very respectfully,
Dean and Faculty of the University
of Michigan Law School
December 7, I926
The Board gratefully accepted this proffered cooperation under the terms and conditions set forth in the communication.
The President notified the Regents that Mr. Frank
Leverett of the federal Geological Survey would not be
able to give his usual lectures in the Department of Geology
during the present University year. Authority was given to
apply the sum set aside in the budget for compensation for
Mr. Leverett toward securing lectures on similar subjects
by other authorities.
Correspondence concerning the exact title of Professor
Charles C. Fries was referred to the President with full
power.
The Board received from Mr. Richard B. Bancroft, '80,
a gift of certain pictures and books made to the University
by Mr. Bancroft and his brother in accordance with terms
of the will of his mother, the late Mrs. William L. Bancroft.
The only terms attached to the gift provided that the pictures
be marked permanently by the University with the name
and former residence of the donor, (Port Huron, Michigan),
and that each volume bear on one leaf an inscription of a
similar nature.  The thanks of the Regents were extended
in recognition of the gift.

The following resolution was adopted by the Regents:Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the University
of Michigan thanks the State Board of Education for the
offer of use of the facilities for practice teaching of the
Michigan State Normal College and wishes the State Board
of Education to know that when the matter of teacher training is before it for discussion the Board of Regents will be
glad to consider the offer most carefully.
The following resolutions were adopted:Resolved, That the President be requested at an early
date (I) to convene the University Senate and (2) to
appoint:(a)  A committee of that body for the study of
and report upon the desirability and practicability of a
reorganization of the first two years of college work at
the University with reference to the development of a
separate administrative unit.
(b) A committee of that body to study and report
upon the courses in the curricula of the various schools
and colleges, and to see whether gain in efficiency and
saving 'in expense might not be accomplished by avoidance of duplication and of unnecessarily frequent offering of such courses as are very lightly attended.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1926

The Board voted that the first and most pressing need of
the University of any needs to be brought before the Legislature of 1927 was clearly the removal of the limitation upon
the proceeds of the mill tax (page 84).
Special needs of buildings, lands, and other capital outlay
were determined, in accordance with the recommendation
of the Executive Committee and chairman of the Building
and Grounds Committee, as follows:UNIVERSITY      OF MICHIGAN       LEGISLATIVE
REQUESTS-SESSION         OF 1927
The first request which the University of Michigan will
make to the Legislature of 1927 is the removal of the limitation of $3,700oo,ooo000 now resting upon the proceeds of the mill
tax of six-tenths of a mill for current operation and general
support. Should this limitation be removed, on the basis of
the present equalized value of the State the mill tax proceeds
would go from $3,700,000 to approximately $4,620,00o annually.
CAPITAL ITEMS
The foliowing items are adopted as the budget to be presented to the Legislature.  They are listed in what is believed to be the order of their importance, though this order

December 21, I926
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
This report of the Executive Committee meeting held
under date of July 8 has been delayed pending conclusion of
the matter in question. The Regents' Proceedings 1923-I926
(page 408), show the purchase by the University of a certain piece of ground on Felch Street in Ann Arbor at $I,500,
the top dirt from which was to be used around the Lawyers'
Club and other buildings which were being completed at
about that time (summer of 1924). As stated in the Proceedings it was the intention to resell the lot after taking
off the dirt. The City of Ann Arbor desired to purchase the
lot as storage for use of the Board of Public Works, and
the Executive -Committee authorized conveyance of the lot
to the City on the basis of the purchase price paid by the
Regents, namely $i,500. The City accepted this offer and
a deed has been made conveying the property in accordance
with the description which occurs in the Regents' Proceedings
of I923-I926, (page 408), and the City's payment of $I,500
has recently been received.
Regent Stone reported that after consulting with Professor Donaldson it seemed wise to postpone the preparation
of a catalogue of the art collection in Alumni Memorial
Hall (page 39) until the views of Mr. A. M. Todd with
respect to articles which he has on exhibit in Alumni Memorial Hall and elsewhere are more fully determined.
The Secretary filed a copy of the monthly payroll of
the Department of Engineering Research for the six-months'
period ending December 31, 1926 (R. P. I923-I926, pages
484 and 504).

12 and I4, Block 5 North of Range 14 East, in the Eastern
Addition to the Village (now City) of Ann Arbor, Michigan,
according to the recorded plat thereof.
From  Morris Kraizman and Sophia Kraizman (who
had purchased an option) and from Clarence F. Cook, ad



JANUARY      MEETING, 1927                II9
ministrator of the estate of Marion M. Wheelock, house
and lot known as 1204 East Washington Street for $8,750,
described as follows: Lot 112, Block 3 R. S. Smith's Third
Addition to the City of Ann Arbor.
Further, complications  developed  before title  was
finally taken to all the property included under "1232 and
1236 Volland Street" (page II), which resulted in the necessity of going through the form of a condemnation suit. There
was no question about the amount to be paid; the question concerned solely the division of payment between the several
parties at interest. As a result of these condemnation proceedings the Regents have possession by order of the Court
and by deed from J. Fred Wuerth and Martha B. Wuerth,
and Cloid A. Witham and Viola M. Witham, and the Grand
Lodge Knights of Pythias of Michigan, of property known
as 1236 Volland Street (which is included, as above stated, in
the description already appearing on page I ) described as
follows: The west half of lot 92, excepting the south 33
feet, of R. S. Smith's Third Addition to the City of Ann
Arbor.
Communications were received from     Dean Kraus and
Mr. W. B. Shaw, Secretary of the Alumni Association,
transmitting statistics with reference to the day of the week
on which Commencement exercises should be held (page
o07).  The Regents allowed their action at the December
meeting to stand.
The Secretary filed a copy of the receipt which Librarian
Bishop had delivered to the Michigan      Trust Company,
executor of the estate of Caroline P. Campbell.    The receipt covered the books, manuscripts, papers, etc. presented
to the Library under paragraphs 4 and 5 of the will of the
deceased (R. P. I923-I926, page 892).
The Board approved the action of the President and
Secretary, as the emergency committee, in adding $95 to
the Current Expense account of the Department of Romance Languages to provide tables, wastepaper baskets,
and chairs.

of a contribution to be made from      athletic funds to the
National Walter Camp Memorial, was instructed by the
Regents to the effect that this problem was regarded by the
Regents as wholly within the control and discretion of the
Board in Control of Athletics.
The Secretary filed with the Regents correspondence
with Mr. Frederick Hoff of New        York City embodying
features of a possible trust fund.   The Secretary was re



JANUARY MEETING, 1927

quested to inform Mr. Hoff that should the trust fund be
created the Regents could presumably accept it, as trustee,
in accordance with the roughly outlined terms and conditions.
The Board approved an increase in the imprest cash fund
of the University Hospital office from $2,500 to $3,500.
The Board approved the payment of the salary of M\Jr.
Walter E. Jominy, Associate Investigator in Engineering
Research, during the months of November and December
while Mr. Jominy was ill.
The traveling expenses of Regent Stone for I925 and
1926, to a total of $87.20, were approved.
The Secretary reported a contract with the Security
Trust Company for handling the affairs involved in remodeling the residence of the late Levi L. Barbour for occupancy
by the Prismatic Club, and by such tenant as might be secured for the balance of the house (pages 73 and 74). The
expense of repairs and alterations of the premises estimated at $3,500 is to be charged to the Woodward Avenue
Lease fund, another trust created by the late Mr. Barbour,
this latter fund to be recouped in due course as circumstances may make possible from rentals of the property at
86 Eliot Street.
The Secretary reported to the Board the death of Howard B. Merrick, Associate Professor of Geodesy and Surveying, December 14; of Volney A. Chapin, Assistant in the
Law Library, December I2; and of Gustave A. Ritz, Curator in the Physics Department, January 2. Authority was
given to pay the salaries of these deceased members of the
University staff to their dependents for the balance of the
first semester.
Cyrus C. Sturgis, M.D., was appointed Professor of
Internal Medicine and Director of the Thomas Henry Simpson Memorial Institute for Medical Research, at a total
salary of $i5,ooo per year. The distribution of the sources
of this salary and the exact date at which the appointee
would take up his duties were left to be determined and
recorded in the future.
The President, Regent Stone, and the Secretary were
requested to report to the Regents a recommendation for a




I28


JANUARY MlEETING, 1927


general policy with respect to paying salaries of deceased
members of the University staff to any surviving dependents.
The President notified the Regents that Associate Professor Leigh J. Young, of the Department of Forestry, had
been appointed Director of Conservation by Governor
Green, and desired leave of absence without salary to enable
him to assume the duties of this position.  The Board
granted Professor Young a leave. for an indeterminate
period, without salary, to date from the day on which he
assumes the duties of his new position.
The Board accepted with thanks the gift by the Ford
Motor Company, through Mr. Edsel Ford as President, of
a set of Johansson gauges ground to an accuracy of twomillionths of one inch.
The Board placed on record the tender to Mr. Samuel
T. Dana, now at the Northeastern Forest Experiment Station of the United States Department of Agriculture, the
Professorship of Forestry (page II4), with the provision
that should legislative appropriations make it possible there
should be organized during the coming summer a School of
Forestry and Conservation to succeed the present Department of Forestry and of this school Professor Dana should
be dean. The salary for the position was fixed at $8,500
and the duties of the professorship are to begin on or about
May I, 1927.    Professor Dana's acceptance was also
placed on file, this acceptance of the professorship as well
as deanship being contingent upon the provision of funds
by the Legislature which would make possible to foresee the establishment of the School of Forestry and Conservation with the opening of the year 1927-1928. The
Regents voted to pay, out of Forestry funds of the present year, the traveling expenses of Professor Dana for
such trips as might be required between his present station
at Amherst, Massachusetts, and Ann Arbor and the traveling expenses of Mrs. Dana on the trip she made accompanying her husband while the position was under consideration,
and also to pay to Professor Dana such amounts as the federal government had deducted or should deduct from his
salary while absent from his present duties in order to make
these necessary trips to Ann Arbor.




JANUARY MEETING, 1927


I29


Upon recommendation of the Faculty of the College of
Architecture the degree of Bachelor of Science in Architecture (Architecture) was conferred on Gardiner Chandler
Vose.
The appointment of Mr. Lewis Mumford to give three
special lectures in the College of Architecture with compensation of $300 was approved. Funds are already provided
for this purpose in the budget of the College of Architecture.
The Board approved the curriculum submitted by Dean
Cooley with the approval of Dean Effinger for the courses
for the Naval Reserve Aviation unit approved at the November meeting (page 48).
Privileges of the laboratories and libraries of the University were granted to Richard A. Robb of Glasgow, Scotland, holder of a Commonwealth Fund fellowship for
studies in mathematics and statistics, these privileges being
for the period during which Mr. Robb shall continue in
residence here as the holder of this fellowship.
Inquiry was received through Dean Cooley from Professor Henry E. Riggs with respect to whether the Regents
would approve his acceptance of an invitation to act as
engineering counsel to the legal department of the St.
Louis-San Francisco Railway Company and of the New
York Central Lines. The Board approved Professor Riggs's
acceptance with the reservation that he should not serve as
such counsel in any case in which the State of Michigan
should be opposed to the interests which he as such counsel
might represent.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to Friday, February ii, at 7:30
P. M.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary

counties of approximately 4,000 acres, to be utilized by the
University as a forest experiment tract. In case these lands
are offered to the University by the Conservation Commission of the State, the committee voted that the proper officers
of the University be authorized to sign the necessary documents. The matter of caring for and protecting the tract is
to be considered in connection with the budget of I927-1928.

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1927


January 10, 1927
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.

to Mr. Donal Hamilton Haines, now part-time instructor in
the Department of Rhetoric and Journalism at $500 per University year and publicity agent for the Department of Engineering Research from July I, 1926, to June 30, 1927, at $00oo
per month, a third appointment as part-time instructor in

understood that the necessary amount of money to cover Mr.
Haines's salary will be transferred from the Department of
Organic Chemistry to the Department of English.
January 10, 1927
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and   Regent
Sawyer.
The committee granted leave of absence without pay to
Professor C. D. LaRue of the Botany Department for the
remainder of the present University year from December 6,
1926. Mr. E. E. Dale, now half-time instructor at $8oo for

late Regent Levi L. Barbour. Regent Murfin approved the
signing of the petition as a merely formal matter.
January 15, 1927
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and   Regent
Sawyer.
On the recommendation of Dean Effinger, the committee
approved the appointment of Assistant Professor Robert Craig

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1927


I33


January 19, 1927
Present, President Little and Regent Beal.
The committee approved the transfer of $i,ooo from the
unexpended Salary account of the Department of Forestry
to the Current and Salary accounts of the Botanical Gardens.
The needs of the Botanical Gardens have outgrown the
budget, and the additional work done during the summer and
fall has exhausted funds which should have been used for
current expenses and for the payment of the salary of C. 0.
Erlanson. Six hundred dollars of the amount transferred is
for current expenses for the remainder of the University year,
and $400 is to be applied to the salary promised Mr. Erlanson.
January 20, I927
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and   Regent
Sawyer.
Assistant Professor Robert Craig of the Department of
Forestry recommended, through Dean Effinger, the expenditure of a total of $3,400 to carry on the work of that department for the second semester. It is understood that the needs
of the department are as follows:I. To secure a special lecturer to take over the work in
silviculture at a rate of pay not to exceed $2,000 for the second
semester.
2. To hire a Forest technician to be responsible for the
work on various forestry properties, under the direction of a
member of the faculty. The rate of pay would be $9oo for
the second semester.
3. To hire a temporary clerk and stenographer for the
second semester at a cost of not more than $500 for the
semester.
This recommendation as outlined was approved by the
committee. Funds are provided in the budget.
January 20, 1927
Present, President Little and Regent Beal.
The committee agreed to use the sum of $175 from the
Salary account of the Chemistry Department, as honoraria
for lecturers invited to speak on subjects of special value to
the staff and students and of interest to the community. It is
understood that $ioo is to be so used in payment for a lecture
to be given by Dr. F. Paneth, Physical Chemist of the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute of Berlin, and $75 is to be paid to Professor




134


FEBRUARY MEETING, I927


John Johnston, Chairman of the Department of Chemistry
at Yale, for a lecture and consultation with members of the
staff of the Department of Chemistry
January 26, 1927
Present, the President and Regent Beal.
The committee granted Mr. W. W. Bishop, Librarian of
the University, leave of absence, with salary, for a period of
approximately two and a half months, beginning February 17,
in order that he may undertake under the auspices of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace a project of
great importance generally and of value to universities and
schools in particular. It is understood that no expense to the
University is involved and that Mr. Bishop's colleagues will
carry on his work in his absence.
January 26, 1927
Present, the President and Regent Beal.
Unmistakable information having been received that highway authorities of Burt Township in Cheboygan County were
putting a road through University land in that county, without permission, and in utter disregard of rights of the University, the Secretary was instructed to take such legal steps
as might be required to protect the interests of the University.
January 27, 1927
Present, the President and Regent Beal.
In order to meet the technical requirements of the stock
transfer agencies in selling two shares of stock held by the
Regents (as a bequest from the late Cornelius Donovan) in
the United Electric Railway Company of Rhode Island, the
following resolution was adopted. The sale of the stock had
already been approved by Regent Stone as Chairman of the
Finance Committee:Resolved, That Shirley W. Smith, Secretary of
the Regents of the University of Michigan, is hereby
authorized and empowered to sell two shares of the
common stock of the United Electric Railway Company of Rhode Island standing in the name of the
Regents of the University of Michigan, as represented by stock certificate 5670, and to transfer the
said stock in the name of the Regents of the University of Michigan.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1927                       I35
February 2, I927
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
The committee authorized the transfer of $400 from the
Salary account of the Department of Library Science to the
Current Expense account of the same department. It is understood that this amount will be used for payment by the hour
to those persons who are to aid in work of cataloguing and
classification. Librarian Bishop recommends this procedure,
with the approval of Dean Effinger, on the ground that payment by the hour is to be preferred in this work to the
appointment of any persons who would ordinarily work on the
regular basis.
February 2, 1927
Present, President Little, Regent Beal, and Regent
Sawyer.
On recommendation of: Dr., Cyrus C. Sturgis, Director
of the. Simpson Memorial Institute for Medical Research,
and with the approval of the Medical Faculty, the appointment of Dr. Raphael Isaacs, of Boston, Massachusetts, as
Assistant Director of the Simpson Memorial Institute for
Medical Research and Assistant Professor of Medicine, at an
annual salary of $5,ooo per year, was authorized. The distribution of Dr. Isaacs's salary between the budget of the
Simpson Memorial Institute and other divisions of the University is to be adjusted later.
The following resolution was adopted (page 13):
Resolved, That in the case of any land contract by
which the University shall dispose of any real estate, and
which has thus far been or in the future may be turned
over to the trust funds of the University as investment thereof, this Board does hereby promise and bind itself that such
trust fund or funds shall not suffer loss either of principal
or interest by reason of the failure of the contracting purchaser or purchasers to carry out his, her, or their agreement in such contracts made and provided. Should such failure occur, threatening loss to such trust funds, either of interest or principal, the Regents will either repurchase such
contracts out of general funds of the University or reimburse to the trust funds promptly any such loss, from general
funds.




I36


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1927


The following resolution was adopted (page 125):
Resolved, That in deference to the wishes of the donor,
the action of the Regents at the meeting of May I926 by
which the home for nurses erected as a gift to the University by Senator James Couzens was designated as "The
Couzens Residence," is hereby rescinded and the designation
of this building is fixed as "Central Residence for Nurses."
The Secretary reported that the arrangement proposed
by which the American Trust Company of Detroit should
handle funds involved in the land contracts and mortgages
coming to the University in the residue of the estate of the
late Levi L. Barbour (page IIo) had not been completed.
Instead an agreement had been made with the Guaranty
Trust Company of Detroit under which this company would
handle all collection and give a general trust service for 3
per cent collection fee on the land contract payments and on
payments of mortgage interest. The Board approved this
arrangement.
The Secretary filed a report of an inspection by a member of the staff of the Michigan Trust Company, of Grand
Rapids, of lands owned by the Regents in Newaygo County
and Osceola County as part of the Williams Professorship
fund.  These inspection reports were placed on file, with
thanks to the Michigan Trust Company for its cooperation.
The Secretary filed a further report with respect to
appraisal of the stocks included in the residue of the estate
of the late Levi L. Barbour (page IIO). On the basis of
this report the stocks appraised by the executors at $7,630
were placed on the books of the University as follows:125 shares of River Rouge Improvement Company at
par, I$,250.
Certificate No. 229 for 442 shares of the common stock
of the Grayling Lumber Company and Certificate No. 129
for 123 shares of the common stock in this company are
believed to represent no possibility of actual value and the
stock represented is charged off. Certificate No. 57 for 460
shares of preferred stock in the Grayling Lumber Company
may have some value, and in order that it may not be overlooked the Regents directed that it be placed on the books at
$I for the entire holding.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1927


I37


The stocks in the residue of the Levi L. Barbour estate
are therefore appraised on the books at $1,251 instead of
at $7,630 as originally recorded.
The Secretary filed a complete list of all fire insurance
now  carried on University property.    The Buildings and
Grounds Committee was asked to consider this report
especially with respect to determining the propriety and
adequacy of the amounts carried on the various risks, and
further with respect to the desirability of adding protection
against wind storms to the insurance now carried against
fire. The Buildings and Grounds Committee was requested
to make a report thereon at an early date.
The Secretary reported that he had received from     the
executor a copy of the last will and testament of Mrs. Thekla
Bengel Porter, who resided at Seattle, Washington, and who
was a graduate of the University of Michigan in the Medical
class of I890. Item I (f) of the will is as follows:To the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, State of
Michigan, Medical Department, the remaining one-half
(1/2) of said residue and remainder, the same to be known
as the "David E. Porter and Wife (Thekla N. Bengel)
Memorial," and to be invested and the income therefrom shall
be used in aiding worthy and needy medical students by making loans to them from such income, which loans shall be
repaid at such time, or times, after graduation, (or after
leaving the Medical School, if leaving before graduation),
as those charged with the administration of this fund may
deem best. Character, industry, and financial need shall be
the only requirements to entitle a student to share in the
benefits of this fund. The Dean of the Medical School shall
be the sole judge of such qualifications. No discrimination
shall be made on account of sex, religion, religious creed,
race, color, or nationality.
The Secretary filed the eighth annual account of the
Union Trust Company of Detroit as trustee under the will
of Thomas S. Jerome, deceased (R. P. 1923-1926, page 812).
The Secretary filed a copy of the will of the late Minnie
Kempf Hosack of Detroit, of which will the Detroit Trust
Company is executor.     The Regents are beneficiaries in
accordance with the clauses of the will herein below quoted:



I38


FEBRUARY MEETING, I927


Fourth I give and bequeath all my family heirlooms,
furniture, antiques, works of art, books, automobiles, silver,
silver plate, and musical instruments and all my personal effects and belongings, except my jewel box, my pearl necklace, my diamonds, my Russian amethyst pendant, and all my
jewelry mounted in platinum, to my beloved daughter
Madeleine HosacK Baker, now of Trenton, New Jersey, if
she survives me; otherwise, to her eldest daughter living at
the time of my death, if any.
If neither my daughter nor any daughter of hers survive me, I then give and bequeath the above described property to Detroit Trust Company of Detroit, Michigan, and
in that event I direct said Detroit Trust Company as soon
as practicable after my death to convert said property (except the ancient grant written on parchment, the pillow
lace and the old English books hereinafter referred to) into
cash at such prices and on such terms as to it seems wise
and to pay such cash, less its expenses, to the Regents of the
University of Michigan, to be used as hereinafter provided.
As to said ancient grant, pillow lace, and old books I direct
that same be turned over to said Regents of the University
of Michigan to be used as hereinafter provided.
I hope that whoever proves to be the beneficiary of this
gift will make arrangements, as soon after my death as may
be, to present to some fitting public or semi-public institution where same can be publicly exhibited, the ancient grant
written on parchment, the pillow lace, and the old English
books which will be found among my personal effects and
belongings.
If my daughter survives me, I hope that she will, by her
Last Will and Testament, bequeath to her eldest surviving
daughter, if any, such of the articles enumerated in this
Fourth paragraph as remain at her death, and if no such
daughter of hers survives her, that she will direct her Executor to sell said articles for the benefit of her estate.
Fifth I give and bequeath my jewel box, my pearl necklace, my diamonds, my Russian amethyst pendant, and all my
jewelry mounted in platinum to my daughter if she survives
me, to be used and enjoyed by her during her lifetime, she
to have the right and privilege to have any one or more
pieces or parts of same reset, combined, repaired or restrung
as and when she desires, but not to sell or dispose of same.
If my daughter does not survive me, or upon her death if she




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1927                       139
does survive me, I give and bequeath the articles enumerated
in this Fifth paragraph as same are then constituted to Detroit Trust Company of Detroit, Michigan, and in that event
I direct said Detroit Trust Company, as soon as practicable
after receipt by it of said articles, to convert same into cash
at such prices and on such terms as to it seems wise and to
pay such cash, less its expenses, to the Regents of the Univerity of Michigan, to be used as hereinafter provided.
Sixth If my daughter Madeleine Hosack Baker survives
me, I give and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder
of my estate, consisting entirely of personalty, to my Trustee
hereinafter named Forever;   In Trust, however, and not
otherwise, for the times, uses, and purposes hereinafter set
forth.
The trust hereby created shall terminate immediately
upon the death of my daughter Madeleine Hosack Baker.
My Trustee shall take possession of and care for, manage, and control this trust estate. Out of the gross income
thereof it shall pay the entire expenses of such care, management, and control, including a reasonable compensation to
itself as Trustee. Out of the net income thereof it shall pay
Caroline Bowen, now of Chelsea, Michigan, during her lifetime the sum of Three Hundred Dollars ($300) per year,
payable semi-annually, and it shall further pay Caroline
Whitaker and Ella Whitaker Tuomey, now of Ann Arbor,
Michigan, jointly during their lifetime and the survivor of
them during her lifetime, the sum of Three Hundred Dollars ($300) per year, payable semi-annually.  It shall pay
the balance of the net income of the Trust Fund as then
constituted to my daughter during her lifetime, such payments
to be made semi-annually or oftener, as she may reasonably
desire.
Upon the death of my daughter, the trust hereby created
shall forthwith wholly cease and terminate, and my Trustee
shall forthwith pay over the entire principal of the trust
estate to the Regents of the University of Michigan, to be
used as hereinafter provided.
Seventh If my daughter Madeleine Hosack Baker does
not survive me, I give and bequeath all the rest, residue, and
remainder of my estate to the Regents of the University of
Michigan to be used as hereinafter provided.
Eighth  Although I do not intend hereby to place any
limitations on the gifts and bequests made to the Regents of
the University of Michigan by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and




I40


FEBR UARY MEETING, I927


Seventh paragraphs of this my Last Will and Testament, I
hope that the Regents, if the situation then existing, in their
judgment, warrants such a disposition, and not otherwise,
will constitute all moneys received by them under any of the
provisions of this Will, into a fund to be known as the
"Reuben Kempf Memorial Foundation," and will invest
said fund in accordance with their rules for the investment
of trust funds, the income to be used for the maintenance
of a professorship in some branch or branches of the general
field of money, banking and business in the Department of
Economics in said University, to be known as the "Reuben
Kempf Professorship of Economics." And I express the
further hope that if at any time such income should not be
sufficient in amount to secure a man of high attainments
in the field of economics, the Regents will supplement said
income to the extent necessary to secure or retain such a man.
The provisions of this Eighth paragraph are, however,
expressly subject to my further hope that if at the time the
rest, residue and remainder of my estate has come into the possession of said Regents, through the operation of either the
Sixth or Seventh paragraphs of this my Last Will and
Testament, Caroline Bowen or Caroline Whitaker and Ella
Whitaker Tourey, or the survivor of them, are still living,
said Regents will pay to said Caroline Bowen during her
lifetime the sum of Three Hundred Dollars ($300) per
year, payable semi-annually, and will further pay to Caroline
Whitaker and Ella Whitaker Toumey jointly during their
life times, and to the survivor of them during her lifetime,
the sum of Three Hundred Dollars ($300) per year, payable semi-annually.
The Treasurer placed on file a report of the bonds and
stocks held in the University trust funds as of December
3I, i926. This report shows bond holdings totaling par
value of $I,430,49I, book value of $I,4II,483.0I, and a
market value of $I,447,140. Stocks, all of which came to
the University by bequest and none by purchase, have total
par value of $84,560, book value of $126,330.75, and market
value of $212,237.
The Secretary filed a comparative tabulation of student
fees charged at various state colleges and universities during
1925-I926.

the Salaries Committee and the Finance Committee for report
at the March meeting proposals with respect to certain salaries under this action.   (See also page 148).
The Regents received the following proposal:Subject to approval of University of Michigan, hereinafter referred to as "Beneficiary," and Dr. Clarence Cook
Little, President of the University of Michigan, hereinafter
referred to as "Research Director," Donors submit the following proposal:i. Beginning on or about July I, 1927, and monthly
thereafter on the first of each calendar month    from
that date until the end of June, 1932, unless.this gift is sooner
revoked, as hereinafter set forth, Donors will give to Beneficiary three thousand seven hundred fifty ($3,750) dollars
per month for the purposes hereinafter set forth and in the
following proportions, viz:, nine hundred thirtyseven and 50/100 ($937.50) dollars per month; 
nine hundred thirty-seven and 50/I00 ($937.50) dollars per
month; -, one thousand eight hundred seventy-five
($1,875) dollars per month. The said several amounts shall

This agreement and the gifts hereby made by Donors
shall be irrevocable as to payments by Donors during said
period ending in June, 1932, but Donors may change the
Beneficiary if, for any reason, Dr. Little leaves the University of Michigan, and in such event, Donors shall be privileged to make, with any other institution to which Dr. Little
may go, the same sort of arrangement that is now proposed
to Beneficiary herein, and in such event, further payments to
Beneficiary herein shall cease. In the event of the death of
Dr. Little during the period of this agreement, Donors shall
also have the privilege of changing the Beneficiary and making a similar arrangement with some other institution and,
in such event, further payments to Beneficiary herein shall
cease.




164             FEBRUARY MiEETING, 1927
The above condition is an important part of this agreement, emphasizing the intent of the Donors, that this activity
is to be centered about Dr. C. C. Little and associates selected solely by him. After the organization to carry on this
research is selected by Dr. Little, he shall designate a first
and second choice from his assistants, one of whom may be
chosen by the Donors to take Dr. Little's place if he should
die or become incapacitated.
2. This agreement and the gifts hereby pledged may
be continued beyond June I, I932, by unanimous consent of Donors, Beneficiary, and Research Director, and
on such terms as may be then agreed upon. If on or before
July I, 1932, the Research Director, Beneficiary, and part
only of Donors desire to continue this agreement and the
gifts hereby pledged, one or more additional Donors may be
substituted for the Donor or Donors desiring to discontinue.
3. Said monthly payments of three thousand seven hundred fifty ($3,750) dollars shall constitute separate gifts by
Donors to Beneficiary in the proportions above set forth, and
the moneys so received by Beneficiary shall be disbursed by it
only for the following purposes, viz:(a)  For the acquisition  of equipment, microscopes,
cages, electric ovens, instruments, and any and all apparatus and supplies which, in the judgment of Research
Director, are necessary or appropriate for the equipment and
operation of a laboratory for scientific research for the purposes herein stated.
(b)  For salaries and compensation of scientists carrying on such research and any necessary clerical or other
assistance in connection therewith.
All such purchases and payments shall be made and approved by the Research Director. The employment and discharge of all such scientists and assistants shall be vested
in the Research Director. Such scientists' shall be employed
on a basis of working at least nine months out of each year
and so rotated that the work continues throughout the entire
twelve months of each year. Beneficiary is not to be liable
directly or indirectly for any indebtedness incurred on account of the purchase of said equipment or supplies or the
employment of said scientists and assistants. Beneficiary is

research work and without expense to Donors. Donors will
not control or interfere in any way with the exercise of the
powers conferred on the Research Director or with the
scientific investigations.

or about July I, 1927, and continue during the period of this
agreement and the gifts hereby pledged. Dr. Clarence Cook
Little is to be Research Director and is to have all the powers herein specifically conferred upon him and all such as
are incidental thereto. Within the limits of the gifts hereby
made, he is empowered to procure such equipment and supplies, employ such scientists and assistants on such terms
as he deems best, with the end in view of discovering and
promoting scientific knowledge of the causes, prevention, and
cure of cancer and other growth processes. The Research
Director shall cause an appropriate scientific record to be
kept showing the laboratory work, investigations, and developments in connection therewith, and shall make a report
thereof to Beneficiary and to the Donors at such times as
he shall deem wise, but in any event as often as once each
calendar year. Any scientist employed in connection with
said research work who shall make any scientific discovery
shall be given full credit for such accomplishment.  The
permanent record of such work, including all equipment and
supplies, shall, on the expiration or termination of this agreement, as aforesaid, become and remain the property of
Beneficiary.  In case the Beneficiary is changed as herein
provided, a copy of the record of such work shall be passed
on to the new Beneficiary. A copy of such record shall also
be given the Donors.
5. Beneficiary is to keep a separate account of receipts
and disbursements and render detail statements semi-annually to Donors.
6. Donors approve of any publicity which either Beneficiary or Research Director may think desirable in connection with the founding, scientific research, and accomplishments under this agreement and the gifts hereby pledged, but
they respectfully request that the identity of the Donors be
withheld.

A communication from     Dean Bursley notified the Regents that a fund of $57I.98 had been paid into the treasury
c.f the University by friends of the late Charlotte Blagdon
to constitute the Charlotte Blagdon Memorial fund. It was
the desire of the donors that this fund, both principal and

Blagdon Memorial fund, with thanks, in accordance with
the terms and conditions recorded.
Dean Cooley notified the Regents that Mr. George H.
Knutson of the class of I908, and Mr. Frank Hubbard

beginning of a fund to be known as the "Minnie Hubbard
Smith revolving fund, founded by George H. Knutson in
affectionate recognition of her friendship to him."    The
terms and conditions of this fund are set forth in Mr. Knutson's letter, endorsed by a letter from Mr. Smith, as follows:
The purpose of this fund is to have available from
cash in the fund, financial gifts to juniors and or seniors
who have continuously been in one of the Engineering Departments of the University of Michigan at least two and
one-half years prior to date of gift, who are enrolled in the
Department of Civil Engineering, and who have need of
financial assistance in order that they may remain in college, complete their courses, with the end in view of graduating without interruptions in their college course.
The placing and approval of the gift are to be at the
discretion of the Professor of the Department of Civil Engineering.
The student will not be required to sign a note, nor
will there by any actual contingent liability connected with
the receipt of a gift from this fund. However, each recipient is to be acquainted with the name and purpose of
the fund, and is to be asked to remember that (a) there




I90o


iMARCH MEETING, 1927


will be many others who could be similarly assisted if
past recipients contributed to this fund, (b) there will always be great demands on this fund, and (c) that in future
years and when recipient has accumulated a fair amount
of the world's goods, he is to have the purpose and requirements of this fund in mind.
There are to be no contributions to this fund other than
from George H. Knutson and his relatives and heirs, from
Frank Hubbard Smith (son of Minnie Hubbard Smith) and
his relatives and heirs, and from recipients who have enjoyed financial aid. This condition of outside contributions
may be changed with the written consent of either George
H. Knutson or Frank Hubbard Smith or by their heirs
after both are gone.
It is expected that this fund will be formally and legally accepted by the proper University authorities, will
be recorded upon the records of the University, and that
I will have written notice to this effect.
The Regents accepted the Minnie Hubbard Smith revolving fund in accordance with the terms and conditions
expressed in the letters of Mr. Knutson and' Mr. Smith, and
extended a vote of thanks to the donors.
Dean Bates notified the Regents that the allowance of
$i,ooo for a graduate fellowship to John P. Dawson (page
46) had not been used by Mr. Dawson, and that therefore
there remain in the budget of the Law School both of the
two fellowships of $I,ooo each.
In view of his long and uninterrupted term of service
the Regents voted to Professor Victor H. Lane a leave of
absence with full salary for the year I927-I928.
The Board referred to the President and Secretary with
power a communication from M-iss Ellen B. Stevenson suggesting that one or more University-owned houses be operated by the University beginning with I927-I928 as residence halls for women. The power lodged in the President
and Secretary included authority to approve the purchase
of furniture as might be required, later to (be repaid from
the operation of the house, and in general to approve the
method of financing should it be determined wise to put the
proposed plan into operation.




MARCH MEETING, I927


I9I


The President placed on file correspondence which had
passed between the President's office and Miss Jean Hamilton. This correspondence, taken in connection with correspondence filed as exhibit P, meeting of June II, I926,
and not recorded in the printed minutes of that meeting,
constituted a request by Dean Hamilton for sabbatical leave
with full salary during the first semester of the University
year I926-I927, with the tender of her resignation as Dean
of Women to take effect with the end of such first semester.
The request for such leave, and the resignation presented,
were based upon Dean Hamilton's necessity for absence
owing to the illness of her mother. The Regents formally
approved such leave and accepted Dean Hamilton's resignation.
Professor C. S. Yoakum of the School of Business Administration communicated to the Regents tenders of fellowships to be used in the School of Business Administration, as
indicated, for special studies in real estate, as follows:The John Buys Research Fellowship. Contributed by
the Grand Rapids Real Estate Board. Five hundred dollars

I96


APRIL MEETING, I927


work for the junior and senior years at said University.
The selection of the girl student to be recipient of the annual income from said trust fund for the two-year period
above designated, is to be made by a board consisting of the
President of said University, the Dean of the College of
Literature, Science, and the  Arts, and   the  Dean of
the Medical School, all these being officials of said University, it being  understood  that the principal  of this
fund so bequeathed in trust shall remain intact and so invested as to earn as large an income as possible, consistent
with security and safety, and that only the annual income
from the investment of said trust fund shall be disbursed
by said University as heretofore provided.  In connection
with the sale and disposition of the above described real estate
by my executors hereinafter named, I hereby direct said

without sacrifice, within three years from the date of my
death, or as soon thereafter as in the judgment of the executors is for the best interest of the fund hereby provided.

this subject by the University of Michigan.
The sum   of $3,000 was added to the Current Expense

School Inspection Department and to add to the Traveling
Expense account the sum of $300 to provide sufficient funds

The status of fundsl in the hands of Professor William
H. Hobbs for his arctic expedition made it necessary in his
opinion to reduce the amount which he had set aside for Mr.

by Regent Stone to his colleagues with respect to the
diversification of the University's investments as compared
with certain other groups of investments.
The Regents' Proceedings of September, 1925, page 687,

having been assigned by Professor Bailey was not as a
matter of fact the patent authorized to be taken on dynamometer at the preceding June meeting, page 632. The
dynamometer upon which the patent was authorized never
was in fact patented and the patent actually assigned in
September was upon an electric motor.
The Secretary filed for record notice of assignment
executed by Professor B. F. Bailey of another patent, upon
an induction motor, as authorized by the Board (R. P.
I923-I926, page 782).
The Board approved the action of the President and
Secretary in transferring the sum of $200 from the Salary
account to the Current Expense account of the Department of Public Speaking. This transfer was made in
order to meet unusually large traveling expenses due to
the fact that judges of debates had come from longer
distances than was customary.
The Secretary filed notice that ten shares of preferred
stock in the Ivory Garter Company of New Orleans had
been liquidated for $233.64.. The Cornelius Donovan endowment was, therefore, reduced by the difference between
$I,ooo, at whichl this stock had been carried, and $233.64.
The Secretary filed a report from one of the executors
of the late Leona R. Lounsbury with respect to the presumable amount to be realized from this bequest (pages
I95-196).

The Board adopted the following statement:By the death of Alfred Henry Lloyd, which took place
unexpectedly on May II, 1927, the Regents of the University
of Michigan have lost a valued colleague and a friend for
whom they had both respect and regard. In his thirty-six
years of service to the University of Michigan, Dr. Lloyd
gave not only his wisdom as a teacher, investigator, and
author, and his skill as an administrator; his whole life was
distinguished by gentleness, humanity, and integrity in everything he said and did; the example of his quiet, steadfast,
but always courageous spirit as he dwelt here was a thing
beyond all price and value to this community. Largely to
Dr. Lloyd, the second Dean of the Graduate School of this
University, is due the wise administration of that division,
the fostering of scholarly work done under its auspices, and
the development of a School of which the University may
justly be proud. As Acting President of the University of
Michigan, from February to October, I925, Dr. Lloyd guided
wisely and well the affairs of the institution during a time
beset with peculiar difficulties. In token of their respect for




216


MAY MEETING, 1927


Dean Lloyd and their sincere grief at his sudden and untimely
death, the Regents have adopted the following resolution:
RESOLVED, That in the death of Alfred        Henry
Lloyd, Professor of Philosophy, Dean of the Graduate School,
and sometime Acting President of the University of Michigan,
the Regents of the University of Michigan mourn the loss
of a great and inspiring man and teacher, one whose services
have been of the highest order, and one whose place in this
community can never be adequately filled.
And Be It Further Resolved, That these minutes be
incorporated in the Proceedings of the Regents, and that a
copy thereof be sent to Mrs. Lloyd and her family, together
with the sincere sympathy of this Board.
The Regents directed that the salary of the late Dean
Alfred H. Lloyd be paid to Mrs. Lloyd until the end of
the present academic year, and they further approved the
application for a widow's pension for Mrs. Lloyd which
had been forwarded by the Secretary        to  the   Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
The Board adopted the following statement:On Saturday, May 14, I927, Francis Willey Kelsey,
Professor of the Latin Language and Literature in the University of Michigan, died in Ann Arbor after sixty-eight
years of busy, useful life. Since I889 he had been a member
of the Faculty of the University of Michigan, and in I89o he
succeeded his honored predecessor, Professor Henry S.
Frieze, in the headship of the Department of Latin. Professor
Kelsey was gifted with a keen appreciation of the beautiful
in literature, music, and the other arts, which influenced his
whole life. It made him an inspiring teacher and enabled
him to send out others, who in their turn became teachers,
and it also inspired the great service which he rendered to
the University community, the City of Ann Arbor, and the
State of Michigan generally by promoting, through the University Musical Society, of which he was for many years
President, the concerts and opportunities for instruction in
practical music which have proved so great a distinction to
the City of Ann Arbor and of such great benefit to many
generations of University students. Professor Kelsey was
a man of immense energy and enthusiasm, qualities which
likewise he was able to pass on to his associates. His school
texts were nationally known; his scholarly work on the




MAY 'MEETING, I927                       217 -antiquities of Pompeii had an even wider audience. He had
been the President of two national societies. It was his initiative, ability, and ever forward moving spirit to which were
due the Humanistic Series of Univeristy of Michigan Publications, the explorations and excavations conducted by the University of Michigan Near East Expedition in late years, and
the gathering at Ann Arbor of collections of Greek, Roman,
and Coptic papyri, ancient manuscripts, and objects of
archaeological value which are not to be rivalled by any university, and by few public museums, in the Western Hemisphere. 'With all these capacities and characteristics Professor
Kelsey possessed those human qualities which gave him the
liking as well as the respect of his colleagues.
For these reasons, and for many others which will readily
suggest themselves to his friends, Professor Kelsey's sudden
death has come as a great shock to the Regents of the University of Michigan, and as an expression of their feelings and
of the indebtedness of the University to Professor Kelsey
they have passed the following resolutions and have directed
that they be incorporated in their proceedings and that a
copy be sent to Professor Kelsey's family:
RESOLVED, That the Regents hereby express their
great appreciation of the unique service rendered to the
University of Mlichigan by the late Professor Francis Willey
Kelsey, whose death has been a cause of great sorrow to the
members of the Board, and that they extend to Mrs. Kelsey
and her family their deepest sympathy.
The Regents directed that the salary of the late Professor Francis W. Kelsey be paid to Mrs. Kelsey until the
end of the present academic year, and they further approved the application for a widow's pension for Mrs. Kelsey, which had been forwarded by the Secretary to the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
The Board adopted the following resolution:RESOLVED, That beginning with the University year
I927-I928 all men students in the freshman class be required
to live in approved men's rooming houses, and that no unmarried male student be allowed to live in an apartment not
under the direct supervision of a landlady, or in a rooming
house in which there is no landlady in residence. The Dean
of Students is given authority to make exceptions to these
regulations in cases where in his opinion conditions warrant
a departure from the rules.

2MAY MEETING, I927


The sum   of $I,ooo was appropriated on     request of
Dean Kraus to provide for the erection of four student
houses at the Biological Station at Douglas Lake.
The Board authorized an increase in the insurance on
the contents of the Law    Building, principally the Law
Library, from $200,000 to $400,000.
The sum of $4,200 was added to the Teachers Annuity
account for the present year.
The Board approved an invitation to the American
Chemical Society to hold in Ann Arbor one session of its
seventy-fourth annual convention, meeting in Detroit during the week of September 5. The sum of $500 was appropriated to provide a complimentary luncheon to these
guests should the invitation be accepted.
On condition that the total sum be actually    earned
and collected by the Department of Engineering Research
authority was given to transfer the sum of $I,728.24 from
the Engineering Research Current account to a special

Mr. John T. Creighton and Professor Grover C. Grismore were elected to succeed themselves as members of
the Board of Governors of the Lawyers' Club, for the twoyear term beginning June 20, I927 (R. P. 1923-I926, page
704)~
The President discussed a statement of policies, and
these received the approval of the Board.
The Board likewise approved a statement relating in
particular to the scope and policies of the proposed School
of Forestry and Conservation as prepared by Professor
S. T. Dana and submitted by the President (page 128).
The following communication was received from         Mrs.
Mary B. Henderson, Executive Secretary of the Alumnae
Council of the Alumni Association:At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Alumnae
Council of the Alumni Association of the University of
Michigan held Thursday, May I9, 1927, it was voted to
notify you officially that the million dollar building and
endowment fund for the University of Michigan League will
be completed by June I8 of this year.
Under date of December 9, 1921, (R. P. I920-I923, pages
324-325) your Honorable Body granted to the Alumnae
Council of the Alumni Association of the University of
Michigan the right to solicit at least one million dollars with
which this incorporated organization was to erect, equip, and
endow a building which shall be to the women students on
the Michigan campus what the Union is to the men.
For five years a campaign for funds has been carried on
through the alumnae groups, during which time pledges have
been solicited from Michigan women, Michigan men, and
friends of Michigan. These pledges have been secured with
the understanding that the following conditions would prevail:I. That the Regents would furnish the site provided
the million dollars was pledged by June, 1927.  (The site
reserved for the League Building is described in the appended
letter signed by the Secretary of the University, under date
of December 12, 1921).
2. That of the million dollars $600,000 were to be used




222


MAY MEETING, 1927


for construction, $I50,ooo for furnishings, and $250,000 for
endowment.
3. That the League Building shall be managed and controlled by the Alumnae Council in cooperation with the Board
of Regents.
4. That the privileges of the League Building shall be
granted on the basis of membership, with the exception of
the undergraduate women who shall have the full use of
the building upon payment each year of a blanket tax during
the period of their college course.
5. That the League Building shall in no sense be an
administration or academic building, but one for social and
cultural purposes thro'lgh which the activities of the undergraduate women and of the alumnae may operate.
6. That the Leaiue Building shall contain offices and
committee rooms for the activities of the undergraduate
women and for the Alumnae Council, parlors exclusively for
women, parlors for men and women together, a hostess room,
a cafeteria for women only, a dining room for both men and
women, a library, a rest room for girls, a parlor for alumnae,
sleeping rooms for members, and all other rooms incident
upon a well-ordered club house.
The original plans made provision for at least the shell
of a theater, together with offices and committee rooms
through which would function the dramatic, the musical, and
the oratorical activities of the women students.  Changed
conditions, however, in increased enrollment and building
costs have made this allocation impossible.
While a swimming pool was not included in the original
plans, the completion of both the theater and the swimming
pool units has always been the objective of the Alumnae
Council and it is hoped that funds for these important adjuncts will be forthcoming shortly.
The Executive Committee wishes to make the following
statements:i. The first spade of earth will be turned for the League
Building on June I8, at which time the site will be officially
claimed.
2. Pond and Pond, Martin and Lloyd, the architects,
already under contract with the Alumnae Council, are prepared to proceed with the construction of the building as soon
as the ground is cleared by the University. It is hoped that
this will not be later than September 15 of this year.
3. Pond and Pond, Martin and Lloyd, are to have com



MAY MEETING, I927


223


plete charge of the erecting and equipping of the building in
conjunction with the Executive Committee of the Alumnae
Council assisted by advisory members chosen by the committee.
4. Of the million dollar fund there is to date on hand,
in cash and securities over and above all expenses, $500,000
plus, which sum is in the custody of the Treasurer of the
University.
5. The League Building will be financed entirely by
the Alumnae Council through endowment, through income
from various units of the building, and through the blanket
tax paid by the women students, with the exception that heat
and light are to be furnished by the University as in the case
of the Union.
Respectfully submitted,
MARY B. HENDERSON, Executive Secretary
Accompanying     Mrs. Henderson's communication      was
a letter addressed under date of May 21, I927, to the Secretary of the University by Pond and Pond, Martin and
Lloyd, and a blue print plot plan showing the location of
the building. This letter and the plot plan location had the
approval of M\rs. Henderson, and provided for so placing
the building that it would not be interfered with should
Twelfth Street be straightened along its present main axis.
The architects, for and with the approval of Mrs. Henderson as Executive Secretary, formally and permanently
waived the rights of the Alumnae Council, under the abovementioned letter of December I2, I92I, to have Twelfth
Street remain in its present location, and expressed their
willingness, should the   Regents later   desire, to  have it
straightened along its present main axis.
The Board took the following actions with respect to
the communications from     Mrs. Henderson and from       the
architects:Resolved, That the administrative officials of the Michigan League Building, by whatever title they shall ultimately
be called, shall not in any case be assumed to have, with
respect to students in the University, the power of discipline
or of social advisers of the women student body.
Resolved, Further That acceptance of the present plan
does not at this time commit the Regents to approval of the




224


2MAY MEETING, 1927


plan for a theater and swimming pool, as it is the suggestion
of the Board that these latter matters be discussed further in
the light of general University policy.
Resolved, Further That as suggested by the architects'
communications, item No. 2 of the letter of December 12, I92I,
(relative to the straightening of Twelfth Street) be cancelled.
Resolved, Further That otherwise than as provided in the
three resolutions immediately above the Regents give hearty
approval to the location of the Michigan League Building
and to other matters set forth in the communications from
the Executive Secretary and the architects of the Executive
Committee of the Alumnae Council of the Alumni Association.
Rcsolked, Further That the Regents extend to Mrs. Mary
B. Henderson their congratulations upon the successful consummation of the campaign for funds to erect, equip, and
endow the Michigan League Building, and that the thanks
of the Board be extended to Mrs. Henderson and through her
to her associates and to the women of the University in
general for their splendid and devoted work which is now
resulting in a building signally unique among the facilities
of American universities.
The Board received the following communication from
Miss Frances E. Riggs of Detroit, donor of the Frances
E. Riggs Foundation (R. P. I923-I926, pages 38-4o):To the Regents of the University
Gentlemen:I am writing you in reference to the Frances E. Riggs
Foundation accepted by you on September 27, I923.    My
observation of the way in which the Foundation has been
working out has led me to the conclusion that certain modifications in the plan of operation would be desirable. I feel
that American students should have an opportunity to share
directly in the benefits of the Foundation and that it would
be advisable to have American students go to a British university. Perhaps the time may come when the entire proceeds
of the Foundation should be used in this way, although for
the present I believe that some English students should come
here in order that the matter may be given a further trial.
The modifications which I have in mind are as follows:i. That a portion of the income of the Frances E. Riggs
Foundation, as the Regents may from time to time determine,
be used to provide scholarships for American male graduates
of the University of Michigan to study in universities or col



MAY MEETING, 1927


225


leges of the British Isles, with the expectation that a greater
portion, and perhaps eventually all, of the income may be so
used in the future, if it seems advisable to the donor and to
the Regents. Students thus appointed should be of sufficient
maturity to be able to make the wisest use of advantages provided. It is my desire, however, that at least one male student
from the British Isles be appointed each year to a Frances
E. Riggs Fellowship in the University of Michigan, in recognition of the benefits which students of the University of
Michigan have derived in the past from the liberality of
the late Cecil Rhodes.
2. That the term of appointment of Riggs Fellows be
limited strictly to one year, without privilege of renewal.
This provision would tend to give the benefit of the fellowships to a greater number of individuals.
3. That the stipend be fixed from time to time by the
Regents, in accordance with the wishes of the donor, and that
no part of the stipend be advanced for traveling expenses.
In this connection, I respectfully request the Regents to remit,
in the future, the tuition fees of Fellows on the Foundation,
and for the present to fix the annual stipend of Fellows and
Scholars on the Frances E. Riggs Foundation at $I,200. The
Fellowships and Scholarships, also, should be regarded as
being for resident study and not primarily for travel, and each
Fellow or Scholar is expected to pursue a course of serious
study whether at the University of Michigan or at a British
university or college.
4. That so far as it is feasible Riggs Fellows in the
University of Michigan be required to live in dormitories as a
condition of acceptance of the Fellowship. I believe this to
be the only effective way in which the formation of personal
acquaintance and friendship between British and American
students, one of the primary aims of the Foundation, can be
furthered.
5. That in the future the Regents from time to time
investigate the results of the Riggs Fellowships and Scholarships with the view to determining whether the purpose of the
donor is being accomplished and make such changes in the
administration or distribution of the Fellowships and Scholarships as shall in their opinion be advisable, in order to realize
more 'effectively the original purpose of the Frances E.
Riggs Foundation.
May I therefore request your Board to take appropriate
action to permit the above changes with regard to the




226


2MAY MEETING, 1927


Frances E. Riggs Foundation to be carried out. I would
not wish to have the present method of administration of the
Fellowships, as set forth in the resolution of acceptance,
otherwise altered.
Respectfully submitted,
FRANCES E. RIGGS
May 27, I927
The Regents formally approved all the changes requested by Miss Riggs in the administration of the Frances E.
Riggs Foundation. Further, the Board voted that in view
of the commitment already made for I927-1928 to Mr.
James Rutherford, should Mr. Rutherford accept, there will
be provided for him from general funds a fellowship of $I,200 provided such course is recommended by the Executive
Board of the Graduate School.   Further, the Regents directed that a remittance of $800oo from the available funds
of the Riggs Foundation be made to Miss Frances E. Riggs
for her personal use.
The Board    authorized  the Department of Military
Science to participate in the "Big Ten Indoor Rifle
League," but provided that no membership     fee therein
should be paid out of University   funds.  Regent Gore
voted no on this action.
The Regents accepted with thanks the gift of the
Detroit Real Estate Board of the sum of $500 per year
for three years to provide the Detroit Real Estate Board
Fellowship open to students in the School of Business
Administration (page I9I).
The Board referred with power to a committee consisting of the Secretary and Director Fielding H. Yost a
communication from   Mr. R. O. Bonisteel as City Attorney of Ann Arbor, relative to a petition received by the
City Council for the opening of Huron Street from Fourteenth Street to Observatory Street.
The Secretary reported with respect to proposals to
purchase an automobile for the Department of Geography,
a tractor for the use of the Department of Forestry, and
a truck for the use of the Summer Camp surveying (page
203), as follows:



MAY MEETING, 1927


227


That the needs of the Department of Geography had been
provided for by the private ownership of an automobile by
Professor K. C. McMurry, with reimbursement to him for
its use on geographical expeditions at the rate of seven cents
per mile; that, should the increase in the mill tax permit, the
Department of Forestry should be authorized to purchase the
tractor and that the Department of Surveying should be
authorized to purchase the truck desired.  The Secretary
further reported that it was not desirable at present to consider purchase of a number of cars and trucks on the University's general account for use from time to time by the
several departments which might require them. The Departments of Forestry and of Surveying have funds in their
budgets to meet the purchases should they be made.
The Board approved this report.
The Secretary filed a copyl of the salaries paid in the
Department of Engineering Research for the months of
January, February, March, and April, I927, (page IIS).
The Secretary filed the following letters from     Honorable O. B. Fuller, Auditor General of Michigan:My dear Mr. Smith:Replying to your letter of the 3d:
In confirmation of our conversation when you were
in the office you may cease requiring the actual receipt of the
vouchers by the firms or persons to whom payments are made,
providing that the vouchers bear reference to the effect that
the same are paid by check of a serial number specified on
the vouchers. The check itself when returned by the bank
will be regarded as sufficient receipt. This will apply to all
vouchers including the pay roll. The serial number on the pay
roll takes the place of a signature.
Receipts, of course, should be taken on all cash payments.
It is also understood that you may tegard the transfer of
the $5.69 (page 124), as requested by the Board of Regents,
as a balance in the old Accumulation of Savings fund to the
new Medical Building fund as having been made.
We desire to be of assistance to you and avoid delay in
the payment of vouchers.
Yours truly,
0. B. FULLER, Auditor General
May 20, I927




228


I MAY MEETING, 1927


My dear Mr. Smith:Please pardon the delay in replying to your letter of
the 3d.
I called the attention of Governor Green to the matter
of the signature of a member of the Board of Regents on
the vouchers paid by the University, and although he stated
that the requirements of the statute must be complied with
I believe that it would be satisfactory to him  for us to
make other arrangements on the subject and that he would
be satisfied with any arrangements that would be satisfactory
to this office.
If the Board of Regents will adopt a resolution authorizing some official of the University to endorse the vouchers
we will recognize the endorsement and thus avoid the delay
that now obtains.
Please advise me if this suggestion has the approval of
the Regents and the action taken by them in the matter.
Yours truly,
0. B. FUILLER, Auditor General
May 20, 1927
In accordance with the letter immediately above, the
following resolution was adopted, Regents Hubbard and
Gore voting no:Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby authorize the Registrar of the University, Ira
M. Smith, either personally or by duly authorized deputy,
formally to endorse for the Regents currently each month,
the vouchers under which University funds are expended.
The Secretary reported for himself and Regent Stone
that Mr. Alfred J. Brosseau and Mrs. Grace H. Brosseau,
husband and wife, had thought best to refrain for the
present from   making the agreement as printed in full in
the February    proceedings   (pages I50-I53), and     desired
instead to execute at this time an agreement providing only
for a yearly contribution of, $23,000 for five years, as follows:
THIS AGREEMENT, made the eleventh day of May, 1927,
between Alfred J. Brosseau, and Grace H. Brosseau, his
wife, hereinafter called the "Donors," and the Regents of

management and operation of said Foundation and will at
all times permit said Donors to inspect the books of account.
IN WIT'NESS WVHIERRO, we have hereunto set our hands
and seals the day and year first above written.
The President and Secretary were authorized to execute the agreement in its revised form, and the President
was requested to express to Mr. and Mrs. Brosseau the
sincerest thanks of the Regents for this undertaking and
for the interest which Mr. and Mrs. Brosseau have expressed in the possibilities of a future enlargement of the
agreement based on experience and results from the above
benefaction.

232


MAY MEETING, 1927

cover his recent trip from  Madison, Wisconsin, to Ann
Arbor and return.
The Board allowed Miss Ina Rankin an additional
vacation of one month with pay during the coming summer
in order that she might do work in the Municipal Reference Library in the city of Newi York which would, it is
believed, increase her effectiveness as secretary of the
Bureau of Government of this University.
A communication from Dean Ward notified the Regents
that research under the direction of Dr. U. G. Rickert,
Professor of Physiological Chemistry and Therapeutics in
the School of Dentistry, had seemingly discovered a new
and very much improved material for filling root canals.
In order to prevent the commercial exploitation of this
discovery Dean Ward recommended that Professor Rickert or his representative be authorized to take out a patent
thereon with the express understanding that the patent
when secured be assigned to the University and that the
royalties which may be obtained from it after the expenses
incurred in obtaining the patent have been met shall be
devoted to research in the School of Dentistry. The
Regents approved Dean Ward's recommendation.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote
except where expressly recorded otherwise.
The Board adjourned to the date of the annual meeting
7:30 P. M., June T7, 1927, unless sooner called together
by the President.

understanding that these students shall be members of The
University College for the first two years of their course
or until such time as they qualify for admission to one of
the other schools or colleges of the University.
Provided, that any existing college the curricula of which
are at present determined largely by any conditions or regulations not fully controlled by the University, or in which it
can be shown that the best interests of its students would
be jeopardized by requiring them to conform to the above
requirements, shall be allowed the optional privilege of admitting its students directly, until such time as conditions
shall render possible complete coordination with The University College.
Resolved: That the Senate request the Board of Regents to authorize the President of the University to name a
committee of representatives of different schools and colleges who shall have authority to work out details of plans




240         ANNUAL JUNE MEETING, 1927
for The University College which shall be submitted for

faculty may claim the privilege proposed in the preceding
paragraph of this report.
The Board directed that accumulations of approximately
$15,oo0 in the income account of the Cornelius Donovan
fund be added to the principal thereof. The Secretary offered for filing a copy of the will of Cornelius Donovan
which had for some reason never been recorded in the proceedings of the Board. The will is as follows (R.P. I920 -I923, page 433):I, Cornelius Donovan, of New Orleans, therein domiciled, do make this my last will and testament.
I revoke all other wills, testaments, and codocils.
I give and bequeath unto my godchildren Virginia
Campbell Hortenstine, Cornelius Donovan Schnideau, Allan
Johnson French, each the sum of five hundred dollars cash.
To Cornelius Donovan Schnideau my gold watch, gold and
platinum watch chain, and pencil of the same material.
To my sister, Margaret Donovan, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, for and during her natural lifetime, I give and bequeath a monthly sum of one hundred and twenty-five dollars
which shall be payable as hereinafter set out. This legacy
is never to be capitalized or discounted.
The rest and residue of my estate wheresoever situated,
and whatever composed of I give and bequeath unto the
University of Michigan of Ann Arbor, Michigan, to be used
through its Governing. Board, the Board of Regents, for the
purpose of establishing a scholarship to be known as the
Cornelius Donovan Scholarship.  Which scholarship shall
be awarded to meritorious students in the Department of
Engineering of said University who are working their way
through college. The income only from the fund resulting
from this legacy shall be used for the purpose herein named.
The above universal legacy to the University of Michigan is charged with the payment of the annuity legacy to my
sister, Margaret Donovan, and I expressly require the Board
of Regents or other governing body of said University to
see that this legacy is paid to my said sister on the last day
of each and every month.
The legacy to the University of Michigan is also made
on the further condition that the governing body of said
University shall provide for the perpetual care and attention

to the Donovan burial plot and tomb in Forest Hill Cemetery at Ann Arbor, Michigan.
I name and appoint my friends, Joseph B. Simmons and
J. A. Badger, both of this city, joint executors of this will,
with siezin and without bond, hereby fixing their compensation at two hundred and fifty dollars each, and I direct my
said executors to employ the law firm of Dart, Kernan,
and Dart to settle my estate.
All written, dated, and signed in my own handwriting
in New Orleans, La., on this I5th day of October, I92I.
In accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty
of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the
Board authorized the issuance of a special certificate to
social service workers after they shall have completed the
"social service curriculum," and shall also have completed
two months of field work with the approval of the director
of the social service curriculum and his advisory committee.
In order to enable Professor A. E. White to attend certain conferences in Europe his vacation period for the
summer of I927 was changed from the usual dates so as
to begin on or about August I, 1927, and to end on or
about November I following. It was understood that Professor White would arrange for the carrying on of his
duties in his absence without additional expense to the University.
The fees charged pupils in the University High School
were increased $5 a year beginning with the school year
I927-I928 and it was directed that this increase be set aside
into a special "activities fund," which will be administered
by the principal of the high school.
On recommendation of the Faculty of the School of
Education special consideration was given, with respect to
graduation conditions, to a group of students in Physical
Education to whom the Faculty of the School of Education
had failed to give proper notice in time for these students
to adapt their courses to the higher standards. The waiver
of the rule is to cease with June 30, I928.
Authority was given to transfer from balances in University accounts that would otherwise on June 30 revert to




242


2 ANN UAL J/UNE MEETING, 1927


the general furnd, a sufficient sum to provide a working
balance for the long-standing overdrafts in the University
Storehouse account, in the Chemistry Stores account, and
if necessary in the Hospital Stores account. These overdrafts are represented by goods in stock for which a working appropriation has never been made. The Secretary will
in due course report the transfers made under this authority.
An addition of $I75.65 was made to the Daily Official
Bulletin account for the year I926-I927.
The sum of $837.50 was appropriated as a part of the
budget of 1927-I928, of which $500 is to constitute the
usual appropriation as an assistance to the Student Christian
Association in publishing the Student Handbook, in the
customary number of copies, 4,000. The remaining sum
of $337.50 will cover the purchase for the University Extension Department, particularly for the Michigan High School
Debating League, of 1,500 additional copies of this Handbook.
The sum   of $3,532.17 remaining in the Engineering
Research Salary account through the absence without salary
of Mr. F. W. Hutchings from August I, 1926, was transferred to the Engineering Research Current account to
cover payments of $2,725.94 made to Mr. W. E. Jominy,
absent on sick leave. The remainder of the total sum of
$3,532.17 is to cover miscellaneous items in Engineering
Research Current expense.
The Board accepted with thanks the offer of Frederick
Stearns and Company, through Mr. Willard Ohliger, its
President, to supply the sum of $500 annually to reestablish,
on an annual basis, the Stearns Fellowship for students registered in the Graduate School and pursuing advanced work
in Pharmacy. It was provided that the holder of the
Stearns Fellowship should be appointed annually upon the
recommendation of the staff of the College of Pharmacy,
so long as funds should be thus provided by Frederick
Stearns and Company.
The Board accepted two fellowships of $.,500 each
from the National Tuberculosis Association. It was understood that nominations to the fellowship will be made by




ANNUAL JUNE MEETING, 1927


243


the head of the Department of Mathematics with the approval of officials of the National Tuberculosis Association, and further that the work of these fellows is to be in
general that of paid research assistantships.
The Board accepted with thanks the sum of $3,000 from
the Detroit Edison Company through its employment manager Mr. Arthur K. Hurlburt, for the establishment of a
fellowship in Personnel Administration during the threeyear period beginning with the University year I927-1928.
It is understood that the stipend of the fellow shall be $750,
with an expense account of $250 in addition to cover traveling expenses between Ann Arbor and Detroit during the academic year. The candidate, who will presumably hold the
fellowship through the full period of three years, is to be
selected by the Dean of the Graduate School in' cooperation
with the Department of Psychology, the School of Business Administration, and the Employment Bureau of the
Detroit Edison Company.
The following resolution was adopted:Whercas, The Regents of the University of Michigan,
a corporation organized by and existing under the Constitution of the State of Michigan, desire to secure, for the
necessary use of the University of Michigan, land adjacent
to land now owned by the Regents of the University of Michigan, and particularly as a site for buildings, structures, and
grounds for the development of physical education, which,
in the judgment of this Board is and should be an integral
part of a broad program of education, and the said corporation does not hold title to sufficient real estate so located but
needs to acquire real estate for such purpose, and the following described real estate, situated and being in the Township
of Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County, and State of Michigan,
has been selected by the Regents of the University of Michigan, as a necessary portion of the most available site for such
purpose:
Beginning forty rods north of the southeast
corner of section thirty-two  and running thence
north on the east line of said section, forty rods;
thence west at right angles with said first mentioned line, sixty rods; thence south parallel with




244


2 A.NNUAL JUINE MEETING, 1927


said first mentioned line, forty rods; thence east
to the place of beginning, containing fifteen acres
of land.
Also, forty-nine rods off the east end of the
following described tract, viz:-Beginning at the
northwest corner of the southwest quarter of the
southeast quarter of section thirty-two; thence east
on the half quarter line twenty-five chains; thence
south ten chains and eight links to a point, ten chains
north of the south  line; thence west twenty-five
chains parallel to the south line; thence north ten
chains and fourteen links to the place of beginning, containing twelve and 50/Ioo acres more or
less, and
Whereas, said corporation now  owns lands immediately adjoining the above-described land, and
zWhereas, the said corporation has endeavored to purchase said above-described land from the owners thereof,
and is unable to do so at a price at all commensurate with
its value;
Nozu Therefore, Be It Resolved, that the taking of the
above described land and property be and is hereby declared necessary for the public use of said University and
of the Regents of the University of Michigan, and that the
Attorney General of the State of Michigan be requested
to institute legal proceedings by law to condemn said property, and that the Secretary of the Regents of the University
of Michigan be authorized and directed to sign and verify
in behalf of the Regents of the University of Michigan, a
petition for the condemnation of such property and all other
papers necessary or proper for the conduct of such condemnation proceedings.
The following resolution was adopted:Resolved, That no student in attendance at the University from and after the beginning of the first semester of
the University year I927-I928 shall operate any motor vehicle. In exceptional and extraordinary cases in the discretion of the Dean of Students this rule may be relaxed.
The Board     received the following letter from     Des
1M. E. Cooley (R.P. 1923-I926, page 520):



A AN UAL JU NIE IMEETING, I927


245


The President
and Board of Regents of the University of Michigan.
Gentlemen:When I tendered my resignation a year ago for the
second time in the expectation of being placed on the retired
list I was again invited to continue on in the active service
of the University. I felt it to be a very great compliment,
as indeed it was; and being in fair health and feeling eager
for work, I gladly accepted your invitation.
But in doing so it was with the understanding that I
should continue to tender my resignation annually; and that
at the first signs of any waning of mental alertness my
friends might observe in me I should be retired. I put it
that way as I realize how often a man fails without being
conscious of it as age creeps on. Nothing would distress
me more than to feel that I was serving beyond the period
of my real usefulness to the University.
I therefore again tender my resignation with a heart
full of gratitude for the confidence you have had in me, and
for the many splendid opportunities you have given me to
work out the problems of the colleges over which I have
had the honor to preside.
Respectfully,
M. E. Cooley
Professor of Mechanical Engineering
and Dean of the Colleges of
Engineering and Architecture
June I, 1927
The Board voted to accept Dean Cooley's resignation
with regret to become effective as of June 30, 1928, and
for the University year I927-I928 leave of absence with
full salary was accorded Dean Cooley.
The Board referred to Regent Beal and the Secretary, as
a committee with power, the acquirement of sites for the
Michigan League Building and for the Elementary or Laboratory School, funds having been provided therefor by
the Legislature of I927.
A communication was received from the chairman of
the Board in Control of Athletics transmitting the recommendation of the Board in Control of Athletics by a majority vote that preference in the purchase of tickets for




246


ANNU.AL JUNE MEETING, 1927


athletic games be given to alumni of the University who
are members of local University of Michigan Clubs over
ticket requirements of the general public or of alumni who
are not members of local University of Michigan Clubs. It
was moved and seconded that the Regents approve this
recommendation of the Board in Control of Athletics. A
substitute motion was offered and seconded that the matter
lie on the table. This substitute resolution was lost by the
following vote; yes, Regent Beal, Regent Gore, Regent
Hanchett; no, Regent Murfin, Regent Hubbard, Regent
Clements, Regent Stone. The vote upon the original motion was therefore taken and the motion prevailed by the
following vote; yes, Regent Murfin, Regent Hubbard, Regent Clements, Regent Hanchett, and Regent Stone; no,
Regent Beal and Regent Gore.         Regent Hanchett gave
notice, however, that he had voted aye for the purpose of
being able properly to move a reconsideration of this action
at the next meeting of the Board.
The following rules were adopted for the reimbursement of persons using their own automobiles while traveling on University business:i. Any person traveling on the University's account
within the State shall have the alternative at all times of
using his own car with reimbursement therefor in the
amount of the usual common carrier rate between the points
covered by his journey. (When common carrier service is
adequately available, the University cannot properly be
charged more than a carrier fare. If the traveler desires
to use his own car for his greater pleasure, his convenience,
or other reasons, he may do so, but the University will reimburse him only to the amount chargeable for the journey
by rail, interurban, or bus, or other common carrier.)
2. When reasonably adequate common carrier service
is not available any person traveling for the University may
use his own car with expectation of reimbursement at the
rate of seven cents per mile between the points covered, provided always that the trip, at that rate, has been duly authorized on proper requisition in advance, by the authorized
Dean, or other proper departmental official, or by the Presi



ANNUAL JUNE MEETING, 1927


247


dent or Secretary. The rule of authorization in advance is
not to be waived except in cases of genuine emergency.
3. Charges for parking space (or equivalent garage
storage) will be allowed in addition to seven cents per mile
or common carrier fare.
4. Only one fare or one charge of seven cents per mile
will be allowed even though the driver carries a passenger
or more than one passenger on University account.  (Persons using their cars on University account are reivmbursed;
they are not selling transportation to the University.)
5. Any person driving his own or another privately
owned car while traveling for the University, does so on his
own account and not as an agent for the University; he
assumes all risk of accident to property or person, either
of himself or others. (No person is asked to drive his own
or another's car on the University's account,-he does so
only on his own choice or initiative. He may always use a
common carrier, even though it may be more expensive or
though the route may not be convenient as to time or location.
The University can and does insure all automobiles owned
by the University, including public liability risks; it cannot
possibly cover such risks in the case of privately owned cars
driven by their owners or others, and for this reason it
cannot and does not consent to assume any liability whatever
either for accident or injury to property or persons. It must,
therefore, be expressly understood, as above stated, that any
person driving his own car while traveling on official business for the University, assumes all liability for accident,
property damage, or personal injury, of any nature whatsoever.)
A  communication was received from       Mrs. Bessie Ritz,
widow of Gustave A. Ritz (page I27) thanking the Regents
for the allowance to her of Mr. Ritz's salary for the remainder of the semester following his death.      She also requested consideration of the possibility of the payment to
her of a widow's pension out of University funds, in view
of the long service of Mr. Ritz, and in view of a personal
injury which Mr. Ritz had suffered a number of years ago
and which it was thought might have been incurred in a
discharge of his duties, although there was no evidence to
indicate that it had in any way shortened his life. The Re



248


A4 ViNNUAL JUNlE MlEETING, 1927


gents expressed their regret at the practical impossibility
of voting a widow's pension to Mrs. Ritz.
The Board voted that should an assessment not to exceed $I,ooo be levied against the University by the Washtenaw County Drain Commissioner as a proper share of the
expense of constructing the proposed Eber White drain and
the Murray and Washington Street drain, the assessment
would be accepted and the tax paid by the University.
A sum not to exceed $6,662.50 for the purchase and
installation of twenty-five new operating chairs for the
School of Dentistry was voted. As an additional part of
the purchase price of these chairs it was understood that
there could be turned in such worn or obsolete chairs as
might in the judgment of the Dean of the School of Dentistry be thus properly exchangeable to the advantage of
the University.
The sum of $400 was appropriated to be included in the
budget for I927-I928 with the understanding that not to
exceed this amount might be used to secure a course of
lectures by Professor C. Carathedory of the University of
Munich, as a part of a traveling lectureship sponsored by the
American Mathematical Society.
The Board declined to rent University-owned land on
the extension of Forest Avenue for the purposes of a gasoline filling station.
Degrees and certificates were voted as follows, all on
the recommendation of the proper Faculty in each case:BACHELOR or SCIENCE (IN MEDICINE;)

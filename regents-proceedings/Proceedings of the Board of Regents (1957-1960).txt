THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
By:...............................................
Wilbur K. Pierpont
Vice-President in Charge of Business and Finance
Date of Authorization: July 12, 1957
Ann Arbor, Michigan
The Regents convened at 3:35 P.M. at Fair Lane.
The President made a general statement relative to the Dearborn
Center, followed by Vice-President Niehuss detailing the development
of the plans for the academic facilities to be carried on in the educational buildings to be provided by the Ford Motor Company Fund.
Statements were also made by Dean Dorr and by Mr. Barr of Barr and
Linde, the architects who have been involved in the development of the
site and plans for the buildings. After a full discussion of all of the
elements involved in this venture, the Board authorized the proper
University officials to proceed with the detailed plans and specifications
for the utilities and the buildings outlined in the program presented
for the Dearborn Center site of the University of Michigan, provided
it can be accomplished within the $6,500,000 grant of the Ford Motor
Company Fund (R.P., 1954-57, p. 1457).
The Regents designated the firm of Hubbell, Roth and Clark, of
Birmingham, to draw the plans for the necessary utilities, roadways,
parking, etc.. and designated Giffels and Vallet, Inc., of Detroit, as the
architects for the buildings.
Regent Bonisteel made the following statement:
Mr. President, Fellow Regents, and Friends:
This is an historic meeting. I am sure we appreciate the planning and work
done by our faculty and the representatives of other groups in making this presentation possible as well as bringing to us such a plan for the development of this
project, which we might properly call our East Campus.
The Regents wish to express sincere gratitude to our benefactors, the Ford
Motor Company and the Ford Motor Company Fund, who have made all this
possible. No one here today can completely envisage the future of this undertaking
in education, higher education, which will be developed over the next quarter of a
century-not only physical development of buildings and the like but the development in the field of education with great emphasis on the quality offered. Because
of this our Board wishes to express sincere gratitude, yes, emotionally express it,
if you please, to our benefactors for the opportunity offered the University of
Michigan to co-operate with people of this community and the people of the
entire state of Michigan in a new educational program for the young men and




JULY MEETING, 1957


27


women of this state. Needless to say that over the oncoming years the generosity
of our benefactors will attract other benefactors to help develop this project. The
opportunity and the vision are here now, and we gladly accept the challenge to
new leadership in educational horizons.
It is to be noted also that under present plans the integrity of Fair Lane, the
Henry Ford home, will be maintained. It is already a place of great interest in the
minds of the peoples of the world-and they will come from all over the globe to
visit it. We will try to match this interest with our new opportunity. Thanks
again for the chance.
Regent Connable presented to the Regents the following resolution,       A. L. Brandon:
which was adopted by the Board in view       of the fact that this is the    Relundation
final meeting at which Dr. Arthur L. Brandon, Director of University
Relations, will be in attendance:
Be It Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan go on record
as expressing their deep appreciation to Arthur L. Brandon for his conscientious
devotion, loyalty, and creativeness in forwarding and developing a constructive and
well co-ordinated public relations program for the University. He has set and
achieved high professional standards that have won national recognition for the
University in this field. After almost twelve years of dedicated service to Michigan,
we wish him well and all success as he assumes his new responsibilities at New
York University.
Regent Connable's travel expense vouchers for attendance at the
meetings of April 19 and June 14 and Honors Convocation on May 10
in the total amount of $84.79 were approved.
A letter was received from Miss Ethel A. McCormick, Social Director of Women, Office of the Dean of Women, thanking the Board for
their action in granting her a leave of absence because of illness (R.P.,
1954-57, p. 1528).
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to meet on September 20, with the understanding that following that meeting a general discussion will be held
on Friday evening and Saturday following on the subject of part-time
service by those employed by the University.

respective corporation for the accumulation of the rents and profits and
income thereof until such time as such accumulation shall amount to the
sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00). Thereupon such onefourth and such accumulation and the fund then existing which shall then
represent the three-fourths of the original bequest shall be consolidated and
shall be available for the use of such corporation as one trust fund, the
income of which shall thereafter be used for the same purposes as I now direct
that the income of three-fourths of the bequest shall be used from the inception of the trust, viz., for the purchase of books of the kind and character
specified immediately following the name of each of the corporations, to be
added to and retained in the libraries of the said institutions to which I have
hereinbefore, in this paragraph "SECOND" of my Will made a bequest."
The will of Mrs. Harper's husband, Lathrop Colgate Harper,
who predeceased her, provided that the entire estate go to Mabel
Herbert Harper if she survived him, and if not
"All the rest of my property, real and personal, I direct my executors to divide
into eight equal parts. One each of said equal parts I give. devise and
bequeath to... The William L. Clements Library of Ann Arbor, Michigan.... All of which bequests are to be held in trust by the said institutions and
the principal to be kept invested pursuant to the laws governing trust funds,
and the interest from said trust funds to be used by the said institutions for
the purchase of printed books more than 100 years old and for no other
purpose."
Inasmuch as it was apparently the intent of Mr. Harper that the
income from this fund was to be used by the William L. Clements
Library, the Regents so directed.
H emenwayh W.       Estate of Beulah W. Hemenway, A.B., 1899, deceased            (R.P.,
Will      1954-57, p. 1541):
"To the Governors or Trustees of Adelia Cheever House of the University
of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan ($5,000.00) to be used as loans or scholarship awards for deserving girls in the discretion of said Governors or
Trustees."
The Michigan Department of Revenue held that, since the bequest was not specifically to a tax-exempt entity, it was subject to
inheritance tax. The executor paid the tax, and we are in receipt of
the executor's check in the amount of $4,525.00 in payment of the
legacy, less the tax.
This bequest in the amount of $4,525.00 is to establish a fund
to be used for loans and scholarship awards for deserving girls who
are residents of Adelia Cheever House.
Erasmus C.         Estate of Erasmus C. Lindley, LL.B., 1896, deceased:
"FIRST:          I give and bequeath:
"(f) Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) to the UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN, Ann Arbor, Michigan, to be held and maintained as a permanent fund, to be known as the 'LINDLEY SCHOLARSHIP'; the income
from said fund shall be used, at the discretion of the Board of Regents of said
institution to help worthy and needy law students."
S. D. McGraw:         Estate   of Stanley   Dickinson    McGraw, A.B., 1892, deceased
Will      (R.P., 1948-51, p. 1140):
"All of the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, both real and personal,
I give, devise, and bequeath to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
Michigan, for scholarship or student loan purposes, and I hope the name of
Stanley Dickinson McGraw will be used to make known the benefactor."
The executor advises that at the present time the gross estate is
approximately $1,200,000. There are specific bequests of personal
effects, a summer home, and $230,000 in cash.

The following memoirs were adopted:
G. G. Brown:                        GEORGE GRANGER BROWN
Memoir
The death at age sixty of Dr. George Granger Brown, Edward DeMille
Campbell University Professor of Chemical Engineering and Dean of the College
of Engineering, August 26, 1957, has taken from the University and from the
world a great scientist and a renowned teacher. Following his graduation in 1914
from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he completed the requirements for a
Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1917 at New York University. At the
same university, in 1924, he received a degree in chemical engineering. In 1922
he earned the M.S. degree in engineering at the University of Michigan and two
years later, the Ph.D. degree. In 1917 he became Engineering and Department
Manager of the Aluminum Company of America; the following year, Chief
Engineer of the Universal Aniline Dyes and Chemical Company; in 1919, Production Manager of the Union Special Machine Company in Chicago; in 1920,
Operator at the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company. In the same year he
joined the Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering in the College
of Engineering at the University of Michigan as Instructor, advancing in the next
decade to the rank of Professor. He became Chairman of the Department of
Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering in 1942; in 1951, Dean of the College
of Engineering. His research in the field of petroleum fuels was reflected in a great
number of papers and monographs that established his reputation internationally.
More than thirty companies in America and in Canada sought his expert judgment
as consultant. He served as director, vice-president, and chairman of many of the
important committees of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. In 1939
the Institute conferred upon him the William H. Walker Award for the work that
he had done in thermodynamics as it related to chemical engineering, and particularly to petroleum refining. The Institute in 1944 conferred upon him its




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1957


89


highest honor by electing him President. Professor Brown was appointed Director
of Engineering for the Reactor Division of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1949. In 1954 his colleagues at the University of Michigan recognized
his scholarly eminence and chose him Henry Russel Lecturer. He was a member of
the Executive Committee of the College of Engineering from 1942-46; a member
of the Executive Board of the Graduate School for many years. In 1943 he was a
member of the Senate Committee on Faculty-Regents Relations. The intellectual
excitement which he brought to his studies and into his classroom, combined with
the authority born of practical experience, gave him a reputation that attracted
students to the University from all parts of the world. He insisted upon high
quality performance in himself and in those about him. He translated his ideals to
his faculty and revitalized the work throughout the College of Engineering. The
high position the College has achieved among the engineering schools of the nation
in the short period of his deanship stands as a monument to his leadership. The
Regents of the University of Michigan express to the members of Dean Brown's
family their deepest sympathy and mourn with his many friends their great loss.
ROSCOE WILLIAM      CAVELL
The death of Dr. Roscoe William Cavell, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry,
at the age of sixty-one years, when he seemed to have reached the very height of
his effectiveness, occurred July 13, 1957. After earning the B.S. degree from
Emmanuel Missionary College, Berrien Springs, Michigan, in 1919, Dr. Cavell
attended the College of Medical Evangelists at Loma Linda, California, where he
earned the M.D. degree in 1921. The following year he was an intern at the
White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles. From 1922 to 1931, Dr. Cavell carried
on a general practice at Gardena and at Los Angeles, California, and also was
Junior Attending Physician, Contagious Disease Service, Los Angeles General
Hospital (1926-27), and Junior Attending Psychiatrist at the same hospital
(1929-30). From 1931 to 1933, Dr. Cavell was Psychiatrist with the U.S. Public
Health Service at the Penitentiary Annex, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. From 1934
to 1936, he was on active duty with the U. S. Army as Assistant Post-Surgeon,
Fort Missoula, Montana. He was Psychiatrist at the Wayne County General
Hospital, Eloise, Michigan, from 1936 to 1940. For the next six years, until 1946,
he was on active duty with the U. S. Army Medical Corps, being separated with
the rank of Colonel. From 1946 to the time of his death, Dr. Cavell was Consultant to the Secretary of National Defense, Department of the Army. He was also
engaged during these years in private practice of psychiatry in Detroit and there
was attached in various clinical and administrative capacities to Harper Hospital
and to Grace Hospital. Dr. Cavell came to the University of Michigan as Assistant
Professor of Psychiatry in 1951. In addition to membership in the American
Medical Association, the Michigan Medical Society, and the Wayne County
Medical Society, Dr. Cavell also was a member of the American Psychiatric
Association and the Michigan Society of Neurology and Psychiatry. The Regents
of the University express their deep sympathy to Dr. Cavell's family and mourn
his death with them and with his many friends.


R. W. Cavell:
Memoir


GORDON ALEXANDER SUTHERLAND
The death of Dr. Gordon Alexander Sutherland, Professor of Music, at the
age of fifty-one, has deprived the School of Music and the University community
of a brilliant musician and administrator. Dr. Sutherland, who was trained at the
American Conservatory of Music and at Harvard University, enjoyed a wide
experience as teacher and administrator before coming to the University in 1951.
From 1946 to 1951 he had been Professor of Music, Head of the Department of
Music, and Dean of the School of Fine Arts at Miami University. In the short
period of barely six years after he joined the faculty of the University's School of
Music, he co-ordinated all of the graduate work in the School, and achieved for it
a new high level that drew praise and acclamation from all parts of the country.
Professor Sutherland set his mark not only upon his department in the School of
Music but upon the entire school itself. In thinking of his devotion to his ideals
as musician and administrator, he may well be likened to another musician and
inventor who was praised by a great English poet in these words:
But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,
Existent behind all laws, that made them and, lo, they are!
And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,
That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1957


G. M. Bleekman:
Memoir


The Regents of the University of Michigan join in the sorrow which Professor
Sutherland's death has brought to his many colleagues and friends and express to
his family their heartfelt sympathy.
The President also reported the retirement of members of the
faculty. The following memoirs were adopted:
GEORGE MOYER BLEEKMAN enrolled as a student at the University of
Michigan in 1913, earning the B.S. degree in Civil Engineering three years later.
From 1916 to 1917 he undertook graduate study and was Teaching Assistant in
Geodesy and Surveying. After serving in France from 1917 to 1919 with the 23rd
Regiment of Engineers, he was Field Clerk in Transportation for the American
Relief Administration there until September, 1920. He then acted as Secretary to
the Director of Exports for Oneida Community, Ltd. until June, 1922, when he

the Borrower shall procure and maintain Use and Occupancy Insurance on each
building, the revenues of which are pledged to payment of the Bonds, in an

which shall be deposited from the Project Revenue Fund Account on or before
the close of each fiscal year, (1) not more than $25,000 annually for an equipment reserve until the funds and/or investments in the equipment reserve portion
of the account shall aggregate $250,000 and thereafter such sums, but not more
than $25,000 annually as may be required to restore and maintain the balance of
$250,000 and (2) not more than $35,000 annually for a building maintenance
reserve. All monies in the "Building Maintenance and Equipment Reserve Account"
may be drawn on and used by the Borrower for the purpose of paying the cost of
unusual or extraordinary maintenance or repairs, renewals and replacements, and
the renovating or replacement of the furniture and equipment not paid as part of
the ordinary and normal expense of Project operation. However, in the event the
funds in the Bond and Interest Sinking Fund Account should be reduced below the
amount required to meet the then current year's debt service and a debt service
reserve of $200,000 on the outstanding Bonds, funds on deposit in the "Building
Maintenance and Equipment Reserve Account" shall be transferred to the Bond
and Interest Sinking Fund Account to the extent required to eliminate the deficiency
jn that Account.
e) Subject to the foregoing, the Borrower may use the balance of excess funds
in the Project Revenue Fund Account to redeem outstanding Bonds on the next
interest payment date, in inverse numerical order and in amounts of not less than
$5,000 par value at one time, or for any expenditures, including the payment of
debt service, in improving or restoring any existing housing and dining facilities or
providing any such additional facilities, or for any other lawful purpose.
f) Prior to filing any requisition for loan funds, the Borrower shall present
satisfactory evidence of its ability to provide the moveable equipment and
furnishings required for the operation of the Project and that it has deposited in
the Construction Account the sum of $2,050,000, being the difference between the
amount of the loan and the estimated development cost of the Project. Section 8,
Construction Account of the Terms and Conditions attached to the Loan Agreement
is hereby modified by substitution of the following sentences for the last paragraph
of that Section: Any monies remaining in the Construction Account after all costs
of the Project have been paid, but not more than $2,050,000, shall be returned to
the Borrower. Any funds then remaining in the Construction Account shall be

promptly used for redemption of bonds; Provided, However, that any of such
funds in an amount less than $1,000 shall be deposited in the Bond and Interest
Sinking Fund Account.
g) The Borrower shall covenant and agree that the heating service which is to
be supplied the Project from its central distribution system will be furnished at a
reasonable cost as long as any of the bonds are outstanding.
h) The Borrower shall covenant that any balance remaining from the $500,000
Series A Bonds sold to provide the furnishings and moveable equipment will, after
such provision, be deposited in the Bond and Interest Sinking Fund Account for
redemption of Bonds.
i) The second sentence of the first paragraph of Section 8, Construction
Account of the Terms and Conditions constituting part of the Loan Agreement is
revised as follows: "Monies in the Construction Account shall be expended only
for such purposes as are set forth in the latest approved Contract or Project
Change Memorandum (Form H-917, revised)."
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been executed in the name and on
behalf of the United States of America, Housing and Home Finance Administrator,

The President presented a tentative proposal for the capital outlay      Capital Outlay
Program 1958
program   for 1958-59, and a five-year program      for the period   1958   to 1963
through 1963. This program includes new construction for educational
facilities, remodeling and additions, and special maintenance. The
amount requested for the rehabilitation of the University Hospital is
separated from the request for educational facilities. The Regents
approved this program as presented, with the understanding that the
request for appropriations may vary from year to year (R.P., 1954-57,
p. 1147).
The Regents confirmed the approval of the following proposal and         Botanical
Gardens
offer with respect to the relocation of the Botanical Gardens (R.P.,        Relocation:
1954-57, p. 1530):                                                          Gift Proposal
July 26, 1957
To the Honorable The Board of Regents:
I have had extended discussions with President Hatcher and Wilbur Pierpont
looking toward my making a substantial gift to the University of Michigan.
I understand, on behalf of the University, you would welcome an opportunity
to dispose of the present Botanical Gardens, consisting of approximately 40 to 50
acres, and to acquire a new and more suitable site for such Gardens.
At the northern end of my Radrick Farms property in Washtenaw County.
there are approximately 200 acres of land shown on the drawing attached, which
I believe you would find a highly acceptable site.
I am the owner of approximately 140 acres of this suggested site (outlined in
red) and have under option, expiring this August 1, 1957, the remaining approximately 60 acres (outlined in blue) for a purchase price of $96,000.00.
Now then, I propose and offer:
1. That acting as an agent for the University as an undisclosed principal, I
exercise these options and purchase the subject 60 acres-the $96,000.00 purchase
price to be paid by the University of Michigan on demand.
2. I would deed to the University the above described approximately 140
acres-the entire 200 acre site to be used by it as and for a Botanical Garden.
My conveyance to the University would be an outright gift of land having a
present market value, conservatively, in excess of $250,000.00.
3. In order to provide the University with funds with which to construct a
truly outstanding botanical garden over a development period, I will pledge
$300,000.00 to be paid at such times and in such amounts as the University may
request of me, as such development progresses. I further pledge that at my option,
either within my lifetime or by my last will and testament, I will reimburse the
University for the $96,000.00 expended by it for the aforesaid 60 acre parcel.
The following are the only conditions to the above-offered conveyances and
gifts:
1. The property and the pledged funds would be used and expended in the
construction and development of the Botanical Gardens as a beautiful and outstanding facility of its kind, with every effort made toward scientific experimentation and the introduction of a wide range of species of plants, trees, and shrubs,
to the end that this facility would compare with or surpass in excellence the finest
of such facilities wherever now existing.
2. An effort will be made by the University, at suitable times, to give access
and some use of the property to the general public in a manner not inconsistent
with the development and maintenance of the Gardens, to the end that the public
may at once enjoy the beauty combined with some incidental measure of recreational use-particularly favoring the admission of the people in Ann Arbor and
Superior Townships, all of whom are my friends and neighbors.
3. I am the owner of a large tract of land bordering the proposed Botanical
Gardens, on the south of which is located my home, and I would ask that so long




114


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1957


as any members of the Matthaei family reside at Radrick Farms to the south of
this property, that we, together with our personal guests, have a right, in perpetuity, of entry through at least two gates to be constructed on the Gardens' south
boundary line and freedom to move about within the Gardens, walking, driving or
riding, solely for the purpose of enjoying the natural beauties of this property
that we have developed and come to love so much.
I suggest that you give prompt consideration to this proposal as the expiration
date of the options described above would alone emphasize the need for promptness
in coming to a decision in this matter.
Respectfully,
Frederick C. Matthaei
Dixon Property   The Board authorized the Vice-President in charge of business and
Purchase
Authorized  finance to negotiate for the purchase of the Dixon property, 1696
Broadway, as an addition to the North Campus area. The property
consists of 5.17 acres, including a house and a greenhouse. The owner is
86 years of age and wishes to retain a life interest in the house and
immediate ground area.
F.B.I. Spdace  The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized
to arrange with the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the space needs
of this organization, provided a national emergency should occur in the
Detroit area. Permission also was given for similar arrangements with
other governmental agencies. This authorization is in addition to that
approved by the Committee of the Whole on June 15, 1956, at which
time permission was given to provide space for the Michigan Bell
Telephone Company.
C. A. DeWitt    The Regents authorized the proper University officers to enter into
rranSgement with an agency agreement with the National Bank of Detroit, Trust DepartNational Bank  ment, covering the assets of the Clyde A. DeWitt Law Scholarship and
of Detroit Loan Fund on the same terms and conditions as those in the agreements
for the Major Endowment Funds and the Employees Retirement Fund.
The annual fee for the agency account will be /5 of one per cent of the
value of the principal of the fund. The Regents also approved a policy
of shifting the assets of the fund into approximately 50 per cent bonds
and preferred stocks and 50 per cent common stocks. It is understood
that the cost of this fee, payable to the National Bank of Detroit,
would approximate $2,600, which will be charged against the income
of the fund, but that the DeWitt Fund will be reimbursed for this
amount for its share of the fee. It is understood, however, that the one
other beneficiary of the estate of Mr. DeWitt will pay his share of the
fee charged by the National Bank of Detroit (R.P., 1954-57, p. 1481).
0. Ditson    On recommendation by the Dean of the School of Music, permisEndowment:
Use of sion was given to use the expendable fund of the Oliver Ditson Endowment during the year 1957-58 as follows:
$2,000 for scholarships
$500 for giving public performances of musical compositions
$500 payable to a fellow in composition, to be named later, after
receipt of work commissioned by the Stanley Quartet.
Student Loan    The Vice-President for Student Affairs presented a report on the
Fands Rpulo student loan funds as requested by the Committee of the Whole on
Governing  February 15, 1957. As of June 30, 1957, the total loan fund principal
Administration of amounted to $1,089,298.50, with loans outstanding as of the same date
of $602,698.82, or 55.3 per cent of the principal amount. This percentage is in contrast to 39.5 per cent for the period ending June 30, 1956,
and 30.5 per cent for the period ending June 30, 1955. Also, during the




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1957


115


University year 1956-57, 65.7 per cent of the principal of the loan
funds was used, this being 15 per cent more than for the University
year 1955-56 and 22 per cent more than during 1954-55. On recommendation by the Vice-President for Student Affairs the Regents agreed
that for the present the general rules governing the loan fund program
be allowed to remain as they are, with the understanding that at the
end of the present semester a further report will be made of the
experience of the first semester. The Regents did, however, approve
that the following revision governing the actions of the Committee on
Student Loans be adopted:
STUDENT LOAN FUNDS
The University of Michigan is fortunate in having at its disposal loan funds
for which deserving students may apply. Funds have been given to the University
for this purpose by alumni, educational organizations, and other friends of
students. Loans are made in accordance with the conditions set forth by the
individual donors and the rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Regents
for the administration of these funds.
In granting of student loans, the Board of Regents has delegated discretionary
power to the Committee on Student Loans. The Regents have charged the
Committee with the establishment of regulations concerning the applications for
loans and the standards to be observed in the granting of loans.
The administrative policy established by the Committee on Student Loans and
approved by the Board of Regents is as follows:
1. Unless otherwise provided by the terms and conditions laid down by the
donors thereof, the administration of all student loan funds is by the Committee
on Student Loans. The Committee consists of the following members: the Dean of
Men, the Dean of Women, the Secretary of the University, and a representative
from the business and financial staff of the University appointed by the President
on recommendation of the Vice-President in charge of business and finance; the
Dean of Men serves as chairman. Meetings of the Committee are held regularly
and on call of the Chairman. Under conditions set forth below, the Committee
may delegate to individual members of the Committee or other persons specifically
approved by the Committee certain procedural functions of the Committee.
2. In general, a student may borrow from the University to help finance his
education if he is currently enrolled as a student at the time he makes application
or if he has established a record of responsible academic achievement.
3. The amount of money available to a student within a given year and for
his total program depends upon a number of factors which the Committee takes
into account. A part of the application procedure is a personal interview with the
appropriate Dean or with the Committee as a whole, in which the student discusses his yearly budget, sources of income, need for a loan, and plans for repayment of the loan. Applications for loans are filed upon forms provided for women
at the Office of the Dean of Women and for men at the Office of the Dean of Men.
A student under twenty-one needs a letter of parental approval to accompany the
application, and all students must have a faculty recommendation.
4. The Committee on Student Loans has specifically delegated to the Dean of
Men and the Dean of Women the granting of loans in an amount not to exceed
$300 as a cumulative total for one student, payable before the beginning of the
next University year. Each Dean must submit periodically to the Committee a
detailed report of all loans granted in this manner.
5. Each student borrower shall sign a note for the full amount of this loan.
The Committee may require the maker of the note to furnish additional security —
either an endorser or acceptable collateral.
6. Except where a different provision has been made, student loans shall draw
interest at 3 per cent per annum from the date the loan is made. In case the
borrower is unable to meet his payments when they come due, he may apply for a
renewal of the note at the rate of interest charged on the original note. Overdue
notes will bear interest at the rate of 6 per cent.
7. Loans shall be payable in a lump sum or in installments to be arranged
with the Loan Committee. Payments are applied to liquidate accumulated interest
before they are applied to reduce the principal. The Loan Committee will determine
the maturity date of the note.




116


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1957


8. If the borrower is unable to make payment when it is due, he may apply
for renewal of the note at the rate of interest charged on the original loan. Loan
renewal requests by students in residence or by students returning to the University
are made by women at the Office of the Dean of Women and by men at the Office
of the Dean of Men. Loan renewals requested by students no longer in residence
are made to the Chief Accountant of the University.
9. If a loan is due before the end of the semester and is not paid or renewed,
the student may not receive credit for his semester's work, will not be issued a
transcript, and may not re-register until payment or renewal is made. This delinquency is posted on the student's personnel record.
10. If a loan is due before the beginning of the semester and is not paid or
renewed, the student is not allowed to register or is asked to withdraw if he has
already registered.
EmmaD.       In accordance with the provisions of the University of Michigan
ederick:  Disability Program  the Regents approved participation by Emma D.
Allowance  Frederick beginning August 1, 1957, for the period of her disability,
Provided for but not to extend beyond January 28, 1965, if disability continues, at
which time she will be transferred to the Employees Retirement Plan.
Under the terms of the program, Mrs. Frederick will receive $133.50
a month in salary, plus an additional amount to be paid by the University of $40.06 for her retirement benefit and $1.80 for group
insurance, to a total of $175.36 a month.
J. A. Mann:    The Regents approved the recommendation of the Personnel Officer
ASawalnSt  and the Vice-President in charge of business and finance that James
Provided for Alexis Mann participate in the University of Michigan Disability
Program beginning September 11, 1957, for the period of his disability,
but not to extend beyond July 25, 1961, if he continues to be disabled.
At that time he will be transferred to the Employees Retirement Plan.
Mr. Mann will receive salary amounting to $200 a month, to which
will be added an amount payable by the University of $69.96 for his
retirement benefit and $4.80 for group insurance, for a total payable by
the University of $274.76 a month.
A. J. Gibson:   On recommendation of the Personnel Officer and the Vice-President.R.P. to in charge of business and finance, the Regents reinstated Arthur J.
Gibson, Pharmacist at the University Hospital, in the Employees Retirement Plan, although he had resigned his position and had requested
the University to refund his contributions in the amount of $4,546.04
on September 13, 1956. It is understood that he will return the amount
refunded to him, plus interest, to the Employees Retirement Plan, and
that credit for his entire period of employment at the Health Service,
where he was formerly employed, will be applied toward his final
retirement benefit.
General    The President presented to the Regents the tentative University
Operations
Budget Operations Budget for 1958-59, upon which legislative requests will be
1958-59 based.The Regents approved the recommendations that, as of the date
requested by the Budget Office, the University will present an approximate figure of the total amount needed as an appropriation from the
legislature, and that at a later meeting of the Board the budget, completed for presentation to the Budget Office, will be presented to the
Regents for confirmation.

W. L. Whitaker:r    The President reported the death of Wayne L. Whitaker, Ph.D.,
Professor of Anatomy and Assistant Dean of the Medical School, which
occurred on September 29, 1957. The following memoir was adopted
for inclusion in these minutes:
The Regents mourn with the University community the death of Dr. Wayne L.
Whitaker, Professor of Anatomy and Assistant Dean of the Medical School, September 29, 1957, at the age of fifty-three. Following his graduation from
DePauw University in 1926, Professor Whitaker was Assistant Pastor at the
First Methodist Church in Elkhart, Indiana. From 1928 to 1932, he was Assistant
Director of Lawrence Hall, a home for dependent boys in Chicago. From 1932 to
1939, he was a graduate student at the University of Michigan, where he earned
the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in zoology. He was a teaching assistant in the Department of Zoology from 1934 to 1937, in which year he joined the Department of
Anatomy as a part-time instructor. In 1943 he became Assistant Professor of
Anatomy, and in due course, Professor of Anatomy. In 1953 he was named Assistant Dean of the Medical School. Professor Whitaker's versatility was reflected in
his ability to teach, to do research, and to carry the burdens of administration.
His authoritative judgment in the area of evaluating candidates for the study of
medicine was sought by such bodies as the Association of American Medical
Colleges. His understanding of young people and his wide experience in working
with them developed for him an enviable reputation. His laugh cheered his students
and often cleared their troubles. Patience, the first requisite of his administrative
assignment, he developed into a fine art. It became the crowning quality in his
character and marked his greatness of heart.
The Regents of the University of Michigan join in the sorrow which Professor
Whitaker's death has brought to his many colleagues and friends and express
deepest sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Leaves of Absence   The following leaves of absence and extension of leave of absence
were approved (p. 98):

Appointment
Vaughan that he be permitted to engage the services of Dr. Carey P.         Approved
McCord on a per diem basis, with compensation to vary between $50
and $100 per diem, dependent upon the obligations imposed upon the
lecturer. Although Dr. McCord has retired, the Regents granted this
privilege because at present no other individual is available who can
furnish the material for such lectures, and it is more economical to
employ Dr. McCord, who lives in Ann Arbor, than to import a lecturer
who lives at some distance. It is anticipated that the total payment to
Dr. McCord will probably not exceed $1,200 during the University year.

C. C. Furnas


CLIFFORD COOK FURNAS, Ph.D., University of Michigan, 1926; aeronautical
engineer; Chancellor of the University of Buffalo. Ability to translate vision into
reality marks his career. Insistence upon extraordinary achievement in all phases
of his development won for him while he was a student at Purdue University the
Big Ten Conference Medal for the best combined scholastic and athletic record.
In the three main fields of his accomplishment-process metallurgy, chemical
engineering, and aeronautical engineering-there is reflected his conviction that the
scientist who develops a theory should also undertake its application. In 1941 and
1942, with the National Defense Research Committee, he combined various and
differing elements into a single effective program. This co-ordination was translated
into the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, of which he became Executive VicePresident and Director. Having served in Washington for a period of two years as
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Development, he returned this
year to his duties as educator. Honored by the University at her Centennial in
1937. he again is invited to receive her acclaim.
J. C. Zeder          JAMES CHURCHILL ZEDER. automotive engineer, educator, industrial planner,
graduate of the College of Engineering in the Class of 1922. His ability to deal
with administrative problems and to organize more effective methods of industrial
production soon became apparent. In 1924 he became associated with the corporation which today reflects all the facets of his genius. He has applied his theories
of education in the Chrysler Institute of Engineering, which he helped to found
and of which he is President. In World War II his country sought his expert
judgment again and again. Brilliant analyst. ardent patriot, loyal alumnus, your
Alma MIater proudly honors you this day.
J. H. Doolittle      JAMES HAROLD DOOLITTLE, aviator, pioneer in aeronautics, military strategist.
He has combined reason and calm judgment to achieve the impossible. His discipline of men reveals his talent to reach the small and to rule the great. Recipient
of the world's highest praise, he is a leader of leaders. We are honored in honoring
him.

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1957


a) Four seventeenths (4/17) thereof to the Regents of the University of
Michigan. In the event that said four-seventeenths (4/17) does not amount to Six
Thousand ($6,000.00) Dollars, then this bequest is to be for Six Thousand
($6,000.00) Dollars. Should four-seventeenths (4/17) of the residue of my estate
be less than Six Thousand ($6,000.00) Dollars, I direct that the amount sufficient
to be added thereto to make up the above mentioned Six Thousand ($6,000.00)
Dollars be deducted from the share of the residue hereinafter provided in Paragraph "b" immediately following this one. The fund hereby created, to be known
as the "DR. CHARLES WILLIAM HALL MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP LOAN FUND,"
is to be used for the following purposes:
This fund is to be held in trust by the Regents of the University of Michigan
and to be used as a loan fund from which loans are to be made to students in the
University of Michigan School of Dentistry, such loans not to exceed Five Hundred ($500.00) Dollars per year to any one individual and to bear interest at two
(2%) per cent per annum, commencing at the date of graduation of such student
from the School of Dentistry if the student receiving such loan graduates therefrom, and if such student does not graduate therefrom, then from the date when
such student shall abandon the dental course in the University. Repayment of the
amount loaned is to be made within five (5) years from the date of graduation
should the borrowing student graduate, and if such student does not graduate, said
loan is to be repaid within six (6) months from the time the course of study is
abandoned. Loans from this fund are to be made only to students who have successfully completed one (1) year of study in the University of Michigan School of
Dentistry and have shown diligence in pursuit of studies and an aptitude for the
course of study and who are unable to continue such course of study without
financial assistance, and the amount of the loan made to any student entitled to
receive the same shall be such an amount as will enable such student to continue
the course of study.
The selection of students applicable to borrow money from this fund shall be
determined by the Loan Committee of the University of Michigan with the aid and
advice of the Dean of the School of Dentistry. Any student obtaining a loan from
this fund shall execute and deliver such student's promissory note for the amount
of the loan so obtained, payable to the Regents of the University of Michigan,
setting forth the time when the same shall become due, and rate of interest charged
thereon, and other conditions necessary to carry out the provisions herein set
forth. Interest income from the use of these funds shall be added to the fund.
Gertrude R.     The Attorney for the Regents reported that the will of Gertrude R.
Condon Will of  Condon, '04a, has recently been offered for probate in Wayne County,
Michigan. The residuary clause of the will provides as follows:
I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my property
of every kind and nature, now and hereafter acquired, to the Regents of the
University of Michigan, with the request that the income therefrom shall be used
for the benefit of the Physics Department of the University in memory of my
father, George S. Roper, and my mother, Emma Roper.

the same Trust Agreement, dated as of October 1, 1957, and for which purchase
commitments have been, or are to be, entered into with others than the Government.
b) The Borrower shall covenant and agree that as soon as any portion of the

from the operation or ownership of the Project shall be deposited to the credit of
a special fund, to be known as the "Project Revenue Fund Account" and held in




222


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1957


the custody of the Financial Officer of the Borrower, separate and apart from all
other funds. Such Project Revenue Fund Account shall be maintained, so long as
any of the Bonds are outstanding, in a bank which is a member of the Federal
Deposit Corporation and shall be expended and used by the Financial Officer only
in the manner and order specified below.
c) Current Expenses of the Project shall be payable-as a first charge, from
the Project Revenue Fund Account as the same become due and payable. Current
Expenses shall include all necessary operating expenses, current maintenance
charges, expenses of reasonable upkeep and repairs, properly allocated share of
charges for insurance and all other expenses incident to the operation of the
Project but shall exclude depreciation, all general administrative expenses of the
Borrower and the payment into the "Building Maintenance and Equipment
Reserve" hereinafter provided for.
d) The Borrower shall establish with the Trustee to be designated in the
Indenture, and maintain so long as any of the Series "A" Bonds and Series "B"
Bonds are outstanding, a separate account or accounts (herein collectively called
the "Bond and Interest Sinking Fund Account"), into which shall be deposited all
accrued interest received from the sale of the said Bonds, together with the portion
of the proceeds of the said Bonds that is allocated for the specific purpose of
paying the interest accruing thereon during the construction period of the Project.
Thereafter, as soon as any portion of the Project becomes revenue producing and
after providing for the payment of Current Expenses, the Borrower shall transfer
from the Project Revenue Fund Account and deposit to the credit of the Bond and
Interest Sinking Fund Account, on or before each March 15 and September 15,
the balance therein until the funds and/or investments therein are sufficient to
meet the debt service requirements on the outstanding Bonds for the current year,
plus a debt service reserve in the sum of $300,000 and thereafter, on or before
each March 15 and September 15, such sums from said sources as may be necessary to meet the then current year's debt service and maintain the debt service
reserve in the sum of $300,000.
e) As soon as the required reserve is accumulated in the Bond and Interest
Sinking Fund, the Borrower shall establish with the Trustee a separate account
called the Building Maintenance and Equipment Reserve Account into which shall
be deposited from the Project Revenue Fund Account on or before the close of
each fiscal year, not to exceed $60,000 annually until such time as deposits in this
Account shall aggregate $180,000, and thereafter, not more than $60,000 annually
as may be required to restore and maintain the balance of $180,000. All moneys in
the Building Maintenance and Equipment Reserve Account may be drawn on and
used by the Borrower for the purpose of paying the cost of unusual or extraordinary maintenance or repairs, renewals and replacements, and the renovating or
replacement of the furniture and equipment not paid as part of the ordinary and
normal expense of Project operation. However, in the event the funds in the
Bond and Interest Sinking Fund Account should be below the amount required to
meet the then current year's debt service and a debt service reserve of $300,000
on the outstanding Series "A" and Series "B" Bonds, funds on deposit in the
Building Maintenance and Equipment Reserve Account shall be transferred to the
Bond and Interest Sinking Fund Account to the extent required to eliminate the
deficiency in that Account.
f) Subject to the foregoing, the Borrower may use the balance of excess funds
in the Project Revenue Fund Account at the close of each school term to redeem
outstanding Bonds, both Series "A" and "B" on the next interest payment date, in
inverse numerical order and in amounts of not less than $10,000 par value at one
time, or for any expenditures, including the payment of debt service, in improving
or restoring any existing housing and dining facilities or providing any such
additional facilities.
g) Section 8 of the Terms and Conditions constituting part of the Loan
Agreement concerning moneys remaining in the Construction Account after all costs
of the Project have been paid is revised to provide that half of any moneys
remaining in the Construction Account shall be used to retire Series "B" Bonds
and the other half shall be deposited into the Bond and Interest Sinking Fund
Account.

take up and pay for the Bonds. The requisition shall be supported by a signed
certificate of purposes in which must appear in reasonable detail the purposes for
which the proceeds of the Bonds covered by the requisition are to be used, and by
such additional data as the Administrator shall require in order to determine
whether it is obligated under the provisions of the applicable Loan Agreement to
honor such requisition. If the Government is so obligated, it will promptly take up

the Project. Moneys in the Construction Account shall be expended only for such
purposes as shall have been previously specified in a signed certificate of purposes
filed with and approved by the Administrator.

Any moneys remaining in the Construction Account after all costs of th(
Project have been paid shall be promptly used for the redemption of Bonds:
Provided, however, that any of such funds in an amount less than $1,000 shall b(
deposited in the Bond and Interest Sinking Fund Account.
SECTION 9. PAYMENT OF COSTS-ADDITIONAL FUNDS. The Borrower shal
pay all costs of the development of the Project, and furnish from sources othe'
than the Government, and from sources and in a manner which will not jeopardize
the security of the Bonds, the additional funds, if any, which will be sufficient t{

connection therewith: Provided, That if applicable State law requires a separate




226                 NOVEMBER MEETING, 1957
bond for the protection of laborers and materialmen, the Borrower will require
that each such contractor shall furnish a bond in the amount above stated for the

3. Proof of Carriage of Insurance. The contractor shall furnish the Borrower
(owner) with certificates showing the type, amounts, class of operations covered,
effective dates and dates of expiration of his insurance policies. Such certificates

and mechanics to be employed on the construction of the Project (which list shall
be based upon the wage rates prevailing for the same classes of laborers and
mechanics employed in construction activities, similar in character to the Project
in the area in which the Project is to be constructed). Upon obtaining the Administrator's approval of any such proposed minimum wage rates, or the rates
required by applicable State law, the Borrower will include such list in all
contracts calling for work on the Project and require adherence thereto. The

particular contract a reasonable amount, specified in the contract, sufficient to
insure the proper performance of the contract.

require of its contractors that (a) no materials manufactured or produced in a
penal or correctional institution be incorporated into the Project; and (b) that
only such unmanufactured articles, materials, or supplies as have been mined or
produced in the United States of America, and only such manufactured articles,
materials, or supplies as have been manufactured in the United States of America,
substantially all from articles, materials or supplies mined, produced, or manufactured, as the case may be, in the United States of America, shall be employed

cause his subcontractors to do likewise.
SECTION 28. RETENTION OF TITLE. SO long as the Government holds any
of the Bonds, the Borrower shall not dispose of its title to the Project or to any
facility the revenues of which are pledged as security for the Bonds, or to
any useful part thereof, including any facility necessary to the operation and use
thereof, and the lands and interests in lands comprising their sites, except as

against does not exceed 80 per centum (80%) of the full insurable value of the
damaged building.
Where a Trustee is to be or has been designated in connection with the bond
issue, each such insurance policy shall be acceptable to the Trustee and shall
contain a clause making all losses payable to the Trustee as its interest may
appear.
In the event of any damage to or destruction of any of said building or
buildings, the Borrower shall promptly arrange for the application of the insurance
proceeds for the repair or reconstruction of the damaged or destroyed portion

for more than one person involved in one accident, to protect the Borrower from
claims for bodily injury and/or death which may arise from the Borrower's
operations, including any use or occupancy of its grounds, structures and vehicles.
SECTION 33. USE AND OCCUPANCY INSURANCE. Immediately upon occupancy of any portion of the Project and so long thereafter as the funds and investments of the "Bond and Interest Sinking Fund Account" (which Account is to be
maintained by the provisions of the Loan Agreement) are less than the maximum
debt service reserve required by said provisions of the Loan Agreement, the
Borrower shall procure and maintain Use and Occupancy Insurance on each

amount sufficient to enable the Borrower to deposit in the Bond and Interest
Sinking Fund Account, out of the proceeds of such insurance, an amount equal to

the Project, there shall be included a sum to be specified in the Loan Agreement
as the agreed fixed fee for payment of the Government's expense of supervising
and inspecting the work appertaining to the development of the Project and of
auditing the books, records, and accounts pertaining to the Project. The Government will bill the Borrower after award of the construction contract for such
expense, and the Borrower will promptly make payment to the Government therefor, from the first funds received by it for construction of the Project, as part of
the consideration for the loan hereunder and as a cost incident to the financing
and development of the Project.
In the event of termination of this Agreement through the sale of all of the
Bonds to private purchasers, the Borrower shall be entitled to a refund of all or a
proportionate part of the above fixed fee, dependent on whether the Government
has rendered any service in inspecting the construction of the Project and in conducting audits of the Borrower's books, records, and accounts pertaining to the
Project prior to or within a reasonable time after said sale of the Bonds. The
refund shall be in such an amount as the Community Facilities Commissioner.

The Regents also adopted the Trust Agreement which appears as
Appendix A to the minutes of this meeting.
The following resolutions were adopted (R.P., 1954-57, p. 1346):
WHEREAS, Pursuant to authorization for preliminary planning granted by the
Regents (R.P. November, 1956, p. 1346) preliminary drawings and a model of a
structure to house 1,200 unmarried students, both men and women, on the North
Campus have been presented to the Regents and approved, and
WHEREAS, The Regents have determined that it is necessary and desirable to
proceed with final plans and construction of the said residence hall.
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved That the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance be authorized to retain Swanson Associates, Inc., as architect to prepare
working drawings and specifications for the said residence hall, and
Be It Further Resolved That the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance be authorized to proceed with plans for financing the said residence hall
and to make application, if necessary, to the Housing and Home Finance Agency,
College Housing Authority, for a loan to finance such construction.
On recommendation of the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance the Regents authorized the purchase of Lot 7 (1414 Washington
Heights), and agreed that negotiations be continued with the owners of
the properties adjoining to the east and west of Lot 7, so that additional
property may be acquired, provided the cost is reasonable, to provide
parking in the area. The Regents authorized the Vice-President in
charge of business and finance to acquire this additional property if at
all possible.
Under the terms of the will of Hon. Levi L. Barbour, former regent
of the University (R.P., 1932-36, p. 789), certain property on Woodward Avenue in Detroit came to the Regents. On January 1, 1952, a
fifty-year lease on this property, known as the Graystone Ballroom,
Inc., took effect. This lease had been originally made in 1925 (R.P.,
1923-26, p. 703), and in 1946 was purchased by and assigned to
Graystone Ballroom, Inc., with the consent of the University. Owing to
conditions involving the location of the property, the delinquencies in
the rent have now accumulated to $10,500, including the rent due
November 1, 1957.




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1957


231


On recommendation by the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance authority was given to start legal action to forfeit the
long-term lease between Graystone Ballroom, Inc., and the University,
and to collect the delinquent rent; and to retain the firm of Butzel.
Eaman, Long, Gust and Kennedy of Detroit for this purpose. Further.
authority was given to place the property in the hands of the Detroit
Bank and Trust Company for management and possible sale at the
usual fee or commission, with the understanding that any reasonable
offer'to purchase will be submitted to the Regents for consideration.
Regent Kennedy asked to be recorded as not voting.
On recommendation by the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance the Regents authorized acquisitions for the Museum of Art
to the extent of approximately $50,000 a year for the next three to five
years with funds provided from the current operating funds of the
University, and that the bequest of Dr. Walter R. Parker (R.P.,
1954-57, p. 427) be maintained in an investment status during these
years. This action was taken because of the following statement in the
bequest of Dr. Parker and because of discussions between Deans
Odegaard and Bennett and the Executive Committee of the Museum
of Art. The conclusions of this group were that the acquisition program
should precede a building program, and that the bequest of Dr. Parker
could act as a substantial base for additional gifts for a building:
The remaining one-half of such residual estate to the REGENTS OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN for the use and benefit of the Department of Fine
Arts of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, in acquiring additions to
the Margaret Watson Parker Art Collection, or to be added to a fund for the
erection of a suitable art gallery to house the Margaret Watson Parker Art
Collection and other art collections or for both purposes. It is my desire that said
art collection be housed at all times in appropriate and attractive surroundings.
The recommendation of the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance to engage the public accounting firm of Price Waterhouse
& Co. for the audit of University accounts and records for 1957-58
was approved (R.P., 1954-57, p. 1411).

Board of Regents
Gentlemen:
In compliance with an expressed wish of my husband, the late Dr. H. I. Lillie,
I give to the Regents of the University of Michigan the sum of $5,000.00 to be
called the Harold I. Lillie Scholarship Fund, the interest from which to be given
to some worthy medical student, in the junior or senior class, who is in need of
financial aid and who gives promise of successfully completing the medical course
leading to the M.D. degree. It is further requested that preference be given to
some such student who has demonstrated an interest in Otolaryngology and expects
to seek training in this field after his graduation from Medical School. If no such
qualified person is available, the annual income from the endowment fund should
be used at the discretion of the Scholarship Committee for some junior or senior
medical student who is worthy and in need of financial aid. The selection of the
candidate for the Harold I. Lillie Scholarship should be made by the Dean and the
Scholarship Committee of the Medical School. If, in future years, the need for
scholarships no longer exists, the income from the Fund may be used at the
discretion of the Board of Regents for a Harold I. Lillie Memorial Scholarship or
Research Project.
Very truly yours,
s/ Oda K. Lillie

Established in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the following
proposal of Roy G. Michell, Sr., and the Vice-President in charge of
business and finance was authorized to accept the proposal in behalf of
the Regents:




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1957


233


Roy G. Michell, Sr., Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eclipse Counterbore Company of Ferndale, Michigan, desires to establish a scholarship fund in
memory of his daughter, Marie Michell, who lost her life during World War II in
the course of duty as a member of the WASP (Women's Auxiliary Service Pilots).
To carry out his plan, he has submitted a formal proposal for acceptance by the
Regents.
The proposal contemplates the establishment of the fund to be known as "The
Marie Michell Memorial Scholarship Fund" and the immediate assignment to
The Regents of the University of Michigan, as sole owner, of Policy No. 2545348
issued by the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company on the life of Roy
G. Michell, Jr. (age 35) in the amount of $100,000. This is a 20-pay life policy,
and the donor proposes to make contributions to the fund annually in amounts
sufficient to pay the premiums on the policy and, upon his death, has made
arrangements to have the premiums continued by the National Bank of Detroit, as
trustee, under a living trust created by the donor.
The proposal further contemplates that the Regents shall make payments of
the premiums on the life insurance policy from moneys in the scholarship fund,
and in the event moneys in the scholarship fund are not sufficient to meet premiums due on the policy, then the University, as sole owner of the policy, shall
have the option to continue with the policy paying premiums from other funds, or
to place the policy on a paid-up basis requiring no further premium payments, or
to surrender the policy for its then cash value, or to exercise any of the other
rights, privileges, or options contained in the policy.
The proposal further provides that all proceeds which may be received from
the policy shall be used for scholarships preferably to be offered first to children
or grandchildren of members of WASP (Women's Auxiliary Service Pilots) and
next for scholarships to be given to applicants to the School of Nursing. Ten years
after the death of Roy G. Michell, Jr., the Regents may, in their discretion, use
any balance of benefits or proceeds received from the policy for the School of
Nursing of the University of Michigan.
The following memoir, adopted by the faculty of the Medical              w. L. Whitaker:
School, was filed for inclusion in these minutes:                           Memoir
MEMORIAL: WAYNE LEWIS WHITAKER
August 9, 1904-September 29, 1957
For twenty years Wayne Whitaker served our Medical School well, and we,
his colleagues, recognize his contributions as important. Whitaker was energetic;
he liked problems and he gave them time and thought if he felt that we could
help; he liked to get things done and by better ways; he was a true rationalist,
and the experimental approach to problems-"Well, let's try it"-was a part of
his nature.
His first research as a graduate student in the Department of Zoology of the
University (M.S. '34; Ph.D. '39) made him known to certain members of the
Anatomy Department. At that time he was investigating a problem in reproductive
physiology, a research field with which anatomists were much concerned in the
1930's. His own studies related to the effect of different periods of light and of
darkness on the sexual cycles of field mice. In an attempt to find human correlations, he corresponded with explorers and combed the records for data on Eskimos.
After joining the Anatomy staff as instructor in 1937, Doctor Whitaker turned
his attention to hair growth and to the study of the possible local action of sex
hormones upon the hair and skin. This led in time to a collaborative study (with
B. L. Baker) on the localized action of adrenocortical steroids on the skin; this
investigation was probably his master work. When it was found that the hormones
acted locally without systemic effects, the way was paved for their practical use in
dermatology and ophthalmology.
After a brief period of teaching medical courses, Doctor Whitaker took charge
of the anatomy course for nurses and he continued in this for four years. He
instituted the most thorough-going revision that the course had had to that time
and developed the present laboratory approach whereby organ systems are demonstrated system-by-system. During the following years he taught medical students;
when Professor R. E. McCotter retired, Doctor Whitaker assumed the administrative responsibility for the topographic anatomy course. Over a period of several
years he completely modernized this course by introducing, in addition to cadaver
sections, both surface anatomy of the living and the X-ray approach.
Doctor Whitaker's contributions to his department were solid and they were
recognized by a normal rate of promotion; he became Assistant Professor in 1943,
Associate Professor in 1949, and Professor in 1956.
Doctor Whitaker was, of course, interested in teaching anatomy to the medical




234


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1957


students, but more than this he was always interested in the students themselves,
in their personal problems, and in their attempts to solve them. There are few
men on the faculty who have been more appreciated by medical students for the
advice and help they received.
A third major activity-administration-began in 1947 when Doctor Whitaker
became Secretary of the Medical School. In 1953 he became the first Assistant
Dean of the Medical School. The whole faculty came to know and respect him for
his clear-headed handling of the problems involved. He became especially interested
in the development of techniques for screening applicants to Medical School. He
felt that potentially good candidates were lost by the screening tests used while,
at the same time, the tests permitted too many people of low calibre to qualify.
Doctor Whitaker's suggestions were an important contribution to the field of
personnel selection; his work on the Conference on Admissions of the Association
of American Medical Colleges was directed also to the goal of better selection.
Wayne Whitaker's attitude during his last year would seem to approach the
heroic, but it was only his way of facing the facts. He came to regard his condition
as a challenge and as an opportunity to learn more about cancer. He not only
read the recent experimental literature on cancer but made himself available as an
experimental subject for cancer research.
Wayne Whitaker will be known in many ways to many people. He will be
thought of as teacher, as administrator, and as research man. He will be remembered as a sincere counselor to students. Wayne was an active member of the
technical societies to which he belonged; among local societies he will be remembered as one-time president of Phi Sigma, as secretary of Sigma Xi, and as president of the Science Research Club. Some knew him as a co-operative colleague, as
a dedicated member of his church, or as a family man and host in his own home.
His interest in reviving square dancing in Ann Arbor will be remembered by others,
as will his skill as a wood shop hobbyist and boat-builder. Some people will recall
his satisfaction in building his summer island home in Georgian Bay. To a good
many he will be missed as a warm friend.
Carnegie Corpt fora-  The Regents accepted with an expression of grateful appreciation a
Study of Higher  grant of approximately $400,000 from        the Carnegie Corporation to
Education  support a program    in the study of higher education which has been
directed by Professor Algo D. Henderson of the School of Education
since 1950. It is understood that this amount will be paid over a fiveyear period to be used for training in higher education, especially to
instruct those who intend to become administrators in colleges and
universities and to stimulate basic research in the problems of higher
education.
Financial Report    The annual financial report of the University for the year ended
for 1956-7 Filed  June 30, 1957, which contains the audit certificate of Price Waterhouse
& Co., was accepted and placed on file and adopted by the Regents as
the report of the Board to the Governor of the State (R.P., 1954-57,
p. 1347).
Constitution of    The following was adopted by the Regents as the Constitution of
Association of  the Association of Governing Boards and Presidents of State UniversiGoverning Boards

University's Disability Plan (p. 116).

interest hereon or the negotiability of the coupons hereto attached,
which shall at all times pass by delivery and be payable to bearer.

Thousand Dollars ($5,000) at the price of 101%  of the principal
amount of such prepayment plus accrued interest to the date of prepayment.

thereof in multiples of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) but in amounts
of not less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) as the Obligor may
determine, at the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the
date of such prepayment.
Notice of any such optional prepayment shall be given at least
thirty (30) days prior to the prepayment date by mailing to the registered owner of this Bond a notice fixing such prepayment date, the
amount of principal and the premium, if any, to be prepaid.
This Bond may be assigned and upon such assignment the assignor
shall promptly notify the Obligor at the office of the Trustee by registered mail, and the Trustee shall have the right to require legal evidence
of assignment and submission of the Bond for verification of the
Payment Record, or, at the option of the Obligor, exchange for a new
Bond in the amount of the unpaid principal installments of this Bond.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or
interest on this Bond against any officer, Regent, or member of the
Obligor, as such, all such liability (if any) being hereby expressly
waived and released by every registered holder or transferee hereof by
the acceptance hereof, and as a part of the consideration hereof, as
provided in the Indenture.
It is hereby certified that all of the conditions, acts and things
required to exist, to have happened or to have been performed precedent to and in the issuance of this Bond do exist, have happened or

on said books at such office, in the City of Detroit, and such registration
noted on the Bond. After such registration, no transfer shall be valid
unless made on said books at the request of the registered owner or
by his duly authorized attorney and noted by the Trustee on the Bond;
but the Bond may be discharged from registration by being in like
manner transferred to bearer, and thereupon transferability by delivery
shall be restored; and such coupon Bond may again, from time to time,
be registered or transferred to bearer as before. Such registration, however, shall not affect the negotiability of the coupons, but every such
coupon shall continue to be transferable by delivery and shall remain
payable to bearer.
SECTION 6. BONDS VALID WHEN AUTHENTICATED. All Bonds
issued and authenticated hereunder shall stand upon equality without
regard to date of issue, authentication, delivery, or negotiability, but

the Trustee shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or entitled to
any benefits hereunder; and such authentication certificate shall be
conclusive and the only evidence that the Bond so authenticated has
been duly issued hereunder and entitled to the benefits of the trust
hereby created. No holder of any Bond authenticated by the Trustee
shall be under any duty to ascertain whether the same shall have been
duly issued, authenticated, and delivered according to the provisions
hereof.
SECTION 7. MUTILATED BONDS. In case any Bond and the coupons
belonging thereto shall be mutilated, lost, stolen, or destroyed, then,
upon production of such mutilated Bond or evidence satisfactory to the
Obligor and the Trustee of the loss, theft, or destruction of such Bond
and the coupons thereon, and receipt of indemnity satisfactory to the
Obligor and Trustee, the Obligor, in its discretion, may execute, and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver substitute Bonds in exchange
for and upon cancellation of the ones which have been mutilated or in
lieu of the ones which have been lost, stolen, or destroyed. The Trustee
and Obligor may require payment by the owner of such Bonds of a
sum sufficient to reimburse them for any expense incurred in the
preparation, authentication, and issuance of such substitute Bonds.

remaining outstanding hereinunder; said new Bonds to be secured
equally and ratably with the then outstanding Bonds and to be subject
to the same terms and conditions as the then outstanding Bonds in all

single Bond of the intention to make payments on principal installments
prior to due dates.
SECTION 5. BONDS CEASE TO BEAR INTEREST ON DATE FIXED FOR
REDEMPTION. All Bonds called for redemption shall cease to bear
interest on the date fixed for redemption if the Obligor shall have
deposited with the Trustee sufficient funds for the payment thereof,
and the interest coupons thereto attached maturing thereafter shall be
null and void. Any coupon Bond so called for redemption, when presented, shall have attached thereto all unmatured coupons, but the
Trustee may, in its discretion, accept in lieu of any such coupons
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee and the Obligor against liability
or loss on account of any unmatured coupons not presented therewith.

the Obligor shall promptly arrange for the application of the insurance
proceeds for the repair or reconstruction of the damaged or destroyed

to the sum that would normally have been available for deposit in such
account from the revenues of the damaged building during the time the
damaged building is non-revenue producing as a result of loss of use
caused by the perils covered by Fire and Extended Coverage Insurance.
All insurance shall be carried in companies approved by the Trustee.

the Project in and under a Blanket Policy covering the Project and
other properties of the Obligor, and all policies of insurance or certificates evidencing the carrying of insurance on the Project herein designated, with loss payable clause attached payable to the Trustee as its

Trustee and the Obligor. Provided, however, if in the judgment of the
Trustee, the funds received from said insurance policies or otherwise
shall be insufficient to make the building suffering such loss usable or
tenantable, then, in that event, the Obligor shall forthwith retire all of
the outstanding Bonds, and the Trustee may hold the funds paid to it
by reason of such loss for the ratable benefit of the holders of all outstanding Bonds and the retirement thereof. In such event, all of the
Bonds shall be subject to redemption and without premium therefor.
SECTION 9. AUDITS AND ACCOUNTS. The Obligor will, on or before ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year, commencing

issued hereunder.
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant, stipulation or
agreement contained in this Trust Agreement or in any Bond or coupon

authorized shall be had against the State of Michigan, the Obligor, or
any member or officer of the Obligor, individually; it being expressly
understood and agreed that the Bonds issued hereunder are secured by

returned to the Obligor it will manage the same in such manner that
it will be able to meet the obligations herein imposed, then, and in
every such case, the Trustee shall restore the Obligor to its former
position in relation to the Project, and the rights of the Obligor, the

to prepay corresponding principal installments of a single Bond upon
the following terms and conditions:
The Obligor reserves the right to redeem the Bonds, with excess funds

The President reported the death of James M. Cork, Ph.D., Profes- J. M. Cork:
sor of Physics, on November 27, 1957. The following memoir was                 Memoir
adopted:
The Regents of the University of Michigan join with the University community in mourning the death of Professor James M. Cork on November 27, 1957,
at age sixty-three. Professor Cork was born at Yale, Michigan, and was graduated
from its public high school in 1911. He earned the B.S. degree from the University
of Michigan in 1916, the M.S. in 1917, and the Ph.D. in 1922. In 1918 he was
with the United States Signal Corps as First Lieutenant; in 1919 he was Assistant
Physicist at the Bureau of Standards in Washington. The following year he was
Assistant Professor of Physics at the Pennsylvania State College. He became
Instructor in the Department of Physics at the University of Michigan in 1920,
and Professor of Physics in 1937. From 1926 to 1927 Dr. Cork was an exchange
professor at Victoria University, Manchester, England. During a sabbatical leave
in 1930-31, he was a research associate in the Duc de Broglie Laboratory in Paris,
where he worked in the field of X rays. He was at the University of California in
a similar capacity in 1935-36. From 1942 to 1946 he was Section Member and
Research Supervisor of the National Defense Research Committee. Professor
Cork's early interest in nuclear physics and radioactivity, and his constant researches in these fields, developed for him a wide reputation. He was a consultant
to the Argonne National Laboratory and to the Atomic Energy Commission. He
was Assistant Editor of the Handbook of Physics for the American Institute of
Physics and wrote books in three different fields of his subject, Pyrometry, in 1927,

DECEMBER MEETING, 1957


Heat, in 1933, and Radioactivity and Nuclear Physics, in 1946. His versatile
mind is reflected not only in his voluminous contributions to publications but also
in the apparatus, widely copied, which he designed. For many years Professor
Cork was responsible for one of the introductory courses in physics that enrolled
a large number of students. His ability to present his subject as a serious discipline,
and in a most attractive fashion as well, gave him a wide following among
students. He was adviser to students in engineering physics and directed many
doctoral candidates. He was widely honored by his colleagues and received the
acclaim of the scientific world. His services on the Executive Committee of the
Physics Department, on the Executive Board of the Graduate School, and on the
Senate Advisory Committee reflect his interest in his community and the confidence
and high esteem he enjoyed throughout the University.
The Regents express to the members of Professor Cork's family deepest
sympathy and share with his many friends their great loss.
Leaves of     The following leaves of absence, an extension of leave of absence,
and a change in a previously granted leave of absence were approved
(p. 218):

Engineering
College:
Appropriation for,
to Rehabilitate
Libraries of
North Campus
Utilities:
Appropriation for


On recommendation by the Committee on Budget Administration,
the Regents approved an appropriation of $38,000 for rehabilitation of
library space in the East Engineering Library, the Transportation
Library, and the West Engineering Library, to provide offices and classrooms, a student room, and a faculty seminar room. The books
previously stored in these libraries have been transferred to the Undergraduate Library, and the rehabilitation will provide approximately
8,000 square feet for instructional purposes.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance reported on
the progress made to date with respect to the utilities which will be
necessary for the construction in the North Campus area (R.P.,
1954-57, p. 1311). For the first phase of the system, which provides for
the development of the water supply, the total cost is $630,000, of
which the University's share is $283,500, the work to be completed by
the end of 1958. The sanitary sewer service, it is estimated, will cost
about $328,777, of which the University's share is $147,292, the construction of which project will be completed in the late summer of
1958. The Regents have already appropriated $150,000 from the revenues of 1956-57 for the first part of this program (p. 25). The Regents
* It is understood that he will pay both his share and the University's share of the
premiums due on his annuity policy during the term of this leave.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1957


285


at this meeting approved an appropriation of $150,000 as an addition
to the total cost of the University's share of this program, with the
understanding that a third contribution of $150,000 will be appropriated
during the fall of 1958.
The Dean of State-wide Education and the Vice-President in charge      Rouge River
Relocation:
of business and finance presented two proposals submitted by the Board    Action Deferred
of Road Commissioners of Wayne County, the first, to provide for the
relocation of part of the Rouge River some 1,200 feet in length, opposite the Fair Lane estate, at which point the river forms the common
boundary line between land owned by the University and land owned
by Wayne County. The Board of County Road Commissioners, it is
understood, will assume the obligation for filling the present channel
and providing a finished grade that will blend into the contour of the
existing ground on both sides of the river.
The second proposal concerns the authority to drain and fill the
pond on the University-owned land located immediately north of the
Fair Lane estate, with the understanding that the Board of County
Road Commissioners will assume the obligation for contour grading in
the filling of the pond.
After considerable discussion, the Regents requested the Dean of
State-wide Education and the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance to negotiate for the acquisition of somewhat more property in
the area along the river to protect the University's interest against any
outside encroachment, with the request that having explored this possibility, recommendations will be brought to the Regents in the future
for more definite action (R.P., 1954-57, p. 1457).
On recommendation by the Dean of State-wide Education, the            National Music
agreement between the University and the National Music Camp was          with, Renewed
changed to provide that the University will pay to the National Music
Camp a total of $5,000 a year instead of $3,000 a year for the use of
classrooms and other physical facilities used by the University of Michigan Division. This agreement, it is understood, is to cover a five-year
period beginning October 1, 1957, and reads in full as follows (R.P.,
1954-57, p. 269):
AGREEMENT BETWEEN UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AND NATIONAL MUSIC CAMP
WHEREAS, An agreement between the University of Michigan and the National
Music Camp, was made in October, 1941, and revised and renewed from time to
time, including a renewal of December 17, 1954; and
WHEREAS, The agreement has been generally satisfactory to the University
and the National Music Camp;
Be It Resolved, That the agreement, as here revised, be renewed for a period
of five years;
That the Summer Session be authorized to offer at the National Music Camp
a limited number of University courses and such other educational activities as are

The Regents received for consideration and discussion a recommendation from Mr. Joseph C. Hooper, President of the Alumni Association, requesting that the Regents consider the construction of a new
building to house all alumni activities, including the Alumni Association,
the Development Council, and the Alumni Catalog Office. It is estimated that the total building area would comprise approximately 25,000
square feet. This proposal was referred to the Vice-President in charge
of business and finance and such members of a committee as he may
wish to appoint, for further study and more definite recommendations,
particularly with the anticipation that this committee may present plans
not only for a building to house the activities mentioned but to recommend to the Regents a complete procedural program of all alumni
activities, as indicated in the following resolution adopted by the
Regents:
WHEREAS, The Alumni Association of the University of Michigan is now in its
sixty-first year, and
WHEREAS, The Alumni Association has occupied its present quarters for the
past forty-seven years in Alumni Memorial Hall, the gift of the Alumni Association to the University, and
WHEREAS, The steady progress and growth of the Association have placed it
among the foremost of such organizations in the academic world, and
WHEREAS, The Development Council of the University of Michigan was
founded in 1952, and, with it, the Michigan Alumni Fund, and
WHEREAS, With the creation of the two last-named bodies, the entire concept
of the University's alumni activity is being reassessed and redefined, and
WHEREAS, With these added new activities, the Alumni Association has
markedly expanded its staff,
Now Therefore Be It Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan request the executive officers of the University to review the new concept
of the University's alumni organization and its activities; that they explore the
basic strengths of the organization and test the potentialities of its further growth
and expansion; and that these findings include recommendations concerning the
immediate and future development of the Alumni Association of the University and
specify plans to house all such activities.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized
to investigate a proposal by a friend of Mrs. Marion LeRoy Burton
that the payments now being made to Mrs. Burton from the Marion
Leroy Burton Memorial Endowment fund (R.P., 1923-26, p. 605) be
continued to her daughter Jane during her lifetime, following the death
of Mrs. Burton.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1957

The President presented a proposal to establish at the University of
Michigan an Institute of Science and Technology, devoted specifically
to these major goals: (1) It would serve as a center for scientific and
technological instruction, research, and service at the collegiate and
postgraduate level. It would be staffed by University of Michigan
faculty members and outstanding new men who could be attracted to
the Institute. (2) It would set up and administer a system of scholarship grants for graduate and undergraduate students who desire to
devote themselves to teaching or to research in the fields of technology
and science. This would be based upon a most thorough and careful
talent search of the entire state of Michigan. (3) It would carry on
research in methods of increasing the effectiveness and extent of scientific education at all levels. (4) It would co-operate with other educational institutions in the state, both public and private, in the encouragement of scientific and technological research and instruction. Staff
members and nationally known scientists would be given time from
teaching duties to work with high schools, other colleges and universities, and even elementary schools, in an effort to stimulate and encourage interest in careers in science. (5) It would seek to extend the
co-operation of business and industry in furthering the purposes of the
Institute, especially as they relate to future industrial and business
development in the state.
The Regents approved this proposal in principle and recommended
that the program be studied to provide further information as to the
probable costs involved, and recognition of the following conditions
submitted by Regent Bonisteel:
"We in no way expect to lessen our progress and efforts in other educational
fields such as the humanities.
"We are here today adopting a program to meet an immediate educational
need in scientific fields of knowledge-in the interests of our national security and
with the hope that we may ultimately through it achieve peace."

The President called attention to the fact that this meeting marked
the termination of the service as regents of Mrs. Baits and Mr. Connable, and of Mr. Adams, who has recently been appointed Attorney
General of the State of Michigan by Governor Williams. Regent
Connable has served for sixteen years, having been elected first in 1941.
Mrs. Baits was first appointed to the Board by Governor Harry F.
Kelly in 1943, and Mr. Adams began his service on January 1, 1956.
Regent Connable made the following comments, which are included
in these minutes:
It is never easy to say goodbye to old friends. Or to terminate the labor of
love of 16 years to one's alma mater.
From Pearl Harbor to Sputnik my term of office has been a thrilling experience
for which I shall always be grateful. I was a freshman regent when President
Ruthven and our Board successfully converted the University to the defense of our
country. As I leave the 1957 Board our learned scientists, mobilized by the timely
call of President Hatcher, are giving us glimpses of the universe.
The speed and initiative with which President Hatcher and the Regents have
acted to probe the educational implications of this epochal break-through, augur
well for' the future leadership of our University. To our new Regents, Mrs. Irene
Murphy and my successor, Mr. Carl Brablec, go my hearty good wishes as you
become a policy-making part of this future leadership. I am confident that by you
both the University will be served well.
As a Regent and as a past President of the Association of Governing Boards
of State Universities and Allied Institutions I have visited many university
campuses and met educational administrators from most parts of the country

A. B. Connable:
Remarks by




290                DECEMBER MEETING, 1957
I have also visited a number of universities abroad. At the risk of complacency,
I feel that Michigan's top staff of administrators developed by President Hatcher,
in ability, imagination, character, and understanding, has few peers.
Representatives of the press were not in our board room sixteen years ago.
Your presence today reflects a healthy development. It has also been a personal
pleasure to see you join us and to become acquainted with you.
It takes time to realize, and I am still learning, what makes a university really
great, the students, the faculty, the administration, the governing board, the
environmental traditions? I have learned that true distinction can stem from one
or all of these components of university life.
But the solid base that permits such distinction at Michigan is the constitutional corporation; its mandate that gives complete responsibility for the affairs of
the University to the Board of Regents, and the protection it has afforded the
University, over the years, from political interference.
As a result, Michigan has gradually evolved those intangible values essential
to true educational greatness: a liberal tradition of faculty and student expression,
a stimulating environment for scholarly exploration, and a responsiveness to the
needs of all the people.
As I see them, those are the all-important values to be preserved and
nourished in the years ahead.
Thank you all, President Hatcher, my fellow Regents and administration
officials around this table, for your warm friendship. I shall think of you often as
you carry on your service of dedication.
P. L. Adams:     Mrs. Baits was not present at the meeting.
Remarks by     Mr. Adams expressed his regret on terminating the association
which he has had with the Board and its members during the past
two years.
E. B. Power:     The following resolution was adopted by the Board as presented by
Resolution by  Regent Power:
Resolved, That it is with great regret that today marks the final meeting with
three of our members. The contribution made to the welfare and progress of the
University by Alfred Connable, Vera Baits, and Paul Adams is known to us all.
Their places will be difficult to fill. We wish them Godspeed and success in their
future activities which we know will be for the benefit of their fellow men.
Regent Adams' travel expense vouchers for attendance at the
meeting of November 22 in the amount of $66.76 were approved.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
otherwise expressly stated.
The Board adjourned to meet on January 10.

REGENTS' CITATION OF HONOR
Prepared by Erich A. Walter
Conferred December 6, 1957                  Voted October 18, 1957 (p. 179)
Rudolph E. Reichert, President of the Ann Arbor Bank, Chairman of the
Board of the City Bank of Detroit. When he was seventeen he became a messenger
for the Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank of Ann Arbor. After a brief association
with the American Savings Bank of Lansing, he returned to Ann Arbor, where he
successively was teller, assistant cashier, and director of the German-American
Savings Bank, remaining on its staff after it was consolidated with the State Savings Bank. In January, 1927, Governor Fred W. Green appointed him Banking
Commissioner of the State of Michigan, a position he held through the administrations of Governors Green, Brucker, Comstock, and Fitzgerald. In 1936 he resigned
his commission to accept the presidency of the Ann Arbor Savings and Commercial
Bank, formerly the Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank and now the Ann Arbor Bank.
In 1933 he wrote the reorganization banking law which was adopted by the state
of Michigan and several other states, and collaborated in writing the congressional
act that established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the following
year he was elected President of the National Association of Supervisors of State
Banks. He was named Director of the Detroit Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago in 1943 and served in that capacity for six years. In 1944 he was
elected President of the Michigan Bankers' Association. He served as a member of
the Advisory Board of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for much of the
period of its existence. He was Chairman of the War Loan Committee for the
Second Congressional District from 1941 until 1946, and State Chairman of the
Treasury Savings Bonds Association of the American Bankers' Association from
1946 until 1953. His astute judgment was recognized in his appointment in 1951
to the chairmanship of the Committee on Federal Legislation of the American
Bankers' Association. His membership on the Research Council of the Association
further attests to the high standing he has won in the banking fraternity. From
1917 to 1922 he served Ann Arbor as President of the City Council, and from
1948 to 1956 as Chairman of the Police Commission.
Rudolph E. Reichert, on behalf of the Regents of the University of Michigan,
I take great pleasure in presenting to you, honored, respected, and acclaimed in
your city and throughout your state, the Regents' Citation of Honor as a mark
of the high esteem which the University and the University community have for
you as an outstanding citizen.

McCotter, M.D., '10m, former Professor of Anatomy (R.P., 1945-48,
p. 1349), has been offered for probate in Van Buren County, Michigan.
The pertinent provision of the will is as follows:
"All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate and effects, whatsoever and
wheresoever, both real and personal, to which I may be entitled, or which I may
have power to dispose of at my decease, I hereby give, devise, and bequeath to
The Regents of the University of Michigan, IN TRUST NEVERTHELESS, for
the following purposes:
a) During the lifetime of my wife, Claire S. McCotter, and that of my son,
George R. McCotter, the net income from said trust fund shall be divided equally
between my wife and my son, share and share alike, so long as my said wife shall
live, but only so long as she shall remain unmarried. In the event she shall predecease me, or remarry, then the entire income from the said trust shall be paid to
my said son, George R. McCotter, during his lifetime. It is also my express wish
that my wife's share of the said income from the said trust shall be at least One
Hundred ($100.00) Dollars per month, and the Regents are hereby authorized
and directed to make such adjustment of income in the division thereof so that my
said wife shall receive a minimum of $100.00 per month, regardless of the equality
of division as herein set forth.
The income reserved to the respective beneficiaries of any trust created by
this will shall not be subject to anticipation or to pledge, assignment, sale, or
transfer in any manner, nor shall any beneficiary have power in any manner to
charge or encumber such interest, nor shall such interest be liable or subject in
any manner while in the possession of the trustee for the liabilities of any beneficiary, whether such liabilities arise from his debts, contracts, torts, or other
engagements of any type.
b) I hereby further direct the Regents to use not to exceed the sum of Five
Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars for my granddaughter, Janet McCotter of the City
of Ann Arbor, Michigan, for a college or university education of her choice,
maintaining standards generally accepted by the better colleges and universities
of the nation. If the said sum is not used for educational purposes by my said
granddaughter before she shall attain the age of 27 years, or in the event of her
death before reaching that age, then said sum shall remain in the trust herein
established as a part of the corpus thereof, and upon the death of my son, George
R. McCotter and my wife, Claire S. McCotter, the entire trust fund shall become
the sole property of the Regents of the University of Michigan, to become a part
of the endowment funds of the University.
"I hereby grant full discretionary powers to the said Regents in the use of said
endowment. It is my wish, if possible, that the income therefrom be used for a
scholarship or loan fund for the use of students in the Medical School of the
University of Michigan, and to be known as the 'Rollo E. and Erma H. McCotter
Fund'."

finance, the Regents authorized the following grant applications under      Grant Applications
the provisions of Public Law 835:
CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL-PEDIATRICS UNIT, $1,000,000 for matching             Children's
funds in the research portion of the construction costs. The Public         HospitalHealth Service allocation would be for the fiscal year 1958-59, thus
making the total cost, including the research facilities specified in this
grant application, $8,308,000.
MEDICAL SCIENCE BUILDING, UNIT II, $576,290 for matching funds           Medical Science
for the additional research facilities which should be provided. This Building, Unit II




306


JANUARY MEETING, 1958


grant would be for the fiscal year 1958-59. The University capital outlay request for an appropriation from the state for 1958-59 includes an
item of $368,000 for complete plans for this Medical Science Building
with an estimated total project cost of $9,200,000.
Biochemistry     For the DEPARTMENT        OF BIOCHEMISTRY, $36,825 for matching
Departmen   funds for research equipment. When the move is made to the new
facilities in Unit I of the Medical Science Building the Department is
preparing for a significant development in the nature and scope of both
teaching and research activities, essential to which is the acquisition of
proper equipment.
Biological Station:  At the request of the supervisors of Munro Township, Cheboygan
Right of Way
Through Granted  County, in behalf of the Board of County Road Commissioners of that
county, and with the approval of Dr. A. H. Stockard, Director of the
Biological Station, the Regents approved a right of way 66 feet wide
across the Northwest Quarter of the Northeast Quarter of Section 18,
Town 37 North, Range 3 West, Munro Township, Cheboygan County.
The reasons for the need for this right of way are as follows:
"1. A road in the locality will give the University access by automobile to a
parcel of 125.32 acres which presently can be reached only by boat and entered
on foot. Access by automobile is important for protection from fire, other
management activities, and for biological study.
"2. A road around this part of Douglas Lake will give direct connection between Cheboygan and the thin but populous strip of the county along the western
end of the lake, an advantage to the public which the University can promote
while also serving its own best interest."
W. W. Cook:      Mr. Clair B. Hughes and the City Bank Farmers Trust Company,
Will of, Accounting
Approved  trustees under the Tenth Clause of the will of William            W. Cook,
deceased, have submitted their annual accounting for the year ended
June 30, 1957 (R.P., 1954-57, p. 1369). The account has been examined
by an auditor of the internal audit staff of the Business Office and
appears to be correct as stated. In accordance with the request of the
trustees, the following resolution was adopted:
WHEREAS, City Bank Farmers Trust Company and Clair B. Hughes, as
trustees, have presented an account dated June 28, 1957, of their proceedings as
trustees of the trust created under Clause "TENTH" of the last will and testament of William W. Cook, deceased, for the benefit of the Law School of the
University of Michigan; and
WHEREAS, In order to save the expense of a judicial settlement of said
account, it is desirable to settle the said account out of court; and
WHEREAS, City Bank Farmers Trust Company and Clair B. Hughes, as
trustees, are willing to have their account settled out of court upon the terms and
conditions set forth in a certain instrument annexed to the said account whereby
the Regents of the University of Michigan accept the said account as an account
stated, final and conclusive and release and discharge the said trustees, all as more
fully set forth in the said instrument; and
WHEREAS, Said account has been duly examined by this Board and has been
found to be correct and true; be it therefore
Resolved, That said account of City Bank Farmers Trust Company and of
Clair B. Hughes, as trustees, covering the period from June 30, 1956, to and
including June 28, 1957, be and is hereby approved in all respects; and be it
further
Resolved, That this corporation does hereby accept the said account as an
account stated, final and conclusive and does hereby authorize and direct W. K.
Pierpont, Vice-President of this corporation, and Herbert G. Watkins, Secretary
of this corporation, to execute for and in the name of this corporation and under
its corporate seal an instrument substantially in the form annexed to the said
account releasing and discharging the said trustees as in said instrument more
fully set forth.

The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized
to advise the Detroit Bank and Trust Company that the University will
sell the Graystone Ballroom property at a price of approximately
$185,000, with the understanding that any offer reasonably close to this
figure will be presented to the Board for consideration and final action
(p. 230).
The Board authorized the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance to purchase Lots No. 48 and 49, Fairview Cemetery, for the
burial of anatomical material.
The Regents established the James O. Murfin Student Loan Fund
with the understanding that the amount available, $40,000, be invested
in the Consolidated Endowment Fund of the University and that the
income therefrom be used for student loans in accordance with the
following provisions of the testator's will:
"At her death I bequeath the same to the Regents of the University of MIichigan, the income from which is to be used by them as a loan fund for needy and
deserving male students. It is my wish that the Regents of the University of
Michigan use the income of this fund to be loaned, under their supervision,
direction and regulation, to such deserving male students who otherwise would not
be able to acquire an education. I, naturally, do not wish this income devoted
entirely to boys of athletic ability, nor do I wish any boy because he has athletic
ability to be denied the facilities of this fund. It is difficult to express in concrete
language my views as to how I would like to have this handled. I am willing to
leave it to such rules and regulations as the Board of Regents of the University
of Michigan may from time to time prescribe. I hope, however, that the administrators of this fund will always bear in mind my frequently expressed views as to
the difference between a boy who goes to college and the boy who is sent to
college; the one I want to help, for the other I have very little use."
On recommendation of the donor, Mrs. James B. Edmonson, and
Dean Willard C. Olson, the Regents changed the status of the James
B. Edmonson Award Fund of $1,000 from an expendable to an endowment fund, with the understanding that an award be made from the
income from this fund when approved by the Dean and Executive
Committee of the School of Education (R.P., 1954-57, p. 1418).
After considerable discussion with respect to the administrative
organization of the Dearborn Center, the following bylaw was adopted:

Division shall provide the necessary courses of instruction, prepare suitable
requirements for admission, proper curriculums, and appropriate requirements for
graduation, which shall become effective upon approval by the Board of Regents.
The governing faculties shall recommend to the Board candidates for degrees, and
shall exercise such other powers as are ordinarily exercised by school or college
governing faculties.
Sec. 33.04. Standing Committees. A standing committee shall be created for
each Division established in the Dearborn Center. Until such time as may be
determined, the standing committee shall represent the faculty of the Division.

to be appointed by the Board of Regents on recommendation of the President. The
appointed members shall hold office for three years. The terms shall be so adjusted
that one shall expire each year. The Dean of the Dearborn Center shall be Chairman of the Executive Committee.
The Executive Committee is charged with the duty of investigating and
formulating educational, research, and instructional policies for consideration by
the faculties of the several Divisions, and it shall act for the Center in matters
related to the budget, promotions, appointments, plant extensions, and all other
financial affairs.
The Dean shall perform such functions and assume such responsibilities for
the administration of business and financial affairs, student activities, etc., as may

authorized to offer graduate instruction leading to the master's degree, but no
such program of graduate studies may be authorized except in compliance with the
rules and regulations covering similar offerings on the Ann Arbor campus. Unless
specifically excepted, such offerings shall be under the general jurisdiction of the
Dean and the Executive Board of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies.
Board of Governors   The Regents amended       Section 30.03 of the Bylaws to read as
of Residence Halls:  follows:
Bylaw in re:
Amended      There shall be a Board of Governors, consisting of the Vice-President for
Student Affairs as Chairman, the Dean of Men, the Dean of Women, the Manager

nineteen years ago for display purposes, was presented by the Board to
the Smithsonian Institution of the United States National Museum in
Washington, D.C., to be used as a museum piece (R.P., 1939-42,
p. 293), with the understanding that the National Museum will absorb
all costs involved in packing and shipping the engine to Washington.
Dean Attwood was requested to advise the National Museum that the
Regents would appreciate it if the engine could be designated as a gift
from the University of Michigan.
On December 16, 1949 (R.P., 1948-51, p. 614), the Regents ap-      Liberal Artsan
proved a recommendation by the faculties of the Law School and the     Program
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts to provide an opportunity  Terminated
for the study of law integrated with its background of political science,
economics, and other related disciplines, under the terms and conditions
set forth in that recommendation. The experience with this program
has been reviewed during the past year by the faculties of the schools
involved, and it has been found that the program has not proved
attractive to students. The Regents therefore approved the recommendations that the present Integrated Program in Liberal Arts and Law
should be terminated as of the end of the second semester of the
University year 1957-58 with the understanding that the students
currently enrolled in the program will be permitted to continue to the
completion of the program and that any juniors that apply for the
program in the spring of 1958 shall be permitted to enter and continue
in the program to its completion if they meet the specified qualifications.
The Regents accepted with grateful appreciation the following      JennetnSolar
proposal made by Mr. Chesser M. Campbell, '21a, President of the       ship in Journali!
Tribune Company, Chicago, to establish a memorial to be known as the   Established
James O'Donnell Bennett Scholarship in Journalism, to be administered
under the following terms and conditions. Mr. Campbell is Trustee of
the James O'Donnell Bennett Trust.
1. That the funds be used for grants or loans to deserving undergraduate or
graduate students in journalism who possess superior or above-average ability in
scholarship and leadership. In-so-far as possible awards should be made to students
who intend to enter the newpaper profession.
2. That the Chairman of the Department of Journalism, after consultation
with others of the faculty, determine the recipients of the annual awards, and the
amounts and conditions under which they are made. That at least once a year the
Chairman of the Department of Journalism make a report to the Trustee of the
James O'Donnell Bennett Trust as to award winners and individual expenditures
from the fund.
3. That no more than $1,500 in total be awarded in any single calendar year
except when the annual contributions to the fund in the future exceed that figure.
4. That contributions to the memorial be accepted from others as well as the
James O'Donnell Bennett Trust and recipients of awards be encouraged to contribute to the fund in later years when and if they are able to do so.

by unanimous call vote, to cover the cost of the removal of the building
and the construction of sidewalks and the planting of trees and shrubs
in the area.
The following memoirs were adopted:
V. B. Baits:                         VERA BURRIDGE BAITS
Memoir
Vera Burridge Baits, Bachelor of Arts, 1915, was appointed a Regent of the
University of Michigan on May 14, 1943, by Governor Harry F. Kelly. In 1949
she was elected for the term of office which ended December 31, 1957. Mrs. Baits
brought to the regency the point of view of a gifted and successful high school
teacher who had also become a leader among the University's alumnae. Her understanding of students and her appreciation of sound teaching proved of great value
in her work on the Board. Although her comments at meetings of the Board were
infrequent, she packed much meaning into few words. Most jealous of quality
performance for her University at all levels, she reflected this view throughout the
state in her frequent appearances before its citizens. To her the Regents express
their affectionate felicitations and wish her good health and continued activity in
her role as an honored alumna.
This memoir, adopted by unanimous vote of her colleagues and successors at
their meeting January 10, 1958, and incorporated in their Proceedings, formally
records their appreciation of her as a most conscientious public official.
A. B. Connable:                      ALFRED BARNES CONNABLE
Memoir
Sixteen years ago, on January 1, 1942, Alfred Barnes Connable, Bachelor of
Arts, 1925, became a Regent of the University of Michigan. Eight years later he
was re-elected to the post. In his sixteen years of service, he saw the University
double its enrollment; he saw the development of the North Campus; he saw the
state appropriation for the University multiplied more than six times. He had
great admiration for the autonomy of the Board as a constitutional corporation
and took pride in explaining this concept to others, particularly to such groups as
the Association of Governing Boards of State Universities and Allied Institutions,
of which he is a past president. In leaving the Board Mr. Connable defined the
essential values of greatness in a state university as being derived from "a liberal
tradition of faculty and student expression, a stimulating environment for scholarly
exploration, and a responsiveness to the needs of all the people." These values he
consistently emphasized in discussion and proposed for action. The Regents of the
University of Michigan recognize his significant and faithful service to his Alma
Mater and extend to him their very best wishes for health and happiness.
This memoir, adopted by unanimous vote of his colleagues and successors at
their meeting January 10, 1958, and incorporated in their Proceedings, formally
records their appreciation of him as a most conscientious public official.
P. L. Adams:                          PAUL LINCOLN ADAMS
Memoir
The Regents of the University recognize the diligent and significant service
which Paul Lincoln Adams gave his University in the two years from 1956 to
1958 he served as a member of the Board of Regents. Having received the degrees
Bachelor of Arts (1930), Master of Arts (1931), and Bachelor of Laws (1936)
from the University, he approached the regency with a high sense of devotion and
loyalty to his Alma Mater. In his short period of service, he was highly valued by
his fellow Regents as a constructive force in their deliberations. The Regents
extend to him their very best wishes for outstanding success in his new post as
Attorney General of the State of Michigan.
This memoir adopted by unanimous vote of his colleagues and successors at
their meeting January 10, 1958, and incorporated in their Proceedings, formally
records their appreciation of him as a most conscientious public official.
Regent Murphy:     Regent Murphy was appointed to membership on the Board of
Appointment to  Governors of the Michigan League to succeed Regent Vera B. Baits,
League   rtretired.




JANUARY MEETING, 1958

Although with respect to the question of the present location of the
proposed route of U.S. 23 through the North Campus, no definite
action was taken, the Regents, however, requested the Vice-President
in charge of business and finance to discuss the matter further with the
Michigan State Highway Department.
The Regents directed the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance to agree with Eastern Michigan College concerning the construction of the will of Frederick Alexander to provide an organ as
recommended by the committee named in the will, provided that the
distribution to Eastern Michigan College will not exceed $86,000 (R.P.,
1954-57, p. 1311).
Regent Connable's travel expense vouchers for attendance at the
meetings of the Regents on October 18, November 22, and December
13, and the meeting of the Governing Boards of State Institutions on
October 24, in the total amount of $98.49, were approved.
Regent Adams' expense vouchers for attendance at the meeting of
December 13 in the amount of $71.40 were approved.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to meet on February 21, on March 21, and on
April 18, and the President requested that members of the Board
reserve May 22, 23, and 24 as the dates when presumably the Regents
will meet at Hidden Valley, Gaylord, as has been the custom for the
past few years.

The Attorney for the Regents reported that the will of Maud Helen
Parker, deceased, has recently been offered for probate in Shiawassee
County. Mrs. Parker was the wife of Dr. Walter T. Parker, 'Olm. This
will provides that the amount of "the maximum allowable marital
deductions under the Federal Estate Tax Law from my estate" shall be
given to her husband, Walter T. Parker, and the remainder of her estate
given to the Detroit Trust Company, as trustee, to pay the income for
life to her husband, and upon his death the corpus of the trust is to be
turned over to the Regents of the University of Michigan to be used in
relation to the program of the Medical School of the University. The
will also contains a provision that in the event her husband predeceases
her, then the entire estate, after the payment of some small specific
legacies, is to go to the University. The will also recites that it is a
reciprocal will and that her husband has executed a will of like terms.
The exact size of the estate has not yet been determined.


Ernestine K.    The Attorney for the Regents filed the following Paragraph Sixth of
Kahn: Will of the will of Ernestine K. Kahn, A.B. 1892, deceased, recently filed for
probate in Wayne County:
I give and bequeath to the WOMENS LEAGUE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, Ann Arbor, the sum of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00). If such organization shall not be in existence at the time of
my death, then the said amount shall be given to the UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN.
Dr. and Mrs.    The Regents accepted with grateful appreciation a gift to the Kelsey
A. G. Ruthven:  Museum of Archaeology by Dr. and Mrs. Alexander G. Ruthven of an
antique chandelier originally purchased in Egypt and valued at approximately $500 in Cairo but presumably worth much more in this country.
Alice Bogdonoff   The Regents accepted with an expression of sincere thanks to the
Aware Esditorial  donors, Dr. Samuel Bogdonoff, D.D.S., and Mrs. Bogdonoff, of Washington, D.C., a proposal to establish the Alice Bogdonoff Silver Editorial Award under the following terms and conditions:
Origin: Established by gifts from Dr. and Mrs. Samuel Bogdonoff in memory
of Alice Bogdonoff Silver. Mrs. Silver served the Michigan Daily variously as a
member of its editorial staff, as its associate editorial director, and as its co-editor.
Eligibility: The award may be given to any member of the Michigan Daily
sophomore, junior, or senior editorial staffs, except that any member of the selection committee shall be ineligible. A winner of an award is not by that fact
ineligible to receive the award again in subsequent years.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1958


321


Criteria: The award shall be given to that person who, during the year preceding the time of the award, has most notably and consistently manifested qualities
of courage, responsibility, thoroughness, maturity of interpretation, and concern for
justice and democratic ideals in editorials and interpretive writing dealing with
University or non-University affairs or both.
Procedure: The selection of the winner of the Alice Bogdonoff Silver Editorial
Award shall be made by a committee composed of the Managing Editor, the City
Editor, and the Editorial Director of the Michigan Daily for the year of the
award. This committee shall make its decision between April 1 and May 1, and
shall communicate its decision to the Board in Control of Student Publications for
transmittal to the appropriate business office of the University and for public
announcement. The committee shall have the option of making no award if in its
judgment no performance merits recognition as outstanding editorial work.
Award: One hundred dollars.
Number: One annually.
Term: It is the understanding between the donors and the University that the
Alice Bogdonoff Silver Editorial Award will be established for a period of three
years. At the time of the third year's award, the donors and, on behalf of the
University, the Board in Control of Student Publications will discuss the desirability of perpetuating the award as here established or as amended.

A. J. Van Duren:
Memoir


The President reported the death on January 26, 1958, of Dr.
Arthur J. Van Duren, Assistant Professor of German and Chairman of
Faculty Counselors in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
The Regents adopted the following memoir:
The Regents of the University of Michigan join his many friends in mourning
the death, January 26, 1958, at age fifty-seven, of Arthur J. Van Duren, Assistant
Professor of German, and Chairman of Faculty Counselors in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Professor Van Duren, a native of Holland, Michigan, transferred from Hope College in 1920 to the University of Michigan, where
he earned the A.B. degree in 1923, the A.M. in 1924, and the Ph.D. in 1930.
Before becoming Assistant Professor of German, Dr. Van Duren was Instructor in
Economics and Business Administration. In 1933 he was appointed Academic
Counselor, in addition to his teaching; in 1938 he became Chairman of the
Academic Counselors in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. From
1943 to 1945 he was Supervisor of the General Curriculum for the Navy College
Training Program. Professor Van Duren possessed the qualities of a true counselor.
He measured with extraordinary skill students' capacities and their will to succeed.
He gave them a clear picture of what the University expected of them. Those who
had difficulties but truly wanted to succeed found in "Art" Van Duren, as he was
affectionately called, patience without limit. His understanding of their strengths
and weaknesses endeared him to Michigan students everywhere. In him the University has lost a man who was able to translate the University, as an institution,
into a spirit called Alma Mater.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1958


335


The Regents express their deepest sympathy to Mrs. Van Duren, and to the
members of Professor Van Duren's family, and share with them their great loss.
The Regents adopted the following memoir in honor of Mr. James            J. w. Parker:
'Memoir
W. Parker, D.Eng.(hon.), who died on December 30, 1957:                       Memo
Death came to James W. Parker with unbelievable suddenness on December
30, 1957. It found him at the very zenith of achievement. His mark was
indelibly placed on his life's work, the Detroit Edison Company, which he joined
at twenty-three upon graduation from Cornell University, and in which he held the
lowest and the highest offices. His intelligence, his aspirations, his trustworthiness,
his hopefulness, his understanding, and his kindness were reflected in his Company,
and became integral to its character and reputation. These qualities were felt and
recognized beyond his Company, beyond his City, beyond his State, beyond his
Nation. They were felt wherever he worked in the world. Instinctively aware of
new sources of natural power and of the effect of it upon society, he became
Chairman of the first Industrial Advisory Group of the United States Atomic
Energy Commission. He "dipped into the future as far as human eye could see.
He saw the vision of the world and all the wonder that would be." His perception
was his genius. His ability to translate it for his fellow men made him great.
The Regents mourn the death of James W. Parker, good neighbor, sound
counselor, and trusted friend of the University of Michigan. They express their
deepest sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
As a matter of record, and to comply with the provisions of the           E. w. Sink,
Bylaws of the Regents, Sec. 5.20, the Regents approved the retirement         C. C. Fries:

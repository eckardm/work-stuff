Section 5.01 of the "Bylaws," Definitions, was amended by adding
the following paragraph:
(7) The term "University year" as used in connection with appointments of
members of the faculty and otherwise is defined as the period extending from one
week before the opening of classes in the fall to Commencement day inclusive.
The Board approved the clarification of the record by rescinding
the action of March 29, 1929 (R.P., 1926-29, p. 943), which established an Institute of Engineering Research, for the following reasons:
On March 29, 1929 (R.P., 1926-29, pp. 943-45), the Regents established
an Institute of Engineering Research to be composed of several constituent foundations and designed to give the University leadership in the prosecution of research
in engineering and the fundamental sciences related thereto. The Institute was to
be administered by a Board of Governors, the membership of which was specified.
In January, 1938 (R.P., 1936-39. p. 443), the Regents established the
Mortimer E. Cooley Foundation of Engineering as a constituent of the Institute


Bylaw:

JULY MEETING, 1948


of Engineering Research, but no other constituent foundations have been approved
by the Board of Regents and the Board of Governors of the Institute of Engineering Research has never met. In January, 1948 (R.P., 1945-48, pp. 1132-33),
the Regents established the Engineering Research Institute to take the place of
the Department of Engineering Research, but this Institute has no relation to
the Institute of Engineering Research previously established.
Architecture   On recommendation by the Dean and Executive Committee of the
and Design:  College of Architecture and Design, the second paragraph of Section
Executive
Comittee  21.03 of the "Bylaws," The Dean and Executive Committee, was
amended to read as follows:
The Executive Committee shall consist of the Dean and four additional
members of the faculty to be appointed by the Board of Regents on recommendation by the President. The appointed members shall hold office for terms of four
years each, the terms to be so adjusted that one shall expire each year. The
Dean shall be chairman of the committee.
This involves a change in the number and length of terms of the
members of the committee, as well as the elimination of the provision that they shall not be eligible for reappointment.
In order to give the above amendment immediate effect, the terms
of the present Executive Committee members were terminated herewith and a new committee was appointed (p. 14).
Payment for     Section 3.05 of the "Bylaws" provides that members of the faculty
Overtime Service  holding full-time appointments may not receive payment for overtime
work or additional services during the appointment period, whether in
their own department or in another budget unit of the University,
unless arrangements therefor have been authorized by the Regents.
The Board voted that in the future payments of stipends in the program of postgraduate dentistry, which have heretofore been presented
to the Regents at definite intervals for approval, need not have specific
action by the Board. All such payments, however, will be transmitted
through the Provost's Office and will be subject to the approval of the
Provost (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1345).
Art Collections:  At the request of Jean Paul Slusser, Professor of Drawing and
Surplus Items  Painting and Director of the Museum    of Art, the Regents gave approval to the sale or exchange of items unsuitable for use found in the
collections of the Museum of Art. It is understood that any items
obtained by exchange are to be added to the collections and that all
monies realized from cash sales of substitute or unwanted items are to
be deposited in the Museum of Art Special fund.
Residence    The Board gave permission to Mrs. Frederica B. Wahls to register
Status Granted  in the University as a resident of Michigan beginning with the first
semester of the University year 1948-49.
Permission was given to Sunhild Rauschkolb to register in the University as a resident of Michigan beginning with the second semester
of the University year 1948-49, with the understanding that she will
have received her first citizenship papers at that time, but that for
the first semester of this University year Miss Rauschkolb will register
as a nonresident student.
Phoenix and    The Board voted that Kersting, Brown and Company, Incorporated,
Cooley Projects  be employed as managers of the Cooley Memorial Building Project
and of the Phoenix Project, at a cost of $45,000 for the period August
16, 1948, to June 25, 1949. The executive officers and the respective




JULY MEETING, 1948


29


committees of the Cooley and Phoenix projects were directed to seek
ways and means of integrating the two projects so far as possible to the
end that the appeal for financial support may be made in a single unified
effort rather than through separate and competing campaigns. The sum
of $25,000 was appropriated to the Phoenix Project account for organizational expense and for support of research activities on the project
(p. 27). It is understood that not more than $5,000 of said sum is to
be used for organizational expense. If it is finally decided that the two
projects are to be combined into one fund-raising campaign, the funds
for payment of the fund-raising managers are to be had from the
Mortimer E. Cooley Foundation in Engineering and from Phoenix
Project sources in proper proportionate amounts (R.P., 1945-48, pp.
1261 and 1202).
The Board confirmed the action of the Finance and Property Committee in awarding to A. P. W. Hewett, Incorporated, of Ann Arbor,
the contract for the construction of the Observatory building at the
Portage Lake Station (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1264). It is understood that
the building is to be completed in one hundred and eighty days, at a
total cost of not to exceed $37,500, for which there is at present a
total appropriation of $65,000, of which $53,000 has been allocated for
construction purposes. It is expected that a housing unit will be built
from the remainder of this allocation.
The Board approved a program in real estate, to be administered
under the supervision of the Extension Service, from July 1, 1948, to
June 30, 1949, and appropriated $17,000 to the University Extension
Service General Instruction budget for the development of this statewide program (p. 27). It is understood that the State Board of Control for Vocational Education will subsidize the program to an amount
equivalent to 50 per cent of the salary and travel of the person appointed to develop the program and 50 per cent of instructional costs
connected with the courses actually offered. It is assumed that the
remaining 50 per cent of the cost of the program will be met by
enrollment fees in the classes. With the approval of the Dean of the
School of Business Administration and the Executive Committee of the
University Extension Service, Mr. Charles H. Sill was named Lecturer
in Real Estate (p. 13). A tentative budget was approved as follows:
Salary of person to be directly in charge of the program......$ 7,000
Travel  of  supervisor.....................................  2,000
Stipends and travel of teaching personnel................... 8,000

Audio-Visual    The following recommendations of the Provost were approved:
Education     (1) That, effective immediately, the Audio-Visual Education Center be disassociated administratively from the Extension Service and be established as a
separate academic unit under its present designation.
(2) That the Center be under the immediate direction of a Director (p. 21)
assisted by an Executive Committee, the Executive Committee to consist of the
Director, who shall act as chairman, the Director of the University Extension
Service, the Director of the Bureau of School Services, and the Director of the
University Library, or their designated representatives, and one additional member
of the University Senate to be appointed by the Board of Regents on recommendation by the President.
Trust Funds:     On recommendation by the Committee on Budget Administration,
Budget Procedure  the Board authorized the following budget procedure in connection with
projects supported by trust funds for which budgets are presented during the fiscal year:
The budgets are to be submitted in the usual manner to the Committee on
Budget Administration for approval and recommendation to the Board of Regents.
If salary and wage payments for services rendered become due before the budgets
have been approved by the Board of Regents, the Vice-President in charge of
business and finance is authorized to make such payments in accordance with
the budgets as approved by the Committee on Budget Administration, pending
approval of the Board of Regents at the next meeting.
Appointments in connection with such projects shall not be made until the
Regents have approved the budgets therefor.
Bylaw: Sick     Section 5.19 of the "Bylaws" reads: "Persons classified as academic
Leibrary  personnel and not included in the teaching staff shall be entitled to sick
Employees  leave with pay in accordance with regulations approved by the Board
of Regents." The following regulations were approved as applicable
to this "Bylaw" (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1090):
Sick leave for library employees of professional grade. Library employees of
professional grade shall be granted sick leave with salary for disability resulting
from sickness or from accidents. They shall be entitled to sick leave beginning
with the first day of disability in accordance with the policy set forth below:
(1) Every full-time professional library employee shall be entitled to sick
leave with pay of one working day for each complete calendar month of service.
(2) An employee may utilize his sick leave allowance, upon approval of the
Library Director, for absences due to illness, injury, or exposure to contagious
diseases endangering the health of other employees. In the event of death in the
employee's immediate family, leave with pay, up to a maximum of three days,
will be granted. Time thus taken will be deducted from accumulated sick leave.
(3) Unused sick leave may be accumulated to make up a maximum credit
of one hundred working days.
The accumulated sick leave as of July 1, 1948, shall consist of one day for
each full month of service during the preceding ninety-month period, less any
sick leave granted during that period. For purposes of determining the amount of
sick leave under this policy, the University records concerning an employee's
service shall be accepted.
(4) An employee is not entitled to the benefits described above unless he is
able to furnish satisfactory evidence of inability to work by reason of accident
or sickness. The employee must report disability promptly to his department




JULY MEETING, 1948                               31
head. To qualify for sick leave, a disabled employee is expected to obtain, when
necessary and at his own expense, the services of a qualified physician.
(5) The continuous service record of each library employee shall be calculated
from the beginning of the first full calendar month of original employment.
Voluntary termination or discharge shall be considered a complete break in
service continuity, and no past service will be credited in case of re-employment.
(6) The transfer of an employee from one University unit to another shall
not affect his sick leave status in any respect.
(7) The University reserves the right to withdraw or modify these regulations at any time. However, every disability shall be provided for on the basis
of the regulations in force at the time when the disability occurred.
The President reported that Preston W. Slosson, Ph.D., Professor            P. W. Slosson:
of History, has announced his candidacy for member of the House of
Representatives from the Second Congressional District of the State
of Michigan.
There having been no objection        within the stipulated    two-week     Approved489
period from any Regent to any item included in the budget for
1948-49, tentatively approved at the June meeting (R.P., 1945-48,

H. W. Kothe     The Regents accepted, with sincere thanks to the donor, an initial
contribution of $50 from Mr. Herman W. Kothe of Indianapolis,
Indiana,
to be held in trust by the University of Michigan as the beginning of a fund to
be known as the Kothe-Hildner Fund, to which I intend to add from time to time
other small amounts, to the end that the income therefrom may be expended
annually, or at longer intervals of time at the direction of the Department of
German of the University, as it may deem desirable in the interests of said
Department. By way of suggestion, the income may be devoted to the payment
of an award to outstanding students of German, or to members of the Faculty of
said Department; all, however, within the sole discretion of the Department.
If the fund shall not reach the amount of $2,000.00 by grants during my
lifetime and by such testamentary provision as I may make, the corpus of the
trust may be expended as well as the income therefrom. If, however, the aggregate




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1948

of the fund from all sources, including such income as may be derived from
the investment of the fund prior to my death, shall be in the amount of $2,000.00
or more, then the fund shall become a permanent trust fund for investment and
the use of income as hereinabove stated. In the event of any impairment of
principal, restitution to the fund shall be made from income until the principal
thereof is reconstituted.
If the teaching of German shall be abandoned, then the income from the
trust shall be devoted to the payment of awards, annually or at longer intervals
of time, at the sole discretion of the Department of Literature, Science and the
Arts, to such member of the Faculty whose work as a teacher during the year
of the award shall warrant the receipt thereof.
The Board     accepted, with   grateful appreciation, 500 shares of      Bequest:

Students, the income from which will be administered by the Alumnae
Council for fellowships and scholarships as student aid to women.

Death: D. M.      The President reported the sudden death of Professor Donald M.
Matthews  Matthews on September 14, 1948. The following memoir was adopted
by the Board for inclusion in the minutes of this meeting:
The Regents of the University of Michigan hereby make formal record of
their deep sorrow for the sudden death, on September 14, 1948, of Donald
Maxwell Matthews, Professor of Forest Management in the School of Forestry
and Conservation, and of their profound appreciation of Professor Matthews'
value to the University and to the nation, as one of the foremost and most
successful advocates of a rational economy of forest properties. In the teaching
of his subject and in his many contacts as consultant with the major woodproducing companies, he combined to an unusual degree the technical and the
business approach to the management of privately owned forest lands, and by his
expert knowledge and compelling personality had come to exercise a widespread
and wholly beneficial influence throughout the industry. This influence will long




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1948

continue to be felt through the many students who profited by his instruction
during the twenty-one years of his membership in the University's faculty.
Professor Matthews was an alumnus of the University of Michigan, an able and
beloved teacher, and a scholar in the best sense of the word. His wise counsel
was frequently sought by his colleagues, and he was often called upon to perform
administrative duties. He will be sorely missed and sincerely mourned, not only
for his professional achievements, but likewise for his personal qualities of
integrity, loyalty, and friendliness. To his surviving family the Regents express
their deepest sympathy in their sudden and overwhelming loss.
The following resolution upon the retirement of Professor Louis C.
Karpinski was adopted (p. 50):
WHEREAS, Louis Charles Karpinski, Professor of Mathematics, reached the
age of seventy years on August 5, 1948, and
WHEREAS, Professor Karpinski, as a member of the faculty of the University
of Michigan for forty-four years and as the holder of a full professorship for the
past twenty-nine years, has actively interested himself in the affairs of his profession, winning distinction in the fields of the history of mathematics and of
cartography and energetically aiding in the extension of the University's facilities
in these subjects, therefore be it
Resolved, By the Regents of the University of Michigan, that the Regents
express to Professor Karpinski their sincere felicitations upon the many accomplishments of his career as teacher and scholar and their gratitude for his longcontinued service, and be it further
Resolved, That Professor Karpinski be retired from active service, with the
title Professor Emeritus of Mathematics, as of August 5, 1948, in accordance
with the regulations of the Board of Regents and with all of the privileges
customarily extended to emeritus members of the faculty.
The following memoir on the retirement of Mrs. Mabel Ross Rhead
Field was adopted for inclusion in the minutes of this meeting:
On August 7, 1948, Mrs. Mabel Ross Rhead Field, having attained the age
of seventy years, became eligible under the "Bylaws" of the Board of Regents
for retirement from her active duties as Professor of Piano. Mrs. Field was
graduated from the University School of Music in 1904, and in the same year
joined its faculty. Ever since that time she has been associated with the School,
becoming an Associate Professor in 1928 and Professor in 1944. This long period
of teaching and artistic performance has been characterized both by the consistently sustained quality of her work and by a warmth of personality which
has made her an especially valued member of the faculty of the School. As an
artist she has been invited to make frequent concert appearances in Ann Arbor,
with nationally known orchestras, and, during a leave of absence in 1936-37. in
China. As a teacher she has displayed a notable ability to draw out and develop
the capacities of her students. The Regents of the University of Michigan hereby
formally record their sincere gratitude for Mrs. Mabel Ross Rhead Field's long
and distinguished service and express their good wishes for her future health and
happiness. As a further mark of their appreciation they confer upon her the
title Professor Emeritus of Piano and cordially invite her to avail herself of all
the courtesies customarily extended to emeritus members of the faculty.
The following leaves of absence and extensions of leaves of absence
were granted (p. 24):
Stephen S. Attwood, Professor of Electrical Engineering, for the second semester
of the University year 1948-49, with full salary, sabbatical, for study and

An addition of $800 to the Salary budget of the Department of Speech, to
provide additional instructional assistance for the first semester of the University
year 1948-49, was approved by the committee.
Permission was granted to the Department of Botany to use $1,200, originally
allocated as compensation for teaching fellows, for the payment of assistants, on
an hourly basis, for the University year 1948-49.
The committee approved the transfer of $1,200 from the Current account to
the Salary account of Lane Hall to provide funds for the payment of honoraria
to visiting lecturers and others invited to participate in its programs, during the
fiscal year 1948-49.
September 28, 1948
The committee approved the following appropriations:
Romance Languages and Literatures, Salary account: $600 to provide funds to
carry the required instructional load for the first semester of the University
year 1948-49
Institute of Social Work, Salary account: $50 as an addition to the item in the
budget allocated for lecturers, to provide compensation for one appointee
living in Ann Arbor, thus requiring the extra salary above that of the original
Detroit appointee, who has resigned
Approval was given to use funds in budgets of the following departments:
Department of Anatomy: $3,000 originally appropriated for four teaching fellows
in this department, to be used at the discretion of the chairman for hourly
help during the remainder of the present University year
Department of Psychology: $2,050 of the salary originally allocated as compensation for Associate Professor Martha G. Colby, on leave (p. 87), as compensation for teaching fellows in the amount of $1,200, and assistants in the
amount of $850, for the present University year
Department of Geology: $2,500 from the unexpended balance in the budget appropriation for Associate Professor George M. Stanley, resigned (p. 79), as
compensation for teaching fellows during the present University year
Department of Bacteriology: $3,600 made available in the salary budget because
of the resignation of Dr. Rafael Cordova-Marquez (p. 139), to the extent of
$1,600 for assistants in the department and $2,000 for hourly part-time help
Michigan Historical Collections: Approximately $400 which would otherwise be
unspent at the end of the present fiscal year, for use as compensation to
part-time hourly help. This amount is available because of the resignation of
an assistant curator on August 1 and the fact that a replacement was not
made until September 13. It is understood that this amount is not to be
carried forward into the budget of 1949-50 as extra help.
Institute of Social Work: The Salary budget of the Institute carries an appropriation of $4,400 for an assistant professor. Permission was given to use $1,150
from this item as compensation for three staff members who will carry part

of dollars and cents.

Spaulding, Washington, D. C., and her sister, Mrs. Hugh McCulloch,
Redlands, California, a small but very interesting and valuable collection of books and papers relating to their father, Stephen Davis Tucker,

Memoir:      The following memoir on the retirement of John Lewis Brumm,
j. L. Brumm   Professor of Journalism     and Chairman of the Department of Journalism, was adopted for inclusion in the minutes of this meeting
(p. 50):
John Lewis Brumm, whose seventieth birthday fell on August 13, 1948, has
had a long and intimate association with the University of Michigan. A graduate
of the University, with the degree A.B. in 1904, followed by the A.M. in 1906,
he became in 1905 an instructor in the Department of Rhetoric, where the earliest
courses in journalism were being developed under the leadership of the late
Professor Fred Newton Scott. Professor Brumm actively entered this phase of
the Department's work in 1918 and in the following year organized the University
Press Club of Michigan, of which he was secretary and treasurer from 1919 until
1947. After successive promotions, he reached full professorial rank in 1921 and
became the first chairman of the Department of Journalism upon its establishment in 1929-30. In the meantime his activities had included the editorship of
the University's news service and, for two years, of the Michigan Alumnus; in
1925 he was the founder and sponsor of the Michigan Interscholastic Press
Association. His standing as an early and respected teacher of journalism on the
college level was made evident by his election in 1918 to the presidency of the
American Association of Schools and Departments of Journalism, and his value




OCTOBER MEETING, 1948


141


to the Ann Arbor community is attested by the prominent positions he has held
in local civic, church, and social organizations. It is inevitable that the retirement
of one whose active career has been so varied and whose acquaintances are so
widespread should affect to an unusual degree the faculty of which he has been a
member for forty-three years, the hundreds of students who have experienced the
benefit of his teaching, and the even larger number of friends, in the journalistic
field and elsewhere, who have come to appreciate his geniality and helpfulness.
The Regents of the University of Michigan therefore hereby record their sincere
gratitude for the notable service of John Lewis Brumm to the interests of the
University over a period of more than four decades, and, now that he has reached
the age of retirement specified by their Bylaws, confer upon him the title Professor
Emeritus of Journalism. They wish Professor Brumm long-continued enjoyment of
the leisure now afforded him and invite him to avail himself of all the courtesies
customarily extended to emeritus members of the faculty.
The following leaves of absence and an extension of leave of
absence were granted (p. 87):
Harry Bouchard, Professor of Geodesy and Surveying, for the first semester of
the University year 1948-49, with full salary, because of illness
Robert B. Hall, Professor of Geography and Director of the Center for Japanese
Studies, for the period November 1, 1948, to January 31, 1949, to accept an
Army assignment for research in Japan. Since Professor Hall will be engaged
in work directly related to the objectives of the Center for Japanese Studies,
and because his Army salary will be less than his salary for the academic
year, the University will continue to contribute its share of the premiums due
on his annuity policy and $235 monthly toward his salary, during the period
of this leave.
Amos R. Morris, Assistant Professor of English, for the first semester of the
University year 1948-49, with full salary, because of illness
Ignatius A. Wojtaszak, Associate Professor of Engineering Mechanics, extension
of leave of absence to the end of the first semester of the University year
1948-49, with full salary, because of illness (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1124)
John N. Clancy, Admitting Officer and Assistant to the Director of the Speech
Clinic, Institute for Human Adjustment, from October 8 to November 8,
1948, with full salary, because of illness
James M. Cork, Professor of Physics, for the first semester of the University
year 1948-49, with full salary, because of illness
On recommendation by the proper faculty in each case, degrees

OCTOBER MEETING, 1948


143


On recommendation by the Provost, the Regents authorized the discontinuation of the present appointment procedure for student assistants and other junior academic employees performing minor services in departments of instruction and other academic units, with the
understanding that:
1. Such persons will be employed by the units concerned and paid on the
basis of payroll vouchers approved by the head of the unit (dean in the case of a
school or college) and the Provost. The stipend may be established on a semester
basis if that is desirable so that one payroll voucher will authorize payments
through the semester. Complete payroll procedures will be worked out with the
Business Office.
2. The present appointment procedures will be continued in the case of
(a) a teaching fellow or person of comparable rank and above; (b)a person having
continuing responsibility for the conduct of a class or a section or laboratory
section thereof; and (c) a person whose semester stipend is in excess of $500.


Appointment
Procedure
Changed


The Board granted the petition of Paul W. Brown, a student in the
Medical School, to register as a resident of Michigan beginning with
the second semester of the University year 1948-49.
On recommendation by the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance and with the approval of the University auditors, Ernst
and Ernst, the Regents approved writing off accounts to a total of
$151.80, which are two years old or older and which are deemed uncollectible.
On recommendation by Dean Ralph A. Sawyer, the Board approved
the addition of $3,000 to the budget of the Bureau of Psychological
Services, Institute for Human Adjustment, to supplement funds of the
Evaluation and Examinations Division. It is understood that in all
probability this amount will be covered by student fees for examinations taken under the direction of the Bureau, and when collected will
be added to the budget of the Bureau (R.P., 1945-48, p. 991).
The Board received a petition from residents living in the vicinity
of 1808 Hermitage Road, at which address a fraternity is now situated, protesting the use of this dwelling as a fraternity house. The
Board recommended that the executive officers appoint a committee
to meet with a delegation of the residents of that vicinity to explain
the situation and to cite the action of the Committee on Student
Affairs in granting permission for the purchase of this property by the
fraternity.
On recommendation by the Finance and Property Committee, the
following resolution regarding the audit by Ernst and Ernst for the
year ended June 30, 1948, was adopted (R.P., 1945-48, p. 931):
Resolved, That the reports of Ernst and Ernst, as auditors for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1948, be received and placed on file.
The auditors' certificate with respect to the general accounts of the University
is as follows:
The Board of Regents of the
University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, Michigan
We have examined the balance sheets of the several funds of the University of Michigan as of June 30, 1948, and the related statements of income and expenses and fund
equities for the year then ended, have reviewed the system of internal control and the
accounting procedures of the University and, without making a detailed audit of the
transactions, have examined or tested accounting records of the University and other supporting evidence, by methods and to the extent we deemed appropriate. Our examination
was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards applicable in the
circumstances and included all procedures which we considered necessary. It was not
practicable to confirm by communication the accounts receivable from United States

OCTOBER MEETING, 1948


Government departments and agencies, but we have satisfied ourselves with respect to
such accounts by means of other auditing procedures.
In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and related statements of income
and expenses and fund equities present fairly the position of the several funds of the
University of Michigan at June 30, 1948, and the results of its operations for the year,
in conformity with generally accepted principles of institutional accounting applied on a
basis consistent in all important respects with that of the preceding year.
ERNST AND ERNST
Certified Public Accountants
October 5, 1948
Legal Services:     The Board approved payment to Burke, Burke and Smith of a bill
ureand Smithr  for services rendered for the period ended December 31, 1947, to a
total of $803.10. When first received, this statement included a $1,500
charge for services in connection with the White Company to perform
on a subcontract for refrigeration in the Food Service Building. The
legal instruments which were prepared provided that the trustee would
pay for the legal services in preparing the appropriate instruments.
This matter has now been resolved, and the University is billed only
for the legal services received by the University. Of the total amount,
$50.75 is chargeable to Administration-Legal Fees and Expenses and
$752.35 to Plant Fund-Food Service Building.
Jefferson     On recommendation by the Vice-President in            charge of business
Conrolidatd  and finance, the Regents voted that the Consolidated Endowment fund
Endowment   take over, at the cost to the University, the Jefferson Apartments as
nvestment   an investment, with the provision that if in the future the land or
building is needed for other purposes, the Consolidated Endowment
fund will be reimbursed on the basis of the depreciated book value
of the property (p. 106).
Regent Herbert's traveling expense vouchers for attendance at the
meeting of September 24, in the amount of $76.90, were approved.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote, except where
otherwise expressly stated.
The Board adjourned to meet at 9:00 A.M., November 13, with the
understanding that the regular committee meetings will be held at 3:00
P.M. on November 12.

Library of the University of the Philippines (R.P., 1945-48, p. 59).
The soliciting campaign, carried on through the facilities of the General Library, has produced approximately twenty-six and a half tons
of books and periodicals, conservatively 55,000 items, the cost of transportation being absorbed by the American Book Center. Book publishers have also contributed generously. Various student efforts, in
which the University of Michigan Club of Flint and the citizens of Ann
Arbor have assisted, have accumulated $5,764.68. Further shipment
of books now on hand cannot be made until the United States Book

The Regents voted that appropriate thanks be extended to the
donors of the gift recorded in the following letter:
Mr. Randolph G. Adams
William L. Clements Library
Ann Arbor, Michigan
Dear Randolph:
Our mother took very real pleasure on many occasions in lending the Library
her coffee urn for use on appropriate occasions of entertainment in the Library
Building. We would like the Library to have this urn as a gift from her and in
her memory and we are including also the cream pitcher, sugar bowl and an
extra bowl which were part of the set.
As you perhaps know this set belonged to her family and, therefore, to the
family of Mr. Clements and was for many years in the home in which they lived
on State Street in Ann Arbor.
We hope that it will continue to give pleasure to the friends and patrons of
the Library and particularly those to whom an item of association with Mr.
Clements and his family has a special significance.
Faithfully yours,
(signed) RENVILLE WHEAT
October 27, 1948

The President reported the death of Cecil J. McHale, Professor of         Memoir:
Library Science, on November 2, 1948. The following memoir was
adopted for inclusion in the minutes:
Cecil John McHale, Professor of Library Science in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, died in Ann Arbor on November 2, 1948, aged 49 years.
His death, coming with shocking suddenness to one who was at the height of
his vigor and productivity as teacher and scholar, has united the University
community in grief at his loss and in sympathy for the surviving family who
have been called upon to bear this benumbing tragedy. Professor McHale, who
had received his education at Carleton College, the University of Minnesota,
Harvard University, and the University of Michigan, joined our Department of
Library Science in 1938. His practical experience in public library service and
his gifts of good judgment and lucid expression at once made it clear that his
appointment had added strength to the Department of Library Science, both in
its instruction and in its relations with public library practice in the State; for
Professor McHale was eminently successful as a teacher and was also conspicuously helpful, through his surveys in several Michigan cities, toward improving
the services of the public library system to the citizenry. These abilities were
further evidenced by his professional publications and were recognized by his
colleagues through his election to high office in their organizations. In the face of
an event which has brought so much sadness to our community, the Board of
Regents can only give voice to their recognition of Professor McHale's great
contribution to the success of the University's work in the field of librarianship
and convey to his family their heartfelt condolences. This they do with the utmost
sincerity, and order that this memoir be made a permanent part of their records.
The President reported and the Regents accepted with regret the            Resignation
resignation  of Dr. Edward      W. Blakeman, Research       Consultant in
Religious Education, effective December 31, 1948. Dr. Blakeman has
accepted the position of Research Consultant and Chairman of Religious
Education at the Pacific School of Religion, Berkeley, California.

The Board approved the transfer of the administration of the
Michigan High School Forensic Association from the University Extension Service, with which it has been identified during the past thirtyone years, to the Bureau of School Services, with which it will be
identified hereafter as an agency for the rendering of services to schools.
The Committee on Budget Administration has authorized the transfer
of the budget appropriation covering this administrative activity.
The Regents voted that part of the salary of Marian Swenseid,
Research Chemist in Hematology Research, Medical School, to the
amount of $1,440, for the period November 1, 1948, to June 30, 1949,
may be paid from the Alphonso Morton Clover Medical Research fund,
the principal to be used if a sufficient amount does not appear in the
income account (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1165).
The Regents added the Association of College Admissions Counselors to the list of those organizations in which the University has
membership and to which it pays dues. In this case the annual membership fee is $25, which is to be paid from the budget of the Office
of the Registrar.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized to retain counsel and to institute suit in the name of the Regents
to recover damages incurred as a result of an accident in which a
University-owned vehicle and an automobile owned by Mr. Gladwin H.
Lewis were involved on August 26, 1948.

Frederick A.    The Regents accepted, in accordance with its terms, a proposal
Coller Funds  from  a group of former students of Dr. Frederick A. Coller to estabestablished
lish two funds, as indicated in the following letter:
Mr. Herbert Watkins
University of Michigan
Dear Mr. Watkins:
At the meeting of the American College of Surgeons at Los Angeles this fall,
a group of former Surgical Residents trained under Dr. Frederick Coller at the
University of Michigan formed a Society to be known as the Frederick A. Coller
Surgical Society. The purpose of this Society, other than social, is to raise
annually a sum of money to be placed at the disposal of the Director of the
Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, for the teaching of and research
into, the problems of surgery. It is also desired that the expenses, such as
stenography, stamps, etc. incurred by the officers of the Society in circularizing
the members be borne by this fund. The authenticity of such bills as may be
submitted is solely the responsibility of the Society.
In addition, should there be any gifts in excess of the annual assessments, it
is requested that these be placed in a permanent fund, the income of which is to
be placed at the disposal of the Director of the Department of Surgery and to be
known as the Frederick A. Coller Endowment.
It is hoped that at reasonable intervals the Director of the Department of
Surgery may be informed by the University of Michigan of the monies at his
disposal.
May we respectfully ask the consideration of the Regents of the University
of Michigan in this matter.
Sincerely,
Nov. 12, 1948                (Signed) E. THURSTON THIEIME, M.D., Treasurer
Frederick A. Coller Surgical Soc'y.
Gift: L. C.     The Board accepted, with appropriate thanks to the donor, the
Ledyard receipt by the Clements Library of a collection of Lewis Cass papers,
valued at approximately $2,000, from Mr. Lewis Cass Ledyard of New
York City, thereby returning to Michigan historical materials highly
important for the study of one of Michigan's great figures.
Gift: E. M.     The President reported a gift of $10,000 from Mr. and Mrs. Ernest
and N. C. Sims  M. Sims to establish a student aid fund for junior and senior students
in economics, to be named the Ernest M. Sims and Natalie C. Sims
fund. The details of the administration of the fund will be presented
to the Regents for approval at a subsequent meeting of the Board.
The Regents voted sincere thanks to the donors.
C. C. Smith     The President reported that funds listed in the estate of the late
Estate  Crapo C. Smith (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1213) have now been received by

C. Woody  Education, Director of the Bureau of Educational Reference and Research, and Graduate Adviser to the Michigan Colleges of Education,
on November 19, 1948. The following memoir was adopted for inclusion in the minutes:
Clifford Woody, since 1921 Professor of Education and Director of the
Bureau of Educational Reference and Research in this University, died suddenly
on November 19, 1948, in Ann Arbor, in the sixty-fifth year of his age. A native
of Thorntown, Indiana, and a graduate of Indiana University, which conferred
upon him the A.B. and A.M. degrees, Professor Woody received the doctorate of
philosophy from Columbia University in 1916. Previous to his coming to Ann
Arbor he had likewise been a high-school teacher and superintendent of schools




DECEMBER MEETING, 1948

and for five years a member of the faculty of the University of Washington.
Professor Woody had a profound knowledge of the materials and methods of
educational research, and the willingness to devote all necessary time and effort
to the solution of the problems which arose in his inquiring mind. He became the
author of numerous monographs, articles, and educational texts and was regarded
as one of the leaders in his field. The thoroughly sane and judicious approach to
educational problems which Professor Woody consistently displayed gained him
the confidence of both his students and his colleagues, and gave high value to his
participation in the work of numerous commissions, boards, and similar groups
in which he served both the University and other organizations. As a director of
graduate study he achieved especial distinction; for the past ten years he had
acted as adviser of the Michigan Colleges of Education with reference to the work
of graduate students in their co-operative program with this University. Besides
being possessed of high professional competence Professor Woody was gifted
with personal qualities of friendliness, wholesomeness, and integrity, which
greatly endeared him to all who knew him. In recognition of Professor Woody's
distinguished service to this University, therefore, the Regents of the University
of Michigan have formally adopted this memoir for inclusion in their permanent
records, and have directed that a copy thereof be sent to Mrs. Woody, together
with assurances of the Regents' deep sympathy with her in this affliction.

The record of the meeting of the Regents of June 11. 1948 (R.P.,         Degree
1945-48, p. 1289), was corrected to show that the degree awarded to          H. S. Voegelin

I)ental School  The Regents approved the inclusion in the budget of 1949-50 of
Rehabilitation  $190,000, which, together with  $100,000  already  provided  (R.P.,
1945-48. p. 1352), will allow purchase orders to be issued at once for
necessary equipment. As of July 1, 1949, the account, Transfer-Plant,
Dental School Rehabilitation, will have totaled $290,000.
etirement:s    The Regents voted an additional allowance of $48.99, payable
monthly from   the James B. Angell-Willard M. Clapp fund, to Miss
Edith Thomas, Chief Extension Librarian, who will retire as of December 31, 1948. The monthly retirement income to which Miss Thomas
is entitled as of the above date is $126.01; the total of $175 a month
represents approximately her expenses for care in a nursing home,
where presumably she will be definitely confined (p. 88).

A report made by the Special Senate Committee on Retirement             Senate
Committee
to the University of Michigan Senate, and by that body recommended          Retirement
to the Regents for consideration, was referred by the Board to the          Report
executive officers for further consideration and subsequent report, with
the understanding that this report will include the estimated cost of
whatever changes are recommended.
A committee of faculty members-Dean Dana, Chairman, Profes-             Biological
Station:
sors Harley H. Bartlett, George R. LaRue, J. Speed Rogers, and              Executive
William  C. Steere-has presented a report on the organization and           Committee
operation of the Biological Station. With the approval of the General
Committee of the Division of the Biological Sciences, the Dean and
faculty of the School of Forestry and Conservation, and the Dean and
Executive Committee of the College of Literature, Science. and the
Arts, and on recommendation of the executive officers, the Regents
established an Executive Committee of the Biological Station. consisting of the Director of the Biological Station, ex officio, who shall
act as Chairman; and, in addition, the Dean of the School of Forestry
and Conservation, ex officio, or his designated representative; the
Chairman of the Department of Botany, ex officio, or his designated
representative; and the Chairman of the Department of Zoology. ex
officio, or his designated representative; with the understanding that
this committee shall exercise the functions set forth in the following
extract from the report:
The Executive Committee of the Biological Station would be responsible for
developing educational policies and programs, and for making recommendations
concerning budgets, staff, and plant development and operation to the Director of
the Summer Session. The Provost would be responsible for final action on matters
dealing with education, and the Vice-President in charge of business and finance,
for final action on matters dealing with plant construction, replacement, and
maintenance, and with business procedures, subject of course to the President and
the Board of Regents. The Director of the Summer Session would be responsible
for preparation and submission to the Committee on Budget Administration of
budget estimates (including staff appointments), for carrying out approved educational policies and programs, and for handling the plant at the station under
the general supervision of the Vice-President in charge of business and finance.
The Director of the Biological Station, in addition to serving as chairman of the
Executive Committee and of the Committee on Admissions, would be responsible
for making recommendations to the Executive Committee on all matters relating
to policies, programs, and operation of the station, and for the actual administration of the station under the general supervision of the Director of the Summer
Session.
The Executive Committee recommended above replaces the former
Advisory Committee for the Biological Station which was created by
the Board of Regents at its meeting on January 26, 1940 (R.P., 1939-42,
p. 182).
Subsequently a bylaw will be presented to the Regents for approval to implement the above procedure.

U. S. Savings    To comply with the regulations of the United States Treasury for
Bonds:  cashing United States Savings Bonds at maturity, the following resoing o lution was adopted:
Resolved, That Alexander G. Ruthven, President, R. P. Briggs, Vice-President,
Herbert G. Watkins, Secretary, and R. G. Griffith, Investment Officer, or any two
of them are hereby authorized and empowered to sell and assign or to request
payment or reissue of any and all United States securities of any description now
or hereafter registered on the books of the Treasury Department and registered
securities with respect to which the Treasury Department acts as the transfer
agency in the name of The Regents of the University of Michigan, or which may
now or hereafter be assigned to it.
And It Is Further Resolved, That any and all assignments of any such securities registered in the name of, or assigned to, this corporation heretofore or hereafter made by the above-named officers, are hereby ratified and confirmed.
Golf Service    The Board approved the final plans and specifications of the archiBuilding Plans  tects, Loree and Sirrine, for a golf service building on the University
approved
pp  of Michigan Golf Course, to be financed by funds made available by
the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics. The Regents thought
it inadvisable at this time to authorize the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics to accept competitive bids for the construction of
this building (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1207).
Annual      Mr. Clair B. Hughes and the City Bank Farmers Trust Company,
Accounting:
W. W. Cook  trustees under the tenth clause of the will of William      W. Cook, deEstate  ceased, have submitted their annual accounting for the year ended
June 30, 1948 (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1206). The account has been audited
by the accounting staff of the University and appears to be correct as
stated. In accordance with the request of the trustees, the following
resolution was adopted.
WHEREAS, City Bank Farmers Trust Company and Clair B. Hughes, as
trustees, have presented an account dated June 30, 1948, of their proceedings as
trustees of the trust created under Clause "Tenth" of the last will and testament

account, it is desirable to settle the said account out of court; and
WHEREAS, City Bank Farmers Trust Company and Clair B. Hughes, as

conditions set forth in a certain instrument annexed to the said account whereby

fully set forth in the said instrument; and
WHEREAS, Said account has been duly examined by this Board and has been

further
Resolved, That this corporation does hereby accept the said account as an
account stated, final and conclusive and does hereby authorize and direct R. P.
Briggs, Vice-President of this corporation, and Herbert G. Watkins, Secretary of
this corporation, to execute for and in the name of this corporation and under
its corporate seal an instrument substantially in the form annexed to the said

fifth clause of the will, and have requested a release (R.P., 1945-48,




DECEMBER MEETING, 1948


209


p. 1332). The account of the trustees has been reviewed by this office
and appears to be a proper accounting. At the request of the trustees,
the following resolution was adopted:
WHEREAS, City Bank Farmers Trust Company and Clair B. Hughes, as
trustees, have presented an account dated April 1, 1948, of their proceedings as
trustees of the trust created under Clause "Fifth" of the last will and testament
of William W. Cook, deceased, for the benefit of the Law School of the University
of Michigan; and

trustees, are willing to have their account settled out of court upon the terms and
conditions set forth in a certain instrument annexed to the said account whereby
the Regents of the University of Michigan accept the said account as an account
stated, final and conclusive and release and discharge the said trustees, all as
more fully set forth in the said instrument; and
WHEREAS, Said account has been duly examined by this Board and has been
found to be correct and true; be it therefore
Resolved, That said account of City Bank Farmers Trust Company and of
Clair B. Hughes, as trustees, covering the period from October 20, 1941, to and
including April 1, 1948, be and is hereby approved in all respects; and be it
further
Resolved, That this corporation does hereby accept the said account as an
account stated, final and conclusive and does hereby authorize and direct R. P.
Briggs, Vice-President of this corporation, and Herbert G. Watkins, Secretary of
this corporation, to execute for and in the name of this corporation and under its
corporate seal an instrument substantially in the form annexed to the said account
releasing and discharging the said trustees as in said instrument more fully set
forth.
The University Calendar Committee submitted a report in detail            Academic
on the problem    of shortening the period between the end of first se-       Calendar
mester classes and the beginning of the second semester (R.P., 1945 -48, p. 1203). The conclusion is that at present no solution to the
problem has been found.
At their meeting of -March 5, 1948, the Regents approved certain regulations
for fixing the beginning and end of semesters and of vacations. The fourth of
these, relating to the Christmas recess, reads in part, "If, however, the Friday
preceding Christmas falls on December 24, the vacation will begin one week
earlier." The Calendar Committee recommends, and the Regents approved, that
this part of the rule should be corrected to read, "If, however, the Friday preceding Christmas falls on December 23 or December 24, the vacation will begin
one week earlier." This will tend to keep the major part of the vacation in
December, and to give more time in January before the beginning of the final
examinations, which the Committee regards as desirable. If, however, the Friday
preceding Christmas falls on December 23, both Christmas and New Year's Day
fall on Sunday and the following Monday is a legal holiday. In such cases the
Committee recommends that classes after the holiday recess be resumed on
Tuesday, January 3.
The academic calendar for 1949-50 was approved as follows. with
the understanding that it first be submitted to the President and the
Conference of the Deans, with special attention being given to the
question of whether Thanksgiving Day should be a one-day or a threeday holiday:

University    The Vice-President in charge of business and finance filed for record
Musical
Society  the audit of the University Musical Society, submitted by Dr. Charles
Audit  A. Sink, President, for the year ended August 31, 1948, as prepared
by Icerman, Johnson and Hoffman, Certified Public Accountants (R.P.,
1945-48. p. 1205).
Freer     The Executive Committee of the College of Literature, Science,
Fund  and the Arts submitted a report of the significance of the Freer Fund
in its relationship to the program of instruction, research, and publication in the Department of Fine Arts (R.P., 1920-23, p. 76). The
Regents approved entering into a collaborative arrangement between
the University and the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution,
to which Mr. Freer left his art collections, to provide a plan of publication and research which will meet the terms of Mr. Freer's will and
also to strengthen the program    in Oriental art in the University. The
suggested plan approved by the Board is as follows:
1. That Mr. Archibald G. Wenley be appointed Honorary Curator of
Oriental Art in the Department of Fine Arts, without salary and on an annual
basis.
2. That Dr. Richard Ettinghausen, Associate of Near Eastern Art at the
Freer Gallery, be appointed Research Professor of Islamic Art in the Department
of Fine Arts, without salary and without tenure and on an annual basis.
3. That the Department of Fine Arts be authorized to nominate a Professor
of Oriental Art at a salary of $7,500, effective in September, 1949. The person
thus appointed would be a scholar acceptable to the Freer Gallery, and he would
receive a joint appointment, without salary, as "Research Associate" in the Freer
Gallery of Art.
4. That the Committee on the Freer Fund be reconstituted to consist of the
Dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, the Chairman of
the Department of Fine Arts, the Chairman of the General Committee of
the Division of Fine Arts, and the Honorary Curator of Oriental Art in the Department of Fine Arts (Director of the Freer Gallery), and that this Committee
be authorized to determine the program of research and publication in Oriental
art to be carried on with funds derived from the income and the unexpended
balances of the Freer bequest and to prepare for presentation to the Provost of
the University an annual budget for the expenditure of such funds.
5. That the University Administration be authorized to enter into an agreement with the Smithsonian Institution looking toward the joint publication of a
serial to be known as "Ars Orientalis (formerly Ars Islamica)," with the understanding that the joint editorship of this serial shall be provided for by the
appointment of one person representing the University of Michigan and one person
representing the Freer Gallery; with the further understanding that the Smithsonian Institution shall assume administrative responsibility for the publication
and distribution of Ars Orientalis, in accordance with a plan to be approved by
both institutions; and with the further understanding that this arrangement may
be terminated at one year's notice by either party.
Political    Reports were received from    the Student Legislature and from     the
Speeches University Senate with respect to the general statement of policy ap

pearing in Section 8.10 of the "Bylaws", Use of Lecture Rooms and
Auditoriums (p. 184). Because of the nature of the proposals contained in these two reports and because the Regents have already
granted permission to representatives of the Student Legislature to
appear before the Board to argue their case, and because it is possible

January Meeting, 1949
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR, JANUARY 29, 1949
The Board met in the Regents' Room at 10:00 A.M.
Present, the President, Regents Eckert, Bonisteel, Stevens, Baits,
Kennedy, Connable, and Herbert. Absent, Regent Hayward and Superintendent of Public Instruction Thurston. There were also in attendance Provost Adams, Vice-Presidents Briggs and Niehuss, Dr.
F. E. Robbins, and the Secretary.
The usual financial reports were placed on file.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance filed a report
of progress made on plant extension since the meeting of the Regents
on December 18.
The minutes of the meeting of December 18 were approved as submitted to the members in press proof, with certain specified changes.
The President reported the death of James H. Cissel, Professor of      Memoir:
Structural Engineering, early in the morning of this day. The follow-     J. H. Cissel
ing memoir was approved by the Board for inclusion in the minutes:
On assembling for their meeting of January 29, the Regents were inexpressibly
shocked to learn of the sudden death, early that morning, of Professor James H.
Cissel of the Department of Civil Engineering. Born at Goodland, Kansas, June
24, 1889, Professor Cissel was a graduate of Purdue University in the Class of
1910, and after five years of practice in the engineering departments of several
railroad companies joined the faculty of this University in 1915. During the
thirty-three years of his faculty service he gained an enviable reputation both as
a teacher and as a technical consultant in the field of structural engineering. He
was the author of important published studies of various phases of this subject,
and as Engineer of Bridge Design for the Michigan State Highway Department
and Consulting Engineer for the Mackinac Straits Bridge Authority he amply
demonstrated his practical, as well as theoretical, command of his chosen branch
of the engineering profession. The beautiful and serviceable bridges which he
designed for the public use will remain as monuments to his memory, together
with his students' and his colleagues' affectionate remembrance of his capacity
for happy companionship and self-forgetful co-operation. The Regents of the
University of Michigan hereby record their high appreciation of the contributions
made by the late Professor Cissel to the prestige of the University, and to his
surviving family they express their deepest sympathy in the cruelly sudden
bereavement which they have sustained.
Regent Bonisteel reported for the Committee on Finance and
Property and recommended approval of all items referred to that committee appearing on the agenda and on the Vice-President's personal
program.
Regent Baits reported for the Committee on University Relations.
recommending that all items in the regular agenda and in the President's personal program referred to that committee be approved, with
the exception of a petition by a student for permission to register as a
resident of Michigan.
Regent Connable reported for the Committee on Educational Policies, recommending that all items referred to that committee in the
agenda and in the President's personal program be approved.

Memoir:      The President reported the death on December 26, 1948, of Dr.
J. W. Eaton  John Wallace Eaton, Professor of German. The following memoir was
adopted for inclusion in the minutes:
It is with extreme sorrow that the Regents have received notice of the death
by accidental drowning of Professor John Wallace Eaton, on December 26, 1948.
under circumstances peculiarly distressing to his family, friends, and colleagues.
Professor of German at this University since 1929. Dr. Eaton brought to our
campus something of the flavor of the England and Ireland which he knew in his
youth, together with the fine scholarship built upon his natural abilities through
studies in London, Dublin, Paris, Marburg, and Munich. He signally contributed
to the instructional program of his department and was the author of frequent
articles relating to the culture, history, and literature of Germany. Professor
Eaton furthermore held membership on important faculty committees, including
the Executive Committee of his College, the Senate Advisory Committee, the
Board of Governors of Residence Halls, and the Committee on Comparative Literature, and in all these capacities rendered valuable service in the friendly and
co-operative spirit which won him esteem throughout the University community.
In testimony of their appreciation of his fine character and noteworthy services
the Regents of the University of Michigan have adopted this memoir, to be incorporated in their official records, and have directed that a copy thereof be conveyed to MIrs. John Wallace Eaton, together with assurances of the Regents'
heartfelt sympathy for her and her family in their bereavement.
Memoir:      The President reported the death on January 2, 1949, of Dr. Roy
R. H. Holmes  Hinman    Holmes, Assistant Professor of Sociology.         The following
memoir was adopted for inclusion in the minutes:
Roy Hinman Holmes, who died in Ann Arbor on January 2, 1949, had been
a member of the faculty of this University for the past thirty years, and since
1922 had been Assistant Professor of Sociology. Dr. Holmes was a graduate of




JANUARY MEETING, 1949


231


Hillsdale College in the class of 1911 and was granted the degrees A.M. and Ph.D.
by the University of Michigan in 1912 and 1927 respectively. For six years prior
to joining our faculty he had been Alumni Professor of English at Hillsdale College. Industry, loyalty, and dependability characterized his services to this University, while as a sociologist he interested himself in the social problems of the
rural areas, a subject upon which he conducted a lengthy program of research and
had frequently written articles for the professional journals. His book Rural
Sociology, another product of this study, appeared in 1932 and is regarded among
his colleagues as a substantial addition to the literature of the subject. Dr. Holmes
was accustomed to devote many hours to consultation with individual members
of the student body and will long be remembered with gratitude by those young
men and women who, sharing in his own somewhat retiring disposition, were
greatly aided by his sympathetic counsels. In view of Professor Holmes' long and
faithful service, therefore, the Regents of the University of Michigan have adopted
this memoir as evidence of their appreciation of his accomplishments while a
member of the University's faculty, and they direct that a copy thereof be transmitted to his surviving family, together with assurances of the deep sympathy
of the Regents with them in their bereavement.

JANUARY MEETING, 1949


M. S. Knapp    Dean Ralph A. Sawyer of the Horace H. Rackham School of GraduAgreement ate Studies reported that Dr. Mark S. Knapp had died on November
Terminated  11, 1948. Under the terms of a resolution adopted by the Board of
Governors of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies
and approved by the Regents (R.P., 1939-42. p. 93), Dr. Knapp was
receiving $3,000 a year, payable from the Endowment Fund created
by an agreement dated September 7, 1935, between Horace H. Rackham
and Mary A. Rackham Fund and the Regents. The Regents approved
the action of the Board of Governors in paying the full quarterly installment due December 31, 1948, to the estate of Dr. Knapp and
instructed that the balance remaining in Project R No. 21, $1,500,
should be returned to the Horace H. Rackham Fund (Income account).
Bylaw:    Because of the subsidiary status of the Administrative Board of
Sec. 10.04
Changed  the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts as reconstituted and
because it is appointed by the faculty, the Regents voted that reference
to it in the "Bylaws" be eliminated by the deletion of the present
Section 10.04, and a new Section 10.04 was approved as follows:
Sec. 10.04. Other Committees. The Executive Committee or the faculty
may, from time to time, constitute such other committees as may be deemed
appropriate for the exercise of functions within the jurisdiction of the faculty.
Fees:    With the approval of the University Committee on Fees, the
Medical
School application fee for admission to the Medical School was increased from
$2.00 to $5.00, effective October 1, 1949. and the acceptance deposit
was increased from $25 to $50 as of the same date.
Fees:    On recommendation by the University Committee on Fees, the
Law Scoo  fees for the proposed eight-week course in the Law School were fixed
at $50 for residents of Michigan and $100 for nonresidents. The summer session fee schedule in the Law School will be as follows, effective
with the summer session of 1949:
Residents Nonresidents
Five and one-half weeks............... $ 30        $  65
Eight  weeks..........................   50          100
Eleven weeks.........................     60           130
Institute for  On recommendation of Dr. Rensis Likert and the Executive ComSocial Research
Established  mittee of the Survey Research Center, and with the approval of the
General Committee of the Division of the Social Sciences, the Regents
voted that the Survey Research Center and the Research Center for
Group Dynamics are to be identified under the title Institute for Social
Research, with Dr. Rensis Likert as Director. For the time being the
two projects will operate with separate designations within the Institute for Social Research, but it is expected that in due course their
separate identities will merge (R.P.. 1945-48, pp. 1133 and 522).
Reuben Peterson  The Board approved the proposal of Dr. Norman F. Miller, ChairMemorial
Research  man of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, to request conLaboratory tributions from former trainees of the Department, and especially from
those trained by Dr. Reuben Peterson, in the hope that $25,000 may
be raised to complete the laboratory wing in the new maternity hospital
now under construction (R.P., 1945-48. p. 932). Funds for this wing
are not now available. If constructed, the laboratory is to be designated
The Reuben Peterson Memorial Research Laboratory in Obstetrics
and Gynecology.




JANUARY MEETING, 1949

At its request the Board voted to return to the Sarah Ann Cochrane
Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, of Plymouth and
Northville, the sum    of $83.86, representing the total of the fund
originally accepted by the Regents plus $3.86 interest, at the March 27,
1942, meeting (R.P., 1939-42, p. 891). Because of its size, this fund
cannot be operated economically, and, since its acceptance, only one
loan has been made from this account.
Because of the conditions now existing among the Chinese students
registered in the University and on recommendation of Dr. Esson M.
Gale, Counselor to Foreign Students, the following proposals were approved, with the understanding that the financial aid referred to in
proposals 2, 3, 4, and 5 shall be acted upon by the University Committee on Student Loans after consultation in each case with Dr. Gale
(R.P., 1945-48, p. 652):
1. Those students who have obtained a degree by the end of the first semester (1948-49), be urged to avail themselves of the Embassy's offer for transportation back to China. The University can offer no assistance to such students, who
if they remain for a further degree must do so upon their own responsibility and
subject to other possible help.
2. Those "certified" students who may obtain their degrees in June, or at
latest at the end of the Summer Session, may have their tuition deferred, provided
they fail to receive their promised exchange allowance in time.
3. Self-supporting students who may be having present difficulties in securing
U. S. dollars, owing to chaotic financial conditions in China, may have their tuition
deferred, upon presentation of evidence that they would normally be in position
to secure adequate funds for their University expenses, and are likely to obtain
their remittances shortly.
4. Deferments of tuition payments will be considered for approval only after
individual personal investigation by the Counselor to Foreign Students. All
applicants shall be referred to him for recommendations.
5. Deferment of tuition shall be regarded as a University loan and the degree
earned shall be conferred or diploma released at time of repayment of the loan.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized to institute legal proceedings against the following, to recover, if
possible, accounts due the University Hospital:
Elmer E. Finch, Saranac, Michigan, and Mabel Vincent, Farmington,
M ichigan..................................................$876.39
Housten E. Whitney, 927 North Main Street, Ann Arbor..............$213.40
Kenneth  Fields,  Romulus,  Michigan...............................$111.10
James Patterson, 708 North Fifth Avenue, Ann Arbor...............$ 47.50
The request of Marvin L. Aronson, a graduate student, that he and
his wife be allowed to register as residents of Michigan was denied.
After discussing plans presented by its officers for a proposed addition to the Michigan Union, the Regents voted that the preliminary
plans for the addition to the Michigan Union be accepted in principle;
that the proper utilization of the additional space on the second floor,
presently allocated to ballroom addition, be restudied in co-operation
with the executive officers, in the light of the demand for ballroom and
public meeting space, and that the Board of Directors of the Michigan
Union be authorized to proceed with the preparation of final plans
and specifications, with the understanding that these will be submitted
to the Board of Regents at a later date (R.P., 1945-48, p. 837).
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the annual report of the Vice-President for the year ended
June 30, 1948, as filed by him, which contains the audit certificate of Ernst and
Ernst, be accepted and adopted by the Regents as the report of the Board to
the Governor of the State, and that the usual number of copies be printed.

the purpose shall be sufficient in the judgment of the Regents to establish a Chair
or Professorship in the field of Philosophy in the College of Literature, Science,

After discussion of the proposal to construct a new men's residence  Residence
hall, the Vice-President in charge of business and finance was author-  Halls
ized to take the following steps:                                  Addition

2. Negotiate with the Adelia Cheever Board of Patronesses for the
removal of the Adelia Cheever House from Madison Street to the
property on the corner of Hill Street and Haven Avenue
3. Study further the financial situation as well as the probable
construction costs
C. R. Burd:
On recommendation of the Committee on Budget Administration,     1tBurd
the Board voted extra compensation of $500, payable from the Bab-  Compensation
cock Urological Expendable fund, to Charles R. Burd, Medical Photographer in the University Hospital, because of duties performed by him
over and above those normally assigned in making a teaching motion
picture for use especially by the Department of Dermatology and
Syphilology.
At the December meeting (p. 209) the Regents adopted the aca-    cadedmic
demic calendar for 1949-50 in general, but referred to the Conference  Thanksgiving
of the President and the Deans the question whether the Thanksgiving  Iay
holiday should remain as at present or extend over the week end. It is
reported for record that the members of the Conference expressed a
preference for the present system of a one-day holiday, to be observed
both by faculty and by students. The academic calendar for 1949-50,
therefore, will show that Thanksgiving Day is designated as a one-day
holiday.
The executive officers were instructed to present to members of the  Equipment
Board at the February 26 meeting a general estimate of the cost of
providing adequate instructional equipment for all units of the University.
The Board authorized the President and the Vice-President in
charge of University relations to notify the members of the State
Legislature, if it seems advisable, that the Regents will seriously consider a drastic reduction in student enrollment unless funds can be
provided immediately for the addition of adequate equipment for all
instructional units.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to meet at 9 A.M., February 26, with the
understanding that the regular committee meetings will begin at 3:30
P.M. on February 25, at which time the Board will meet as the Committee of the Whole.

The President reported the death on February 5, 1949, of Associate       W. F.s
Patterson,
Professor Warner F. Patterson of the Department of Romance Lan-              Memoir
guages and Literatures. The following memoir was adopted for inclusion in the minutes:
Dr. Warner Forrest Patterson, Associate Professor of French, whose death
at the age of fifty-two took place on Saturday, February 5, 1949, first became
a member of our faculty in 1920. From 1942 to 1944 he served as executive
secretary and acting Chairman of the Department of Romance Languages, and
at the time of his death was associate chairman of that department, with special
responsibility for its work in French and Italian. He had received the A.B. degree
from Taylor University in 1917, that of A.M. from this University in 1922, and
from Columbia University two degrees, B.S. in 1921 and Ph.D. in 1930.
His students and colleagues have been deeply affected by Professor Patterson's
untimely death, and their sorrow and sense of loss are fully shared by the members of the Board of Regents. He had won recognition as a scholar whose studies
in the field of French poetic theory were well regarded; he had had a long and
successful experience as a teacher; and he was known to be a completely devoted.
fairminded, and thoroughgoing administrative officer within his department and
college. His career, had it not been thus terminated by early death, would
undoubtedly have continued to bring him honor and to add to the University's
prestige. The Regents of the University of Michigan, therefore, have adopted, to
be included in their official Proceedings, this memoir of their regard for the value
of Professor Patterson's services and direct that a copy thereof be transmitted
to Mrs. Patterson, together with assurances of the Regents' sincere sympathy for
her in this bereavement.
The following leaves of absence and extension of leaves of absence       Leaves of
Absence
were approved (p. 231):
Walter F. Colby, Professor of Physics, extension of leave of absence through the
second semester of the present University year, without salary, to continue
work with the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D. C. (p. 87)
Alan S. Foust, Professor of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, from February 1, 1949, to January 31, 1950, without salary, to serve as Co-ordinator
of Basic Research on Project Wizard of the Engineering Research Institute
during that period

(p. 24) was canceled, and his name was restored to the payroll for
those periods. The fellowship from the Social Science Research Council for study in Japan was not available, since scholars are not yet permitted to enter Japan. It is expected that Dr. Ward will take advantage
of the leave for the first semester of the University year 1949-50, with
the possibility that a request will be made to extend the leave through
the second semester of that year.
Degrees and    On recommendation by the proper faculty in each casa, degrees were
Certificates  conferred and certificates were granted as of February 5, 1949, as

February 23, 1949
The committee approved the following appropriations:
Department of Aeronautical Engineering, Salary account: $720 as compensation
for a secretary for the period March 1 to June 30, 1949, at the rate of
$2,200 a year, twelve-month basis, to assume some of the office duties of
Professor Emerson W. Conlon, who will be active in the Department on a halftime basis only, for the remainder of the present year
Departments in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts: $183.33 to each
of the salary budgets of the departments here indicated, to provide compensation for a secretary for the period March 1 to June 30, 1949, to be

approving an addition of $450 to the Salary account of the Department of
Mathematics, to provide extra compensation for Visiting Associate Professor Jack
R. Britton, for the second semester of the present University year, this increase
being from $1,150 to $1,600 for the period.
The committee approved the use of $150 appearing as unexpended in the
Salary budget of the School of Education because of the change in employment
status of Professor Harlan C. Koch from full time to half time (p. 226), as an
honorarium to the speaker at the Convocation of the School of Education on
March 18; and the transfer of $352 from the same salary allocation to the Salary
account of the University Elementary School, to provide compensation for a halftime typist-clerk for the second semester of the present University year.
An appropriation of $255 to the Salary account of the Department of Botany,

present fiscal year.

Social Work:     The Board discussed a proposal by the executive officers for a colaynversit  laborative plan between the University of Michigan and Wayne University in the operation of a school of social work in the city of
Detroit (p. 279). No final action was taken, but the following statement of policy was approved:
The Regents share the view that collaborative effort on the part of the
University of Michigan and Wayne University will serve useful educational purposes and the public interest. They believe that the conduct of professional training in the field of social work offers an opportunity for such collaboration. After
careful consideration of the ways and means by which this may be achieved, the
Regents conclude that they cannot share their constitutional responsibility for
the corporate control of any educational function performed in the name of the
University of Michigan. At the same time, they cannot accept a share of the
corporate control of any educational function performed in the name of another
institution. With this in mind and with full appreciation of the spirit in which
the officials of Wayne University have co-operated in the study of this matter,
the Regents authorize the executive officers of the University to continue their
search for ways and means by which an effective collaboration can be achieved
within the legal limitations here indicated.
Sabbatical    With the understanding that the reports of their sabbatical leaves
Leave
Reports  have been approved by the appropriate dean in each case and by the
Approved  Provost, the purposes of leaves to the following were approved:
Irving H. Anderson, Professor of Education (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1234)
Walter C. Sadler, Professor of Civil Engineering (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1350)
Edward T. Vincent, Professor of Mechanical Engineering (R.P., 1945-48,
p. 1258)
Shady Trails    The Vice-President in charge of business and finance reported on
D     the acquisition of Shady Trails Camp by the University          (p. 279).
A purchase agreement has been signed and, as soon as certain legal
technicalities are cleared, the gift of $66,000 from the Kresge Foundation will be made to the nonprofit corporation, and the University will
assume the outstanding mortgage, $25,650, outstanding notes payable of
$2,100, and accrued interest. Operation of the camp by the University,
with a possible capacity of ninety, was assumed March 1, 1949, and, to
date, thirty-two boys have been accepted for the summer of 1949.
University    The Vice-President in charge of business and finance reported on
Additional  the need for space to be made available to the College of Literature,
Space for  Science, and the Arts, especially office space; for the Institute of Social
Research; and for the Department of Fine Arts. There is a possibility
that all or most of the room needed by the Institute of Social Research
may be provided in the Business Administration Building. Additional
space in Tappan Hall will probably be allocated to the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts. Although the immediate razing of




MARCH MEETING, 1949                             287
University Hall is contemplated, it appears at present that it may
be necessary to retain Mason Hall and South Wing so that some of
the offices in these buildings may still be used.
The Regents discussed the preparation of the general funds budget        Budget Resolu
for 1949-50 and the summer session budget for 1949, and the following        and Summer

general funds budget for 1949-50 within a total of $18,700,000, subject to any
adjustments in trust fund income which may be realized before the final budget
is adopted, and with an unappropriated margin for emergencies.
Reso.vcd, That the Director of the Summer Session be authorized to proceed
with the preparation of the tentative budget for the Summer Session of 1949,
within an estimated total of $900,000, to cover the cost of administration, instruction, and operation.

A. L.      The President reported      the death   on Monday, February       28, of
Hawkins:
Memoir Aubrey L. Hawkins, Instructor in English. The following memoir was
approved by the Board for inclusion in the minutes of this meeting:
The death of Aubrey Leslie Hawkins, A.M., Instructor in English in the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, occurred on February 28, 1949,
after a brief illness. Mr. Hawkins, a native of the state of Indiana, was an
alumnus of Indiana University, from which he received the degrees A.B. in 1909
and M.A. in 1911, had studied also at Columbia and Harvard universities, and
had spent four years in independent research at the Bodleian Library and the
British Museum. He came to the University of Michigan in 1927 and at the
time of his death was sixty-five years of age. It was characteristic of Mr.
Hawkins, throughout his teaching career, to demand of his students the same high
standards of perfection which he required of himself, and there are today many
alumni of the University who acknowledge their debt to him for the inculcation
of habits of accurate expression none too common at the present time. Though
he was of a retiring disposition, Mr. Hawkins was known to his intimate friends
as a delightful companion, thoughtful of others and loyal to his associates. Few
indeed among his contemporaries have served the University with greater conscientiousness or with more constant faithfulness to their professional ideals. The
Regents of the University of Michigan, therefore, have adopted this memoir as
an expression of the sorrow which Mr. Hawkins' sudden death has brought to
them, and as a testimonial to the admirable qualities which he displayed as a
member of our teaching staff during the past twenty-one years.
Leave of     The following leave of absence was approved (p. 257):
Absence
AbsenceClark Tibbitts, Director of the Institute for Human Adjustment, one-third time
during the period from March 1 to June 30, 1949, without salary, to permit
him to make a special survey for the United States Public Health Service
Honorary      Dr. Frank E. Robbins reported the recommendations of the ComDegrees  mittee on Honorary Degrees. The Regents voted to confer at Commencement, June 11, 1949, the honorary degrees and a Regents' citation as recommended and also one degree in Master of Laws and two
additional Regents' citations (R.P., 1945-48, p. 1260).

MARCH MEETING, 1949


4. The decision of the Committee shall be by secret ballot. The discussion
of the candidates shall at all times be held strictly confidential, and confined to
the members of the Committee.
Mortarboard   At the request of the Mortarboard Society, the Mortarboard Loan
Scholarship
Fund  Scholarship fund, established in 1911 as a loan fund for women students, was changed to the Mortarboard Scholarship fund so that each
year, as long as the fund lasts, a scholarship may be granted to a woman
student "who has above-average scholarship, who is a participant in
activities, and who has need of financial aid." The scholarship fund
will be administered by a committee of the Mortarboard Society and
a representative of the Office of the Dean of Women, and it is understood that this fund is expendable (R.P., 1910-14, p. 288).
Louise    At the request of the Michigan alumnae of Chicago, the name of
Fairman
Scholarship the Chicago Association of University of Michigan Alumnae Scholarship was changed to the Louise Fairman Scholarship (R.P., 1917-20,
p. 456).
Ernst    The firm of Ernst and Ernst, public accountants, was appointed by
Audit by  the Board to make the audit of the accounts and records of the University of Michigan for the fiscal year 1948-49 and to render the necessary consulting services for a maximum fee of $16,500 (p. 143).
Michigan Air   The Vice-President in charge of business and finance submitted a
National
Guard report of the present activities now being carried on at Willow Run
Negotiations Airport embodying negotiations with the Michigan Air National Guard,
for the use by that unit of certain of the Airport facilities. The Board
voted that the University continue its negotiations with the Michigan
Air National Guard, looking toward an agreement which will be mutually satisfactory.
Willow Run    The President and the Vice-President in charge of business and
Right-of-Way  finance were authorized to execute a quitclaim deed to convey to the
War Assets Administrator or his successor a perpetual right-of-way and
easement over certain specified parts of Willow Run Airport. The deed
provides for the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, building,
patrol, and removal of sewer lines, water lines, electric conduit lines,
subject to the obligation of the War Assets Administrator to restore
the property to its original condition or to a condition satisfactory to
the University, and subject to the operation of the Airport for public
airport purposes. This action becomes necessary at this time because
the rights in connection with the operation of the water and sewage
disposal plant were inadvertently not reserved from the quitclaim deed
of January 15, 1947, by which the airport property was conveyed to
the University, and also because the War Assets Administrator is negotiating the sale of its water and sewage disposal plant at Willow Run
to Ypsilanti Township. A copy of the deed is filed with Exhibit Z2 of
this meeting.
Conveyance:   The Board approved the adoption of the following resolution, which
Willow Run  combines the acceptance of a conveyance of property to the Regents
Airport
Personal from the War Assets Administrator (p. 109) and the conveyance by
Property the same agency to the Regents of additional personal property consisting of kitchen and cafeteria equipment, dormitory furniture, and
other miscellaneous property itemized in Exhibit A attached to a proposed quitclaim deed. This personal property has actually been in




MARCH MEETING, 1949


313


possession of and used by the University since the Airport was first
turned over to the University, but it was inadvertently omitted from
the original conveyance.
WHEREAS, By quitclaim deed dated January 15, 1947, the United States of
America and Reconstruction Finance Corporation, acting by and through War
Assets Administrator, conveyed to The Regents of the University of Michigan
property in Wayne and Washtenaw      Counties, Michigan, commonly known as
Willow Run Airport, and
WHEREAS, The Regents subsequently, to wit, on May 20, 1948, made application to War Assets Administration for additional property in connection with
the said Willow Run Airport under the provisions of Public Law 289, 80th
Congress, and
WHEREAS, A supplemental application for additional personal property was
filed with War Assets Administration on February 16, 1949, and
WHEREAS, War Assets Administration has, by acceptance of the said applications, agreed to convey to the Regents 15.0695 acres of land in the Southwest
Quarter of Section 9, Town 3 South, Range 8 East, Van Buren Township, Wayne
County, Michigan, and also buildings no. 1, 2, 8, 15, 16, 21, 22, 25, 30, 31,
33, 34, 350, 360, 361, 361A, and 556 located on the land previously conveyed
to the Regents but reserved to the grantor, together with those items of maintenance equipment listed on Exhibit A to a proposed quitclaim deed which has
been submitted by the War Assets Administrator to the Regents for approval,
and
WHEREAS, A form of quitclaim deed prepared for execution in behalf of the
War Assets Administrator by Joseph A. Burke, Deputy Regional Director for
Real Property Disposal, War Assets Administration, Chicago, Illinois, has been
submitted to the Regents for approval,
Now Therefore, Be It Resolvcd, That the proposed quitclaim deed be and it
is hereby approved as to form and substance, and
Further Resolved, That upon execution of the said quitclaim deed in behalf
of the War Assets Administrator, R. P. Briggs, Vice-President, or Herbert
G. Watkins, Secretary, be and either hereby is authorized to accept delivery of
said deed conveying the above-described property to the Regents of the University of Michigan, and to record said deed in the Office of the Register of Deeds
for Wayne County, and
Further Resolved, That by such acceptance of delivery, the Regents of the
University of Michigan shall be committed to and bound by the reservations,
restrictions, and conditions set forth in said deed, and
Further Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to transmit one or more
copies of this resolution, fully certified by him, to the War Assets Administration.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized to clear the improvement from the property at 209 South Thayer
Street and to enlarge the existing parking facilities on the corner of
Thayer and Washington streets by the addition of this lot, which is 66
by 132 feet (p. 111).
The executive officers reported on the present inadequacy of office
and office-laboratory space for the members of the teaching staff in
some of the units, particularly in the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts. In view of all the considerations involved, the Board adopted
the following statement of policy: The Regents regret that. until additional facilities are provided for the use of departments of instruction
now seriously overcrowded, it will not be possible to set aside for the
use of retired members of the faculty additional office or office-laboratory space which could otherwise be used by active members of the
staff.
The Regents voted that the petition of Irvin F. Fieber, of Grand
Rapids, for permission to register in the University as a resident of
Michigan be granted.

M. M. Peet:      The President filed for record a memoir adopted by the Executive
Memoirs  Faculty of the Medical School on April 5, 1949, following the death
of Dr. Max Minor Peet on March 25, 1949.
The Regents adopted the following memoir on the late Dr. Max
Minor Peet:
The Regents of the University hereby record their sorrow and their sense of
loss, occasioned by the untimely death on March 25, 1949, of Dr. Max Minor
Peet, Irofessor of Surgery in the Medical School. A native of Michigan, a graduate
of this University irom which he had received the degrees of A.B. in 1908, and
A.M. and M.D. in 1910, Dr. Peet had achieved international distinction by his
skill in neurosurgery and in particular by the advances he had made in the
surgical treatment of hypertension. The amount of good he did in the course of
his life, by the alleviation of suffering and the restoration of hope and usefulness
to the afflicted, and by the instruction of others in the profession in which he
himself was a leader, is incalculable. Incalculable, too, is the personal loss which
the entire University community, Regents, faculty members, officers, students and
alumni, has suffered through the sudden passing of one who was so friendly and
helpful in all his personal relationships and so highly respected for his attainments and the integrity of his character. He was the recipient of many honors
at home and abroad; the history of our own Medical School will forever list his
name among those who contributed most to its fame and success. To Dr. Peet's
surviving family the Regents send all their sympathy, and they direct that this
memoir shall be incorporated in their official records.
H. M. Bates:     The following memoir on the late Deain Emeritus Henry M. Bates,
Memoir   who died April 15, 1949, was approved:
The death of Henry Moore Bates, Dean Emeritus of the Law School, has
removed a distinguished officer and teacher, to whom the University of Michigan
stands indebted for no small share of the prestige which it enjoys at the present
time. As Tappan Professor of Law from 1903, and Dean of the Law School from
1910 until his retirement in 1939, Dean Bates's efforts were constantly directed
toward the improvement of legal instruction and the raising of professional
standards in the practice of the law. While the results of his exertions are to be
seen in the high level of achievement attained by our own Law School, his influence
was also widely felt through the American Bar Association,, of which he was a
prominent and active member, and the Association of American Law Schools, which
he served as president in 1912-13. In addition to the recognition which came to
him as an administrator, Dean Bates was widely known as a profound scholar




APRIL MEETING, 1949

in the field of constitutional law and as one of the great teachers of this subject.
It was, furthermore, characteristic of him throughout his long and honorable
career to feel a genuine and a keen interest in the students of his School, not only
during the period of their enrollment but after they had entered active legal
practice, and this same concern for the welfare of Michigan students led him to
take an effective part in the establishment of the Michigan Union and the provision of its present facilities. The circle of his friends, among the faculty and the
alumni body of this University and in the legal profession throughout the country,
is a wide one. They, together with the Regents of the University of Michigan, will
sorrow at the loss of a vigorous and universally respected leader, whose contributions to the causes he espoused will be a lasting monument to his memory.
The Regents adopted the following memoir on the death of Chase           c. s. Osborn:
S. Osborn, former Governor of the State and a Regent of the Uni-             Memoir
versity (p. 317):
In mourning the death of Chase Salmon Osborn, and in recognizing the greatness of his character and of his services to this State, the Regents of the University of Michigan act in unison with every thoughtful citizen. Governor Osborn
was a Regent of this University from July, 1908, to January, 1911, and since
that time has been its generous benefactor and on many occasions its sage counselor. He was a vigorous and enlightened Governor of the State. He was a leader
in the develcpment of natural resources, an author, a journalist, and a proponent
of many measures for the public or the common good. As in these later years he
lived in his well-loved homes on Duck Island and at Poulan, Georgia, he seemed
in every true sense of the phrase to be an elder statesman, whose words and
appearances were greeted with reverence. In token, therefore, of their great respect
for the late Chase Salmon Osborn and their sorrow for his death on April 11,
1949, the Regents of the University of Michigan have adopted this memoir as a
plart of the permanent record of their official Procccdings, and direct that it also
be communicated to the surviving members of Governor Osborn's family.
The following leaves of absence and an extension          of leave of    Leaves of
absence were approved (p. 308):

of this meeting (p. 117): 
Richard Dennis Teall Hollister, Associate Professor of Speech, reached his
seventieth birthday on October 26, 1948, and thereby became eligible for retirement under the provisions of the "Bylaws" of the University. The Regents of the
University of Michigan take this opportunity to congratulate Professor Hollister
upon his long and fruitful career as a member of the faculty of the University.
A graduate of Michigan in the class of 1902 he became in 1899 assistant to the
Curator of the Museum of Zoology, but in 1902 turned from zoology to the
subject which was to constitute his life's work, public speaking, and after a brief
service as an assistant and a year of teaching at the Michigan Military Academy
became an instructor in elocution and oratory in 1904. During the following
forty-four years Dr. Hollister has continued as a devoted and inspiring teacher
in the Department of Speech, constantly and effectively engaging in important
activities closely allied with the work of the Department, such as the training of
debaters, the staging of plays, the administration of the Oratorical Association,
and the creation of the Trueblood Fellowship Fund. The Regents feel deeply
grateful to Dr. Hollister for the fine spirit which he has exhibited at all times
as a member of our faculty and for the great good which he has accomplished as

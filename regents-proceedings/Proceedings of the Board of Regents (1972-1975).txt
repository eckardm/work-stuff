Board incontrol  Regent Waters moved that Connie Dunlap, Warren Palmer,
of Intercollegiate 
Athletics and Walter Kell be named to the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics. The motion was seconded by Regent Paul Brown.
Regent Robert Brown amended the motion, nominating Wilbert
McKeachie to the Board in place of Professor Palmer. Regent
Cudlip seconded the amendment. The amendment was defeated.
The vote on the motion passed, with Regent Robert Brown
abstaining.
Regent Lindemer then moved that Rose Sue Berstein and
John McKenzie be appointed student members of the Board in
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, Miss Berstein for a term
ending June 30, 1973, and Mr. McKenzie for a term ending
June 30, 1974.
President Fleming said there was some question as to the need
for appointing Miss Berstein, since she had been duly elected
under the old bylaw and her term had another year to run. In any
event, he felt, this action should clarify the situation.
Regent Lindemer's motion was seconded by Regent Cudlip
and passed unanimously.
Court of Appeals  Regent Lindemer then moved that the faculty and student
Panels panels for the University Court of Appeals be adopted as revised.
The motion was seconded by Regent Huebner and passed.

Regent Dunn commented that he was disappointed that the
list from SACUA did not contain more women and more minority
representatives. He indicated, and Regent Lindemer concurred,
that the same criticism could be made of the list of student nominees. It is hoped that in any further lists like this, the organizations responsible will see that such representation is not ignored.
President Fleming stated that he had asked the faculty nominating committee to review their list for this very reason. They
had responded that their efforts to encourage women and minorities to express an interest in serving on the Court of Appeals
had met with no success.

Regent Lindemer asked Chancellor Moran if the twenty-three
terminations listed for the UM-Flint in the summary report of
terminations were anything out of the ordinary. Chancellor Moran
replied that they did not represent an unusual turnover, that the
Flint Campus relied heavily on part-time appointments of this
type.
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of eleven members
of the faculty. The following memoirs were adopted:
Marston Bates, the eminent cultural biologist who has served as Pro-  Marston Bates
fessor of Zoology here for the past twenty years, is retiring from the active  Retirement
faculty because of ill health at the age of sixty-five.                 Memoir
A native of Grand Rapids, Professor Bates moved to Florida as a boy
and was graduated from the University of Florida in 1927. After serving for
a period as an entomologist for the United Fruit Company, he entered graduate school at Harvard, where he earned his doctorate in 1934. During seventeen subsequent years, he was associated with the Rockefeller Foundation,
chiefly its International Health Division. His research into disease-carrying
mosquitoes, on which he became an international authority, carried him to
Albania, Egypt, and Colombia. His own catholic interests, meanwhile, led
him to explore also the more general bearings of biological science upon
human life, and when he came to the University in 1952, it was to direct
research and instruction bridging the gap between the natural sciences and
the social.
Professor Bates loyally performed the yeoman services required by his
Department and College. Remaining nonetheless a national figure and a
citizen of the world, he responded to calls from the National Science Foundation, the Navy, and the Interior Department; from the University of California and Wesleyan University, and, for a long and fruitful year, the University of Puerto Rico; and from a host of other societies and agencies, public
and private, professional and educational. He has lectured under the auspices
of Sigma Xi and Phi Beta Kappa and many individual universities and
colleges. His books, which range in their topics from closely technical to
broadly discursive, have been translated into thirteen languages and are at
once respected by scientists and enjoyed by the thoughtful laity. He has been
elected to the National Academy of Arts and the World Academy of Arts and




14


JULY MEETING, 1972


Sciences. In 1968, the University fittingly granted him a Distinguished Faculty
Achievement Award.
Professor Bates' presence here has conferred honor on the University.
His colleagues and students have admired him both for his keen and comprehensive mind and for his personal flair. The Regents of the University,
deeply regretting his incapacity, extend to him a special meed of thanks and
praise as they name him Professor Emeritus of Zoology.
P. S. Dwyer    Paul Sumner Dwyer, statistician and for thirty-five years a member of
Retirement the mathematics faculty, completed his retirement furlough in June, 1972,
and is eligible for an emeritus appointment.
A native Pennsylvanian, Professor Dwyer earned his baccalaureate from
Allegheny College in 1921 and a subsequent master's degree from Pennsylvania State College, where he taught mathematics for five years. During the
next decade, he taught at Antioch College while pursuing his own graduate
studies at Chicago and at Michigan. Upon earning his doctorate here in
1936, he joined the staff of the Vice-President in Charge of Educational Investigations as a research assistant. In the next year he was appointed also
to the mathematics faculty. In 1946 he was advanced to a professorship in
mathematics, and his concurrent research appointment was transferred to
the newly created Statistical Research Laboratory. In recent years he has
been director of that Laboratory and has held a professorial appointment in
the new Department of Statistics.
Professor Dwyer was one faculty member who was never prompted to
change with the times: the times were changing with him. His book Linear
Computations and the theorems and techniques he helped devise, such as the
Dwyer-Doolittle Technique for Computer Operations, placed him in the
forefront of the current technical revolution. His special skills, bearing upon
both research and record-keeping, proved directly useful to these functions
within the University and vital to the interests of many individual students
and colleagues. Possessing enthusiasm and sympathy as well as expertness, he
imbued an intrinsically impersonal subject matter with his own humane
concern. In 1958 the University conferred its Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award upon him.
The University is abidingly grateful to Professor Dwyer for his able and
earnest ministry. As they appoint him Professor Emeritus of Statistics, the
Regents would further pay him the peculiarly affectionate tribute due to
one of those rare persons who are at once genuinely distinguished and genuinely unassuming.


G. H. Forsyth, Jr.,
Retirement
Memoir


George Howard Forsyth, Jr., who has pursued uniquely significant research into Byzantine and early Christian archaeology and architecture,
retired from the active faculty at the end of June.
Professor Forsyth was born in Highland Park, Illinois, in 1901, was
schooled at the Chicago Latin School and Lawrenceville School, and earned
Bachelor of Arts and Master of Fine Arts degrees from Princeton University
in 1923 and 1927, respectively. He served on the Princeton faculty until the
Second World War; subsequently he assisted the United States Geological
Survey in photomapping and held research grants from the Institute for
Advanced Study at Princeton and the Rockefeller Foundation. Coming to
The University of Michigan as a visiting professor in 1946, he became Professor and Chairman of the Department of Fine Arts (now History of Art)
in the following year. The University appointed him Director of the Kelsey
Museum in 1961 and conferred on him the special title Research Professor
of Archaeology in 1969.
Professor Forsyth had carried out excavations at the Church of St.
Martin in Angers, France, while at Princeton. As a member of the faculty
here, he directed expeditions throughout the Near East, to Syria and Libya
specifically, and to St. Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai, where a joint




JULY MEETING, 1972


15


team from Michigan, Princeton, and the University of Alexandria in Egypt
examined and made available to the scholarly world a record of art and
culture extending over nearly fifteen hundred years. The past several years
he has devoted chiefly to review and publication of this material.
Professor Forsyth brought honor to this institution by his skillful and
energetic leadership in field research and by his expert and sensitive description and interpretation of architectural history. The Regents of the University
are grateful to him as well for his capable intramural services. As they appoint
him Professor Emeritus of the History of Art and Research Professor Emeritus in Archaeology, they take satisfaction in his continued vigor and anticipate for him a long and fruitful retirement.
Keith Willis Hall, talented engineering designer and Professor of Me-   K. W. Hall
chanical Engineering, has been granted permission formally to retire from the  Retirement
active faculty at the age of sixty-two.
Professor Hall was born and schooled in Blissfield, Michigan, but earned
his engineering degree from the University of Alabama in 1933. He then
associated himself for sixteen years with the Toledo Scale Company and its
subsidiary, the Defiance Machine Works; during two of those years he
worked in the Department of Engineering Research at the University. Joining the faculty of the Engineering College as an Assistant Professor in 1949,
he was advanced to Associate Professor in 1952 and to Professor in 1958.
For a sustained period, from early 1963 to mid-1967, he represented the University at a USAID project in Brazil.
When he came to the University, Professor Hall already held some dozen
patents, and to these he continued to add. He helped extend the curriculum
in engineering design here, taught in it capably and conscientiously, and established a close and effectual rapport with students in formal and informal
counseling. The presence of so creative a faculty member was intrinsically
heartening to his Department and College; his sound technical knowledge,
united with his creative flair, lent him authority as an educator in his field.
His humane sympathy, visible here and preeminently during his years in
Brazil, completed the equation.
The Regents of the University salute this gifted and worthy man, both
gratefully and respectfully, as they name him Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering. They trust that he will long retain his University associations and partake of all the privileges accorded the emeritus rank.
Harold Wilfred Held, who has taught continuously at the Dental School   H. W. Held
since 1938, has attained the age of seventy and retired from the active faculty.  Retirement
Born and schooled in Fremont, Ohio, Dr. Held attended Bowling Green
State College and was graduated from Western Michigan College. For eight
subsequent years, he taught industrial arts in the Ann Arbor Public Schools
and concurrently attended Columbia University, where he earned a Master
of Arts degree. Then, in 1934, he enrolled in the Michigan Dental School,
was graduated in course in 1937, and set up a private practice in Ann Arbor.
In the next year he began to assist in the Dental Clinic. Appointed an instructor in the year after that, he rose through the several ranks to a professorship in 1963. During the Second World War and the enrollment bulge
which followed, he lent timely aid in the Health Service.
Over the year, Dr. Held taught basic technics, dental anatomy, and
other subjects-to dental students and also to hygienists, for whom he prepared text materials in anatomy. Being at once genial and efficient, he further
presided capably and tactfully over systems of arrangement and recordkeeping at the Dental Clinic-patients, students, and staff all profiting from
his conscientious management and courteous consultation. It was characteristic of him that he further devoted much time and concern to civic and
charitable good works in the town.




16


JULY MEETING, 1972


His peers and many generations of students remember him with affectionate gratitude. The Regents of the University, too, thank this warmly
endeared man for his long devotion and invite him to retain his University
contacts as Professor Emeritus of Dentistry, a title herewith conferred.
George Katona     George Katona, who has made the survey of consumer attitudes a major
Retiremeont  factor in economic analyses, retired from the University faculty at the end
of June at the statutory age of seventy.
A native of Budapest, Professor Katona moved to Germany after the
First World War and earned a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of
Goettingen at the tender age of nineteen. Reflecting on the hysteria attending
the disastrous inflation of 1923, he then recorded for the first time an opinion
that was to revisit him often: namely, that mental states act significantly
upon the economy. He later gained experience in economic journalism on a
liberal Democratic weekly, The German Economist. In 1933, together with
some of his editorial colleagues, he emigrated to New York to escape the
rising despotism in Germany.
In the United States, Professor Katona supplied financial information to
clients in Europe, lectured in the New School for Social Research, wrote a
book-length study (Organizing and Memorizing, an essay in Gestalt psychology), and at length, in 1942, published a book on psychological factors
in the war economy that acquainted him with Rensis Likert. Joining Likert's
survey group in Washington, he took part in the first two Surveys of Consumer Finances and in the Great March of social scientists from Washington
to Ann Arbor, which brought the Survey Research Center into being here
in 1946.
His subsequent accomplishments have become a part of general knowledge as his successive reports on consumer sentiment have accumulated in
the public consciousness. He has contributed both to the methodology and
the theory of social science, delineating with a special care and precision the
place of psychological inquiry in the science of economics. The sincerest form
of flattery-imitation-has been widely accorded him. Professional societies
and universities, here and abroad, have acclaimed Professor Katona and his
books. He has been honored with visiting professorships and lectureships.
The University has granted him its own Distinguished Faculty Achievement
Award. Finally, though he has become a kind of institution in government,
business, and academic circles, he has conserved a certain old-world privacy,
informing his research with a lively personal intelligence and remaining alert
to the considerations of value which, as a scientist, he has schooled himself
to disregard.
His colleagues on campus are abidingly grateful to him for his creative
example and his inspiring leadership in the Survey Research Center. The
Regents of the University, as they appoint him Professor Emeritus of Economics and of Psychology, tender him their own special thanks and cordially
invite him to lend this institution his continued presence.
J. A. Lewis    James A. Lewis, Professor of Education and former Vice-President for
Retirement Student Affairs, has completed his retirement furlough and is retiring from
Memoir the active faculty at the age of sixty-seven.
Professor Lewis was born and schooled in Owosso, attended Michigan
State, and earned his baccalaureate from Central Michigan. His subsequent
involvement in state education proved unusually diverse. He taught school
in Cass City and Dowagiac, served as elementary school and high school
principal in the latter city, earned a master's degree from the University in
1938, and then returned to Dowagiac as Superintendent of Schools. Serving
later as school superintendent in St. Joseph and in Dearborn, he came to the
University at the end of 1953 as Director of the Bureau of School Services.
In the following year he was appointed to the newly created post of Vice



JULY MEETING, 1972


17


President for Student Affairs. Awarded a Doctor of Education degree from
Harvard University in 1956, he was in the same year appointed Professor of
Education here. At the end of 1964, he retired from the vice-presidency to
devote himself full time to the School of Education.
As principal administrative officer for student affairs, Professor Lewis
dealt with early phases of the demand for accelerated change, reckoning
genially and flexibly with pressures like those for relaxing dormitory rules
and for eliminating ethnic uniformity in student associations. He concurrently oversaw, in a fostering spirit, an agglomeration of University functions not always clearly rationalized or organically related. In the School of
Education, his long practical experience in a diversity of school offices lent
authority and scope to his teaching and his counsel.
Professor Lewis' good humor and forbearance notably assisted this institution during a period of difficult transitions. The University Regents bid
him cordial thanks and Godspeed as they confer on him the title for which
he has now become eligible, Professor Emeritus of Education.
F. Percival Price, international authority on campanology and Univer-  F. P. Price
sity Carillonneur since 1939, is relinquishing his active faculty status at the  Retirement
age of seventy.
Having been musically precocious during his early life, Professor Price
entered upon his special calling at the tender age of twenty, when a carillon
was installed in the Toronto church in which he was studying organ. He
later earned a baccalaureate in music from the University of Toronto, became
the first non-European Diplomate of the Carillon School of Malines in
Belgium, and undertook advanced studies in music-with excursions into a
side interest, architecture-in New York, London, and a number of cities on
the European Continent. Gaining additional experience in performance at
the Rockefeller Memorial Carillon in New York, he was for twelve years
Dominion Carillonneur at the Houses of Parliament in Ottawa, Canada.
Then, in 1939, he was attracted to Ann Arbor to preside over the new
Charles A. Baird Carillon. On the strength of his compositions, for one of
which he had won a 1934 Pulitzer Prize, he was given also the title Professor
of Composition.
Professor Price has given guest recitals in many cities of Europe and
North America and in Israel as well. His compositions for carillon include
over one hundred original works, and his arrangements of existing works
number some fourteen hundred. His research, which he has assiduously pursued wherever there are carillons, has issued in the classic work on campanology. An additional book records his part in finding and restoring historic
European bells after World War II. The Guild of Carillonneurs in North
America, of which he is cofounder and past president, paid him special tribute
in 1962 for his forty-year role in advancing the cause of carillon music on
this continent.
The members of the University community have liberally benefited, for
more than thirty years, from Percival Price's unique ministry. On their behalf, the Regents now most affectionately thank him. And they trust that as
Professor Emeritus of Campanology, a title now conferred, he will continue
his scholarship and extend further a knowledge and understanding of the
delightful sound of bells.
Harry Albert Towsley, pediatrician and Chairman of the Department of  H. A. Towsley
Postgraduate Medicine, is retiring from the medical faculty after forty-seven  Retirement
years of continuous association with the University.                      Memoir
Born in Midland in 1905, Dr. Towsley studied at Kalamazoo College and
Michigan State and then entered the combined premedical and medical curriculum at the University, earning his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1931. He
served as intern and pediatrics resident here, joined the staff as Instructor in




18


JULY MEETING, 1972


Ped'atrics in 1934, and rose through the intervening ranks to a professorship
in 1954. In 1948 he began also to assist in the extramural activities in postgraduate medicine. In 1967 he became Chairman of that Department. From
1942 to 1945 he served as major and lieutenant colonel in the Army Medical
Corps.
In the best tradition of the medical educator, Dr. Towsley has cherished
the concurrent ideals of enhancing the technical capabilities of physicians
and of making the best medical service more widely available. He has both
administered the postgraduate courses in Ann Arbor and brought such
cours-s to key locations throughout the state. He himself planned facilities
for perfecting his purposes, furthermore, and led campaigns to raise funds
for them. In 1969, when the new Mott Children's Hospital and the Towsley
Center for Continuing Medical Education were opened, his dreams were
effectually realized. He and his wife had personally contributed a substantial
portion of the funds for the latter facility. Since then he has embraced, with
his characteristic energy and dedication, a campaign for a new study center
which will make advanced technical resources available for medical education at the University.
Dr. Towsley has presided over the Washtenaw County Medical Society,
the Michigan Foundation for Medical and Health Education, the Michigan
Health Council, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, and also the
Board of the Michigan United Fund. Despite these pressures of professional
and civic service, he had still found time to take part in major councils of
the Medical Center and of the University faculty and alumni. The record of
his accomplishments during the last decade of his tenure is truly astonishing
in its scope.
His professional colleagues extend to him their heartfelt gratitude as he
formally retires from the active faculty-the more happily because they anticipate his continued presence and counsel. And the University Regents,
speaking for the institution at large, tender him their own abiding thanks
for his generosity and long devotion as they name him Professor Emeritus of
Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases and of Postgraduate Medicine.


R. W. Waggoner
Retirement
Memoir


Raymond Walter Waggoner, the wise and kindly physician who served
as chairman of the Department of Psychiatry for thirty-three years, has now
formally retired from the active medical faculty.
A native of Carson City, Michigan, Dr. Waggoner enrolled in a premedical curriculum here in 1919 and earned his medical degree in 1924. For
his residency and for further special study, he went to Philadelphia, where
he earned a Doctor of Science degree in neuropsychiatry from the University
of Pennsylvania. Returning to Michigan in 1929 as Assistant Professor of
Neurology, he was promoted to Associate Professor in 1932; at the end of
1936, while on sabbatical leave in London, he was recalled to Ann Arbor to
assume charge of the Psychiatry Department and of the State Psychopathic
Hospital (now the Neuropsychiatric Institute) following the sudden death
of the Hospital's founder, the late Dr. Albert Barrett. Relinquishing his
chairmanship in 1970, he has since participated regularly in the work of the
Reproductive Biology Research Foundation of St. Louis, Missouri. During
his retirement furlough, he was named director of continuing education for
that Foundation.
Dr. Waggoner significantly developed and diversified the programs and
facilities in psychiatry here-these including the Veterans' Readjustment
Center, the Mental Health Research Institute, and a special adolescent unit
within the Neuropsychiatric Institute. Himself possessing a solid background
in neurology, he fostered interdisciplinary training within the Medical Center
and helped to integrate his specialty into the total complex of the physician's
science and art. He was, finally, an astute and responsible observer and critic
of the social role of medical and psychiatric practice.




JULY MEETING, 1972

Dri. Waggoner has served as president of the American College of Psychiatrists and of the American Psychiatric Association. He will be admiringly
remembered by his local colleagues and by his former trainees throughout
the nation for his union of technical proficiency and humane balance. The
University, which has earlier bestowed on him a Distinguished Faculty
Achievement Award, now tenders him a most cordial gratitude as it appoints
him Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry, and the University Regents offer him
a special, personal thanks and praise.
Corwin Robert Wright of the School of Dentistry concluded forty-three  C. R. Wright
years on the active faculty this past month and is entering upon his formal  Retiree
retirement.
Born in Detroit in 1906, Dr. Wright came to the University in 1924 and
completed his studies toward his dental degree in 1929. He joined the faculty
that fall as Instructor in Dentistry and rose through the intervening ranks
to a professorship in 1952, with specialization in full denture prosthesis. During the nineteen-thirties he extended his own studies, earning a master's degree in 1937.
Dr. Wright assumed the burden of undergraduate teaching in his specialty
when the demand for instruction burgeoned in 1946, and he has since supplied graduate and postgraduate instruction as well. In 1963 he assumed
charge of the program of complete denture prosthesis. His research has
treated oral physiology, morphology, and pathology, as these are related to
denture prosthesis. Skillful in his presentations to his students, he ably publicized also the fruits of his basic and clinical research, being invited to lecture
and show his illustrative films in many parts of the United States. In addition, he distilled this material into a text, of which the topic might for
present purposes be summarized in laymen's language: the physiology of
chewing and what this means to people with false teeth. He actively participated, finally, in School committees treating of present and prospective programs and facilities.
His colleagues in the Dental School are deeply indebted to this singleminded and devoted educator and scientist for his most gracious and most
faithful service. And the Regents of the University, who now appoint Dr.
Wright Professor Emeritus of Dentistry, express to him their own personal
gratitude and honor.

Two off-campus assignments and five leaves of absence were        Leaves of
reported to the Regents.                                              Absence
On recommendation of the Dean of the School of Natural
Resources endorsed by Vice-President Smith, the Regents approved a sabbatical leave with full salary for the 1973 winter term
for Richard D. Duke, Professor of Regional Planning, although
Professor Duke will not have accumulated the required six years
of service by that time (R.P., 1966-69, p. 912). The leave was
granted with the understanding that Professor Duke will not
again become eligible for sabbatical leave until he has completed
seven years of service after his return to duty from this leave.




20


JULY MEETING, 1972


The following extensions of leaves of absence without salary
for the 1972-73 University year were granted:
Richard E. Balzhiser, Professor of Chemical Engineering
Lloyd E. Brownell, Professor of Chemical Engineering
Bruce B. Cork, Professor of Physics without tenure
Roger C. Cramton, Professor of Law
Harry F. Gollob, Associate Professor of Psychology
Frank R. Kennedy, Professor of Law
Richard H. Solomon, Associate Professor of Political Science
John Waterbury, Assistant Professor of Political Science.
IX. DEGREES
Degree Lists  On recommendation of the Associate Dean of the Graduate
School the Regents removed from the December 1969 Master of
Arts degree list the name of Judith Mary Jesse, B.S.Ed., and
added to the August 1971 Master of Arts list the name of David
Eugene Schoonover, B.S., University of Texas.
On recommendation of the Assistant Registrar endorsed by
Vice-President Smith the May 1972 School of Education degree
list was amended to show that Carol R. Shuster received the
Bachelor of Science in Education with Distinction and that
Rhonda Rosenberg received the Bachelor of Arts in Education
with Distinction. The following corrections of misspelled names
in the School of Education degree lists were recorded: in the
December 1971 list Thomas Joseph Petitpren (misspelled Petipren) received the Bachelor of Science in Education with Distinction and Ann-Margret Gunilla Ulrich (misspelled Ann-Margaret)
received the Bachelor of Arts in Education; in the May 1972 list
Candace Lee Petrick (misspelled Patrick) received the Bachelor
of Arts in Education.
Degrees   On recommendation of the faculty of the Law School the
Conrmed Regents confirmed the conferring of degrees as of May 13, 1972,
on those completing the prescribed course of study on that date.
The list appears as Appendix A to these minutes.
Honorary Degree  The Regents approved the recommendation of the Committee
Approved
pp on Honorary Degrees for the awarding of the Doctor of Laws
degree to the speaker at the August 20, 1972, Summer Commencement Exercises.
X. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Budget for  Vice-President Smith presented a detailed analysis of the
1972-73 Adopted operating budget for 1972-73 for the Ann Arbor campus. He noted
in his presentation these points in particular: that the allocations
authorized by the budget exceeded anticipated revenues and that
this difference would be made up during the year by requiring all




JULY MEETING, 1972


21


units to accumulate savings amounting to one percent of their
budgets. He noted that it would likely also be necessary to freeze
certain accounts during the year to ensure that we stay within
our anticipated revenues. He noted that the budget calls for increased allocations of $1,850,000 for student aid and an additional
$167,000 for the supportive services program. He noted that the
proposed compensation program totaling $5,225,000 had been
discussed with the Committee on Budget Administration and
the Committee on Budget Priorities as well as the Academic
Affairs Advisory Council. The compensation program anticipates
a continuation of the University's efforts to achieve equity in
women's salaries and also provides for certain special adjustments
in the various units which could not be anticipated or provided for
through the regular compensation program. The total available
monies then amounted to approximately a 4.3 percent increase of
our existing salary base spread over a twelve-month period.
It is recommended that these salary monies be allocated over a
ten-month period, making an average rate increase of 5.2 percent.
This provides a much better increase in salary rates. Salary increases therefore would become effective with the September pay
period rather than on July 1, as has been customary. One of the
major reasons for making this recommendation stems from the
fact that the legislature does not act on higher education appropriations soon enough so that reasoned decisions can be made in
June on expenditures for the year, since we lack definite knowledge then of what our resources are going to be. By moving to
a September 1 effective date for salary increases, better decisions
on allocations can be made, since by then exact resources are
known. Whether or not this becomes a permanent practice is
frankly dependent upon the timing of the legislative process.
That decision will have to be made annually.
Regent Lindemer then moved adoption of the operating budget
for 1972-73 for the Ann Arbor campus and the student fee
schedules submitted to the Regents at the April meeting (R.P.,
1969-72, p. 1453). The motion was seconded by Regent Huebner
and adopted unanimously.
Regent Dunn moved adoption of the operating budgets for
1972-73 for the UM-Dearborn and the UM-Flint. The motion
was seconded by Regent Huebner and adopted unanimously.
Vice-President Norman then reviewed the various steps that Willow Run
were under way to accomplish separation of the Willow Run  aa
Laboratories from the University. One of the steps was the
formal transfer of title on the equipment now at Willow Run from
the University to the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, a Michigan nonprofit corporation established "in order to
provide for the orderly total separation of the Willow Run research facilities from the University."




22


JULY MEETING, 1972


Regent Cudlip moved that the recommendation for the transfer
of equipment and for the transfer of contracts to the new corporation be approved. The motion was seconded by Regent
Huebner and passed unanimously.
Regent Nederlander commented that he felt that the officers
of the University and others should be commended for the very
great effort put forth in accomplishing the separation of the Willow
Run Laboratories from the University. He noted that the University's critics in this area ought to be convinced now of the
University's sincerity in making this move.
Property Sale  The Regents approved the recommendation of Vice-President
Pierpont that the property in Oregon, Ohio, received from the
estate of Leger J. Metzger be sold.
Bentley Historical  On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents
rary authorized awarding of the contract for construction of the Bentley
Historical Library Building to the low bidder, R. T. Mitchell
Construction Co., of Ann Arbor, and adopting the project funding
as outlined by Mr. Pierpont.
Architecture  Vice-President Pierpont indicated that construction bids for
Bailding the Architecture and Design Building will be received in early
August and, if they are within the funds available for the project,
he will write to the Regents and advise them of the bids, the project budget, and the funds available for the project, all for approval by the Regents by mail.
Zeta Beta Tau  Vice-President Pierpont reviewed the circumstances leading
House Purchase
up to his recommendation for purchase and renovation of the
property currently owned by Zeta Beta Tau fraternity for use
by the School of Music. He indicated that the representatives of
the fraternity had indicated their willingness to accept an offer
by the University.
Regent Cudlip moved that the purchasing and renovation
recommendations be adopted. Regent Robert Brown seconded the
motion and the recommendation was approved.
Regent Nederlander abstained from the discussion and vote.
Band Rehearsal  Vice-President Pierpont then reviewed his recommendation
Hall concerning the location and construction of the proposed Band
Rehearsal Hall.
Regent Robert Brown asked whether the location indicated
would conflict with possible expansion of the Intramural Building.
Mr. Pierpont noted that intramural facilities were in much
greater need elsewhere on campus and he foresaw no possibility
of the expansion of the athletic facilities in the area.




JULY MEETING, 1972


23


Regent Lindemer then moved that the recommendation to
locate and construct the Band Rehearsal Hall be approved and
that the Hall be named in honor of William D. Revelli. The
motion was seconded by Regent Huebner and adopted unanimously.
Vice-President Pierpont reviewed his recommendation for the Trotter House
purchase of property for the Trotter House Program.
Regent Robert Brown inquired as to whether the recommended location was desirable in that it seemed more remote
from the campus than the original Trotter House.
Vice-President Johnson indicated his view that the location
on Washtenaw Avenue is most desirable and, all things considered,
provides the best location among the several alternatives that had
been considered.
In connection with the discussion of the property purchase,
Vice-President Johnson indicated his thoughts with regard to
alternative living proposals.
Vice-President Smith reviewed the budgeting aspects of the
alternative living proposals. As a result of this discussion a detailed review of the alternative living proposals was suggested and
was included in the REPORTS section of these minutes (p. 2).
Regent Dunn moved that the property acquisition recommended be approved and that renovations be authorized. Regent
Huebner seconded the motion and it passed unanimously.
On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents Retirement Pi
authorized the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association
(TIAA)-College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF) Retirement
Plan in place of the current Employees' Retirement Plan, including
the transfer of past service benefits. The Regents authorized any
two of the following-the President, the Vice-President and Chief
Financial Officer, the Secretary, and the Investment Officer-to
sell or transfer the securities in the Employees' Retirement Fund
and purchase benefits from TIAA-CREF for each employee with
the value of his/her share of the proceeds.
XI. OTHER
Approval was given for the Institute for the Study of Mental Organization
Retardation and Related Disabilities to become a member of the  Membership
Association of University Affiliated Facilities. Regent Lindemer
voted no.
On recommendation of the Dean of the College of Pharmacy  Pharmacy Deg:
endorsed by Vice-President Smith the Regents approved a four- Program
year degree program in the College leading to the degree Bachelor
of Science, without qualifying designation.

JULY MEETING, 1972


Bylaws Revision   Regent Cudlip, in connection with the discussion of the new
C hapter II of the Bylaws, made the following statement:
I suggest the following with respect to the method of handling the
additions to Chapter II:
A motion that Chapter II of the existing Bylaws be repealed and in
its place the proposed Chapter II be adopted.
Because of the great number of references to the University's executive
officers, etc., in the existing Bylaws, I would suggest the elimination of
references in the proposal to sections of the existing Bylaws. Those that are
now included are certainly incomplete.
In this connection, I think legal counsel for the University should carefully examine the existing Bylaws so that there can be prepared a crosssection schedule. This schedule need not be a part of the Bylaws, but it
certainly would be helpful in interpreting the powers and duties of the
officers and committees as contained in proposed and existing Bylaws.
It appears to me that, when speaking of the two chancellors, changes
are needed in present Section 11.03 and present Section 11.07.
I think Section 2.05 might read as follows: "The Vice-President and
Chief Financial Officer is the chief financial officer of the University. Except
as otherwise specifically provided, he shall have general supervision of the
finances, property, and business of the University. He shall be the chief
adviser of the President on financial matters." I note that in connection
with this section, there is an elimination of the word "responsibility," which
appears in Section 3.01.
I would suggest that the substance of the proposed Bylaws is proper,
but in order to provide for correlation I think that a new Section 2.16
should be adopted to read as follows: "The powers and duties of the officers
and committees conferred upon them by the provisions of existing Bylaws
shall be in addition to the powers and duties conferred upon them by the
provisions of this Chapter II.
"Any existing Bylaw which is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Chapter II is hereby expressly repealed."
Regent Dunn stated that in view of the concerns expressed
by Regent Cudlip he would move that action on Chapter II be
tabled and that the matter of the Bylaws revision be referred to
the Office of the General Counsel for clarification and final recommendation.
Regent Nederlander seconded the motion.
Regent Robert Brown said that there were many other sections
of the Bylaws that would need similar attention and it was his
hope that Regent Dunn would broaden his recommendation to
include a complete review of all the Bylaws.
Regent Dunn agreed that it was his understanding that all
Bylaws now be referred for revision and clarification to the Office
of the General Counsel.
The motion was adopted unanimously.
Bylaws Sec. 11.12  On recommendation of the Associate Dean of the Medical
Revised School endorsed by Vice-President Smith the Regents approved
the folowing revision of Sec.11.12 The Medical School-The Executive Faculty of the Bylaws:




JULY MEETING, 1972


25


Sec. 11.12. The Medical School-The Executive Faculty. The Executive Faculty shall consist of all faculty members of the rank of professor,
associate professor, and assistant professor, and those instructors of one or
more years' standing approved by a majority vote of the professorial staff
of the Medical School. It shall perform the duties assigned to the Governing
Faculties of other schools and colleges (R.P., July 1972).
Regent Cudlip moved that the Journal of Conflict Resolution    Journal of Conflict
be transferred in accordance with the recommendation of Dean       Resolut
Rhodes endorsed by Vice-President Smith, with the understanding
that a specific agreement to accomplish the transfer be worked
out. The motion was seconded by Regent Lindemer and adopted
unanimously.
A copy of revisions in the Faculty Code of the College of      L.S&A Faculty
Literature, Science, and the Arts was filed with the Secretary of
the University.
The Regents approved the awarding of a Regents' Citation       Regents' Citation
of Honor.
The Regents approved termination of the requirement for        Review of
Research
Senate Assembly Committee review      of proposals for classified  Proposals
research activities emanating from the Willow Run Laboratories,
effective July 21, 1972.
The Regents received a report on the University Activities     Unive    ntersity
Center.                                                            Report Received
In connection with the report, Regent Robert Brown asked
for a thorough report encompassing various events on campus
which had resulted in damage to University facilities as well as
other problems. He also asked for a statement of rules and regulations governing the conduct of such events.
President Fleming indicated that such a report would be prepared and made available to the Regents by their September meeting. The report would include information regarding outstanding
obligations on the part of several student organizations which were
incurred for a variety of events sponsored by them.
Regent Dunn commented on the proposal for relocation of        FlintCampus
the Flint campus. He noted that in all of their considerations on
this idea the Mayor's Implementation Committee in Flint and
the staff of the University in Ann Arbor and Flint were all
working toward the same goal, that of providing in the best
possible way for the educational needs of the students in the
Flint community. In this connection Regent Dunn then moved
the following resolution:
Plans for the presently authorized building on the Court Street site
will continue as at present. Under this plan, the University hopefully will
be able to go to bids by the first week in September and contracts will be
ready to let by October 15. Between now and the latter date, the Regents
authorize a feasibility study of the proposed riverfront site, to be paid for




26


JULY MEETING, 1972


out of nonstate appropriated funds. As of October 20 (the date of the
October meeting of the Board) the Regents will decide on one of the
following:
1. That the Court Street site is the best of the options and the contracts
for the building on that site will be let. (Since this date coincides with the
presently anticipated date for letting contracts, no delay will be caused.)
2. That the riverfront site is the best of the options and that the
building plans should be redrawn to be compatible with a campus plan for
that area.
3. That all of the information and commitments on which a decision
must be based are still not available. In this event, a delay in the delivery
of the classroom and office building could result, and for that reason the
Regents will not proceed with any further study unless the Implementation
Committee in Flint can guarantee that there will be private financing for a
$700,000 Surge Building. This would accommodate students in the fall of
1974 and compensate for the delay of the presently authorized building,
no matter which site is ultimately chosen.
The Capital Outlay Committee of the State legislature must concur in
points 2 and 3 above.
The motion was seconded by Regent Paul Brown and adopted,
with Regent Cudlip abstaining.
President Fleming asked Vice-Presidents Pierpont and Fauri
and Chancellor Moran to direct the feasibility study called for in
the Regents' resolution.
Disclosure   President Fleming then read the following proposal regarding
disclosure of individual staff salaries by name:
Attached hereto is a letter from the Daily asking that the University
release the names and salaries of all individuals working for the University.
In making this request, the Daily mentions the decision of Judge Dardas in
the Saginaw Valley case but does not state that this case is on appeal and
has not yet been resolved.
In any event, the question is a legitimate one and deserves an answer.
It must be obvious that there are conflicting rights involved here. On
the one hand, there is the right of the public to know how a university is
using its money. And on the other hand, there is the right of the individual
to his privacy.
Lest I be alleged to have a personal interest in the decision, I should
like to make clear at the outset that I have repeatedly expressed a willingness
to have my own salary published, and it is, in fact, published in the Michigan
Manual. I believe there is a greater right on the part of the public to know
what salaries are being paid to presidents than to other people working for
the University.
If one examines the question of the public's right to know about monies
supplied to the University, it seems to me one comes up with the following:
1. The public certainly has a right to know that the money is being
properly expended. This interest is presently well satisfied by three different
kinds of audits which we undergo. One is by the state auditor. A second is
by a private, outside auditing firm which the Regents employ each year. The
third is by federal authorities where federal funds are involved.
2. The public is entitled to know that all laws, e.g., affirmative action
laws, are being obeyed. This is satisfied by furnishing to enforcement agencies
salary information which they want. This is being done for both state and
federal agencies, we know of no complaints on their part in this respect, and
federal enforcement authorities have in fact said that they believe the right
of privacy of individuals ought to be respected.




JULY MEETING, 1972


27


On further examination, the argument that salaries ought to be disclosed
for affirmative action purposes does not stand analysis. A single example
will illustrate the point.
There is presently pending an amendment to Chapter 60 of Title 41
of the Code of Federal Regulations, adding a new part 60-30, which includes
further guidelines against discrimination on grounds of religion or national
origin. This proposed amendment has been published in the Federal Register
and is currently under revision before being codified.
If the argument that public employee salaries must be disclosed to
insure that affirmative action laws are being enforced is valid, it follows
that public agencies must also publish a list which will show the religious
faiths and national origins of all of their employees. Surely this would be
perceived by all as an invasion of privacy, yet it is not distinguishable from
the matter of one's salary so far as the above argument is concerned.
3. The public is entitled to know that the University's salaries are not
out of line with those of comparable institutions. This is accomplished by
a thorough review of the situation each year before the Bureau of the Budget
and legislative committees. At that time data are gathered which show how
University of Michigan salaries compare with others.
For the above reasons, it is reasonable to conclude that in balancing
off the public's interest in how funds are expended and the individual's right
to privacy, there is no reason to publish names and salaries. It is possible,
if the Regents wish, to release a book of faculty salaries which we compile
without names, which will show levels, ranges, individual colleges, etc.
I have discussed the Daily's request with our counsel, and he advises me
that the decision rendered by Judge Dardas is not final and that in his
opinion the University should not release individual names and salaries.
Accordingly, it is my recommendation that the University decline to
release this information and prepare to defend against any legal action.
Dear President Fleming,
For quite some time now, there has been a controversy within the
state of Michigan as to whether the salaries of employees of tax-supported
universities and colleges should be made public. During the past year, two
state-supported colleges (Michigan State University and Delta College)
voluntarily made their payroll records public. Your administration, however,
has refused to take similar action after being requested to do so by several
parties.
Up until a short time ago, there might have seemed no compelling reason
for you to comply with those requests. Legal statutes were hazy, and, unlike
the MSU and Delta College situations, no one group had seriously challenged
your authority to keep the records secret, nor had any local paper threatened
to obtain a copy of the list and publish it (as The State Journal did with
the MSU records).
Now, however, it seems that a clear legal precedent regarding these matters
has been set. In a ruling several weeks ago, Bay County Judge Leon Dardas
decided in favor of a suit brought by the Bay City Times, thus compelling
Saginaw Valley College to disclose the salaries paid to their faculty and staff.
I have been advised by legal counsel that the judge's decision is based on a
well-articulated opinion that likely will be held to apply to all state colleges.
Thus, I am requesting you to make the University of Michigan salary records
public, and I am prepared to undertake appropriate legal action to ensure
that end should you refuse. Specifically, I am requesting a computer printout
including the following: name, sex, minority code, salary, years of service,
and job title for all administrators, faculty, and staff.
I am making this request because I believe it is in the best interests of this
University to conduct all of its business operations in public, under the




28


JULY MEETING, 1972


close scrutiny of the people of the state of Michigan. Furthermore, I believe
that the people of this state should be provided with adequate information
to decide for themselves whether the University is making adequate progress
toward eliminating its past and present sexual and racial biases (including
close public scrutiny of affirmative action hiring programs), and whether
salary funds are being allocated in a fair and reasonable manner that is
consistent with the long-range interests of the people of this state and the
goals of public higher education.
As Judge Dardas noted in his opinion in the Bay City Times case, "There
is a clear and definite trend in our law today for the right of the public to
have full and complete information about all public institutions (federal,
state, and local). The spending of public money is public business."
I hope to hear from you at your earliest convenience.
Sincerely,
Alan Lenhoff
Editor
In addition, President Fleming noted that the Regents had
received a communication from SACUA opposing the release of
such salary data on a name basis as well as communications from
Student Government Council and the Women Law Students Association urging such disclosure.
Regent Cudlip moved the adoption of the recommendation of
the President. Regent Lindemer seconded the motion and it passed,
with Regents Waters and Dunn voting no.
Athletic    President Fleming then reviewed the following proposal for
Facilit the study of athletic facilities on campus:
Separate requests have been made by SGC and ACRICS (Advisory
Committee for Recreation, Intramurals, and Club Sports) for a task force
to look into the whole problem of facilities, financing, and organization of
these activities at The University of Michigan. ACRICS has now changed
its request to the more limited mission which is suggested herein.
There are indeed problems in these areas, and they have been studied
extensively. Though each new group, as it comes on the scene, suggests the
need for a study, most of the things which they wish to study are already
well known. For instance:
1. There is a clear and documented need for greater facilities for these
activities at The University of Michigan. We lag badly in this respect, and
with the new academic calendar most of our school year occurs during
months in which outside sports are limited.
2. In the past, recreational facilities at The University of Michigan
have been built primarily with funds from intercollegiate athletics and
student fees. There is no possibility that any major facility can be built
with intercollegiate athletic funds at the present time. On the contrary, there
is a serious problem of whether the present intercollegiate athletic programs
can be continued within their present funding sources.
3. Because university presidents and university athletic directors are
greatly concerned about the viability of intercollegiate athletics, in the
financial sense, there are major conversations going on right now within the
various athletic conferences and the NCAA and among the presidents about
how to cope with this problem. Since part of the solution is a regional or
national agreement on such things as tenders, there is little that can be
done locally until the broader conversations are pursued further.




JULY MEETING, 1972


29


4. The joint use of facilities by intercollegiate athletics, recreation,
intramurals, and club sports inevitably creates problems of equitable timesharing. Given our present inadequate facilities, there is no way in which
this can be done to everyone's satisfaction, and there is little reason to believe that a change in the structure will make any difference. This was
thoroughly discussed at the time the present structure was established, and
its dimensions have not changed.
5. The most likely possibility for funding the construction of one or
more new facilities for recreation, intramurals, and club sports is to impose
a student fee. Some of the problems of imposing such a fee are:
a. It will have to be mandatory, even though some students do not use
the facilities.
b. Its enactment will have to compete against other fees, including
a possible prepaid health insurance fee and the need to raise tuition.
c. From the time a commitment is made to construct a new facility,
at least three years will elapse before it is ready for occupancy and
this will require "front" money from students who will not benefit
from the use of the facilities.
d. Amortization of the debt will take place over 20 to 30 years, which
means that presently unborn generations of students will still be paying the fee.
6. Private gifts toward a major facility may be possible, but probably
not in significant amounts. A fund-raising campaign for this purpose would
probably take at least two years, during which the outcome would be
unknown.
7. Insofar as any undesignated or unrestricted University resources
might be made available for this purpose, there will be competition from
other internal projects, and the amount of such money is growing increasingly tight.
For all of these reasons, it is doubtful that a committee to study the
whole area will accomplish very much.
On the other hand, if a way (probably through students fees) can be
found to finance facilities, real progress can be made. An increase in facilities
will do far more than anything else to relieve the present tensions over
facility-sharing.
I would propose, therefore, to do the following:
1. Ask Messrs. Pierpont, Henry Johnson, and Canham to take the
Knauss memorandum on intercollegiate, intramural, and club sports and
recreation and prepare a detailed and accurate account of the financing
which goes into these activities so that the community can see and understand what is there and what, if anything, might be available for financing
additional facilities.
2. Ask a specific task force to study: (a) how much is needed in the
way of additional facilities, (b) the pros and cons of one facility versus
several, and (c) the methods of financing such facilities, with a report to be
rendered as soon as possible.
3. If there is a desire to consider the structure of the operation as of
this moment, which I think will be unproductive for the reasons mentioned,
I would then bring it up through the present lines of authority. It should be
noted that Big Ten rules require that the faculty dominate the Intercollegiate
Athletic Board, and if there is dissatisfaction with the present Board it can
be raised with the faculty.
Regent Robert Brown stated that he remembered that such
a study of proposed new intramural facilities was submitted two
or three years ago but was bogged down because of opposition
to the increase in student fees that would be required to finance




30


JULY MEETING, 1972


such a program. He hoped that the study could be revised and
updated and that the question of funding could be resolved.
The Regents agreed to proceed as recommended by the President.
D. M. French    Regent Dunn moved adoption of the following statement.
Regent Waters seconded the motion and it passed unanimously:
The Regents of the University take this opportunity to convey their
sincere appreciation to David M. French, Dean of The University of Michigan-Flint, on the occasion of his retirement.
This resolution gratefully acknowledges the efforts of Dean French in
establishing the first campus of the University outside of Ann Arbor as a
means of better serving the educational needs of the citizens of this state
and particularly those in the Flint area.
It recognizes further his dedication, which enabled this fledgling institution to grow and develop to the point where it is now a complete fouryear college of 2,100 students pursuing courses in sixteen different departments.
The success of this undertaking is indeed a fitting tribute to the leadership given it by this able and effective educator.
The Regents offer to David M. French their warmest expressions of
gratitude and best wishes on this occasion.
A. G. Norman    Regent Cudlip moved adoption of the following statement.
Commended       egn                    a    t             following
The motion was seconded by Regent Dunn and adopted unanimously:
A. GEOFFREY NORMAN, Vice-President for Research, who was to
have retired from that office last year at the statutory age of sixty-five, has
instead, in accordance with his own accommodating nature, served for
another six months and another six months, so that he is retiring now.
He came to his office from a distinguished background in plant biochemistry and soil microbiology and from most capable labors as Director
of the Botanical Gardens during the years of their relocation. He has presided
with a quiet efficiency over an unparalleled burgeoning of sponsored research
on campus and with a fostering confidence over subsequent declines in
external support and internal morale. He has hastened the return of the
present measured optimism. He has further endured, with his accustomed
courtesy and forbearance, some criticisms which have come his way.
The officers and Regents of the University will miss his able officeswhich are nevertheless in a formal way replaceable-and his personal gracewhich is entirely irreplaceable, though lingering in pleasant and grateful
memory. They extend to him their hearty thanks, wish him Godspeed in his
new post as Director of the Institute for Environmental Quality, and give
notice that they will still call upon his seasoned judgment in time of need.
Interim    The Regents authorized the President or the Vice-President
Authorizen   for Academic Affairs to make such interim    appointments as may
be necessary to complete the staff for the opening of the fall term
and to report such appointments to the Regents at their September meeting (R.P., 1969-72, p. 1145).
The above actions were by unanimous vote except where indicated.
The Regents adjourned to meet on September 14 and 15.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1972
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR, SEPTEMBER 15, 1972
The Regents met Thursday and Friday, September 14 and 15.
Present were the President and Regents Cudlip, Huebner, Dunn,
Paul Brown, Lindemer, Robert Brown, Nederlander, and Waters.
Chancellors Goodall and Moran, Vice-Presidents Pierpont, Smith,
Fauri, Radock, Overberger and Johnson, and Secretary Kennedy
also were present. Regent Paul Brown was absent from the Friday session.
On Thursday afternoon the Regents heard a detailed presentation from representatives of Robert H. Hayes and Associates, Inc.,
regarding their study on the Development of a Uniform Salary
Program for Professional and Administrative Employees. The
complete details of this study are on file in the office of the Secretary of the University.
The Regents then reviewed the detailed operating budget for Operating Budg
1972-73. Each of the Regents commented on specific aspects of viewed
the operations budget, and several items will require more detailed
response on the part of the administrative officers. Specifically,
these are as follows:
In response to a question from Regent Nederlander, Vice-President Smith will review in detail the budget of the Botanical
Gardens.
Regent Robert Brown suggested that it would be most helpful
to have information regarding the number of people employed
related to overall salary budgets. Vice-President Pierpont agreed
that this information would be provided.
Vice-President Johnson indicated he would provide detailed
information for the Regents regarding the account Student Projects, No. 155980.
In connection with the discussion on funds being provided for
recreation and intramural facilities, Vice-President Pierpont indicated that he would furnish a report to the Regents on the utilization of the special $600,000 allocation which was authorized by
the Regents and budgeted over a three-year period. He also indicated that the results of a current study on the whole area of
funding for intercollegiate, intramural, and recreational activities
is very close to completion and will be provided to the Regents as
soon as it is available.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1972


Appropriations  Vice-President Smith then took up the matter of the 1973-74
Request for
1973-74 appropriation request. He indicated that this year's request would
consist largely of five items. The first of these would involve the
program revision requests resulting from the new program budget
evaluation system instituted this year by the Governor's office.
These program revisions would require approximately $12,600,000.
The details of these program revisions are on file in the Secretary's
office.
The second component of the appropriation request would consist of a salary and wage program.
The third aspect would request funds for the increased costs
imposed by changes in the unemployment compensation laws and
Social Security taxes.
The fourth item would consist of an inflation factor covering
nonsalary budget items, and the fifth would be a miscellaneous
request category which could not be included in the program revision section but which represents items which are fully justified in terms of need.
Vice-President Smith explained that the Governor's office would
need the total budget request by October 2.
Regent Cudlip commented that it is difficult for the Regents
to have much impact on the budget request at this point in time.
He noted that the Regents should undertake a review of existing
operating budget data now if they really want to have an impact
on such budget proposals in the future.
President Fleming indicated that the afternoon schedule required
that further discussion on these items be deferred until Friday.
The Regents then heard and viewed a presentation on computer
graphics by Professor R. L. Phillips.
Later in the day the Regents reviewed the proposed design
characteristics of the Engineering IA Building, the Flint classroom and office building, and the Band Rehearsal Hall.
The Regents discussed these designs at some length. It was
their general consensus that in the future there should be more
advance information provided so that the Regents could have
some impact on the eventual design characteristics of a particular
building. While the designs of the three buildings presented were
accepted, the Regents indicated their hope that they could be
involved at an earlier stage in these matters.
I. MINUTES
The minutes of the meeting of July 21, 1972, were approved
with certain specified changes.

W. D. Revelli  Secretary  Kennedy    reported  the  retirement of William     D.
Retirement
Memoir Revelli. The following memoir was adopted:
William D. Revelli, whose name is synonymous with band music in the
memory of thousands of Michigan alumni, has completed his terminal
furlough and formally retired from the active faculty. He was conductor
and later director of the University's bands for thirty-six fruitful years.
Entering the Chicago Musical College in 1919 after earlier study in
St. Louis, he completed his musical education at the Columbia School of
Music and the Vandercook School of Music, where he earned bachelor's
and master's degrees, respectively. In 1925 he was elected Supervisor of
Music in the public schools of Hobart, Indiana. There he led the high school
band to an incredible record of five first places in national competition.
He became band conductor at The University of Michigan in 1935, and the
remainder of his career here is a campus legend.
Professor Revelli advanced the bands of the University to national
eminence, both in the concert hall and on the football field. Concurrently,
he built up the wind instruments department, of which he was made chairman in 1941, to one of the most versatile and distinguished units of the
Music School. He crisscrossed the country with his symphony band and
took it on a worldwide tour under the auspices of the International Cultural
Exchange Program. Insisting always upon the highest standards of performance and upon a fresh and versatile repertory, he made his perfectionism felt through the hundreds of band directors who had been under his
immediate tutelage and the thousands who observed and admired his workmanship. He further extended his influence as a guest conductor, clinician,
and adjudicator in all parts of the United States.
Fitting honors have been heaped on him, including a Distinguished
Faculty Achievement Award from the University and five honorary doctor's
degrees. He is Honorary Life President of the College Band Directors'
National Association (which he founded) and of the band fraternity Kappa
Kappa Psi, past president of the American Bandmasters' Association, and
the first conductor to be elected to the Academy of Wind and Percussion Arts.
No external honor, however, can rival in value the persistence of his
ideals among the innumerable musicians whose lives he has touched and




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1972

the enjoyment that his own conducting has brought to literally millions
of persons in the state, the nation, and the world. The Regents of the
University, having themselves been among his beneficiaries, tender him a
special meed of affectionate esteem as they appoint William Revelli Professor Emeritus of Music and Director Emeritus of University Bands.
VII. DEATHS
Mr. Kennedy reported the death of Professor Edward Glaser on
August 29. The following memorial statement was adopted:
The University of Michigan and the international fraternity of Hispanic  Edward Glascr
scholars suffered a grievous loss in the death of Professor Edward Glaser,  Memorial
on the twenty-ninth of August, at fifty-three years of age.
A native Austrian, Professor Glaser studied classical philology and
ancient history at the University of Vienna from 1936 to 1938. Leaving
Austria because of the German occupation, he spent six years in Argentina
and then came to the United States. After two years in the United States
Army, he enrolled in Wayne University, from which he earned bachelor's
and master's degrees in 1947 and 1948, respectively. Completing his graduate
education at Harvard, he remained to teach there after earning his doctorate
in 1951. He came to Michigan as an associate professor in 1959 and was
advanced to a professorship three years later.
Professor Glaser was a close and versatile scholar of both Spanish and
Portuguese literatures-particularly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries-and of the relations between these. He single-handedly re-created the
curriculum in Portuguese literature here, shepherding doctoral students in
that field and conducting research in it himself while on a Guggenheim
fellowship. His scholarly acumen was acknowledged by his appointment to
the advisory board of the Hispanic Review and the editorial boards of
other scholarly journals in the United States and Brazil. He was elected,
in addition, a corresponding member of the Hispanic Society of America.
For a scholar so deeply involved in research, he was also an exceptionally
enthusiastic and committed teacher with a keen interest in his individual
students. And he was, finally, an earnest and whole-souled participant in
departmental affairs.
His colleagues are sorrowfuly aware that the scholarly stature of their
department is significantly diminished by his death and are deeply and
personally grieved by the loss of his quick and eager presence among them.
The University Regents now join them in mourning the untimely death of
this distinguished and devoted man and in extending their deepest sympathy
to Mrs. Glaser and her daughters.
Regent Robert Brown commented about the loss of Regent              H G. Kipke
Emeritus Harry G. Kipke, who had been one of the University's                 p
truly great friends. He directed the Secretary to prepare an appropriate memorial statement for adoption at the October meeting.
VIll. OFF-CAMPUS ASSIGNMENTS AND             LEAVES OF ABSENCE
One hundred fifteen leaves of absence and eight off-campus
assignments were reported to the Regents.

President Fleming then suggested that discussion resume on         Appropriations

the appropriations request which had been discussed on Thursday       Discussion
(p. 40).                                                             Resumes
Vice-President Smith reviewed in detail the reasoning which
went into the decision with regard to the recommendations for the
salary program for 1973-74. He noted that, while a considerably
higher increase could be justified on the basis of the position of
University of Michigan salaries relative to those at competitive
institutions, it was the general consensus that a 7.5 percent increase in compensation coupled with a 3 percent increase in staff
benefits would seem to provide a reasonable request.
Regent Robert Brown questioned whether such an increase
would in fact require an exception from     the Pay Board. VicePresident Smith said it is of course difficult to know what guidelines will prevail next year but he felt confident that if present




60


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1972


guidelines existed an exception could be secured for this level of
increase.
Regent Nederlander commented that he didn't think it was
realistic to think that the University could go beyond the 5.5
percent guidelines.
Regent Dunn stated it was his experience that exceptions to the
guidelines were taking more than a year to be processed.
Regent Cudlip commented that he was not comfortable with a
request that would exceed the 5.5 percent level.
Regent Lindemer stated that in the present political climate
and with the state's present budgetary circumstances he saw
absolutely no chance of securing any increase higher than 5.5
percent. He felt the chances of securing a 7.5 percent increase
were minimal but he would support and fight for a 5.5 percent
increase.
Vice-President Smith commented that he felt it to be regental
policy not to allow political probability to dictate the University's budget requests. He felt that such decisions in the past
had been based on a determination of what could be effectively
used and reasonably justified. He expressed his concern that the
faculty might interpret the Regents' decision to ask for only a
5.5 percent increase as one which was suggested because a
higher increase could not be justified to the Regents themselves
rather than to the legislature.
Regent Cudlip said that the faculty should be told that this
was not the case.
Regent Dunn and others commented on the very significant
progress that had been made in improving our credibility with
Lansing in the recent past. They felt we would appear to lose
credibility by now asking for a salary program which exceeds
existing guidelines.
Vice-President Smith pointed out that he was quite confident
that no other educational institution in the state would submit
a salary increase request as low as 5.5 percent.
Regent Lindemer then moved that the appropriations request
submitted by the University include a request for a 5.5 percent
increase in salaries at the University. The motion was seconded
by Regent Cudlip.
Vice-President Fauri commented that he was quite disturbed
that colleges and universities had not fared as well as state
civil service employees in securing salary increases.
Regent Robert Brown commented that, regardless of this
fact, we must demonstrate leadership in helping to solve the
state's fiscal problems and in combatting national inflation.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1972

Regent Waters stated that throughout the discussion he had
not heard a very good reason why the 7.5 percent increase is not
a good idea.
The motion passed, with Regent Waters dissenting.
President Fleming then stated that he too was disturbed by
the inability of universities to keep pace with salary increases
granted to civil service employees. He noted that this past
year university salary increases fell at least one percent behind
those granted through Civil Service. He wondered whether an
attempt ought to be made to regain this ground through improvements in staff benefit programs.
The Regents reacted favorably to this suggestion and Regent
Lindemer moved that the appropriation request include a 1.5
percent increase in the fringe benefit program.
The motion was seconded by Regent Huebner and adopted
unanimously.
The Regents also approved the following additional elements to
be included in the 1973-74 appropriations request:
Program Revision Requests requiring an increment of
$12,678,000;
Funds to provide for imposed costs of unemployment compensation laws and increased Social Security taxes (approximately $3 65,000);
Funds to cover inflation costs on nonsalary budget items
(estimated at $1,078,700);
Miscellaneous request items (specific items and amounts to be
identified and included in the appropriations request and confirmed by the Regents at their October meeting).
The Regents approved the Capital Outlay request for 1973-74. capital Outlay

Xl. OTHER
Building Name  After discussing the recommendations for the naming of the
recently acquired building for the School of Music (p. 22), Regent Cudlip moved that the building be named the Cady-Stearns
Building. The motion was seconded by Regent Huebner.
Regent Dunn suggested that Vice-President Smith inquire of
School of Music officials as to whether they had any objection
to this combination of names.
Regent Lindemer then moved that the motion to name the
building be tabled until October. Regent Dunn seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
Appeals Denied  AS recommended by Vice-President Smith, the appeals of
Bruce S. Bigelow and Frank D. Muschett from their classification as nonresident students for purposes of fee assessment were
denied.
Dental School  The recommendation of the Dean of the School of Dentistry
Executive Committee Enlarged endorsed by Vice-President Smith to increase the number of
members of the Executive Committee of the School of Dentistry
from three to six was approved.
Office sof ice-  The Regents approved the recommendation of Vice-President
President for
Research Re- Overberger for restructuring the Office of the Vice-President for
structured Research. The restructuring would include the appointment of an
assistant vice-president for research and a change in the name
of the Office of Research Administration to the Division of Research Development and Administration, Office of the Vice-President for Research.
Dental School  The Regents approved the recommendation of Vice-President
Assistant
Deanships Smith for the appointment of two part-time assistant deans in
the School of Dentistry.

degree, Bachelor of Musical Arts (B.Mus.A.), to be granted
on recommendation of the School of Music faculty, effective in

program at UM-Dearborn entitled Industrial Engineering to
Industrial and Systems Engineering, effective with the 1972 fall
term.
The Regents discussed the letter from the President of Student Government Council requesting that regular meetings be
held by the Regents with SGC. As an alternative the Regents
suggested that a one-hour period be set aside in the Regents'
regular Thursday meetings so that various individuals and groups
could request a specific appearance with the Regents then for
limited discussion of any topic of their choosing.
William Jacobs, President of SGC, indicated his intent was to
increase the opportunity for communication with the Regents and
also to ensure that the Regents spend more time here on the
campus.
Regent Lindemer pointed out that he presently is spending up
to 20 percent of his working time on regental business and could
not possibly spend that much more.
The Regents then agreed to have the officers work out a plan
whereby the suggested one-hour period would be set aside for
groups and individuals to discuss items with the Regents.
Vice-President Pierpont reported that negotiations on the
establishment of Willow Run Laboratories as an independent
entity were moving forward and that the entire operation should
be completed shortly.
The Regents adopted the following resolution:
The Regents of the University wish to take this opportunity to express
their appreciation to the Faculty Women's Club, which has recently
completed fifty years of service to the University community.
The Regents recognize and congratulate the officers and members
of the Club for their efforts in providing activities and programs which
stimulate and enrich the cultural, social, and intellectual life of the
community. We extend our best wishes for continued success as the Club
embarks on its second half-century of service.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents reported for the month of June 1972 totaled $855.75;
for July 1972 totaled $829.83; and for August 1972 totaled
$667.24.
The Regents adjourned to meet October 19 and 20.

APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREES, AUGUST 20, 1972
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison
DOCTOR OF LAWS
GEORGE EDGAR GULLEN, JR., President of Wayne State University.
Mr. Gullen administered the affairs of Wayne State so capably during
ten months as acting president that he had become the only rational choice
when a permanent chief executive officer was selected last spring. He has
met the hazards of faction and financial crisis. And, if he has not precisely
slain these dragons, a feat beyond human powers, he has comported himself with courage and tact in the field and is vindicated as the defender
and champion of an alma mater in distress. He is welcomed to the knighthood of university presidents, a band of men volunteering to confront a
new and improved model of dragon each year.
In all seriousness, The University of Michigan rejoices in his present
auspicious accomplishments and wishes him enduring success in his important and sensitive office. As we confer on him the degree Doctor of
Laws, we cordially and respectfully salute President Gullen and his school,
our sister university, Wayne State.
DOCTOR OF SCIENCE
JOHN CHIPMAN, Professor Emeritus of Metallurgy, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
It was in the early nineteen-thirties, when he was a research engineer
at The University of Michigan, that Professor Chipman began his seminal
work on steelmaking and high-temperature metal systems; and here he
won the first of many signal honors, the Howe Medal, for his inquiries
into the deoxidation of liquid steel. He has since added steadily to a
knowledge and understanding of the thermodynamic properties of metallic
and slag solutions and of reaction equilibria among gases, slags, and metals
at high temperatures. He has further inspired successive generations of
students to join him in a general labor which can be called without
hyperbole the transformation of metallurgy into a mature science.
These admiring and affectionate disciples, many of them now possessing an autonomous distinction, join us in spirit as we celebrate John
Chipman's creative accomplishments with metals and with men and tender
him the degree Doctor of Science, for the sake of honor.

Alfred Marlyn Elliott, international authority on the nutrition and  A. M. Elliott
genetics of protozoa, having retired from the active faculty, is now eligible  Retirement
for an emeritus appointment.                                        Memoir
A native of Humbolt, South Dakota, Professor Elliott earned his baccalaureate from Yankton College in 1928, taught in high school for two
years, briefly attended Iowa State University, and then earned master's and
doctor's degrees from New York University in 1931 and 1934, respectively.
During the next year he taught in the College of the City of New York
and for twelve succeeding years, from 1935 to 1947, at the State Teachers
College in Bemidji, Minnesota. Accepting then an appointment here as Assistant Professor of Zoology, he was raised to a professorship in 1955.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1972


R. C. Parmenter
Retirement
Memoir


Professor Elliott was a most capable and conscientious teacher of the
basic zoology course over the years, preparing his own text materials and
keeping abreast of the organizations and techniques of comparable courses
elsewhere, so that he became a national authority on pedagogy in his field.
In his administrative and committee offices for his Department and for more
inclusive units of the University, he displayed a similar zeal and devotion.
In his field of specialization, he steadily extended his long research on the
physiology of certain fresh-water protoza which, because of their simplicity
and brief life cycles, lend themselves to inquiries rich with promise for
physiology, biochemistry, and, ultimately, medicine. His work on these microorganisms was supported by a succession of grants from the National Science
Foundation and the United States Public Health Service, and it won him a
prominent place among his national and international fellows. During his
later career, he was president of the Society of Protozoology and of the
American Microscopical Society, director of the Academic Year Institute,
executive committeeman of the American Type Culture Collection in Rockville, Maryland, and fellow of the New York Academy of Science.
Acknowledging his long fidelity in teaching and service and his distinction
in basic research, the Regents of the University extend him their special
thanks as they now appoint him Professor Emeritus of Zoology.
Ruth Carney Parmenter, Associate Professor of Nursing and Assistant
Director of Nursing Services in the University Hospital, relinquished her
active offices last summer after serving on the University faculty for twentysix years.
Mrs. Parmenter earned successively a nursing certificate from the Henry
Ford School of Nursing and Hygiene, a baccalaureate degree from the University's School of Nursing (in 1935), and a public health certificate from the
Wayne College of Nursing. She gained various experience in health education,
field teaching, and field supervision with the Detroit Department of Health.
After brief service in the Army Nurse Corps, she came to the University
Medical Center in 1946 and was promoted to her present academic title in
1960; a year earlier she had become Assistant Director of Nursing Services
in the Outpatient Department of the Hospital.
Mrs. Parmenter was at once efficient and sensitive in carrying out her
duties, so that she was warmly regarded by the students and faculty of the
Nursing School and also by the patients and staff in the Hospital. Within the
Nursing School, where her long experience in public health nursing gave her
added versatility, she contributed significantly to course design and curriculum planning as well as to instruction.
The Regents of the University express to her their own personal gratitude
and good wishes as they appoint her now Associate Professor Emeritus of
Nursing.


Vll. DEATHS
Regent Robert Brown read the following resolution in memory
of Regent Emeritus Harry G. Kipke (p. 57):
H. G. Kipke    The Regents of the University sadly acknowledge the death of Regent
Memorial Emeritus Harry George Kipke on the fourteenth of last month at the age
of 73.
He had made his mark at the University as an athlete, winning nine
varsity letters and All-American honors in football. He was perhaps the
greatest punter in Michigan football history. From 1929 through 1937, moreover, he served as head football coach, leading his team to four Big Ten
championships and one national title. He became a member of the National
Football Hall of Fame in 1958 and of the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in




OCTOBER MEETING, 1972


99


1968. His term on the Board of Regents extended from 1940 to 1947. He was
also an alumni member of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics
for two terms, from 1950 to 1956. And throughout a successful business
career, during which he was president of the Chicago Convention Bureau
and director of the Chicago Better Business Bureau, he retained an abiding
loyalty to the University and a genial and fostering association with it.
The Regents now join his many friends within the larger University
family in mourning the death of this storied athlete, former colleague, and
devoted alumnus, and they tender their deepest sympathy to Mrs. Kipke and
his surviving kin.
VilI. OFF-CAMPUS ASSIGNMENTS AND LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Sixteen leaves of absence and four off-campus assignments were

WHEREAS, the Board of Regents of The University of Michigan has
received a proposal to relocate the Flint Campus from the Court Street to
the Riverfront site; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Regents has commissioned professional studies
which have demonstrated the comparative advantage of the Riverfront site
over the Court Street site for the future University of Michigan-Flint
campus; and




104


OCTOBER MEETING, 1972


WHEREAS, nonstate sources in Flint have furnished satisfactory
evidence that $9,750,000 will be forthcoming in the period between 1972 and
1976 in support of the Riverfront site; and
WHEREAS, The University of Michigan-Flint can, and expects to,
utilize the Mott Building on the present Flint campus for an indefinite
period; and
WHEREAS, the Regents have no present intention of disposing of the
Court Street site and are prepared in the near future to address themselves
to the provision of expanded facilities until such time as adequate buildings
can be constructed on the Riverfront site;
NOW BE IT RESOLVED
That the Board of Regents of The University of Michigan approves the
Riverfront site for the main campus in Flint, subject to:
1. Approval by the State Legislature's Joint Capital Outlay Committee
of the transfer of funds already appropriated for building construction on
the Court Street site to the Riverfront site;
2. Agreement by the City of Flint to revise its City Plans and Urban
Renewal Plans so that certain site conditions now under discussion by the
City Council are resolved to the satisfaction of The University of Michigan;
3. Adoption by the City of Flint of resolutions:
a. appropriating $600,000 in January of 1973 and an additional
$600,000 not later than November 1973 to be used for the provision of land within the Riverfront site boundaries, which land
shall then be conveyed to The University of Michigan-Flint immediately, or upon request of the University; and,
b. appropriating a total of $4.8 million to be used in the period
extending from fiscal year 1975 through fiscal year 1982 in support of further development of the Riverfront site.
AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED
That the Board of Regents expresses its deep appreciation to the City
and Citizens of Flint for their interest in and support of the developing
University of Michigan-Flint campus.
The resolution was supported by Regent Robert Brown.
Chancellor Moran commented that the faculty at the Flint
campus had recently studied the alternative site proposals and had
adopted the following resolution:
That the sense of the faculty is that they approve the
riverfront campus if the Regents are satisfied that adequate
resources are available to support the program of the University of Michigan-Flint there.
President Fleming commented that, while the Regents' resolution is supportive of the move to the downtown site, it must be
remembered that the resolution still contains three conditions
that must be met before the relocation of the campus can be
finalized. He commended Chancellor Moran for his diligent efforts
in bringing about this relocation.
Regent Lindemer extended his commendation to include all
the officers and staff members who had undertaken an extremely




OCTOBER MEETING, 1972


105


intensive effort to resolve this question. He indicated how     very
impressed he had been with the diligence and dedication to the
effort involved.
Regent Dunn commented that it should be particularly clear
to everyone that a major factor in this decision was the massive
financial commitment on the part of the people of Flint that played
such an important part in making this move possible.
The resolution was adopted unanimously.

David J. Strawbridge, August 4, 1972
James L. Vedder, July 15, 1972
Joel M. Zahler, April 30, 1972
Vice-President Smith indicated that the summary report of
resignations presented to the Regents should be corrected to show
that Professor Arthur R. Miller resigned to accept a position at
Harvard University rather than at Howard University.
On recommendation of the Dean of the School of Education
endorsed by Vice-President Smith, the Regents granted the request
of Stewart C. Hulslander, Professor of Education, to begin his
retirement furlough on January 1, 1973, seven months before his
sixty-fifth birthday, because of ill health. He will then retire on
December 31, 1973, at age sixty-five.
Regent Lindemer stated that it seemed unusual that Professor
Hulslander had not taken a sabbatical leave during his entire
tenure of twenty-three years.
Vice-President Smith said that only 35 to 40 percent of University of Michigan faculty members eligible for sabbatical leaves
actually take them.
President Fleming commented that the public sometimes has a
somewhat distorted perception of the concept of the sabbatical
leave. He indicated that at most universities fewer than half the
faculty members eligible for these leaves actually take them.

Architect  On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents
Appointed approved the appointment of David P. Trautman of Petoskey
as architect for the dining and lecture halls at the Biological Station (R.P., 1969-72, pp. 1339 and 1426).
Regent Robert Brown asked whether there was a movement
to convert all the buildings at the Biological Station so that they
could be used the year round. Vice-President Overberger indicated
that he understood that the director and faculty at the Station did
intend to convert to a year-round facility.




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1972


171


Chancellor Moran reviewed the latest meeting with the state      Flication
Capital Outlay Committee, in which the Committee indicated the
need to develop now a campus plan for the Flint riverfront site
before it could act to approve the new site. To that end Chancellor
Moran asked that the Regents approve a proposed resolution
which would implement the various steps now necessary to comply
with the requests of the Capital Outlay Committee.
Regent Lindemer then moved the following resolution with
regard to the Flint campus:
WHEREAS, on October 20, 1972, the Regents approved the location
of the new Flint campus on the Riverfront site, in the city of Flint, subject
to stipulated conditions; and
WHEREAS, in order to determine the site of the Classroom and Office
Building for which funds have previously been appropriated by the State
Legislature, and to consider any desirable alterations in the current plans
for this building, it is necessary to prepare the first phase of a campus plan
and plans for interim space between now and 1976; and
WHEREAS, in order to maintain the schedule for occupancy of the
new site by the Fall of 1976, such planning should be accomplished by
February 1, 1973; and
WHEREAS, in order to meet space needs for enrollments in 1973 and
later, initial design work will be completed for a $400,000 surge building on
the Court Street site subject to future construction authorization by the
Board of Regents and contingent on approval of the Riverfront site by the
Joint Capital Outlay Commitee; and
WHEREAS, non-State funds have been committed to accomplish the
required planning;
NOW, THEREFORE,
The Regents authorize the expenditure of such non-State funds for the
preparation of such required plans by The University of Michigan-Flint in
consultation with Sasaki, Dawson and DeMay Associates and a qualified
firm of consulting mechanical and electrical engineers to be recommended
by The University of Michigan-Flint and appointed by the President.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
That the Regents express their appreciation to the donors for their
cooperation in making this important step possible.
Regent Huebner seconded the motion.
Regent Paul Brown indicated that, while he favored the essence
of the resolution, he felt it was unnecessary for the Regents to
make any firm commitment with regard to a surge building at
this time. In spite of the reservation, however, he indicated he
would support the resolution.
The resolution was adopted unanimously.

Bylaws Amended:
School of Business
Administration


On recommendation of the Dean of the School of Business
Administration endorsed by Vice-President Smith, the Regents
approved the following Sec. 11.021 of the Bylaws, replacing the
Bureau of Business Research with the Division of Research, and
Sec. 11.022, replacing the Bureau of Industrial Relations with the
Division of Management Education:
Section 11.021. The School of Business Administration-Division of
Research. The Division of Research shall be maintained as a part of the
School of Business Administration to provide a means of administrative
coordination of the various research activities throughout the School. The
Division will also foster and promote research in problems of business and
economic significance. The Division shall make possible continuous contact
between the School and business enterprises, thereby enriching instruction.

the Executive Committee, appointed by the Board on recommendation by
the President.
Section 11.022. The School of Business Administration-Division of

Memberships  In discussing institutional membership in the American Association of Deans of College and University Schools of Nursing
for 1972-73 at a cost of $500 from the School of Nursing General




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1972


173


Fund account, Regent Lindemer commented on the proliferation
of this type of association membership. He expressed his concern
that, although the individual costs of such memberships may appear insignificant, the overall effect would seem to indicate a not
inconsiderable drain on University resources.
Regent Dunn concurred, saying that even those membership
approvals which had occurred during the short time that he has
been dealing with them must now total several thousand dollars.
Both President Fleming and Vice-President Smith commented
on the very real benefits of belonging to various educational associations. The University clearly derives substantially more in
benefits than is expended in membership dues.
Regent Nederlander commented that he felt University departments which request these memberships are in a better position
to determine whether the memberships warrant any call on their
limited budgetary resources. He felt that the central administration
has a responsibility to look after overall budgetary matters, including cutbacks that are required of all departments. The individual departments then have to make the hard decisions about
how to use their specific resources to the best advantage.
Vice-President Smith noted that in many cases these memberships are absolutely essential to the operation of the departments.
Regent Huebner then moved approval of the membership. The
motion was seconded by Regent Nederlander and adopted unanimously.
President Fleming then reviewed the history of the develop- Cultural Living
ments which led to the draft of the guidelines for establishing  Units Discussed
cultural living units. He noted that, after the Regents had turned
down the request for an Afro-American and African housing unit
last spring (R.P., 1969-72, pp. 1435-38), the Michigan Civil
Rights Commission, acting on a complaint, indicated that such an
action might be discriminatory in view of the existence of various
language houses on the campus. This draft of a proposed policy
would provide that a cultural program sponsored by an academic
unit could be the basis for establishing a housing unit in the same
way that the language houses were established. He indicated that
with the Regents' permission the draft would be circulated internally for comments and suggestions. The draft would also be
sent to the Civil Rights Commission indicating that the Regents
would again review it for action at the December meeting.
The Regents agreed that this procedure was quite appropriate.
Regent Robert Brown stated that this seemed to be a step
in the right direction and that the draft policy might even be
revised to include the language houses.




174


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1972


Bniversity Press   The Regents approved the following amended Sections 13.02
and 13.03 of the Bylaws:
Section 13.02. The Director and Executive Committee. The Press shall
be under a Director, responsible to the Dean of the Graduate School, appointed by the Board on recommendation by the President. He shall be
assisted by an Executive Committee consisting of the Dean of the Graduate
School, who shall be chairman of the Executive Committee; the Director of
the University of Michigan Press; the chairman of the University Press
Editorial Committee; and three additional members to be appointed by the
Board upon recommendation by the President for terms of three years each.
The Committee shall have the responsibility for promoting publication by
and on behalf of the University and the power to determine policies relative
to such publications, to supervise such publications and their sale or other
distribution, and to approve all expenditures for publication by or on behalf
of the University.
Sections 13.03. University Press Editorial Committee. There shall be
a University Press Editorial Committee, which shall have power to approve
or reject manuscripts offered for publication under the University Press
imprint. The Editorial Committee shall consist of the Director of the University of Michigan Press, ex officio, who shall act as its secretary, and at
least six, but not more than eleven, members of the University Senate representing academic fields related to the interests of the University Press, to be
appointed by the Executive Board of the Graduate School. The Committee
shall select its own chairman annually, and the faculty members of the Committee shall each be appointed for a term of three years, the terms to be so
adjusted that at least two vacancies occur each year.
C. H. Sawyer    Regent Huebner introduced the following resolution. It was
ommended   seconded by Regent Robert Brown and approved unanimously:
WHEREAS, Professor Charles H. Sawyer is approaching the end of his
term of service as Director of the Museum of Art at the University of
Michigan; and
WHEREAS, Professor Sawyer has built this into one of the finest such
Museums in the nation, not only amassing a distinguished collection but also
introducing such innovative features as the Museum Practice Program and
the Friends of the Museum;
BE IT RESOLVED That the Regents of the University of Michigan do
herewith publicly recognize and commend Professor Sawyer for his distinguished contributions to this University and to the State of Michigan.
President Fleming commented on the fact that, thankfully,
Dr. Sawyer would not be leaving the University but would return
to teaching status. The President commended Dr. Sawyer for his
dedicated effort as Director of the Museum of Art, which clearly
resulted in the constant improvement of the Museum during his
tenure.
Handicapped    Regent Lindemer said he had asked Vice-President Johnson
Students:
Transportation for to look into a complaint he had received regarding the inadequacy
of bus service for handicapped students on the North Campus. The
result of the investigation indicated that there was no real curtailment of bus service but that there was a problem in terms of
identifying handicapped persons living in the North Campus area




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1972


175


and knowing the full extent of their transportation problems. He
said that steps should be taken to encourage handicapped persons
to make themselves known and to assist the University in developing the best means for dealing with these problems.
Regent Lindemer commented that he had for some time heard
many complaints about the secret nature of the various documents
included in the blue agenda book of the Regents. He asked that
the Secretary work with Vice-President Radock and others in
seeing that the contents of the agenda books were appropriately
made available to interested persons in advance of the meetings.
He made it quite clear that certain documents, such as those
dealing with property, finance, and personnel items, would have
to be restricted from this procedure, but he felt that, clearly, most
of the material could be made available.
All the above actions were by unanimous vote.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents reported for the month of October 1972 totaled $831.48.
The Regents adjourned to meet on December 14 and 15.

Regent Dunn noted that the summary report of appointments  Salary,<~.~,.  i,   ~~~~.,~~~~.,~ ~~.  'Information
no longer contained salary information.
President Fleming pointed out that the Regents had reviewed
the question of making individual salaries public and had decided
against such a move (pp. 26-28). Subsequently, at their November
meeting the Regents agreed to make public nearly all the documents in their regular agenda book (p. 175). To carry out the
Regents' directive regarding their prohibition on the release of
salary information and still make individual appointments public,
the salaries were deleted from the summary. It was agreed that the
Regents should in fact be provided with this salary information,
even though it cannot be made public.
Vice-President Smith agreed to correct this matter in the
future.
Regent Dunn stated that he, for one, was quite willing to release salary information.
Vice-President Smith said that there will be available shortly
the usual summary information on salary ranges, which will be
made public.
Regent Dunn also inquired as to the reason that so many of
the new appointments were from the Flint campus. He noted that
some of these appointments were retroactive to last August and
indicated that it would be somewhat unfortunate if any of the
appointments were to be turned down.
Vice-President Smith indicated that efforts were being made
to make the summary appointment report more current and that
renewed attention would be given to this matter in the coming
months.
On recommendation of the Nominating Board for the Faculty  court ot Appeals
Panel for the University Court of Appeals, the Regents appointed
the following members to the University Court of Appeals:
Professor Robert M. Caddell
Professor Halvor N. Christensen
Professor Gunter Dufey

DECEMBER MEETING, 1972


Mr. Harvey W. Graves, Jr.
Professor Marie D. Hartwig
Professor Frank M. Koen
In answer to a question the Secretary mentioned that, after
the Regents' approval of the appointment of the faculty members
to the Court of Appeals only one step remained to make the
Judicial System operative. The Regents must still approve the
student members. Once that is accomplished, the Judicial System
can be implemented.
In connection with the appointments to the University Club
Board Regent Nederlander wondered whether the Board might be
expanded to include more alumni members.
President Fleming indicated that he would look into the matter,
although he noted that there were already at least two alumni
on the Board.

On recommendation of the Dean of the School of Natural Re-         L. E Craine
Retirement
sources endorsed by Vice-President Smith the Regents granted           Furlough
the request of Lyle E. Craine, Professor of Natural Resources,
to go on retirement furlough with full salary on September 1,
1973, even though he had held a half-time appointment for the
last two University years. Professor Craine will therefore retire
on September 1, 1974, at age sixty-six.
In connection with this retirement furlough for Professor
Craine, Regent Lindemer stated that he hoped that in the future
such communications could be written so that a specific reason
for an exception to University policy would be set forth. He noted
that his comments were in no way meant to be a reflection on this
request; he simply wished that the communication had been more
specific as to the reasons for early retirement.
Vice-President Smith reviewed several of those reasons and
indicated that this would be more adequately conveyed in future
communications.
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of Merwin H.              I. H. Waterman
Retirement
Waterman. The following memoir was adopted:
Merwin Howe Waterman is formally retiring from the active faculty
at the end of this calendar year, after more than fifty years of association
with the University.
Professor Waterman came to Ann Arbor from his native Jackson in
1921, was graduated in course from the Literary College, and proceeded to
earn a Master of Business Administration degree in 1926 and a doctorate
in 1932. Joining the faculty in business administration as an instructor in
1926, he rose through the intervening ranks to a professorship in 1941.
A proponent and master of case study as a pedagogic technique, Professor Waterman was a successful and widely influential teacher of finance and
banking. An expert on public utilities, he was a respected consultant for




188


DECEMBER MEETING, 1972


both private corporations and public agencies. In his later career he extended
his interests to international finance, including comparative practices of
capitalization in the United States and Europe. During the past fifteen years
he has supplied expert counsel in a number of foreign centers of education and
finance, including Taiwan and, more recently, Indonesia.
Meanwhile, Professor Waterman served the School of Business Administration as Secretary (from 1937 to 1946), as counselor of doctoral candidates, as director of training and research projects and organizations, as
a member of principal committees, and (for the latter half of 1960) as
Acting Dean. Within the University, he was Secretary of the Senate Advisory
Committee and a member of an astonishing array of deliberative and administrative bodies. And he somehow found additional time to play an
active and various role in the civic and educational life of Ann Arbor.
The Regents of the University salute this capable, faithful, and industrious man with gratitude, esteem, and a touch of awe. Rejoicing in his
continued vigor, they further bid him Godspeed, as holder of the University
of Michigan title Professor Emeritus of Finance, in his future career.
VIi. DEATHS
No deaths were reported to the Regents.
VIII. OFF-CAMPUS ASSIGNMENTS AND LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Five off-campus assignments and seven leaves of absence were
reported to the Regents.
Extensions   On recommendation of the Dean of the School of Education
of Leave endorsed by Vice-President Smith the Regents granted an extension of leave without salary from January 1, 1973, through June
30, 1973, to Joseph P. Cosand, Professor of Education, to permit
him to continue to serve in the Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare as Associate Commissioner of Education in charge
of Higher Education.
On recommendation of the Dean of the College of Engineering
endorsed by Vice-President Smith the Regents granted an extension of leave without salary for the calendar year 1973 to Sami
Erol Gelenbe, Assistant Professor of Computer Engineering, to
fulfill a two-year foreign residency requirement before he can
return to the United States as a permanent resident.
R. W. Fleming    On recommendation of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs
Leave  the Regents approved a leave of absence from January 1, 1973,
through February 28, 1973, for President R. W. Fleming.
President Fleming indicated that Vice-President Smith would
be handling his (the President's) administrative responsibilities
during his absence. The Regents had previously agreed to have
Regent Gertrude Huebner chair the two Regents' meetings scheduled for this period.
R. F. Malcolmson   On recommendation of President Fleming endorsed by ViceLeave President Smith the Regents approved a leave of absence from
May 1, 1973, to August 31, 1973, for Reginald F. Malcolmson,

on Honorary Degrees of candidates to receive honorary degrees Honorary Degrees
at the May and August 1973 Commencements and of a possible
candidate for an honorary degree at the December 1973 Commencement.
Regent Nederlander asked that Vice-President Smith undertake a thorough review with the appropriate internal groups of the
whole question of conferring honorary degrees in the future.
X. FINANCE-PROPERTY
On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents Advances to
Lawyers Club
approved continuation of the advances from the Temporary In- Extended

Richard Little of the University Architect's office reviewed Institute for Social
the various planning alternatives that had been considered in the Research Building
discussions concerning additional space for the Institute for Social
Research.
In answer to an inquiry by Regent Cudlip, Dr. Angus Campbell, Director of the Institute for Social Research, explained the
basic research functions of the Institute.
President Fleming added that the Institute was probably the
most distinguished one of its kind in the world today.




190


DECEMBER MEETING, 1972


The Regents authorized a building project of approximately
51,000 square feet for expansion of the Institute.
Plant Sevice  On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents
authorized construction of an industrial-type building of approximately 14,000 square feet on a site west of the Central Heating
Plant to house Building Services and Trades Repair personnel.
Chemistry   On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents
Building
Renovation authorized the renovation of the Chemistry Building and the appointment of Charles W. Sherman Associates of Birmingham for
architectural work on the project.
FStudenberg   Vice-President Pierpont reported that gifts and pledges, iny eer  luding Medical School funds and a grant of $100,000 from the
federal government, now total $1,113,335.25 for the Furstenberg
Student Study Center in the Medical Center. Bids have been
solicited and are to be opened December 21, 1972, and will be
presented to the Regents in January for authorization to award
a contract.
Investment   Vice-President Pierpont filed a report on temporary investments and presented the semiannual review of investment programs for the major endowment funds, the Total Return Fund,
and the retirement funds. The Regents accepted the review and
approved the recommendations set forth in it (R.P. 1969-72, p.
1504).
rDivisio Street  On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents
authorized negotiations for the purchase of the properties at 517
South Division Street and 425 South Division Street, Ann Arbor.
Property Purchase  Regent Robert Brown moved adoption of the following resolution:
Proposals and discussions have been held in recent weeks concerning
the development of Coordinated Family Planning Services in Ann Arbor.
These discussions have involved the possible purchase by The University
of Michigan of the University Motel with a lease of about one-half of the
property to go to the community groups who would provide these services.
The Regents reaffirm their policy of purchasing property only for University use and decline to take any action on this specific proposal.
The Regents have not followed in the past the practice of property
purchases which anticipate a lease to outside groups as a necessary part of
the purchase.
Regent Cudlip seconded the motion and it was adopted, with
Regent Dunn voting no.
XI. OTHER
Organization  The Regents approved a contributing membership in the
Membership Center for Arabic Study Abroad Consortium from September 1,




DECEMBER MEETING, 1972


191


1972, through August 31, 1973. Regents Dunn and Lindemer
voted no.
The Regents approved the following revised Sec. 14.11. The          BylawsRevised
University Club of the Bylaws:                                         University Club
Sec. 14.11 The University Club. The University Club shall be maintained for the informal association of the faculty, staff, students, alumni,
and alumnae of the various schools and colleges of the University. By providing a variety of opportunities for these groups to associate, the Club
shall serve to integrate the interests they have in common as members of
the University community.
In order to facilitate its operations the Club is authorized to retain
its form as a corporation under the laws of the State of Michigan, adapting
its charter and bylaws to the purpose here stated and conforming to the
general bylaws of the Board. In accordance with its bylaws the Club shall
be in the charge of a Board of Directors consisting of fifteen persons
elected from its membership and approved by the Board of Regents. The
Board of the Club shall elect a President, Vice-President, Secretary, and
Treasurer from among its members. The Board shall be responsible for
the management of the Club and the maintenance and control of its property
and shall undertake, through revenue from dues and other sources, to meet
its expenses.
Standards of eligibility for membership in the University Club shall
be set forth in the Club's bylaws.
The Regents adopted the following resolution:                       Cultural Living
Units
WHEREAS, for many years, in order to enhance learning experiences,
learning and cooperative living centers have been successfully sponsored by
and operated under the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; and
WHEREAS, there may in the future be occasion for the establishment
of similar facilities, and possibly of cultural living units, under the sponsorship of any school or college; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Regents feels that the importance of such
units suggests a present statement of policy with respect to their organization
and operation in any housing owned or operated by the University;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED
That the organization and operation of existing learning and living
centers and subsequently organized learning and living and cultural and
living centers be encouraged when the criteria and standards hereinafter set
forth are complied with:
1. There shall be no discrimination on grounds of race, color, religion,
creed, national origin, or ancestry in any such unit.
2. The President of the University is directed to ascertain that selection
procedures for language or cultural houses as well as for other types of
University housing are reviewed annually to ensure that they reflect the
policies of the University with respect to housing and equal opportunity.
3. The University shall continue to require in-residence housing staff
members to attend in-service training sessions on intergroup relations,
problem solving, and awareness of racial cultures.
4. Any group interested in establishing a unit of the type mentioned
above shall apply to the appropriate department of a school or college, and
if approved by it to the school or college itself, and if approved by it to
the Vice-President for Academic Affairs. The proposal must revolve around
a cultural theme for which there must exist educationally relevant prerequisites.




192


DECEMBER MEETING, 1972


5. If the proposal is finally approved, the academic unit of the University which is involved shall, in the case of any residential units proposed
in the future of the type mentioned above, make a proposal to the Board
of Rzgents outlining the nature of the proposed program which must be
compatible with available resources and definitely related to the educational
program for which achievement is sought.
6. If the proposed plan is approved by the Board of Regents, it shall
be forwarded to the Vice-President for Student Services, who shall make
the necessary arrangements for implementing the proposal. The final arrangements in all respects shall be similar to those now in effect between existing
learning and living units and the Housing Office of the University.
Regent Lindemer voted no.
In connection with the policy statement on cultural living
units President Fleming indicated that Francis Kornegay of the
Detroit Urban League had indicated his opposition to the position.
He also indicated that, when the policy statement had been sent
to the Civil Rights Commission, the Commission indicated that it
met with their approval.
Natural Resources  Vice-President Smith reported that the Dean of the School of
Associate
Deanship Natural Resources had requested the establishment of the position
of associate dean. The Regents indicated that they would not
disapprove of the establishment of such a position and would
await the Dean's recommendation for an appointment to the post.
Minority   President Fleming distributed a report compiled by Dr. William
Enrollment
Cash on the status of minority enrollment at the University. He
noted that the report was for information and review by the
Regents and that a news release had been made of it. He also
noted that the report indicates that we are running somewhat
behind our minority enrollment projection. One of the reasons
for this appears to be a dropout rate which seems to include many
minority students who have left the University although they
were in good academic standing. A survey of these students is now
being undertaken in an attempt to determine their reasons for
leaving.
Regent Waters said that he was quite dissatisfied with the
report because the statistics quoted in it were so indefinite. He felt
that a much more accurate job could have been done. President
Fleming pointed out the difficulty of obtaining information on
minority enrollment, since presently we are not allowed to collect
racial data.


Racial
Designation on
Employment
Forms


The President then introduced Dr. Nellie Varner, who is
Director of the University's Affirmative Action Program. Dr.
Varner explained that it was her feeling that in order to ensure
appropriate compliance with federal affirmative action directives,
it would be necessary to include racial designations on employment forms. This would enable her to, provide much more accurate
statistics on the University's efforts to recruit and employ minor



DECEMBER MEETING, 1972


193


ity personnel. She indicated that her informal discussions with
the Civil Rights Commission had been largely affirmative on this
question. She felt that individuals would still have the right to
refuse to respond to a question on racial designation.
Several of the Regents commented on Dr. Varner's suggestion,
indicating that care must be taken to see that such a practice
would be allowed under the laws of the state.
In answer to other questions, Dr. Varner stated that it was
her opinion that there were probably few, if any, state agencies
using this practice, although, if the matter were up to her, she
would go ahead and implement this suggestion.
The Regents generally agreed that we ought to initiate such a
practice, at least until we have some indication that it is illegal
or inappropriate.
It was moved by Regent Lindemer that racial designation be
included on employment forms. Regent Cudlip         seconded the
motion.
In the discussion Regent Nederlander indicated that, before
he approved such a motion, he wanted to see a detailed legal
opinion on the question as well as a survey of the practices of
other public agencies in the state.
Regent Dunn then moved that the motion be tabled for one
month. That motion was seconded by Regent Robert Brown and
adopted, with Regents Cudlip, Lindemer, and Waters abstaining.
Regent Robert Brown then introduced the following resolution:
WILLIAM   BYRNES CUDLIP of Grosse Pointe Shores completes a     Regent Cudlip
nine-year term on the Board of Regents at the present meeting.     Commended
An alumnus of the Michigan Law School in the class of 1926, Regent
Cudlip has since been associated with a single firm-Dickinson, Wright,
McKean and Cudlip-of which he became a partner in 1933. He has been
steadily active in the legal and business life of Detroit, has exercised professional leadership in the formulation of laws governing financial institutions
and small businesses, has assisted in a compilation of Michigan statutes, and
was an influential delegate and committeeman of the Michigan Constitutional
Convention.
As a member of this Board, Regent Cudlip has shown a most intimate
and fostering concern for his alma mater. He served, for example, on a
major gifts committee of the $55 Million campaign and has undertaken
a survey of the legal status of the University-The University of Michigan:
Its Legal Profile, published here in 1969. His fellows on the Board are conscious of a special tenor of earnestness and devotion that has characterized
every aspect of his service. They further deeply appreciate his unfailing
personal courtesy and geniality over the years. They tender now their abiding
affection and gratitude to this esteemed colleague, counselor, gentleman,
and friend.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1972


There was a unanimous second and the resolution was adopted
unanimously.
President Fleming stated that William Cudlip was one of the
two Regents with whom he had had his initial contact upon coming
to the University. He said that no one had ever been kinder to or
more supportive of him    during his presidency. He expressed his
deep gratitude for Mr. Cudlip's warm       friendship and for the
dedicated service he has given the University.
All the above actions were by unanimous vote unless expressly
stated otherwise.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents reported for the month of November 1972 totaled
$1,152.65.
The Regents adjourned to meet on January 18 and 19.

APPENDIX A
OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison
Conferred November 18, 1972
PHILIP COOLIDGE BROOKS, Bachelor of Arts in the Class of 1928;
recntly retired as Director of the Harry S Truman Library and as Secretary
of the Harry S Truman Library Institute. He now serves on the Board of
that Institute and as a consultant to the National Archives and Records
Service in Washington.
Having completed his academic training at the University of California
and built up his practical knowledge by working with historical records in
Europe and the United States, Dr. Brooks became one of the first staff
members of the National Archives when these were opened in 1935. He
remained with national archival and records services in various capacities
until 1957. During fourteen subsequent years, as director of the Truman
Library and secretary of the institute attached to it, he created a model of
archival accumulation and preservation and a fruitful center of historical
scholarship. He is one of the founders of the archivist's profession in a
nation coming belatedly to assemble and cherish its annals.
The University acknowledges his dedication, his technical skill, and his
generous services to historical scholarship as it tenders Dr. Brooks this Outstanding Achievement Award.
KENNETH MILLAR, Master of Arts in the Class of 1942, Doctor of
Philosophy in 1951; mystery writer.
With due apologies for violating Kenneth Millar's first principle of
literary composition, we instantly reveal him as the pseudonymous Ross
Macdonald, whose primacy as a writer of mystery fiction is not to be challenged in the United States and possibly not in the world. Exercising a superb
literary tact, he has uniformly satisfied his readers' demand for perfectly
articulated problems of crime detection while supplying the precise degrees
of character differentiation and sentiment that the genre of mystery fiction
requires. He has reaped, in consequence, an international reputation and an
appropriate harvest of awards from his fellow mystery writers both here
and in England.
His sympathetic involvement in the well-being of his fellow men and
of nature betokens also the harmonious ordering of his own life, so that
the University may again fittingly penetrate the disguise of Ross Macdonald
and affectionately honor the man Kenneth Millar with this Outstanding
Achievement Award.
THE VERY REVEREND WALTER JOSEPH ZIEMBA, Master of
Arts in Library Science in the Class of 1953, Doctor of Philosophy in 1966;
Rector of Saints Cyril and Methodius Seminary, President of Saint Mary's
College, and Superintendent of Saint Mary's Preparatory at Orchard Lake,
Michigan.
Father Ziemba, whose teachers remember him alike for his charm and
brilliance, has taught an astonishing diversity of courses with effortless
aplomb and proved a capable and inspiring educational administrator. His
own singular breadth and humanity have qualified him, furthermore, for a
ministry of ethnic reconciliation, of which his office as director of the newly
founded Center for Polish Studies and Culture now forms a prominent part.
As the symbol of our national unity ceases in some degree to be the melting
pot and becomes rather a mosaic of people, each with its distinctive mode of
self-realization, this man of genuinely ecumenical temperament and talent
serves for the symbol as well as the agent of a hopeful American future.
The University takes particular pleasure in honoring him now with
an Outstanding Achievement Award.

Vice-President Pierpont placed on file his monthly reports on
investment transactions, plant extension, litigation, and personnellabor relations.
Personnel-Labor   In connection with his report on personnel-labor relations,
Relations Vice-President Pierpont acknowledged the comments of Charles
McCracken, President of AFSCME Local 1583, at the public
comments session on the previous day. He agreed that there were
indeed several problems but indicated that the personnel staff and
the union staff were working to resolve them.
Some of these problems lend themselves to quicker solutions
than others. The question of temporary help is one of the more
serious items under discussion. It results from differing procedures
being utilized by the many different units throughout the University.
Vice-President Pierpont stated that the UM-News error in
wage rate increases cited by Mr. McCracken had already been
acknowledged, and arrangements for a correction have been made.




JANUARY MEETING, 1973


199


The issue of fingerprinting is one which was brought about by
the Security Department's suggestion to try various new techniques in order to reduce theft losses. Again, the procedures are
experimental and differ from one unit to another. These differences
do cause concern on the part of the union.
The discrepancy noted by Mr. McCracken in the University
reports to the Wage Board resulted from the union's misunderstanding as to what those reports called for. The Wage Board
requires the University to estimate the probable cost of sick time
and these estimates were used in the report.
Vice-President Pierpont concluded by saying that, if any of the
Regents had any questions, he would be happy to respond. In the
meantime, the personnel staff and others would continue to work
toward resolving the differences which periodically arise between
the University and the unions.
Vice-President Overberger filed his monthly listing of grants
and contracts for research.
Vice-President Radock filed his monthly report on the Office
of University Relations and Development.
Commenting on his report, Vice-President Radock noted that
radio station WUOM would begin broadcasting in stereo and for
longer hours, thanks largely to gifts received from the Friends
of WUOM/WVGR.
Regent Nederlander commented that in the report on private
support to Michigan institutions of higher education the University was reported as receiving nine times as much in private support as any other Michigan institution. He commended the development Office staff for this accomplishment.

Secretary Kennedy reported the retirements of three faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted:
S. A. Cain    Stanley A. Cain, Charles Lathrop Pack Professor of Conservation, ProRetirement fessor of Botany, and Director of the Institute for Environmental Quality,
has finally been allowed to retire as of January 1, 1973.
Born in 1902 in Indiana, Professor Cain took his Bachelor of Science
degree at Butler University in 1924. He subsequently taught at Butler while
earning his master's and doctor's degrees at the University of Chicago in
1927 and 1930, respectively. His teaching and research then took him to
Indiana University (1931-35), the University of Tennessee (1935-45), Biarritz
American Army University in France (1945-46), and Cranbrook Institute
of Science (1946-50) before he joined The University of Michigan in 1950




JANUARY MEETING, 1973


207


as the first chairman of the new Department of Conservation in the School
of Natural Resources.
Unquestionably Professor Cain must be regarded as one of the most
eminent resource ecologists and environmentalists in the world today. He has
served as an advisor and consultant to government and scientific organizations
throughout the world and has been honored by many. In 1965 President
Lyndon Johnson named him Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish
and Wildlife, a post he held until 1968. His many recognitions include a
Guggenheim fellowship in 1940, the University's Distinguished Faculty
Achievement Award in 1959, and honorary degrees from Williams and Drury
colleges, Butler University, and the University of Montreal.
Since coming to the University, Professor Cain has been at the forefront
in the development of the curriculum in conservation as well as of undergraduate courses in ecology. And all of this long before the environment
became an issue of such vital public concern. His career culminated in his
appointment as Director of the University's new Institute for Environmental
Quality in 1970. This new task delayed his retirement, and in performing it
Professor Cain demonstrated once more his characteristic vigor and dedication as he helped to establish the Institute as a major new tool in facilitating
multidisciplinary research and instructional activities relating to the human
environment.
The Regents join his many colleagues the world over in extending their
gratitude to Professor Cain for his distinguished service to all mankind, and
they take great pride in naming him Professor Emeritus of Conservation,
Professor Emeritus of Botany, and Director Emeritus of the Institute for
Environmental Quality.
Otto K. Engelke, Assistant Professor of Public Health Administration,  0. K. Engelke
has retired from the University as of December 31, 1972.                  Retirement
Dr. Engelke was born in Cincinnati in 1909 and received his B.S. and
M.D. degrees from that city's university in 1930 and 1933, respectively. He
engaged in the practice of general medicine from 1934 to 1937 and then
became Director of the Health Department for Adams County in Ohio, where
he remained until 1939. He received a master's degree in public health from
The University of Michigan in 1941 and in that same year was named
Director of the Washtenaw County Health Department. In 1943 he was
named to a part-time instructorship in the School of Public Health and was
promoted to assistant professor in 1947.
While his major responsibilities have been to direct the public health
programs of the City of Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County, he has maintained his part-time association with the University, and his many students
in his public health practice courses have been the better for it. He has
been a highly satisfactory teacher and is respected by his many colleagues
in the School of Public Health and in professional associations as well.
The Regents extend their grateful acknowledgment for his years of
service and warmly tender him the title Assistant Professor Emeritus of
Public Health Administration.
William Muschenheim, who has been associated continuously with the    William
University for the past twenty-two years as Professor of Architecture, begins  Muschenheim
his formal retirement this month.                                         Retirement
A native of New York City, Professor Muschenheim was born in 1902.
He received his academic training at Williams College (1919-21), the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1921-24), and the Behrens Master
School of Architecture at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, where he
received the Master of Architecture degree in 1929.
While pursuing his academic training, he served as a designer for the
Arthur Korn architectural firm in Berlin, Germany, and with Peabody, Wil

son, and Brown in New York City. After a brief association with the Joseph
Urban architectural firm of New York, he continued his own private practice
from 1934 until his appointment by the University as Professor of Architecture in 1950.
During his tenure with the University, he has been a devoted teacher,
developing genuine intellectual interest in his students and impressing them
with the need for meticulous attention to detail. He has contributed generously to improvement in his courses, particularly those in urban design. In
1964 he was elected a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and in
1971 received the Sol King Award, which recognizes superior performance
in teaching.
The Regents now honor his splendid record of accomplishment as they
name him Professor Emeritus of Architecture.
VIs. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported the deaths of Professor Alexander
W. Allison, his wife Nancy, and their son Charles in an automobile
accident on January 1, 1973. The following memorial statement
was adopted:
A. W. Allison   The University community was stunned by the news of the accident
Memoir which took the lives of Professor Alexander W. Allison, his wife Nancy, and
their son Charles on January 1, 1973.
Born on August 4, 1919, at Kuling, Kiangsi, China, Professor Allison
was graduated from the Shanghai American School in 1937 and received his
bachelor's degree from Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia in 1941. During
World War II, he served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy and then
returned to graduate studies at the University of Virginia, receiving his doctorate there in 1949. Professor Allison immediately joined the faculty of The
University of Michigan's English Department as an instructor, rising successively through the ranks of assistant professor in 1954 and associate professor
in 1964 to full professor in 1970. In 1958-59 he was also a visiting lecturer
at Kalamazoo College. In addition to his teaching responsibilities, he
served as Assistant to the Secretary of the University since 1959.
Professor Allison was a superior teacher, being particularly effective with
honors students and in his assistance to doctoral candidates in the writing
of their dissertations. As a scholar he was an acknowledged authority on
seventeenth- and eighteenth-century poetry, with his book on Waller still
considered one of the standard works in its field.
Perhaps, though, Professor Allison will be best remembered for literally
hundreds of characterizations which he authored during his tenure as Assistant to the Secretary of the University. Upon presidents, princes, colleagues, and others being honored by the University, he showered an endless
litany of phrases that sparkled with a wit and grace which will live long
in the annals of the University.
The Regents, officers, faculty, and students of the University grieve at
so great and tragic a loss. They tender their deepest sympathies to the families of Alexander and Nancy Allison and their son Charles.
L. J. Hamilton   Secretary Kennedy reported the death of Professor Louis J.
Memoir Hamilton on January 13, 1973. The following memorial statement
was adopted:
The Regents of the University extend their deepest sympathies to the
wife, children, and family of Louis J. Hamilton, Associate Professor of
Nuclear Engineering, who fell victim to cancer on January 13, 1973, at the
age of thirty-one.




JANUARY MEETING, 1973


209


Seldom has the University ever lost so promising an individual. A brief
glance at his young academic career gives ample evidence of his obvious
potential. He received his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering
in 1964 and his Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in Nuclear
Engineering in 1966 and 1968, respectively, all from the University of California at Berkeley. He was appointed Assistant Professor of Nuclear Engineering at The University of Michigan in 1968, received the Engineering
College's Class of 1938 Distinguished Service Award for his teaching in 1970,
and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1972.
While his time was short, his contributions are worthy of a scholar
and teacher of many more years. His students acclaimed the excellence of
his teaching and his colleagues marveled at the quality and breadth of his
research and writings. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and his undergraduate and graduate studies were recognized through scholarships and
fellowships from the State of California, the Scaife Foundation, the Atomic
Energy Commission, and the National Science Foundation.
The University community finds in the career of Professor Hamilton a
rare and wonderful example of a person who made the most of every minute
of his life. It indeed is a lesson to us all.
Secretary Kennedy reported the death of Professor Karl F.
Zeisler on December 23, 1972. The following memorial statement
was adopted:
The Regents of the University sorrowfully acknowledge the death of  K. F. Zeisler
Karl F. Zeisler, Professor of Journalism, on December 23, 1972.         Memoir
Professor Zeisler was born in 1903 in Lancaster, Ohio, and attended
Michigan State Normal College in Ypsilanti before transferring to and
graduating summa cum laude from The University of Michigan in 1926. He
supported himself through college as a newspaper correspondent and continued as a journalist after graduation, serving successively with the International News Service, San Jose Mercury Herald, Pontiac Daily Press, and
Monroe Evening News. In 1948 he began his teaching career as a visiting
lecturer in the University's Department of Journalism and in 1952 was
named associate professor. He was elevated to the rank of professor in 1958.
It was said of Professor Zeisler that he was a journalist's journalist. A
brief study of his career reveals him to be all that and a great deal more.
He was a prolific writer, historian, and authority on community organization;
he was continually involved in efforts to aid youth. This unrelenting dedication to young people rendered him a beloved teacher to countless students
who never hesitated to seek his counsel even after leaving the University.
His colleagues grieve at the loss of one of their peers who never let them
relax their efforts to improve constantly the quality and integrity of the
journalism profession. The Regents now join his faculty associates and friends
in honoring his memory. They also extend their heartfelt sympathy to Mrs.
Zeisler, his children, and his grandchildren.
VIII. OFF-CAMPUS ASSIGNMENTS AND LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Five off-campus assignments and 109 leaves of absence were
reported to the Regents.
On recommendation of the Assistant Director of the Institute        F. c. Mann
for Social Research and the Vice-President for Research endorsed Leave

The Regents approved the recommendation of Vice-President
Smith that the Registrar's Office be authorized on a continuing
basis to post degrees and issue transcripts to those who receive
degrees at the end of a term as soon as school and college certification is complete. The final degree lists will be submitted to
the Regents for confirmation at the meeting following completion
of the lists (R.P., 1969-72, p. 1327).
X. FINANCE-PROPERTY
On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents
adopted the following resolution:


A. P. Turner    RESOLVED that, inasmuch as The University of Michigan has accepted
Bequest a residuary bequest from the estate of Amy Prudden Turner subject to
certain conditions expressed in the will of said decedent, one of which is
stated in subsection 6 of section B of article 6 of said will as follows:
I direct that in the event of any of said The Regents of The University of Michigan, said Michigan College of Mining and Technology, or
said The Sparrow Memorials and Endowment Foundation accepts the
bequest made to it for any of the purposes hereinabove set forth, but
thereafter does not expend or irrevocably commit itself to expend such
bequest or any part thereof for the purpose for which the same was
accepted within four years after the date of the death of the survivor of
my said husband and myself, then all or such unexpended or uncommitted balance of the bequest made to any such institution shall lapse

bid (p. 190).




JANUARY MEETING, 1973


211


Vice-President Pierpont presented a report on temporary investments made since his December 15, 1972, report (p. 190).
It was accepted and placed on file.
Vice-President Pierpont described the problem of attempting
to develop a satisfactory investment program for a number of
relatively small life-income gifts to the University. He noted that
the 1969 Tax Reform Act now made it possible to consolidate
many of these life-income gifts, allowing for a pooled investment
program which would benefit not only the beneficiaries but the
University as well.
The Regents on a motion by Regent Nederlander approved
in principle the establishment of a Pooled Life Income Fund with
appropriate operating procedures to be worked out and reported
to the Regents at a later date. The motion was seconded by Regent
Robert Brown and adopted unanimously.
On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents
adopted the following resolution:
RESOLVED that, because of the temporary absence of President
Fleming, Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer Wilbur K. Pierpont be
and he alone is hereby authorized, pursuant to Bylaws 3.07(1) and 3.07(3),
to execute and deliver to Alton Powell, George Parisian, and Richard
Parisian, as tenants in common, a warranty deed to the following described
premises in the City of Lansing, County of Ingham:
That part of the East /2 of the Southwest ~ of Section 26, T4N,
R2W, described as: Beginning at the Northwest corner of said East 2
of Southwest %, thence South 120 rods, thence East 20 rods, thence
North 120 rods, and thence West 20 rods to the place of beginning,
EXCEPT a parcel of land in the Northwest corner thereof, 8 rods East
and West by 20 rods North and South.

Vice-President Smith noted that the Regents had reviewed
the letter of President Fleming to Mr. Don Canham which outlined the basic plan for the expansion of athletic and recreational
facilities. He noted also that the Regents had heard the discussion
on the previous day when the proposals had been elaborated on
by Mr. Canham and the supporting recommendations received


Athletic and
Recreational
Facilities




212


JANUARY MEETING, 1973


from  Mr. Joel Greer on behalf of the Advisory Committee on
Recreation, Intramurals, and Club Sports, and from Dr. Dorin
Hinerman on behalf of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics. As a result of these discussions and recommendations,
Regent Paul Brown moved the following resolution, which was
seconded by Regent Robert Brown and adopted unanimously:
The Regents have considered the proposals for increasing recreation
and athletic facilities on the Ann Arbor campus of the University. They appreciate the thought and study these proposals have received from various
groups on campus, particularly the Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics and the Advisory Committee on Recreation, Intramurals, and Club
Sports.
The Regents resolve that Mr. Canham and Vice-President Pierpont and
their staffs recommend for approval appropriate architects who would undertake necessary planning studies and cost estimates for
1. a major new intramural facility to be located in the North Campus
area
2. the conversion of Yost Field House to a year-round ice-skating
facility
3. the construction of an addition to Yost Field House to house track
facilities, indoor tennis courts, and other appropriate activities
4. the remodeling of the present ice rink (Coliseum) to house intramural
and recreational activities such as basketball, various other court sports, and
related activities.
It is expected that upon the completion of such studies recommendations
appropriately supported by the Board in Control and ACRICS, which
would include cost estimates and source of funding, will be brought to
the Regents.
It is understood that no construction of any of the foregoing facilities
will be undertaken until the Regents are assured that all phases of this
program are found to be feasible and that adequate financial resources
are available to implement each of these projects.
It is also understood that the Executive Officers will explore a variety
of funding sources for accomplishing these proposals, including private
gifts, state and Federal sources, student fees, intercollegiate athletic
department revenues, and user fees.
In commenting on the resolution Regent Robert Brown stated
his hope that the University could now move forward and accomplish all these proposals, thereby taking a significant step
toward meeting the very great need which exists on the campus
for such facilities. He hoped that all elements of the University
community would continue the unanimity of their support so that
all the proposals could be implemented.
Penalty Fee on   Vice-President Pierpont commented on the problem           raised
Delinquent
Student Accounts during the public comments session on Thursday with regard to
the penalty fee charged on delinquent student accounts. He noted
that elimination of such a fee or revisions in present practices
were more difficult than appeared at first glance. He said that his
staff was working on the problem and expected to have a report




JANUARY MEETING, 1973


213


for the Regents this spring. Any needed revisions could then take
effect by next fall.
Regent Huebner indicated that the Regents had discussed the  Meeting
issue of meeting procedures raised the previous day by Student  Reaffirmed
Government Council's acting attorney. She indicated that in response the Regents wished to reaffirm their policy with regard
to meeting procedures. She stated the policy as follows:
It is the current policy of the Board of Regents to conducts its business
as directed by the Constitution of the State of Michigan and in accordance
with Regental Bylaws which require that "all formal sessions shall be open
to the public." Agendas are released in advance and an opportunity is provided for those who desire to address the Board of Regents at the public
comments session.
The Board will continue to have such informal sessions as are appropriate.
Vice-President Smith commented on the recent widespread      Credit by
publicity given the decision of the Literary College to undertake
a program of providing credit by examination. He noted that some
news reports had distorted the facts and he indicated that, consequently, he would arrange to have Dean Frank Rhodes and his
colleagues meet with the Regents in February to review this topic.
Regent Dunn commented that, while he did not disagree with
the decision of the college, he thought it might have been more
appropriate had the matter been discussed with the Regents prior
to its public release.
Regent Dunn then reminded the Board that they had tabled     Racial
the motion calling for a decision on whether to include racial    sg
designation on employment forms (p. 193).
Secretary Kennedy stated that this matter had not been placed
on the agenda because the University was still awaiting final
reports on practices of other public agencies in the state. He indicated that the matter would be on the February agenda.
All the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation and other costs
for the Regents reported for the month of December 1972 totaled
$1,545.10.
The Regents adjourned to meet on February 15 and 16.

APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREE
Characterization by Alexander W. Allison
Conferred December 17, 1972
HAROLD GLENN BIXBY, Bachelor of Arts in the Class of
1927; Chairman of the Ex-Cell-O Corporation.
After rising steadily through the ranks of his corporation, Mr.
Bixby served as its chief executive officer for some twenty fruitful
years and assumed concurrently a fostering role in the total industrial and financial life of metropolitan Detroit. Himself continuing to live in that city, moreover, he has lent not his name
only but long labor and tireless energy to civic and humane causes
there-his charity beginning, though by no means ending, at
home. He has endeared himself to his Alma Mater, finally, by a
loyalty that transcends even our current educational vagaries: he
is our friend for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness
and in health.
Few men indeed have served such a diversity of institutions
and causes so faithfully and well. Upon him, in response to an
astonishingly wide and various demand, the University affectionately confers the degree Doctor of Laws.

for members of the instructional staff whose primary occupations
are not with the University. Their responsibility normally involves instruction in only one course each. Their employment
with the University is therefore incidental to their primary occupational interests, which are outside the University (Bylaw       Sec.

Industrial and Operations Engineering, to go on retirement furlough for the University year 1973-74 and to retire at the end
of that year at age sixty-six.
c. H. LaMore     On recommendation of the Dean of the College of ArchiRetirement
Furlough  tecture and Design endorsed by Vice-President Smith the Regents

go on retirement furlough for the University year 1973-74 and
to retire at the end of that year, on June 30, 1974, one month
before his sixty-sixth birthday.
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of Dorothy C. W.
Schroeder. The following memoir was adopted:
D. C. W. Schroeder   Dorothy C. W. Schroeder, Professor of Social Work, completed twentyRetirement  one very active years on the faculty of the University in June of 1972.
Miss Schroeder came to the University in 1951 as an assistant professor;
already she had amassed a broad range of experience as a teacher, researcher,
and practitioner in her profession. She immediately set about the task of
developing a specialization in psychiatric social work, which quickly achieved
not only popularity among students but national recognition for its quality.
Professor Schroeder received her academic training at Vassar (A.B.
1927) and Smith colleges (M.S.W. 1936). Her professional experience includes service as Girl Scout Director at White Plains, New York; mental
hygienist with the Connecticut State Department of Health; and Assistant
Director of the Cleveland Guidance Center.
It did not take the administration of the School of Social Work long
to recognize the excellence of Miss Schroeder's contributions and to promote
her to associate professor in 1953 and to full professor in 1958. Her career




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1973


295


was marked with a particular ability to translate social science theory into
a rational practicum for the social work student. She shared her rare talents
generously with her colleagues in numerous professional associations and
governmental agencies.
The Regents now join her peers and students alike in acclaiming her
years of dedication as they bestow upon her the title Professor Emeritus of
Social Work.
VII. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported the death of Peter R. Mattis on           P. R. Mattis
January 27, 1973. The following memorial statement was adopted: 
The Regents of the University sadly acknowledge the sudden and untimely death of Peter R. Mattis, Assistant Professor of Psychology, on
January 27, 1973, at the age of thirty.
Dr. Mattis was born in New York City and was graduated with a
bachelor's degree from Queen's College of The City University of New York.
He took his graduate work at The Ohio State University, receiving his
master's and doctor's degrees in psychology in 1966 and 1968, respectively.
Prior to joining the faculty of The University of Michigan in 1970, he served
on the faculty of The Ohio State University and was Chief Psychologist
and Director of Training at the Columbus Mental Health Center.
His forte was community psychology and his expertise was generously
expended for the benefit not only of his students but of the community at
large. He served as a consultant to the Ann Arbor Police Department and
on the staff of the Washtenaw County Community Mental Health Center.
Though his time was brief, his contributions to the improvement of community life warrant grateful acknowledgment.
The Regents join Dr. Mattis's colleagues and students in extending their
deepest sympathies to his surviving family.
Secretary Kennedy reported the death of John F. Simpson on           J. F. Simpson
January 25, 1973. The following memorial statement was adopted:            emor
The Regents grieve at the tragic loss of yet another vital young faculty
member as they acknowledge the death of Dr. John F. Simpson, Associate
Professor of Neurology, who sustained fatal injuries in an automobile
accident on January 25, 1973, at the age of forty-four.
Dr. Simpson was a native of Denver, Colorado, and spent much of his
early life in Wausau, Wisconsin. He received his baccalaureate and medical
training at the University of Wisconsin and served his internship and an
internal medicine residency at Boston City Hospital. He came to Ann Arbor
as a resident in neurology in 1961 and became a teaching associate in the
Medical School in 1962. He rose to instructor in 1964, assistant professor
in 1966, and associate professor in 1969.
Few individuals have successfully achieved an equal distinction as a
teacher, researcher, administrator, and practitioner. Dr. Simpson accomplished this with a vitality that commanded the praise and admiration of
students, colleagues, and patients alike. His knowledge of medicine and his
specialty were continually enriched by ceaseless study and a profound
enthusiasm for his work. His teaching not only drew the plaudits of his
students but also inculcated in them a dedication similar to his own.
Dr. Simpson was relentless in his pursuit of knowledge that would lead
to the control of the insidious diseases of the nervous system. And with
equal verve did he discharge his administrative responsibilities, both within
his department and to the general faculty as well. Still he had time to minister to his patients in the time-honored tradition of his profession.




296


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1973


The Regents join now a legion of students, colleagues, and patients in
expressing to Dr. Simpson's wife and children their heartfelt sympathies.
ViH1. OFF-CAMPUS ASSIGNMENTS AND LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Six off-campus assignments and six leaves of absence were

X. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Library   Vice-President Pierpont directed the Regents' attention to the
Renovation two construction phases involved in the major renovation of the
General Library. One phase involves a complete internal renovation, including new wiring, plumbing, heating, and other mechanical services.
The other phase, external renovation, was reviewed by Richard Little of the Architect's Office. He used models and drawings
to show the addition of stair towers, elevator towers, and two new
entry ramps designed to accommodate the handicapped. He also
pointed out that the main entry doors would be changed to
accommodate students in wheelchairs.
Vice-President Pierpont pointed out that, if the Regents
approved this project, it would go next to the Joint Capital Outlay Committee for approval. The project has already been approved for funding by the state. Regent Lindemer moved approval




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1973


299


of the project as outlined. Regent Dunn seconded the motion and
it was unanimously approved.
Vice-President Pierpont then reported on the three-part pro- Athletic
gram for improving athletic facilities. He indicated that a committee had been appointed to study questions of location for the
proposed new intramural facility as well as to make recommendations on types of facilities to be included in the building,
bearing in mind the present funding limitations. He noted that
both questions would be discussed as part of the hearings being
scheduled by the committee.
Regarding the ice rink facility in Yost Field House, VicePresident Pierpont recommended the Regents' approval of the
engineering firm of Charles R. Beltz and Company of Detroit for
the project. Their effort would be directed at determining how
the new ice rink can be best accommodated within Yost Field
House and preparing cost estimates for the relocation. The Regents would need to approve any recommendation for actual
construction.
Similarly, Vice-President Pierpont recommended approval of
the architectural firm of Colvin, Robinson and Associates of Ann
Arbor to develop plans for the building to replace Yost Field
House. He further indicated his hope that all three aspects of the
proposal would come back to the Regents in March or April for
further action.
Regent Waters asked whether it was usual practice to recommend engineering firms and architectural firms without competitive bidding.
Vice-President Pierpont replied that it is normal procedure
for the staff to investigate several firms that have specialized in
the type of facility being contemplated. Staff members then use
their best judgment in recommending to the Regents one of those
studied. The competitive bids are, of course, always used in the
actual construction of a facility.
Regent Paul Brown indicated that he was pleased to see the
progress being made but wondered whether the committee working on the intramural facility could be expanded to include additional students so they could have more representation in recommendations for the building.
Vice-President Pierpont indicated that more students would
be added. The recommendations of Vice-President Pierpont were
then moved for adoption by Regent Dunn, seconded by Regent
Nederlander, and unanimously approved.




300


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1973


Allocations to  Vice-President Smith then presented his recommendations for
Opportunity
Program increases in student aid allocations for 1973-74 for the Opportunity Program. He indicated that the University had requested
from the state an additional $3,700,000 for student aid, $2,200,000
of which was to be allocated for the Opportunity Program. The
governor's recommendation had included an increase of only
$500,000. Regardless of this, the University needs to make advance commitments of at least $1,600,000 to meet its obligations
to the Opportunity Program. This advance commitment would
enable the Financial Aids Office and the graduate school Student
Aid Office to operate until the University can determine what the
total 1973-74 budget will be.
Regent Lindemer pointed out that it should be clear to the
Regents that in making such an advance commitment they are
saying that, unless the state legislature can be persuaded to add
to the student aid recommendation for the University, the money
to fund this allocation will have to come from some other source,
possibly from increased student fees.
Regent Nederlander noted that other sources may also need
to be tapped, such as overall cost reductions, reduced equipment
purchases, reduced salary increases, and reduced staffing.
Regent Dunn pointed out that the University's original budget
request had asked increases totaling $22,000,000 and that the
governor's recommendations amounted to $7,100,000, leaving a
difference of approximately $15,000,000.
The recommendation for advance commitments was then
moved for adoption by Regent Lindemer, seconded by Regent
Waters, and approved unanimously.
Investments  Vice-President Pierpont presented a report on temporary ineporvestments made since his January 16, 1973, report (p. 211). It
was accepted and placed on file.
Flint Campus  Chancellor Moran reviewed for the Regents the series of meetings and discussions with the Joint Capital Outlay Committee
that had led to the development of the Flint Campus Development Plan the Regents had before them. He noted in particular
that the final request of the Joint Capital Outlay Committee
called for a Campus Plan for the new riverfront site that would
contain a proposed location for the new Classroom/Office Building
already approved for funding.
Chancellor Moran stated that in response to that request The
University of Michigan-Flint was prepared to present to the
Board of Regents a recommended Campus Development Plan, an
engineering study related to utilities, and the results of a citysponsored traffic study. If the Regents approved the Campus Plan




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1973


301


as well as the recommendation for a surge building on the Court
Street site, Flint would then be in a position to meet with the
Joint Capital Outlay Committee and seek their concurrence to
begin construction on the riverfront.
Regent Dunn then moved adoption of the following resolution. Regent Lindemer seconded the motion, and the resolution
was adopted unanimously.
WHEREAS, the Board of Regents has previously authorized preparation
of a Campus Development Plan for The University of Michigan-Flint on
the Riverfront site in Flint; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Regents has authorized initiation and preliminary design work for a surge building on the Court Street site; and
WHEREAS, the University has been assured of the full cooperation of
the City Council and City Administration in acquisition of the defined
Riverfront site; and
WHEREAS, the Joint Capitol Outlay Committee has requested a comprehensive plan for development of facilities and thorough study of utilities
prior to approving the use of state funds for a Classroom/Office Building
on the Riverfront site;
BE IT RESOLVED THAT:
1. The Campus Development Plan, dated February 1973, and the siting
of the Classroom/Office Building as shown thereon is approved.
2. Negotiation and execution of a design-build contract for the surge
building, Court Street, at a total cost, including professional services, not to
exceed $400,000 nonstate funds is authorized.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT the Board of Regents expresses
its deep appreciation to the donors in Flint whose contributions have permitted the preparation of the Campus Development Plan at no cost to the
taxpayers of the State of Michigan.
Regent Baker commented that this was indeed an excellent
plan and that the Regents were very appreciative of the citizens'
support and involvement that has characterized the entire effort
to relocate the campus. Further, he felt, the concept demonstrates
an excellent example of inner-city renovation. He cautioned, however, that all bear in mind that full implementation of this plan
will require immediate and concerted effort to ensure total acquisition of the site.
XI. OTHER
Vice-President Johnson presented his recommendations for Residence Halls
residence halls rate increases for the coming academic year. Regent  Rate Increases
Nederlander asked if these rate increases had been reviewed with
Vice-President Pierpont.
Vice-President Pierpont responded that he had reviewed the
recommendations and agreed that they were necessary in order
to respond to the inevitable pressures of inflation. He noted that
there had been no increases last year and that the only alternative




302


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1973


to the rate increases would be further cuts in housing services.
There has been considerable resistance to such reductions and,
consequently, rate increases are necessary.
Regent Nederlander noted that the Regents were painfully
aware of the many pressures that combine to increase the cost
of education to individuals. In contrast, the only significant revenue increases seem to, be coming in the development area.
Regent Dunn asked whether the rate increases took into account the provisions of the new state law covering deposits. VicePresident Pierpont responded that the Housing Office has discontinued its deposit requirement, since it is nearly impossible to
develop a uniform    deposit linked to a particular room     as is
required by the state law.
Regent Dunn asked whether this new        policy would affect
occupancy. Vice-President Johnson answered that Housing was
hopeful that such would not be the case. However, until the University gains experience in this area, it will obviously continue
to be a matter of concern.
Vice-President Pierpont stated that we will still have the hold
credit procedure, which may alleviate some of the problems resulting from the lack of a deposit procedure.
Regent Nederlander moved that the recommended residence
halls rate increases be approved. The motion was seconded by
Regent Waters and approved unanimously.
Indian    Chairwoman Huebner then commented that the Regents had
eto spent considerable time discussing the issues raised during the
public comments session regarding the inappropriate exhibition
of an Indian skeleton by the Fort Wayne Historical Museum.
She asked that Regent Paul Brown read the following statement
prepared by the Regents in response to this issue:
The Regents have discussed seriously and at length the sincere request
made at the public session yesterday concerning the Indian skeleton said to
have been displayed at Fort Wayne. We are, however, uncertain of the
legal requirements or restrictions on the disposition of such materials and
uncertain of the legal rights of any potential claimant or recipient. We are
not advised as to the impact Regental action would have upon patterns of
preservation and scientific use of historic materials. We are sympathetic
to relieving and eliminating invasions of religious or cultural traditions.
We are concerned that this question be promptly and properly resolved. If
such an option is available after clarification of the legal and research
issues, the Regents are willing to consider the proper interment of the Fort
Wayne Skeleton.
The Regents ask, therefore, that appropriate members of the University
staff have prompt discussion with representatives of the petitioners in order
that the issues may be clarified and a report prepared for the Regents that
will advise us on the matters mentioned above. Pending that report, the
Regents direct that no University personnel permit public exhibition of the
skeleton.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1973

Regent Paul Brown then indicated that the Regents had been
aware of the newspaper reports of the incident during the IowaMichigan basketball game. It was noted that the incident had
been thoroughly investigated and that the newspaper accounts
had been largely untrue. The Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics, however, took advantage of the occasion to have the
Director of Athletics again discuss the matter of behavior with all
the coaches to ensure that they continue to conduct themselves in
an exemplary manner. Regent Nederlander stated that the incident had also been investigated by the Big Ten Conference, which
found no cause for action.
Regent Lindemer then commented on the proposed University
Council rules that had been discussed in a preliminary fashion on
the previous day. He quoted one of the particular rules and indicated that from a grammatical standpoint it was quite inappropriate for a university of the stature of The University of Michigan.
The Regents then unanimously commended Regent Huebner
for her excellence in chairing the Regents' meetings of January
and February.
All the above actions were by unanimous vote.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents reported for the month of January 1973 totaled $2,868.37.
The Regents adjourned to meet on March 15 and 16.

and T. R.
Trautmann Literature, Science, and the Arts endorsed by Vice-President
Leaves Smith, the Regents approved a sabbatical leave with full salary
during the 1974 winter term for James G. Greeno, Professor of
Psychology, and a sabbatical leave with half salary during the

MARCH MEETING, 1973

X. FINANCE-PROPERTY
On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents Turner Gerontology Building
approved the firm of The Warren Holmes Company and Ken- Architects
neth C. Black Associate Architects, Inc., for architectural services
for the Turner Gerontology Building (pp. 203 and 102). Regents
Lindemer and Dunn abstained.
Regent Lindemer explained that he had not known of the
details of this recommendation prior to receiving the Regents'
agenda and, since his law firm represented one of the recommendees, he felt it appropriate to abstain from voting.
Vice-President Pierpont presented a report on temporary in- Investments
vestments made since his February 16 report (p. 300). It was
accepted and placed on file.
Vice-President Pierpont discussed the background of the Oregon, Ohio,
property in Oregon, Ohio, that was bequeathed to the University
by Leger J. Metzger. He noted that the University had been given
a firm offer for the sale of the land. The Regents directed VicePresident Pierpont to have a new appraisal made of the property.
If the offer to purchase seems appropriate in relation to this new
appraisal, Vice-President Pierpont is authorized to proceed with
the sale, giving the Regents a full report at a subsequent meeting.
Vice-President Pierpont also explained to the Regents a Douglas Lake
variety of property acquisition possibilities in and around the 
Biological Station at Douglas Lake. The Regents directed VicePresident Pierpont to proceed with the optioning of a parcel of
approximately forty acres presently owned by the Methodist
Children's Home Society for a price not to exceed $200,000, subject to final confirmation by the Regents. It will also be necessary
to secure gift income to accomplish this purchase.
The Regents also directed Vice-President Pierpont to initiate
negotiations on other parcels in the Douglas Lake area, the total
purchase price of which would not exceed $100,000, subject again to
Regental confirmation and the obtaining of necessary funding
from gift sources.
Vice-President Pierpont reported to the Regents that Dean  Sugar Island
James McFadden would shortly undertake a thorough study of the  roper
University's holdings on Sugar Island in order to make appropriate
recommendations as to the best uses for this land in future years.
Chancellor Moran reviewed for the Regents the current status  Flint Campus
of the Flint Campus relocation. He noted that the Joint Capital
Outlay Committee supported the Regents' commitment to move to
the riverfront site, conditional upon several stipulations the Chancellor felt can be accomplished. He further noted that the
Cunningham-Limp Company had submitted a proposal for a
surge building of some twelve thousand square feet for a pro



322


MARCH MEETING, 1973


posed cost well under the $400,000 limit authorized by the Regents (p. 171). The proposal is now being studied pending a formal
recommendation to the Regents.
The Regents also agreed to the suggestion of Chancellor
Moran that he undertake discussions with Johnson, Johnson &
Roy of Ann Arbor to determine the firm's willingness to undertake the study and review of the present master plan in accordance
with the suggestion of the Joint Capital Outlay Committee.
XI. OTHER
RBylaws  The Secretary presented a summary of proposed changes in
the Bylaws, which the Regents approved. An updated version of
the Bylaws will now be published, after which the University
Counsel will undertake the complete revision of the Bylaws
authorized by the Regents in July (p. 24).
University  President Fleming expressed his strong recommendation that
Council
Rules the Regents approve the University Council rules. He noted that
they were the product of long hours of good faith effort on the
part of students, faculty, and administrators and represented the
best possible consensus among the groups. He agreed that there
were some problems, which the Regents had pointed out. He felt
that these could be handled best through the amendment process.
He further noted that, since the rules allow the more serious
cases to be processed through civil courts, he felt there would be
minimal use of the campus rules.
In answer to an inquiry by Regent Dunn and others, the
University Counsel, Mr. Daane, explained that the new rules
would in no way limit the legal jurisdiction of state or local
governments. Mr. Daane also clarified other points with respect
to multiple proceeding provisions. He indicated his understanding
that the rules would apply to students, faculty, and other staff
of the University.
Regent Robert Brown indicated his concern on certain points
where he felt the new rules were deficient. He stated that they do
not make any reference to the problems of violence, drugs, and
possession of weapons on campus. He felt the rules should at
least refer to applicable state and local laws covering these areas.
He further noted that under the rules there was no way to prevent persons released on bail from returning to the campus. For
these reasons and because of the lack of clarity on other points, he
felt it was not possible for him to support the University Council rules.
Regent Lindemer commented that he had expressed his own
reservations on the rules at the February meeting and felt it
unnecessary at this point to elaborate further.




MARCH MEETING, 1973


323


Regent Paul Brown moved that the rules be adopted. The
motion was seconded by Regent Huebner and adopted, with
Regents Lindemer and Robert Brown voting no.
Vice-President Johnson reviewed his recommendation with  Legal Aid
Society
respect to the Campus Branch of the Washtenaw County Legal Funding
Aid Society. He altered his recommendation somewhat, indicating
that the present level of budget support be continued and that
the requested increases. be considered at a later time, when the full
details of the new University budget are completely clear.
On a motion by Regent Dunn the Regents approved a continuation of the funding for the Legal Aid Society for a oneyear period. The motion was seconded by Regent Lindemer.
Regent Robert Brown indicated that, since this was a calendar
year budget, it should come back to the Regents for consideration in December.
The motion was adopted unanimously.
The Regents denied the appeal of Warren J. Kessler from his w. J. Kessler
Appeal Denied
classification as a nonresident student for purposes of fee assessment.
The Regents received a report of a traveling scholar program.
The Regents approved a change in the name of the Depart-  Engineering
Mechanics Dement of Engineering Mechanics to the Department of Applied  partment Name
Mechanics and Engineering Science. The departmental citation  Change
of Engineering Mechanics on the Bachelor of Science in Engineering and Master of Science in Engineering degrees will be
phased out. Remaining will be the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Engineering Science) (B.S.E.[Eng.Sci.]) degree. The
new degree title Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E. [Appl.
Mech.]) was approved.
Regent Nederlander noted that the Regents' discussion of the  niversity
University Cellar revealed that the request for a five-year extension of the rolling deposit appeared to be unnecessarily long
(R.P., 1969-72, p. 458). His own calculations brought him to
the conclusion that a three-year extension would give the University Cellar adequate time to achieve the necessary capitalization
for full operation. He felt that the Cellar was providing a useful
campus service and that the bookstore management could probably be more diligent in accomplishing internal savings. He further
stated that the Regents felt it was absolutely necessary for the
Board of Directors to understand that the deposit funding
mechanism must come to an end as soon as possible. They should
therefore understand that his motion to extend the deposit
funding for an additional three years is made with the expectation
that there would be no furher continuation.
Regent Huebner seconded the motion.




324


MARCH MEETING, 1973


Regent Robert Brown expressed his serious reservations about
the continuation of the deposit system. He couldn't see any reason
for requiring new students to pay such a deposit, feeling that it
would be much better to put such support on a voluntary basis.
He felt that the University Cellar had been given three years
to get its house in order and he did not feel that any continuation
was warranted.
Regents Waters asked how many of the Cellar's employees were
women and how many were members of minority groups. Dennis
Webster, the bookstore manager, indicated that he did not have
such statistics immediately at hand but would be happy to supply
such information. Regent Waters asked that this be done.
Regent Lindemer stated that, while he had expressed himself
previously as being opposed to the rolling deposits, he had given
the matter further thought. He felt it was possible that the
University Cellar Board may have believed that the deposit funding device would automatically be continued, since no one had
indicated to them that it would not. While he felt that this was
an improper assumption, this factor did change his own thinking
on the matter. As to the argument that the University Cellar be
thought of as an educational experience for students, Regent
Lindemer felt that the experience would be more educational if
the Cellar were forced to operate like a real business, without
any deposit subsidy. He recalled that the students originally advocating a bookstore had wanted most of all for it to be independent of the University. That runs counter to a request for continuation of the deposit mechanism by the University.
Considering all these factors, then, Regent Lindemer offered an
amendment to Regent Nederlander's motion to the effect that the
deposit system for the University Cellar be continued for an
additional two years, with the option for review and a one-year
extension at that time. In no event would the deposit mechanism
continue beyond three years.
Regents Huebner and Nederlander accepted the amendment
to their original motion.
Regent Baker commented that, if he were a student, he would
be most concerned that the University Cellar management was
requesting additional student support without offering improvement in the quality of its service. He noted that the physical
appearance of the Cellar was abysmal. He urged the management
to work diligently toward the position of independence they
espoused. If they cannot achieve such independence, he stated,
they face two alternatives-termination or outside control. He also
suggested that means be found to improve the method of returning the $5.00 deposit to students. Regent Baker summarized his
position, stating that he would support the amended motion but
wanted to see progress in the areas he had suggested.




MARCH MEETING, 1973


325


Regent Waters felt that the amended motion went too far. He
noted the difficulty in understanding what the situation would
be in two or three years and suggested that the deposit mechanism
might be found to be necessary even after that period.
The motion by Regent Nederlander as amended by Regent
Lindemer and seconded by Regent Huebner was then adopted,
with Regents Robert Brown and Waters voting no.
Regent Lindemer moved that the request to seat the President SGC Request
and Executive Vice-President of Student Government Council as
ex officio members of the Board of Regents be denied. The motion was seconded by Regent Robert Brown and was approved,
with Regent Dunn voting no.
President Fleming introduced Dr. Nellie Varner, Director of Racial Designation on EmployAffirmative Action Programs, and the proposal to place racial ment forms
designation requests on employment application forms. He noted
that, historically, requests for information of this type had been
taken off employment forms in the early days of civil rights
legislation in order to preclude the possibility of discrimination
through the use of such information. Currently, there is a need
to provide positive statistical information on race in order to
comply with certain affirmative action requirements. He noted
that the Michigan Civil Service Commission has now included such
a designation on its form. Internally, the Civil Liberties Board was
split in deliberations on the question, as was the Faculty Assembly.
The proposal does have the recommendation of the executive
officers. However, they will be guided by the Regents' decision.
Regent Lindemer asked Dr. Varner whether she could handle
abuses that might arise from the use of this information. Dr.
Varner replied that the staff in the Personnel Office were sufficiently
sensitive in this area so that any abuses would be quickly remedied.
Regent Lindemer then moved that the inclusion of racial
identification requests on employment forms be approved. The
motion was supported by Regent Huebner.
Regent Robert Brown asked whether the information request
would be voluntary and located on a detachable part of the form.
Dr. Varner said it would be directly on the form itself and that
no absolute requirement would be made of any person to complete that part of the form.
Regent Nederlander expressed some very serious reservations
about such a policy, stating his feeling that in the long run it
would create more problems than it would solve.
Regent Waters asked whether any organization had any
statistics that had been derived from the use of such information
requests on employment forms. Dr. Varner replied that the Michi



326


MARCH MEETING, 1973


gan Civil Service Commission has not had sufficient experience
with its form to develop any meaningful data.
Regent Waters commented that it would appear that, regardless of which way the issue was decided, it was likely half the
people would be against the University's policy.
Regent Nederlander expressed the further view that the adoption of such a practice might lead others to follow our example
but be less honest in the way the information would be used.
The motion was defeated. Those voting in favor were Regents
Lindemer, Huebner, and Paul Brown; those voting against it were
Regents Baker, Dunn, Robert Brown, Nederlander, and Waters.
willow Run  Regent Dunn noted that negotiations were continuing with
Airport the Wayne County Road Commission on the future use of
Willow Run Airport. He reiterated the Regents' concern about
the effect any future changes might have on residents in the
area. He requested both that Vice-President Pierpont provide a
report on the current status of the University's negotiations with
the Wayne County Road Commission and that the University
communicate to the Wayne County Road Commission the hope
that they will hold adequate public hearings for concerned residents. He further suggested that the Board of Regents themselves may wish to consider having hearings on the matter.
All the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents reported for the month of February 1973 totaled
$1,141.42.
The Regents adjourned to meet April 19 and 20.

APPENDIX A
REGENTS' CITATION OF HONOR
Characterization by Alexander W. Allison
Conferred February 20, 1973
MARTY MANN, Founder and for twenty-four years Executive Director
of the National Council on Alcoholism; now Consultant to the Council.
Mrs. Mann, a charming and accomplished woman who was herself converted from an addiction to alcohol, has since lent her organizational talents
and her eloquent personal witness to rescuing victims of this dread illness
and to warning prospective victims away. Her understanding of alcoholism is
at once authoritatively scientific and richly intuitive. Her books and public
addresses carry the weight of an absolute sincerity and truth; her private
counsels are winged with a perfect honesty. Her ministry to the largest
single group of "drug addicts" in our nation is unsurpassed in efficacy and
devotion.
The Regents of The University of Michigan, joining a general chorus of
grateful praise for this dedicated and greatly gifted lady, extend to her now
their Regents' Citation of Honor.

VI. RESIGNATIONS AND          RETIREMENTS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirements of two members
of the faculty. The following memoirs were adopted:
M. H. Seevers    In September of 1972 Maurice H. Seevers concluded more than thirty
Retirement years of distinguished service as Professor of Pharmacology and chairman
of that department.
A native of Topeka, Kansas, Dr. Seevers received his bachelor's degree
from Washburn College in 1924. He then took graduate work at The
University of Chicago, receiving his Ph.D. in pharmacology in 1928 and an
M.D. in 1930. His teaching and research career began with a research
fellowship at Chicago in 1926. He subsequently became instructor in pharmacology at Loyola in 1929, assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin in 1930, associate professor at Wisconsin in 1934, and finally Professor
and Chairman of Pharmacology at The University of Michigan in 1942.
To say that Dr. Seevers has been one of this nation's foremost authorities on the effects of drugs and drug addiction is probably a gross understatement. Under his direction the Department of Pharmacology has developed
one of the most extensive programs in the world for testing the effects of
all types of drugs on the nervous system. Using the rhesus monkey as the
basic research subject, the pharmacology laboratories at Michigan have
undertaken countless studies of the effects of both addictive and nonaddictive substances on the brain and nervous system. As a result Dr. Seevers has
become both a national and international consultant on the worldwide
problems of drug addiction.
Dr. Seevers has been a tireless teacher and researcher. Additionally, he
served as associate dean of the Medical School from 1947 to 1950. His
appointments to numerous professional national and international councils
give further testimony to the wide respect he commands in his field.
The Regents now join Dr. Seevers's students and colleagues in expressing their deep gratitude and esteem for his many valued and significant
contributions as they name him Professor Emeritus of Pharmacology.
Newbern Smith     Newbern Smith, Professor of Electrical Engineering, has retired from
Retirement the University as of December 31, 1972.
Born in Philadelphia, Dr. Smith remained in his hometown during his
early academic training, receiving three degrees-A.B. 1930, M.S. 1931, and
Ph.D. 1935-from   the University of Pennsylvania. He served as an instructor in physics at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathy in 1934, as a
physicist with the National Bureau of Standards from 1935 to 1948, and
as a lecturer in electrical engineering at The George Washington University
from 1942 to 1948. After an appointment as division chief with the National
Bureau of Standards from 1948 to 1954, he joined the staff of the University's Engineering Research Institute at Willow Run as a research engineer.
In September of 1959, he was promoted to Professor of Electrical Engineering.
Professor Smith was an enthusiastic teacher, demonstrating frequently
the all-too-rare capacity to enrich his instructional effort with the fruits of
his own programs of original research. His numerous writings and contribu



APRIL MEETING, 1973


337


tions to scientific journals were a natural outgrowth of his extensive research projects, which evolved over a period of time from early radio-wave
propagation investigations to highly sophisticated studies in high-frequency
ionospheric communications and radio astronomy.
He served on countless state, national, and international councils
dealing with a broad range of communications systems and was a member
and officer of a host of professional, honorary, and learned scientific societies.
For his many contributions as a researcher and teacher, for the acclaim
and respect accorded him by his colleagues everywhere, the Regents now
gratefully confer on Newbern Smith the title Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering.
VII. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported the death of Professor Lester W.
Anderson on March 19. The following memorial statement was
adopted:
The Regents and indeed the entire University community sorrowfully  L. W. Anderson
acknowledge yet another tragic loss of a most respected colleague. Professor  Memoir
Lester W. Anderson died on March 19 at the age of fifty-four of injuries
received in an automobile accident.
A native of Minnesota, Professor Anderson received his academic training in Iowa, earning his bachelor's degree from Luther College in 1940 and
his master's and doctorate from the State University of Iowa in 1947 and
1950, respectively.
He served as a teacher, coach, and assistant principal in the Lakefield
and Rochester, Minnesota, school systems from 1940 to 1948. He was
appointed Assistant Principal of University High School in Iowa City in
1948 and Assistant Professor of Education at Arizona State College in 1950.
Professor Anderson came to Ann Arbor in 1952 as Assistant Professor of
Education and consultant in the Bureau of School Services. He was subsequently promoted to associate professor in 1957 and to professor in 1961.
He was an outstanding teacher, especially in the field of school administration. The textbook Secondary School Administration, which he coauthored with L. A. Van Dyke, and his other writings are authoritative and
reflect well his grasp of the field. His work with the Bureau of School Services and with the North Central Association won the respect and acclaim
of his colleagues throughout the state and entire Midwest. And yet he had
time for his own community, giving generously of his energies to his
church and to social service organizations.
The Regents now join Professor Anderson's students, colleagues, and
friends everywhere in extending their deepest sympathies to Mrs. Anderson
and their son.
VIII. OFF-CAMPUS ASSIGNMENTS AND LEAVES OF ABSENCE

X. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Late Payment
Vice-President Pierpont directed the Regents' attention to a  Assessmnent
report on the practice of making late payment assessments on
student accounts. This was in response to an inquiry from the
President of Student Government Council at a recent Regents'
meeting. Vice-President Pierpont noted that the practice began
when the University made provision for periodic payment of
accounts rather than a single payment at the beginning of each
term. The report indicates that the late payment charge seemed to
be necessary to ensure that students pay their accounts.
Vice-President Pierpont indicated that one change would be
made in the procedure so that late payment charges will not be
assessed on overdue amounts of $15 or less.
On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont and the Dean  HcLughlin
of the School of Natural Resources the Regents authorized   Natural Area
acceptance of an offer from Tom P. and Elaine M. Coker of an
additional 22-acre parcel of land south of and adjacent to the
1971 gift of 22 acres of land from Mr. and Mrs. Coker and William
J. and Grace McLaughlin, which combined gift was named the
Horner-McLaughlin Natural Area (R.P., 1969-72, p. 906).
Vice-President Pierpont reported that a current appraisal had  Oregon, Oio,
been obtained on the Oregon, Ohio, property bequeathed to the




340


APRIL MEETING, 1973


University by Leger J. Metzger and that an offer in writing had
been obtained and accepted under the authorization given Mr.
Pierpont at the March meeting (p. 321). The proceeds of the sale
of the property are designated for the Leger J. and Anna Metzger
Memorial fund, for the Law School (R.P., 1969-72, p. 1512).
Investments  Vice-President Pierpont presented a report on temporary investments made since his March 16 report (p. 321). It was
accepted and filed.
Hospital  Vice-President Pierpont filed an interim report on Hospital
Accounts
Receivable accounts receivable as of March 31, 1973. It was accepted and
filed.
Willow Run  Vice-President Pierpont gave a brief report on the status of
development plans for the Willow Run Airport. The matter will
receive detailed attention at the June meeting of the Regents.
Recreational  President Fleming then introduced the topic of recreational
facilities, outlining the various considerations that had been reviewed thoroughly at the Public Discussion on Thursday afternoon. He indicated the possibility that the matter might be
handled as a single proposal that would couple those facilities to
be built and operated through intercollegiate funds and those to
be financed through student fees and other sources.
Regent Dunn stated that, since there appeared to be no disagreement with the part of the program to be undertaken by the
Athletic Department, he moved that the capital, operating, and
program costs for the following facilities be undertaken by the
Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics through funds derived from intercollegiate athletics:
1. the conversion to and use of Yost Field House as a yearround ice-skating facility;
2. the remodeling and use of the present ice rink (Coliseum)
to house intramural and recreational activities;
3. the construction and use of a new facility on Ferry Field
to accommodate indoor track, tennis, and various other sports.
The motion was seconded by Regent Huebner.
Regent Nederlander commented that, since there appeared
to be unanimous agreement on this aspect of the program, he felt
this to be a worthwhile undertaking of the Athletic Department.
The motion passed unanimously.
President Fleming then said that the Regents had heard
various alternatives available for the construction and operation
of new intramural facilities on both the Central and the North
Campus areas.




APRIL MEETING, 1973


341


Regent Baker then introduced the following motion, which
was seconded by Regent Huebner:
That there be imposed a student fee not to exceed $10.00 a term on the
Ann Arbor campus for the purpose of constructing and operating two new
recreation facilities-one in the Central Campus area, the other on North
Campus;
That the fee be imposed on a staggered basis as construction and
operating costs are incurred;
That the Administration seek such other funding support as is possible
from nonstudent sources;
That the construction costs for both projects would be approximately
$5.5 million;
That the suggested proportion of 4 to 1.5 be considered an approximate guideline for construction funds with the exact allocation for each
building to be determined by the program needs at each location;
That operational funds from sources other than student fees be derived
as proposed in Vice-President Pierpont's report on Full Program Funding,
which was attached to President Fleming's letter of April 2, 1973, on
Recreation Facilities.
In clarifying his motion, Regent Baker indicated that the
staggered imposition of this fee would probably follow a time
schedule similar to that indicated earlier by President Fleming,
which was $4.00 in January 1974, $4.00 in September 1974, and
$2.00 in January 1975.
Regent Baker commented that there was obvious agreement
that these facilities had been needed for many years. There
presently seems to be some disagreement as to how much of the
program should be undertaken at the present time. His own feeling is that, while he didn't like the idea of raising student fees
any more than anyone else did, he felt that delays at this point
would result in higher costs.
Regent Robert Brown commented that, as he understood the
motion, it was essentially the same as the full program outlined
in Vice-President Pierpont's report.
Vice-President Pierpont responded that the costs noted in his
report were very rough estimates and would need much more
study. While the total cost of $5.5 million is reasonably firm, the
specific amount to be allocated for each facility would have to
await decisions on programs to be included in that facility.
Regent Dunn noted that, because of the uncertainty surrounding next year's budget determinations and the subsequent uncertainty as to what effect the overall budget may have on student
fees, he thought that a motion to table the matter until July
would be in order, to allow these uncertainties to be cleared up.
In that way, decisions on next year's tuition rates could be made
with much more certainty. While there was no second to Regent




342


APRIL MEETING, 1973


Dunn's motion to table, it was clear from the Regents' discussion
that they would like to see the definitive program statements and
cost estimates when they are available.
Regent Waters asked which group seemed to be supporting
the $10 fee proposal. President Fleming responded that several
student government groups were supporting a $4.00 fee onebuilding North Campus proposal. The ACRICS group appeared
to be behind a two-building $7.00 fee approach, with operating
costs coming from nonstudent fee sources. The Board in Control
of Intercollegiate Athletics had supported the $10 fee proposal.
The motion was then adopted, with Regents Dunn and
Lindemer voting no.
Regent Lindemer explained that, since the proposal had now
passed, he hoped that a great deal more thought would be given
to the question of how the capital costs were to be allocated between the North and Central Campus areas. It was his own feeling that considerably more emphasis ought to be given the North
Campus facility in view of the discussions and viewpoints expressed to the Regents.
XI. OTHER
Samuel Trask  On recommendation of the executive officers of the UniverDana Building  ity the Regents approved the request of the Dean of the School
of Natural Resources to rename the building that houses the
School of Natural Resources the Samuel Trask Dana Building
in honor of Dean Emeritus Dana, whose ninetieth birthday occurs
today, April 20.
Bylaw Revision  Vice-President Smith reviewed the correction of Bylaw Sec.
held over to
May Meeting 5.09. He indicated that this involved an error that had resulted
inadvertently in a revision of the Bylaws in 1968.
Regent Waters suggested that this matter be held over until
the May meeting of the Regents and that the Regents review
the actual wording errors that had occurred in the revision. The
Regents agreed.
Bylaw Sec.  On recommendation    of Secretary Kennedy the Regents
approved the following revised Sec. 11.2110 of the Bylaws, The
Department of Physical Education and Athletics-Advisory Committee on Recreation, Intramurals, and Club Sports, to ensure
adequate representation of women on the Committee:
Sec. 11.2110. The Department of Physical Education and AthleticsAdvisory Committee on Recreation, Intramurals, and Club Sports.
The Advisory Committee on Recreation, Intramurals, and Club Sports
shall be constituted as follows: (1) the Director of Physical Education and
Athletics, ex officio; (2) four members of the University Senate, to be




APRIL MEETING, 1973


343


appointed by the President from a panel of Senate members chosen by the
Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs, subject to the approval
of the Board of Regents. The appointed members shall hold office for two
years; but in no event shall any member of the Senate serve more than two
terms, except that if a member be appointed to fill an unexpired term of
one year or less, he shall also be eligible for two full terms. The terms of
the members shall be staggered so that two terms shall expire each year. The
panel from which the appointments are made each year shall contain twice
the number of names as there are vacancies. If a vacancy in the appointive
Senate membership shall occur from causes other than the completion of the
appointive term, the President is authorized to make an interim  appointment from the most recent panel of names submitted by the Senate Advisory
Committee on University Affairs; (3) a representative from the Office of
Student Services selected by the Vice-President for Student Services;
(4) the Chairman of the Intramural Program, the Associate Director of
Physical Education, and one other staff member designated by the
Director of Physical Education and Athletics so that the Department is
represented by one male and one female, ex officio; (5) four students of the
University to be appointed by the President from a panel of students chosen
by Student Government Council, subject to approval by the Board of
Regents. The student members shall serve two-year terms, which terms
shall be staggered so that two students are appointed each year. The panel
from which the appointments are made shall be unranked and shall contain twice the number of names as there are vacancies. If a vacancy in the
appointive student membership shall occur from causes other than the
completion of the appointive term, the President is authorized to make an
interim appointment from the most recent panel of names submitted by
Student Government Council, or, if the President so requests, from a new
panel of names chosen by Student Government Council; (6) the President
and one other member of the Michigan Sports Club Association so that
the Club is represented by one male and one female, ex officio.
On recommendation of Vice-President Smith the Regents Proposal for
Honoring
approved the following proposal for honoring deceased or retired         Faculty
faculty members who merit special distinction:
It is proposed that:
1. each School or College be allowed to recommend to the Regents one
or more appointments named after a deceased or retired colleague, with such
named appointment to terminate with the death, retirement, or resignation
of the person so appointed;
2. in order to restrict the number of such named appointments (so
that the coin of recognition is not debased), the Schools be allocated the
following authorized numbers of such appointments: L.S.&A.-6; Engineering-2; Medicine-2; all others-one each.
3. To help assure that the emotion arising from the loss of a beloved
colleague is separated from recognition of truly distinguished achievement,
it should be established that no colleague may be recommended for recognition until after two years have elapsed after his death or retirement.
4. The selection of the name or names to be recommended would be
done by the Executive Committee of each School or College (or by the
Dean where no Executive Committee exists), with procedures for securing
nominations to be left to each School or College. Regental approval would
be required.
5. The person to be recommended for appointment as the "named"
professor would also be selected by the Executive Committee (or Dean)




344


APRIL MEETING, 1973


and such recommendation would be made to the Regents after approval
of the "name" to be honored.
This plan would not interfere with potential gifts for endowed chairs
or monetarily supported named professorships. Numbers are controlled and
quality safeguards attached.
Honorary Degrees,  On recommendation      of Vice-President Smith    the Regents
Awarding approved the following resolution reaffirming the University's
Reaffirmed
policy of awarding honorary degrees (p. 189):
The Academic Affairs Committee affirms that The University of
Michigan should continue to bestow honorary degres upon distinguished
citizens, both inside and outside the academic community. The award of
these degrees is illustrative of the dual role of the University as a vital
component in the life of the community-at-large as well as in the community of scholars represented by the recipients of the honorary degrees.
There need be no set number of awards for each occasion, but we judge
that the honoring of truly distinguished persons in this manner contributes
significantly to academic ceremonies. By these special awards, the University
expresses its abiding interest in individuals who continue to fulfill purposes
the University community values most highly.
Fees Increased  Vice-President Smith explained that under normal circumstances the Regents have available to them all the various revenue
factors to consider in setting fees for the coming budget year.
In recent years this has not been possible because of the lag in the
legislative process. It is very important, however, to give some
indication at this time as to what student fees will be next year,
especially so that students returning may have as much time
as possible to make any necessary adjustments in their financial
planning. It is quite clear now that, even if the enrollment remained constant, fee revenue would decline by more than a
million dollars next year, largely because of students shifting from
out-of-state to in-state status. This loss, coupled with the critical
needs that have not been met in the Governor's recommended
budget, gives clear support to the recommendation that student
fees on the Ann Arbor campus be raised an average of 6 percent
for the coming year.
Vice-President Smith stated that a specific fee schedule would
be presented to the Regents for adoption at the time the final
budget for next year is ready.
It was moved by Regent Nederlander and seconded by Regent Waters that Vice-President Smith's recommendation for an
average fee increase of 6 percent for the Ann Arbor campus be
adopted with a specific schedule to be submitted at a later date.
The motion was approved unanimously.
Regent Lindemer commented that, while it may not be a
particularly popular position to take, he felt that the University
must begin to review the relationship between in-state and out-ofstate fees. He was concerned that out-of-state fees have increased




APRIL MEETING, 1973


345


at a much more rapid rate than in-state fees and that the University consequently may be losing its capacity for attracting a
reasonable number of out-of-state students. In view of this it may
be necessary in the future to increase in-state fees at proportionately higher rates.
Regent Robert Brown expressed his continuing reluctance to
take this action, realizing that it was adding to the already difficult cost burdens facing students and their parents. It was mentioned that recent studies of student expenses indicate that,
nationally, fee increases have been averaging 7 to 14 percent over
the last two years, which indicates that the University is not
significantly different from other institutions in this respect.
Regent Baker asked what proportion of student fee revenue
was presently coming from out-of-state students. Vice-President
Smith said the overall out-of-state enrollment accounted for 22
to 23 percent of the University's total enrollment but that outof-state fees accounted for more than half the total fee revenue.
In answer to a question about the status of the court case on
out-of-state fees Vice-President Smith commented that, depending
on the actual outcome of the decision, the University may be
required to hike resident fees some 18 to 20 percent. This, of
course, raises some serious questions as to our competitiveness
with other institutions in the state.
Regent Dunn suggested that the University should undertake
a concerted effort to tell this story about the money crisis facing
the University to the people of the state. Such an effort should
include various union publications that can help tell the story. He
further stated that the kinds of shifts and increases in student fees
being discussed could price higher education right out of business
and that every effort must be exerted to practice all possible
budgetary restraints in this situation.
Chancellor Goodall reviewed the student fee recommendation  Dearborn Fees
for Dearborn, noting that the approximately 5 percent increase was  Increased
a clear necessity for the coming year. He also noted that he
would be recommending soon to the Regents a change in the student fee schedule for Dearborn that would encourage the enrollment of part-time students, which he felt to be a significant responsibility for urban-oriented institutions like Dearborn.
Regent Robert Brown moved adoption of the recommended
fee increase for Dearborn. Regent Lindemer seconded the motion
and it was unanimously adopted.
Chancellor Moran explained that The University of Michigan-  Flint Fee
Flint would not need any general fee increases for the coming  Schedule Approved
year. However, he would appreciate the Regents' approval of




346


APRIL MEETING, 1973


the structuring of student fees to allow for a much more realistic
approach to accommodating part-time students.
Regent Robert Brown moved adoption of the fee schedule
changes recommended by Chancellor Moran, Regent Waters
seconded the motion, and it was unanimously adopted.
Federal Fundiig  Vice-President Smith then reviewed for the Regents the sumCutbacks
mary data prepared for them outlining the effects on the University
budget of recent federal cutbacks. He noted that the data did not
include losses sustained by specific research projects, since it had
been concluded that the University simply had to adjust to those
losses. He noted in particular that the University presently stood
to lose approximately $2.9 million in instructional costs. He indicated that it was the University's intention to let the state fiscal
authorities know just what programs are being jeopardized by
these instructional program cutbacks. It is hoped that, where these
areas were judged to be critical in terms of the state's need for
manpower, substitute funding from the state might be forthcoming. Vice-President Smith cited as an example of such programs
the University's curriculum in psychiatric nursing. He also noted
that most of the cutbacks would come in the area of student support ($6.8 million). This student support comes in several forms
and pending federal legislation indicates that some recoveries are
still possible. He feared that the state fiscal agencies would
simply not concern themselves with attempting to replace these
losses in student support. The only exceptions to this might be
certain traineeships for areas in which the state might have
critical manpower shortages.
Regent Dunn then moved that the Regents
1. endorse the detailed statement of potential federal fund losses as a
statement of needs for the University;
2. authorize the executive officers to transmit and discuss these needs
with the Governor's office and appropriate legislative committees; and
3. seek appropriation support for areas of mutual interest.
Regent Lindemer seconded the motion and it was unanimously approved.
Signatures
on Diplomas   The Regents approved the recommendation of the executive
officers that for diplomas issued by the two branch campuses the
signatures of the respective Chancellors be added to those of the
President and the Secretary of the University.
Graduate Student  Vice-President Smith presented a report on the Graduate StuAssistantship
Program  dent Assistantship Program. Regent Dunn asked that the report
be brought back to the Regents before it is put into final form.
Vice-President Smith asked that the Regents review the material




APRIL MEETING, 1973


347


and submit any comments or suggestions, as it is now in the
process of revision.
All the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents reported for the month of March 1973 totaled $1,262.61.
The Regents adjourned to meet May 17 and 18.

understanding that the necessary $Ioo would be taken from
the unexpended portion of the salary budget of the department, and involved no increase. It is further understood
that this adjustment is for this year only and that the position will be carried for succeeding years at $40o.
September 14, I923
Present, Regents Beal and Sawyer.
The committee granted the request of Professor Gomberg as approved by Professor Campbell and Dean Effinger
for an increase in the salary of Dr. F. F. Blicke, Instructor
in Organic Chemistry, from $2,200 to $2,400, the amount of
the salary allowed for Dr. F. W. Sullivan, who has resigned.
The committee further authorized the appointment of Donald
L. Tabern as Instructor in Organic Chemistry at a salary of
$I,8oo. Mr. Tabern will take the position formerly held by
Dr. Blicke and the above actions will bring about a saving
of $400 in the salary budget of Organic Chemistry.
September I8, 1923
Present, Regents Beal and Sawyer.
On July 5 (page 2) the committee added $500 to the salary of Assistant Professor Stacey Guild.  This sum was
taken from an amount of $I,800 allowed for the salary of
an instructor to be appointed in the Department of Anatomy. The committee now grants the request of Professor
Huber, as approved by Dean Cabot, that $I,ooo of the $I,300
remaining of this amount be allocated for the salary of
Elisha Stephens Gurdjian, as Assistant in Anatomy, and that
the $300 still unexpended be allowed to remain for a parttime assistant during the second semester of the current
academic year.
September 22, 1923
Present, President Burton, Regents Beal and Sawyer.
The committee approved the request of Dean Bursley
for a rearrangement of part of the salary account in the
budget for the office of the Dean of Students. Because of
additional academic work Mr. Robert C. Angell has found
it impossible to give thirty hours a week to work in the
Dean's office, for which compensation of $I,ooo is provided




io           SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923
in the budget as adopted. His appointment was therefore
changed to fifteen hours with compensation of $5oo, and
Mr. Hugh T. Cavanaugh was appointed as assistant with
compensation of $250 on a basis of fifteen hours per week
work.
September 24, I923
Present, the President, Regents Beal and Sawyer.
The committee, approved the request of Dr. Albert M.
Barrett, Professor of Psychiatry, that $Ioo of the $200
allowed for the salary of an assistant professor in the
department budget be paid to Miss Josephine Rusche, as
technical assistant in the department.
On motion of Regent Clements, the actions of the Coi
mittee of Five were confirmed in accordance with the mi
utes of the committee as follows:
July I3, I923
The committee met at the Clements Library at II:oo
A. M.
Present, Regent Clements, Mr. Kahn, Dr. Shepard, and
Mr. Smith, with Superintendent Pardon in conference.
Absent, President Burton.
Regent Clements acted as chairman.
Professor Shepard reported that there were no legal
conditions to prevent the location of the proposed Nurses'
Home upon the northwest corner of the Observatory grounds
(page 8I6). This location was approved by the committee.
The committee authorized Dr. Shepard and Professor
Hussey to look over possible desirable locations in the neighborhood of Ann Arbor, away from vibration and smoke, to
which the Observatory might in the future be advantageously
removed. No obligation on the part of the committee or the
Regents in the way of commitments for such land was recognized.
Mr. Kahn reported that he was in conference with Senator Couzens with respect to the design of the Nurses' Home.
Dr. Shepard reported upon the proposal to change the
original specifications for the University Hospital window
sash. The committee voted to refer the question to Professor
Shepard, Mr. Kahn, and Mr. Pardon with authority to use
the so-called "Kawneer" sash on south windows and on west
windows (where awnings would otherwise need to be provided) upon condition that the total cost of window sash for
the building should not exceed the allowance in the estimates
for window sash and awnings.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


II


No action was taken at this time regarding the purchase
of glass.
The committee directed that in accordance with the recommendation of Mr. Pardon, West Hall should be razed by
the Buildings and Grounds organization, with the expectation
that all materials possible would be salvaged and that these
materials would pay for the work.
The committee approved the erection of a fence about
the grounds of the Betsy Barbour House and Helen Newberry Residence, provided that the Board should in due
course supply funds therefor. Superintendent Pardon and
Mr. Kahn were requested to prepare a plot and sketch design.
The assignment of space in the present Engineering
Shops and old Power House Building after the present occupants shall remove to the new Engineering Shops and Laboratories was referred to Professor Shepard and Mr. Pardon with power.
The committee discussed the procedure under which the
addition to the Power Plant, the coal storage, and tunnels
are being designed and constructed, and informally approved
same.
The request of the Department of Civil Engineering for
changes in Room 301 A on the third floor of the Engineering
Building was referred to Superintendent Pardon and Professor Shepard with power.
The committee discussed the subject of certain repairs
urgently requested by the occupants of East Hall (pages 859 -86I). These repairs were in general approved and authority
was given Messrs. Smith, Pardon, and Shepard to proceed
within an expense of $2,000.
On a general motion by Regent Clements, the following
actions were taken down to and including the appointment
of Captain George W. Dunn, Jr.
The Board approved and adopted the report of Regent
Murfin recommending that since the property was bequeathed
to the Regents "in perpetuity and without power of alienation," the Regents decline the bequest bv the late Dr. Minnie
A. G. Dight of her cottage and real estate known as "Rocky
Knoll" (page 770).
The Board received for filing the report of Mr. Durand
W. Springer as University Auditor, giving a record of his
activities during the year I922-I923.

Committee had authorized repairs in East Hall at an estimated cost of $I,900, including the expense of a temporary
steam line for heat from the new tunnel (pages 859-860,.
and page ii above).
The Secretary reported that in accordance with the agreement between the City of Ann Arbor and the Regents covering the closing of certain streets needed for the University's building program (pages 532-536), the Common
Council of Ann Arbor had executed a quitclaim deed conveying the following described land:That portion of Oakland Avenue included in the following description:Beginning at the point of intersection of the north line

additions and to bequeath a sufficient sum of money to allow
of the continuance of the sets of journals, and to make some

feet to the place of beginning, being a triangular piece of

The Board received from Treasurer Campbell a full

in one list.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the following overdrafts
were charged off as of June 30, 1923, for the reasons given
by the Secretary in each case:Administration, American Library Association Entertainment................................ $  68.oo
This covers cost of 68 luncheons in addition to those provided by the original appropriation. This overdraft had the approval of
the officials at the time.
Administration, Insurance, Automobile...........  42. I5
This covers insurance on three Fords and
one Reo in addition to automobiles covered in
original policy.
Administration, Insurance, Workmen's Compensation......................................   898.80
This covers the amount of premiums over
the appropriation, less amounts apportioned to
buildings and amounts charged to dormitories.
The increase is occasioned by increased payrolls in the several University departments covered by the policy.
Administration, Michiganensian Purchase.........    4.73
This covers one copy of the Michiganensian in addition to number covered by the original appropriation.




36


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


Administration, Taxes..........................   6.65
This covers taxes for New Mexico lands,
for which no appropriation was made.
Administration, Teachers' Annuity Fund..........  542.23
This covers the amount of the contributions
of the University toward annuity premiums in
excess of allowance in budget.
Administration, Telephone Rental.............  I4.5I
This amount covers telephone rental in
excess of amount provided in budget.
Administration, Insurance, Burglary...............72
This excess is due to inclusion of insurance
on Health Service safe.
Anatomy, Anatomical Material...................  737.30
This covers anatomical material shipped to
the University, under the provisions of the state
law, in excess of amount provided for in the
budget.
Physical Plant Extension, Cemetery Lot Purchase.   8.88
This covers accumulated interest on purchase price in addition to amount originally
appropriated.
Physical Plant Extension, Palmer Field Addition   20.54
This covers taxes which we had to pay in
addition to amount provided in the original
appropriation.
University Hospital, Current............$25,749.68
University Hospital, Salaries............ 4I,00.03
66,759.71
This total overdraft of $66,759.7I represents expenditures by the Hospital in excess of
the appropriation. It does not represent any
such excess of expenditures over income. The
actual earnings of the University Hospital were
similarly in excess of the estimated income.
The actual earnings as reported by Mr. Greve,
less expenditures as reported by him, show a
surplus of $8,111.31 upon total earnings of
$837,040.46. This is a margin of not quite one
per cent.
In the general accounting offices of the
University, we have charged to the Hospital
the following items of which Mr. Greve in his
statement does not take cognizance, namely:



SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


37


Roentgenology, Special Equipment........................$ 9,921.80
University  Hospital,  Special
Equipment................... 6,333.6I
Internal Medicine, Amino Acids.  I93.I5
Internal Medicine, Awnings.....  20.00
Internal Medicine, Heart Station  23.39
Total...................... $ 6,491.95
These items should, it seems to the writer,
be properly included in the Hospital Expense.
If they are included, the net result is a Hospital
deficit of $8,376.64, about one per cent.
Total..................................$69,231.22
A communication from Professor John Sundwall stated
that Miss Marion O. Wood and Miss Marion V. Dawley

On motion of Regent Murfin, a leave of absence for the
remainder of the present University year, without salary
except for the one week already served, was voted to Miss
Wood and Miss Dawley, with express citation of the fact
that the appointments of Misses Wood and Dawley did not
extend beyond the year I923-I924.
On motion of Regent Murfin, following the recommendation of Dr. Sundwall, Margaret Bell, B.S., M.D., was
appointed Physician in the University Health Service and
Associate Professor of Women's Physical Education in the
Division of Hygiene, at the salary of $4,000 per year beginning with the academic year I923-I924. It was understood
that such service as might be required preliminary to the
opening of the University year would be given by Dr. Bell
without additional compensation. This appointment involved
no increase in the budget.
On motion of Regent Gore, the Secretary was authorized
to make specified changes in certain clerical salaries.
Notice was filed that Miss Sue Biethan, in charge of the
medical division of the General Library, had resigned to
accept a position as librarian of the American Medical

an increase in the salary of Mr. Albert L. Clark, Instructor




38


SEPTEMBER MEETING, i923


in the Department of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing.
The President presented a communication from Miss
Frances E. Riggs of Detroit. After the presentation of this
communication, on motion of Regent Murfin, the Board
adopted the following resolution:WHIRE;AS, Miss Frances E. Riggs of Detroit, Michigan,
has made to the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan the following proposal:"To the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan.
Gentlemen:"I have executed to the Regents of the University of
Michigan a warranty deed of the following described piece
or parcel of land, situate and being in the City of Detroit,
County of Wayne, and State of Michigan, to-wit:"Lot six (6), Subdivision of Park Lot fifty-three
(53) on the east side of Cass Avenue in said city.
"I purpose delivering said deed to the grantee named
therein, provided said Board by resolution agrees as follows:
"I. That in consideration of the execution and
delivery of said warranty deed, said Board will hold said
land, or its proceeds, if sold, in trust for the purposes
hereinafter named.
"2. That said Board will pay me, on delivery of said
warranty deed and an abstract showing perfect title, one
dollar.
"3. That the net income from the property conveyed by said warranty deed or its proceeds if sold, shall
be used by said Board for the following purposes:"A. For the maintaining of Fellowships in the
Graduate School of said University of Michigan for
the benefit of graduate students, preferably in honors, of the universities of England, Scotland, Wales,
and Ireland, the amount of said Fellowships to be
fixed by said Board from time to time as the judgment of the members thereof may dictate, they, the
members, having in view the amount of the income
from said property and the expense of living at the
University.  The general administration  of the
Fellowships herein provided for, including the selection of the beneficiaries, shall be under the guidance
and direction of the Executive Board of said Graduate School or any succeeding body that may exercise the functions of said Graduate Board. The




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923                        39
length of time during which a Fellowship may be
enjoyed by an incumbent shall in each instance be
determined by said Graduate Board or its successor.
"B. In the event of there being at any time in
the future, for a period of two years, no candidate
or candidates qualified for said Fellowships under
the foregoing conditions, then the funds accumulated
during this period may, in the discretion of said
Graduate Board or its successor, be assigned for
Scholarships for undergraduate students from the
universities hereinbefore designated, the amount of
said Scholarships to be fixed by said Board of
Regents, the members having in view the amount of
accumulated funds and the expenses of living at the
University at the time of the assignment.
"C. The gift herein proposed, if accepted, shall
be known as the Frances E. Riggs Foundation.
"I desire to state in this connection that my purpose in making the foregoing provisions is to aid in
cultivating closer and more friendly relations among
the English-speaking peoples through the presence
of students in this University from the universities
designated. I am impressed with the notion that the
presence at this University of a few selected students
from the universities named will do something
toward accomplishing this desired result.
"4. That while said Board of Regents is to have
authority to sell the premises conveyed by said warranty
deed and invest the proceeds in sound interest-bearing
securities, using the net income as hereinbefore directed,
it is my earnest desire that, if possible, the premises be
leased for a long period of time, fifty or ninety-nine
years, for the best terms that can be obtained, it being
made a part of the agreement in each instance that the
lessee shall erect upon the premises a permanent building
of a stipulated value, the same upon the termination of
the lease to become the property of the University of
Michigan. I make this suggestion because I am satisfied
that if held for a time, probably for several years, the
value of said property will largely increase, and that by
holding and leasing the premises, a larger income for the
purpose designated can be realized.
"Respectfully submitted,
"FRANCES E. RIGGS,
"September 20, I923"




40


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


Therefore, Resolved, That the foregoing proposal be
accepted by this Board, and that this Board agrees to abide
by and perform all of the stipulations and directions contained
therein; and
Resolved further, That the sincere thanks of the Board
of Regents be extended to Miss Frances E. Riggs for her
generous and timely gift to the University.
The President reported that in accordance with the wish
of the donor, he had already appointed Mr. Reginald Ivan
Lovell of the University of London, University College, as
Frances E. Riggs Fellow for the year I923-I924, with stipend of $I,125, which stipend may be increased if the income
from  the foundation during the year shall justify such
increase.
The President reported that a donor in Detroit had promised to provide the sum of $5,ooo to continue the Fellowship
in Creative Art for the year I923-I924.     The President
stated that during a trip to England he had tendered this
fellowship to Dr. Robert Bridges, Poet Laureate of England,
and that he had every reason to expect that the invitation
would be accepted, and that Dr. and Mrs. Bridges would
come to Ann Arbor some time in December and remain
through Commencement. On motion of Regent Murfin, by
a rising vote, the Board approved the invitation to Dr. Robert Bridges and voted the sum of $1,500 to apply on traveling expenses.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board declined to
grant certain requests for changes in the Chemical Laboratory.
On motion of Regent Clements, in response to a question
communicated by Mr. D. W. Springer, Auditor, the Board
voted:i. That if a loss from a student loan fund shall be
finally determined, it shall not be charged off until reported
to the Board of Regents and such course approved by the
Board.
2. That should a student loan be closed, the loss shall
be charged to the income of the fund from which the loan
was made. In the case of a loan from pooled funds, such a
loss would, in accordance with this ruling, be charged to the
income on the pooled funds.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923

A communication from Treasurer Robert A. Campbell,
as Faculty Manager, and Carleton B. Peirce, as Student
Manager, of the University Band, was referred to the Committee on Student Welfare for a report at the next meeting

be at the University (page 24).
On motion of Regent Murfin, the Board voted that regular leaves of absence should be disregarded in the payment
of the University's share of the premiums on annuities purchased by members of the Faculty at the joint expense of
themselves and of the University.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board appropriated
from general funds the sum of $35,000 for the purchase of
equipment for the new Physics Laboratory. This action
was taken on express condition that if savings could be made
on the new Literary Building sufficient to permit such action,
the general funds should be reimbursed for this appropriation.
The President presented a letter from an alumnus of
the City of Detroit, of which letter the following is an
excerpt:I beg to state that I will give the sum of $50,000 per year
for two years to finance the University in Research Work in
the Near East, as outlined by you, payable quarterly each
year, the first payment of $I2,500 to be made October I, next,
and quarterly thereafter. I have not made this for three
years as suggested by you. If the work proves a success and
the results show that it should be carried on for another year,
I know of no reason why I should not continue the payments
for the third year.
On motion of Regent Murfin, this very generous gift
was accepted with the thanks of the Regents.




42


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


On motion of Regent Murfin, a communication from
Professor Kelsey relative to the administration of the fund
thus given for research work in the Near East was referred
with power to the Regents' Committee on Promotion of
Research.
The Board took a recess.
SESSION OF SEPTEMBER 28
The Board reassembled in the Regents' Room at 9:40
A. M.
Present, the President, Regent Hubbard, Regent Sawyer,
Regent Clements, Regent Gore, Regent Murfin, Regent Hanchett, and Regent Beal. Absent, Regent Leland and Superintendent Johnson.
On motion of Regent Gore, the salary of Dr. Udo J.
Wile as Professor of Dermatology and Syphilology was
increased to $6,ooo per annum.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, the salary of Dr. E. Forest
Merrill, amounting to $3,000 per year, was divided for the
remainder of the present year equally between the Department of Roentgenology of the Medical School and the University Hospital. Further, the position of Medical Photographer, Department of Roentgenology, was created with salary at the rate of $I,500 per year, twelve-months' basis. To
this position Mr. Harry F. Minkley was appointed, to date
from October I.
The President presented a letter from Mr. George G.
Booth, of Detroit, transmitting to the University $20,000 in
bonds of the Bedell Company of Michigan, bearing six per
cent interest. These bonds were tendered as the foundation
of the "George G. Booth Traveling Fellowship in Architecture," under the following conditions as outlined by the
donor:PURPOSE
The purpose of the fellowship is to encourage advanced
study and help provide a broader preparation for architectural practice.
The candidate would be expected to go abroad because
of the advantages, cultural and otherwise, to be gained by a
change of environment and a first-hand knowledge of older
civilizations.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923

At the outset, the fellowship is to be awarded annually,
but it may later be assigned bi-annually, should standards of
scholarship or conditions affecting the income or cost of
travel and living make it desirable.
ELIGIBILITY
Students will be eligible who are not more than thirty
years of age on the day set for beginning the competition in
design. They either shall be graduates of the College of
Architecture of the University of Michigan or shall have been
in residence for and have substantially completed the two
last years of the four-year course.
The award will be made on the basis of the student's
general record and a competition in architectural design. It
will not be necessary for competitors to be in residence or
for those living outside the state to come to Ann Arbor. For
candidates located in other states arrangements can be made
with architects to act as general supervisors during the preparation of the competition drawings, while the preliminary
sketch shall be made under direct supervision and, like the
final drawings, without criticism.
The drawings from outside the state are to be sent to
the College of Architecture so as to bear the postoffice mark
or express receipt of a given date.
CONDUCT OF COMPETITION
The duration of the competition shall be about fifteen
days. There is to be a short problem involving a large composition and a problem, for whose solution and proper presentation the remaining time will be allowed.  (The most
favorable time for holding the competition would be such as
to include the spring or Christmas vacations, which usually
are ten to seventeen days in length, respectively, thus not
interfering too much with the regular class work. For nongraduates or candidates for a higher degree the regular academic credit could be given for this work in design. Possibly those attaining a certain standing in this and other fellowship competitions might be allowed to waive the design
examination of the State Registration Board.)
Each competitor will be expected to submit a written
statement of not more than 500 words to explain his point
of view of any features of his design to which he wishes to
draw particular attention.
There will be a public exhibition of the drawings preceding the judgment. The architectural students of the Univer



41


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


sity will be invited to send signed communications discussing
the merits of the drawings for consideration by the jury.
The architectural jury shall consist of three or more
architects not resident in Ann Arbor, and enough of the
Architectural Faculty to make a jury of not less than nine.
It will be desirable to have an architectural alumnus as one
member of the jury.
In reaching its decision, the jury will consider the following:(a) The general record and standing of the candidate.
(b) The candidate's written statement.  Candidates in
residence may also be given an opportunity to
appear before the jury to discuss their designs.
(c) Student communications bearing on the design.
(d) The competition drawing; possibly along with earlier school drawings and work done by the candidate since leaving college.
The successful candidate shall sail within three months
of the notification of the award. In case of his failure or
inability to go, the jury may award the scholarship to the
candidate ranking second.
The payment of the stipend shall be made from time to
time by the Treasurer of the University. The holder of the
fellowship will be expected to make occasional reports, and,
depending on the nature of his chosen field of activity,
accompany the written report with drawings, some of which
may be retained by the College of Architecture.
A public exhibition of all such drawings would be very
desirable upon the return of the Fellow.
The award having been made, I believe that considerable
latitude should be allowed to the winner of the fellowship
as to the manner in which he should use the funds; anticipating, of course, that he would seriously listen to such recommendations as the department chiefs might deem it proper
to make.
I have in mind that in some cases fellowships which provide for traveling abroad have been so limited that men have
been forced to spend their time in a manner not very helpful
to the plans they have made to follow up their chosen profession; one student might wish to concentrate his entire
energies and the use of the entire sum available in the study
of architecture at Rome or Athens; or if his chief aim was
residential work, it might be most profitable to spend all of
his time in England, while others again might benefit by a
more general traveling program.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


45


I believe that Architecture at its best is in reality a tangible expression of our highest social achievements; so I
deem it of the utmost importance that this country shall be
filled with architects of vision and the highest possible training, that we may be inspired by their ideals and they will
surely do us suitable honor by their work; so I hope the step
I have taken may contribute something to the advancement
of the greatest of all arts in America.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, Mr. Booth's tender was
gratefully accepted in accordance with its terms and conditions.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board directed that
the annuity payable to Margaret Donovan from the income
of the Cornelius Donovan bequest should be increased from
this date to $200 per month.
On motion of Regent Beal, the Board voted to reconsider its action (page 40 above) in declining to consider
such part of the request for changes in the Chemistry
Building as were presented by Dean Kraus, and referred
Dean Kraus's request to the Buildings and Grounds Committee with power.
The President read to the Regents, and the Board discussed at length, correspondence relating to the development of dormitories in connection with the Law School.
The President reported with respect to the situation in
Forestry. All the questions presented by the affairs of the
Department of Forestry were referred with power to a
committee consisting of the President, Regent Beal, and
Regent Hubbard.
The Board discussed at length, without taking action, the
question of nursing education.
On motion of Regent Gore (Regent Clements putting
the question), the Board directed payment to President
Burton, from  the Woodward Avenue Lease Trust Fund,
of the sum of $I,500 to apply on the traveling expenses of
the President in his trip to England to interview Dr. Robert
Bridges.
The President reported that he had arranged with the
firm of Pitkin and Mott, Landscape Architects, of Cleveland,




46


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


Ohio, to make a survey of existing conditions at the University, to make a report upon their findings, and to accompany this report with preliminary sketches covering the recommendation of Pitkin and Mott for the solution of the
broader phases of the problem of landscape design upon the
grounds of the University. For this, Messrs. Pitkin and
Mott are to receive compensation not to exceed $I,ooo,
which payment will apply on any remuneration which the
firm might later receive in case the Regents decided to proceed under the general plan to be outlined by the firm (page
816).
On motion of Regent Gore, leave of absence was granted
to Dean Mortimer E. Cooley, under the usual conditions,
for the second semester of I923-I924.
The President filed a letter from Professor William J.
Hussey, stating that it had been determined, after full consideration, to seek a location for the new Lamont telescope
in South Africa rather than in Australia (pages 8io-8II).
On motion of Regent Sawyer, the Board concurred in this
plan.
The President presented an invitation from the University of California to be represented at the inauguration of
William Wallace Campbell (a graduate of the University
of Michigan, class of I886) as President of the University
of California. On motion of Regent Murfin, the President
was authorized to accept the invitation and to appoint a
delegate to represent the University of Michigan on this
occasion. Proper allowance for traveling expenses was
included in the action.
A communication from   Professor Francis W. Kelsey
stated that Mrs. Edward W. Pendleton of Detroit had given
the sum of $2,400 to provide four classical fellowships during the present year to be known as the "Pendleton Classical
Fellowships." These fellowships were accepted with the
thanks of the Regents.
Professor Kelsey further informed the Board that Mr.
Oscar Webber and Mr. Richard H. Webber of Detroit had
jointly contributed $I,ooo to the Humanistic Research Fund.
This gift is to constitute two scholarships of $500 each for




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


47


the two sons of Dr. David L. Askren who are during the
present year in the Phillips Academy in Andover. Much of
the valuable manuscript material which the University
secured during Professor Kelsey's recent expedition to
Egypt was obtained through the devoted cooperation of Dr.
Askren, who is a medical missionary in Fayoum, Egypt.
Professor Alexander G. Ruthven communicated to the
Regents the fact that Mr. E. B. Williamson of Bluffton,
Indiana, had paid the expenses of Mr. Jesse Williamson as
a representative of the University of Michigan with a party
from the United States National Museum on an expedition
into Mexico.  On motion of Regent Gore, the Board
expressed its thanks to Mr. Williamson for this cooperation
with the work of the Museum.
Dean Kraus of the College of Pharmacy, in a communication to the President, informed the Regents that the firm
of Lehn and Fink of New York City would award each
year to a proper member of the graduating class of the College of Pharmacy a gold medal in recognition of special
efficiency in Pharmacy. On recommendation of Dean Kraus,
the Board gave its approval of the awarding of this medal
annually.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the Board voted that as
the last Friday in November would be the day after Thanksgiving, the November meeting of the Regents should be
held on Friday, November 23.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board directed that
the registration of Mr. Harley L. Sensemann, Director of
the Alumni Catalogue Office, should be accepted in the Graduate School for part-time work on the same basis as the
registration of a member of the Faculty.
On motion of Regent Murfin, degrees were voted to the
following as recommended by the Faculty of the Colleges of
Engineering and Architecture:BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING (CIVII ENGINEERING)

On motion of Regent Murfin, the Board authorized the
appointment of such student assistants as the Dean of the
College of Engineering might find necessary to take care
of work of dental students in the Engineering Shops. The
salaries of these student assistants are to be paid from the
provision in the budget for the salary of Professor John
Airey on leave.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board authorized
an expenditure not to exceed $I50 for entertainment of the
Central States Pediatrics Association, which is expected in
Ann Arbor on October I9.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the Board directed that
certain large classes in history should be accommodated in
the gymnasium room of the Model High School as soon as
the Model High School is completed, which will be, it is
expected, about November I. Up to that date, these large
classes are to be housed in University Hall.
The President reported that the probable attendance for
the present University year would represent an increase of
between two and two and one-half per cent of last year's
enrollment.
On motion of Regent Murfin, there was referred to the
Committee on the Promotion of Research a communication
from the Sun-Kist Raisin Company. The committee was
empowered to take such action as it deemed proper upon
this communication.
The Secretary presented the resignation of Miss Grace
Grieve Millard as a member of the Board of Governors of
Martha Cook Building. On motion of Regent Sawyer, Miss
Millard's resignation was accepted with regret.
The Secretary presented for filing a copy of the opinion
of the Michigan Supreme Court in the appeal of the suit for
the condemnation of the site of the Lawyers' Club. This
decision sustained the contentions of the Regents in every
particular (page 663).
On motion of Regent Clements, authority was given to
pay certain demurrage bills. These bills grew out of the
accidental death of Mr. Wilmot Haines, expert crane operator, last May, just at the time when extremely large shipments of coal were coming in. No one else could operate




50


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


the crane skillfully enough to avoid considerable delay in
unloading cars.
The following letter was placed on file (page 821):Mr. Shirley W. Smith,
Secretary, University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
My dear Mr. Smith:The date on which I retired from   active service as
Assistant to the Secretary of the University of Michigan
was August first, 1923.
To the Regents and other officials of the University I
extend my appreciation and thanks for the kindness shown
me during my forty-two years of service.
Yours respectfully,             LUCY E. CHAPIN
Ann Arbor, September 27, 1923
The Secretary called attention to the fact that while the
By-Laws direct that he shall insure the unregistered, negotiable securities (By-Laws, Chapter I, Section 8 (c)), he
had not for stated reasons complied with this direction. No
action was taken by the Board.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board declined to
authorize the registration of Mr. Samuel Barmak as a resident of Michigan.
The Secretary was authorized to make provision for an
expected vacancy in the University Storehouse office.
The Secretary presented the minutes of the meeting of
the Committee of Five held September 27. On motion of
Regent Hanchett, all the actions of the committee were
approved and adopted as set forth in the minutes:September 27, 1923
The committee met in the President's office at 2:30 P. M.
Present, the entire committee, with Superintendent Pardon in conference.
There was presented, discussed at length, and filed the
report of Mr. Christensen giving details of building costs up
to September II.
The Secretary and the Superintendent of Grounds placed
before the committee the arrangement under which the work
of putting in the sewer on East University Avenue was proceeding in accordance with the plans made by Hoad and




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923


51


Decker. The expected cost of this sewer, estimated by the
engineers in the fall of 1922, was much below any bids which
could be obtained upon it at present, but by having the work
done directly by the Buildings and Grounds Department, it
was believed that the sewers required could be provided
within the sum appropriated.
The Secretary and the Superintendent of Grounds
reported on the plans for the expansion of the power house,
including the coal storage. It had not proved practical to
arrange with Smith, Hinchman, and Grylls (page 817) for
the checking of the plans made by Mr. Lynn W. Fry, State
Architect. Therefore, these plans were being developed by
Mr. Fry in current conference with Professor H. C. Anderson and with careful checking from time to time by an engineer of large experience in the construction of coal storage.
The blue-printed plans as thus far developed were placed
before the committee. It was agreed that the Consulting
Architect would also inspect the plans from time to time.
Rough grading at the new    University Hospital was
ordered at a cost within $3,ooo00, to be charged to the building.
Superintendent Pardon outlined his plans for providing
shrubs and trees for landscape work, within the funds provided by the present Buildings and Grounds Maintenance
account.
Mr. Kahn reported progress on plans for the Nurses'
Home.
The committee voted to recommend that should the
church desire to use the chapel at the corner of Jefferson
and State streets after November I, 1923, the date at which
under the deed the University will have possession, such
occupancy should continue at a rental equal to five per cent
on the University's investment.
Professor Shepard and Mr. Pardon were requested to,
report on the feasibility of using University Hall for two,
lecture classes of 60o students each.  Professor Shepard
later reported that it was feasible thus to use University
Hall, provided possible conflicts with other scheduled classes.
could be avoided.
The committee voted that until further action the sidewalk on the west side of East University Avenue, destroyed
in the construction of the heating tunnel, should not be
replaced.
The committee received and filed a letter from Librarian Bishop, speaking for the Library and the Graduate




52           SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923
School, urging that when plans should be developed for a
new Administration Building, space should be provided for
the proper storage, under safe conditions, of the stock of
publications of a learned or scientific character issued by the
University.
Superintendent Pardon reported the cost of razing West
Hall at approximately $2,200 plus $500 for heat and electric
connections provided below the surface of the ground on the
site of West Hall. This expense will be largely, if not fully,
covered by the value of the salvage.
The committee recommended that the Board of Governors of the Betsy Barbour House should have the exterior
woodwork painted and should provide a certain number of
outside blinds for this building. The committee also recommended that the Boards of Governors of the Betsy Barbour
House and the Helen Newberry Residence should be notified
that the Regents will consider the erection of a proper fence
about these buildings.
The President presented the following resolutions
adopted by the Medical Faculty:Resolution No. I. The Medical Faculty unanimously voted that the Medical Library be kept in its
present quarters in association with the General Library,
and that no plans at present be considered for its removal
to the new medical building.
Resolution No. 2. The Medical Faculty unanimously resolve that the authorities of the University be
asked to remove the partition between the medical reading room and the two smaller reading rooms associated
with it so that the entire space could be utilized for a
medical reading room.
Resolution No. I was placed on file. As resolution No.
2 did not deal with a subject within the scope of the committee, no action was taken.
The committee received and filed a letter from Dr. E. L.
Dillman of New York City. The letter referred to the architecture of the new Engineering Shops and Laboratories.
The President filed correspondence between himself and
the H. G. Christman Company under dates of June 22 and
June 23 relative to the delay on the Model High School
(page 816).
A letter was received from Dean Cooley regarding the
delay on the Engineering Shops and Laboratories. Certain
questions raised therein were referred by the committee to




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923                           53
Professor Shepard and Mr. Pardon for such action as might
be possible.
Professor Shepard filed the following statement of the
estimated cost of completing and equipping the new General
Literary Building.  All of the larger items, except the
mechanical trades, to be done by the Buildings and Grounds
Department, represent either complete costs of work already
done or actual bids. The remaining items represent very
careful estimates. The statement is as follows:Excavation, backfill, and grading.............$  IO,682

The committee voted to recommend procedure toward
the completion of the building forthwith, in accordance with
the statement above, including the use of granite for the
steps and the use of Crittal casements.
The committee discussed the University Hospital project,
but took no action pending a meeting to be held September 29
between Dr. Shepard and Mr. Kahn and the University Hospital staff.
Mr. Kahn and Dr. Shepard reported upon the present
status of plans for the Medical Building to the effect that
such plans were nearly ready to ask for bids thereon.
Professor Shepard filed the following report of matters
referred to:At its meeting on July I3 the Committee of Five
referred to Mr. Pardon and myself, with power, the
revision of such space in the West Engineering Building,
the Old Shops Building, and the Old Power House as is
being vacated by departments moving into the East Engineering Building.
In the case of space vacated by Highway Engineering in the West Engineering Building, it was decided to
put in a new partition and door, install a dormer as
called for in the original design of the building, and
install three glass tile skylights. The total cost of work
done plus estimate of work yet to do is $I,500. This
space will be for use of Civil Engineering.
The Old Shops and Power House buildings have
been assigned to Architecture, Military Science, and
Automobile Engineering. The estimate for revisions is
not over $6,ooo. Part of this work is now being done;
the remainder cannot be done until December probably.
On the basis of a report by Professor Shepard, the committee agreed that it was impossible at this time to purchase
land off the campus for parking space.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1923

OCTOBER MEETING, 1923


It was estimated that equipment would cost from
$I30,000 to $I40,000 out of the total allowance for this
building of $889,776.33. The cubical contents of the building, calculated to be 2,034,837 cubic feet, determined the
cubic foot estimate at 35.7 cents.
The committee voted to approve the construction of the
building in accordance with the estimate, and authorized
immediate beginning, by the University force, of the excavation and construction of the concrete frame. On this
action, Mr. Smith did not vote due to his belief that a
wider margin for contingencies should be allowed to insure
the actual construction of the building within the estimated
total. Mr. Kahn stated that costs could be reduced, if
necessary, by cutting down on the stone and granite.
The committee considered correspondence from Professor Alfred H. White who felt that the work of equipping the Engineering Shops and Laboratories was not' proceeding as rapidly as its importance demanded.  These
questions were referred to Professor Shepard and Mr. Pardon with the request to push this work in every way possible with due regard for the other needs of the building
program.
Dean Effinger appeared and suggested a different treatment of the lobby of the General Literary Building than
now contemplated. The question was referred to Mr. Kahn
and Dean Effinger for a report.
The committee voted that plate glass should be used in
the Administration Building and the front elevations of the
new Hospital and that double strength sheet glass should
be used for the balance of the building except in the operating room where plate glass would be required. This arrangement made a saving of about $i6,ooo on the cost for
plate glass throughout.
The committee adjourned to meet at the call of the
President.
Regent Leland presented the annual report of the Secretary and the Treasurer of the University, and on his motion the report was received for printing in the usual number of copies. The report was prepared in the same form
as for the last six years with the following exceptions:Schedule I4, pages 35 to 41, gives much more detail
than was formerly given, including a classification of trust




OCTOBER MEETING, 1923


funds by purposes, and including also a careful distinction
between endowment and expendable funds.
In view of Schedule I4, Schedule C does not go into
the detail of former years.
The "Description of Permanent Trust Funds" includes
matter not previously given.
Schedule E, "Analysis of Student Loans," is also new.
Schedule CC and Schedule DD of last year's report
have been consolidated.
The Auditor's certificate accompanying the report is as
follows:Honorable Frank B. Leland, Chairman,
Regents' Committee on Finance,
University of Michigan.
Dear Sir:An audit of the original documents relating to the receipts and expenditures of the University of Michigan for
the year ending June 30, I923 shows that the reports submitted by the Secretary and Treasurer constitute a correct
statement of the financial affairs for the year.
All assets in the form of cash and securities were verified. As physical inventories are only taken in even years,
the figures given for material, supplies, and equipment represent book inventories.
Respectfully submitted,
DURAND W. SPRINGER,
Certified Public Accountant
Ann Arbor, October 25, I923

The Board received from     Professor Sundwall the following recommendations for collecting fees due from students for room calls by part-time members of the Health
Service medical staff and for the application of those
fees:(i) The University Health Service will collect for room
calls at the present rate of $I.oo for each day call and $2.00
for each night call. This money will be collected, as at
present, by the office of the Health Service.
(2) The money collected for all room calls will be
placed to the credit of the Health Service's Extra Employment account.
(3) The extra service rendered by the part-time physician in making room calls at hours outside of his regular




84             OCTOBER MEETING, 1923
hours at the dispensary will be paid for at the rate of $I.00
for day calls and $2.00 for night calls. It is hereby understood that the physician, in making these room calls, will
provide at his own expense all necessary transportation.
(4) Under no circumstances will the physician making
the call collect this fee from students. The payment for
this extra service will be made upon extra time slips which
will be made out from room call report cards filed at the
office of the University Health Service.
(5) Payment for extra service will be made only for
room calls which are arranged for through the University
Health Service.
These recommendations were approved and it is estimated that this action increases the budget of the Health
Service by $I,oo0.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the sum      of $i,ooo was
added to the budget of Women's Physical Education for
the present University year with the expectation that the
sum of $2,766.67 thus provided, including $I,766.67 already
available, will be used for the salary of an assistant professor of Women's Physical Education for the remainder of
the present University year.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the sum      of $1,200 was
added to the available funds of the Dean of Students, to
be used to meet the expenses of the Student Council.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the Board authorized insurance on the University's automobiles against fire and
theft, at an expected expenditure for the year not in excess
of $300.
On motion of Regent Murfin, an appropriation of $150
was made to cover the expense of building a cinder track
in place of the board track adjacent to the Waterman Gymnasium. The original board track was of necessity removed
during the progress of work on the new Campus tunnel.
Regent Murfin's report for the Committee on Student
Welfare was adopted as follows (page 4I):The Committee on Student Welfare has considered the
communication concerning the support and maintenance of
the University Band and recommends as follows:(I) The Board of Regents will provide office and storage space for the band and likewise a place in which the




OCTOBER MEETING, 1923


band may practice. It is understood, however, that the ability to provide satisfactory space in University property is
necessarily contingent upon the progress of the extensive
building program now in process upon the campus;
(2) The Regents will likewise continue to pay the salary of the director;
(3) They will pay the band for its services Commencement Week seven hundred and fifty dollars;
(4) In the opinion of the Board of Regents, any other
maintenance necessary should be furnished under the supervision and direction of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics.
Regent Murfin's report for the Committee on Student
Welfare was adopted as follows (R. P. I920-123, page
8I5) 
The Committee on Student Welfare has considered the
report of the University Committee on Discipline, which report was submitted at the June meeting of the Board of
Regents. The 'Committee reports as follows:(I) That the report of the University Committee on
Discipline be received and placed on file;
(2) In the main, the Board is in sympathy with the
views expressed in this report;
(3) The Board would seriously disapprove the engaging of spies, detectives, or like instrumentalities in connection with the investigation of matters involving student
behavior;
(4) In the opinion of the Board, the University Committee on Discipline is not the type of body that should be
charged with the duty of investigations and examinations
except in so far as they may, by pertinent inquiry not in
the form of inquisition, inquire to discover facts to assist
them in passing upon cases before them. This Committee
is obviously not a fact-gathering agency nor is it feasible to
attempt to make it such;
(5) The Board expresses the hope that continued and
fuller cooperation from the Student Council may be relied
upon to develop facts for submission to the University Committee on Discipline when a proper occasion arises; it being
the hope of the Board of Regents that more power may be
lodged with the Student Council in this particular and more
assistance be obtained from them from time to time.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1923


(6) The Board also expresses the hope that continued
and cordial cooperation may exist between the University
authorities and the Ann Arbor authorities charged with the
duty of maintaining law and order.
Regent Hanchett offered the following resolution which
was adopted (page 49):Resolved, That the proposition of the Sun-Kist Raisin
Company receive favorable action by the Board of Regents
when the contract first submitted shall be duly executed by
the Sun-Kist Raisin Company with the word "elsewhere"
inserted in Paragraph I after the word "employ" in the
fourth line of Article IV.
Regent Hanchett reported for the Committee on Promotion of Research, and on his motion the following resolution was adopted (page 42):Resolved, That the recommendation of the President
that the plan and organization set forth in a certain letter
under date of September 25, I923, for the conduct of the
research work in the Near East be approved with the understanding and proviso that the Regents assume no responsibility further than expressed in the letter of the donor
dated June 25, 19231; and
Resolved, further, That Professor Francis W. Kelsey
be appointed Director of the Near East Research, under the
Near East Research Fund.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board approved the
proffered cooperation of Mr. Nelson Hollis of the Detroit
Edison Company in a study of the efficiency of the University power plant.
Regent Clements reported for the Buildings and Grounds
Committee with respect to three requests for changes in
the Chemical Laboratory (pages 40 and 45). On motion of
Regent Clements, the following appropriations were
made:$25,000 for alteration and equipment of Chemical Laboratory rooms for instruction and research, following the

$2,140 for alteration and equipment of rooms in the Chemical Laboratory for use of the College of Pharmacy.
The Secretary reported for the committee consisting of
Regent Beal and himself, to which had been referred a proposal to lease certain vacant property for a gasoline filling
station (page 33). On recommendation of the committee
and on motion of Regent Murfin, the Board authorized a
lease of the southeast corner of William  and Maynard
streets at a rental of $75 per month, the lease to be subject
to termination at the pleasure of the Regents and to provide
such conditions as should be satisfactory to the Board of
Governors of the Betsy Barbour House.
On motion of Regent Leland, the Board declined to invest trust funds of the University in building and loan
shares.
An inquiry from the executor of the estate of Emma
Lowrey, deceased (R. P. I920-I923, pages 608-609), asking whether the Regents would be willing to receive the bequest in the form of bonds instead of cash was, on motion
of Regent Clements, referred with power to the Finance
Committee.
Regent Leland reported with respect to uninvested trust
funds, suggesting the possibility of investment in bonds of
Wayne County, Michigan, or of the Dominion of Canada,
or of the City of Toronto. On motion of Regent Murfin,
the investment of present free trust funds was referred
with power to the Chairman of the Finance Committee.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the Board referred to Regent Beal and the Assistant Secretary, Mr. Buckley, the
question of additional land for the Botanical Garden.
A communication from Professors Warfield and Newburgh relative to experimental medicine was, on motion of
Regent Sawyer, referred to the Committee of Five for a
report.




88


OCTOBER MEETING, 1923


Regent Murfin reported that on his request, the Common Council of Detroit had remitted taxes on the Cass
Avenue property given to the University by Miss Frances
E. Riggs (pages 38-40). On motion of Regent Gore, the
Board formally approved the action of Regent Murfin in
signing the request to this body for the remission of taxes.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the Board declared that
should the Senate Committee on Discipline take action in
the case of any student convicted of violating traffic laws,
the Regents would approve such action by the committee.
Regent Murfin filed the audit by the Detroit Trust Company of the books of the Michigan Union for the year ended August 31, I923.
On motion of Regent Gore, the salary of Mr. William
H. Buettner, Preparateur, Geological Museum, was increased to the rate of $2,200 per year to date from November I. This action adds $133.33 to the budget of the Geological Museum.
A request for leave of absence during the year 1924 -I925 to Assistant Professor Carl J. Coe was deferred for
consideration at the usual time in accordance with the rules
governing the granting of such leaves. (R. P. I920-1923,
page 705).
A petition signed by various members of the Faculty
and a resolution adopted by the Faculty of the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts were presented. These
documents expressed the hope that the Regents would take
such action as to permit the use of Hill Auditorium by former Attorney-General George W. Wickersham, now representing the League of Nations Non-Partisan Association,
for a discussion of the League of Nations. On motion of
Regent Sawyer, the petition and the resolution were referred to the Committee on Student Welfare.

and Jefferson Street. The committee from the Stud'ents'
Christian Association withdrew. Mr. Kahn was excused to
catch a train. The Committee of Five referred the request

ultimately come into the hands of the University for a University building.

old Engineering Shops. The cost of this work was estimated at $800.
(b) That parking spaces be made on the vacant property at the northeast corner of Washtenaw Avenue and
Volland Street and on the site of the old greenhouse on
South University Avenue between Haven Avenue arid East
University Avenue.  The estimated expense for properly
adapting these parcels of ground to this purpose was $500.

of Ann Street and Observatory Street, in front of the new
University Hospital. It was estimated that $2,500 would

expense. An estimate of cost was not made beyond the
statement that the cost would be a very minor item.
It was further recommended by the Committee of Five
that the University should take steps at once to the end
that with the cooperation of the City of Ann Arbor and
the Michigan Central Railroad there should be improvement in the appearance of the eastern approach to the Michigan Central station.
(e) That planting be done as recommended about the
University Library at an estimated expense of $750.
(f) The Committee of Five further recommended specifically that when the General Literary Building is finished,

doors to the Capitol (R. P. I9q20-I923, page 690), reported
that the casts were in no danger at present and should remain where now placed until the present University Hall
is removed, at which time arrangements should be made
properly to locate the casts elsewhere. It was the opinion
of the committee that it would be inexpedient to place the
casts in Alumni Memorial Hall.
The report of the University Museum for the year ended June 30, I923 was received and placed on file.
On motion of Regent Hanchett and upon the recommendation of the Faculties of the Colleges of Engineering and
Architecture, degrees were voted as follows:BACHELOR Os SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
(MECHANICAL ENGINEERING)
Edwin Strauchen Lauer
BACHELOR Os SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
(ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING)

BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN ARCHITECTURE
(ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING)
Bernard Fink
On motion of Regent Murfin, the Board appropriated
the sum of $I20 to be added to the sum of $I50 appro-priated above (page 84), in order to provide not only an
oval cinder track south of the Waterman Gymnasium but
also to provide a straightaway cinder track of seventy-five
yards.

and Mr. Christensen acting for Mr. Smith. Absent, Mr.
Kahn, Mr. Smith.
The minutes of the meeting of October 25 were approved.




98            NOVEMBER MEETING, 1923
The report of the committee appointed at the meeting
of October 25 to make specific recommendations for a temporary organization for the purchase of equipment for the
new hospital follows:'he committee, consisting of Dr. Parnall, Professor
Shepard, Superintendent Pardon, and Mr. Christensen
met in the Secretary's office on November 8.
The committee has considered the communication of
Dr. Parnall to the Committee of Five under date of October 22, and begs leave to report its recommendations
as follows:I. It is the opinion of the committee that items I
(a) and I (b) (In order that I may be relieved of administrative detail so that I can devote a considerable
part of my time to the supervision of the completion,
furnishing, and occupancy of the new hospital, I recommend that Dr. Donald M. Morrill, Chief Resident Physician, be made Acting Assistant Director without increase in salary.)  (An additional Assistant Resident
Physician should be authorized so that the close checking of the care of State cases which was lately instituted by the Assistant Resident Physician authorized in this
year's budget, can be continued-salary $2,400), are selfevident and should be approved as Dr. Parnall should
have time available for passing on the equipment needed
at the Hospital.
2. The committee recommends that item I (c) (A
man with business training and hospital experience to
work in conjunction with the Purchasing Department in
the selection and buying of equipment-salary $3,000), be
approved and that authority be given to secure a temporary assistant for the selection and purchasing of
equipment for the Hospital. This assistant will spend
his time at first very largely at the Hopital in getting
lists prepared covering equipment needed.  Later his
time would be divided between the Purchasing Department and the Hospital. This person is to report to the
Director of the Hospital in the selection of equipment
and to the Purchasing Agent in relation to purchasing
equipment.
3. It appears to the committee that provision
should be made for a layout man, item I (d) (A competent draftsman to be furnished through the office of
the Supervisor of Plans who will prepare preliminary




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1923


99


sketches and plans of all equipment and who will work
with the Medical Staff standardizing laboratory and
ward installation as far as it is possible to do so), with
drafting and clerical ability, who would make layouts
of the different rooms under the direction of Dr. Parnall,
and that he should be in communication with Dr. Shepard as to details of special equipment to be constructed.
It is recommended that the person for this work be secured at once and that he report to Dr. Parnall.
4. It is recommended that authorization be given
to employ such clerical help as may be necessary. This
clerical help may not be very much at first but perhaps will be greater as the work progresses.
5. On account of the crowded condition at the Hospital office, it is suggested that rooms be secured in a
house opposite the Hospital as the temporary office for
the layout man with table or desk space for handling
the work to be done.
6. The necessary furniture required should be purchased for later use in the Hospital except where secondhand furniture can be secured.
C. G. PARNALL, Chairman of Committee
J. C. CHRISTNSSENT, Secretary of Committee
The committee voted that the report be accepted as the
recommendation of the Committee of Five except that the assistant for the selection and purchasing of equipment for the
Hospital is to be a member of the staff of the Purchasing
Department of the University and is to report to the Purchasing  Agent, provided, however, that the  equipment
selected is to have the approval of the Director of the
Hospital before ordering.
Dr. Shepard spoke in regard to the division of responsibility in signing requisitions for the purchase of equipment
for the new Hospital.
It was voted that requisitions for all purely movable hospital equipment should originate with Dr. Parnall, with the
understanding that requisitions for specially constructed equipment should have the approval of Dr. Shepard before ordering; and that requisitions for all construction equipment, that
is, equipment that is to be part of the building, including the
lighting, are to originate with Dr. Shepard.
It was voted that a complete survey should be made of
the work needed to complete and equip the Hospital, including




I00


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1923


estimates of cost, with apportionment to the several divisions
of the Hospital, and that after the survey and apportionment
have been adopted by the Committee of Five, it is to be understood that no deviation is to be made from this apportionment except by express authority of the Committee of
Five.
Dr. Shepard reported the condition of alterations undertaken under authority of appropriation by the Regents (page
54) at the old Engineering Shops to furnish quarters for the
College of Architecture. It appears that the original estimate
of $6,ooo will not be sufficient to complete that portion of
the work on the quarters assigned to the College of Architecture and, therefore, it is recommended that an additional
appropriation of $I,ooo be made for that purpose.
It was voted by the committee that approval be given
to Mr. Kahn's arrangement with the John A. Rowe Cut
Stone Company for doing work during the winter months
at an additional allowance of twenty cents per cubic foot
for any such work in addition to that provided in the contract.
It was voted that in handling the building program,
there should be a general superintendent of construction under Mr. Pardon and that there should be a superintendent
under this general superintendent at each of the buildings
under construction.
The committee adjourned to meet at 2:30 P. M. Thursday, November 22, 1923.
On motion of Regent Clements, the action of the Executive Committee was approved as recorded in the committee's minutes as follows:November 17, 1923
Present, the President, Regents Beal and Sawyer.
The committee appropriated the sum of $700 for special
equipment for the Department 'of Engineering Research.
This action was taken as an emergency action in order that
the equipment for the department might be ordered at once.
Large shipments of coal are expected, under the present low
prices, and it seemed desirable that special equipment for testing of coal before unloading should be provided for the department. The request had the approval of Dean Cooley,
and the action of the committee was approved by the
Buildings and Grounds Committee.




NOVEMBER MEETING, I923

On motion of Regent Clements, the action of the Finance
Committee and the President, acting as a special committee,
was confirmed in accordance with the minutes of the committee as follows:

Hubbard.
The committee granted the request which involved the
following changes in the budget:An instructor in Geology at the minimum salary.......$,5co

$3,000
The Board received for filing the reports of Mr. J. C.
Christensen under dates of November 2 and November I4,
bringing up the cost accounting of the building program to
October 23 and November 6, respectively.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board approved the
action of the President and Secretary as the Emergency
Committee provided by the By-Laws, Chapter III, A, Section I (b), in appropriating not to exceed $241.30 for electric fixtures and their installation in the Secretary's office, including the Purchasing Department.

A MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE ON PROMOTION OF RESEARCH OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
IN CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND
GENERAL     MANAGER     OF   THE    MICHIGAN
MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
I. The conference was unanimous in the opinion that
the policy of publicity of results developed in the Industrial




II4


"NOVEMBiERE MEETING, 1923


Research Laboratory was sound. This was a reiteration
of the conclusion reached at the meeting held on June I4,
I923.
2. The conference was unanimously of the opinion that
a "Promotion Man" should be added to the staff. It would
be the function of this official to acquaint the manufacturers
of the state with the aims and purposes of the Industrial Research Laboratory and to convince them of its value to the
manufacturing interests of Michigan.
3. After considerable discussion it was unanimously
agreed that this new official should be a University appointee.
Viith these principles established, the conference proceeded to consider the best methods for putting them in operation. In this connection, it was further agreed:(I) That the President and General Manager of the
Michigan Manufacturers Association would bring before
the Board of Directors of their organization the conclusion reached in this conference, and in particular
would ascertain whether the Michigan Manufacturers
Association would provide the salary of the new officer.
It was very distinctly stated by Regent Hanchett, Chairman of the Committee on Promotion of Research, that
this was not to be thought of either as an ultimatum or
a final request of the Board of Regents. Regent Sawyer
emphasized the fact that it should be thought of in terms
of cooperation and mutual understanding; and
(2) It was understood that both groups would feel
perfectly free to nominate persons for the position and
that the appointment when finally made should be mutually acceptable.
Regent Leland, as Chairman of the Finance Committee,
reported the purchase of bonds of the City of Toronto in
the sum   of $50,ooo on an earning basis of 5T4 per cent,
bonds of Orange County, Florida, in the sum        of $30,000
on an earning basis of 5.28 per cent, and bonds of Lake
County, Florida, in the sum of $30,000 on an earning basis
of 5 per cent.   These investments were made from       uninvested trust funds of the University as authorized by the
Regents at the meeting of October 26, I923 (page 87).
With reference to the estate of Emma Lowrey and the
proposal of the executor that the Regents receive the bequest
in the form of bonds instead of cash (page 87), Regent Le



NO VE3BER MEETING, 1923


I15


land reported that he had informed the executor that the
University preferred to receive-cash for the amount of the
bequest.
On motion of Regent Leland, the Board voted to accept
the proposal of Emma A. Doyle (R. P. I920-1923, page
639) for a present payment of $2,000 in cash for an assignment of all rights of the University under the will of Agnes
C. Wreaver. This action was taken with a view of avoiding
possible litigation and on the advice of the Board's attorneys
and of the legal firm of Cutting, Moore, and Sidley of Chicago.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the matter of the purchase
of certain property on Fourteenth Street was referred to
Regent Beal and Assistant Secretary Buckley with power.
Regent Beal reported on the success of the recent meeting in Chicago of the Association of Governing Boards of
State Universities and Allied Institutions, at which meeting
Mr. Durand W\. Springer, University Auditor, was made
Secretary and Treasurer of the association.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board voted to join
the association and appropriated the sum   of $95 for the
yearly dues.
Regent Sawyer was excused.
On motion of Regent Murfin, Paul Buckley was made
Assistant Secretary of the Regents.
On motion of Regent Murfin, Miss Emilie Gleason Sargent of Detroit was appointed to the Board of Governors of
the Martha Cook Building to fill the unexpired term     of
Miss Grace Grieve Millard (R. P. I917-1920, page 692).
On motion of Regent Clements, the following statement,
as presented by Regent Murfin, was approved and made a
matter of record:
The attention of the Board has been attracted to the fact
that there is considerable public discussion of the question
of an enlarged stadium for football games at Ferry Field.
Moreover we are informed that the subject is receiving considerable attention from those officially charged with the duty
of controlling inter-collegiate athletics. We deem it proper,
therefore, seasonably to express our views on this matter.
(I). We are in cordial sympathy with any plan that fosters and encourages clean and wholesome inter-collegiate




II6


6 NOVEMBER MEETING, 1923


contests. We regard the physical welfare of our students
with growing interest and prize highly every agency which
develops the spirit of true sportsmanship.
(2) We should seriously regret any policy that would
strengthen the tendency to transform the amateur collegiate
contest into a public spectacle with some of the evils which
seem inevitably to accompany some events in the world of
sportsmanship.
(3) Inter-collegiate athletics should be conducted primarily for the students and alumni of the competing institutions, for their friends and families, and for the immediate constituencies of the participating schools.
(4)  Consideration must be given to certain very practical aspects of the problem arising out of the limitations
of a small city such as Ann Arbor.   Spectators must be
provided with meals and housing facilities.  Special trains
require railroad yards which do not exist and could only be
provided with great difficulty. The parking of automobiles
is already a perplexing problem.
(5) The solicitation of a fund amounting to one and
a half millions of dollars would not at this time meet with
our approval in view of other very proper demands that have
been and may be made upon our graduates and the constituency of the University.
(6)  In view of the foregoing observations and with the
thought of avoiding an undue emphasis upon inter-collegiate
competition and one which in our judgment is frequently misinterpreted, we venture to suggest that those primarily in
charge of the matter may find the most satisfactory solution
of the problem by proceeding to the completion of the concrete stadium heretofore planned, the south unit of which
has rendered and is now rendering such satisfactory service.
By this method we understand about thirteen thousand seats
would be added making it possible to accommodate approximately fifty thousand spectators.
On motion of Regent Clements, the report of Professor
Clarence T. Johnston with regard to certain lands adjacent
to Camp Davis was received with approval, and the Board
directed that the suggestions of Professor Johnston be
adopted.
On motion of Regent Leland, the resignation of Assistant Professor LeRoy C. Abbott of the Department of Surgery was accepted to take effect December i, 1923, and Dr.

voted for supplies for the dispensing room of the Department of Chemical Engineering.

Salary account of the department for the purpose of hiring
six student assistants at $i.50 each for the present academic
year.

Campus
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Dear Mr. Burton:
At the next meeting of the Committee of Five the
following with reference to the items recommended by Pitkin
& Mott can be reported:
(a) The old PoWer House which has been used as a
Fire Station and a storage place for the Buildings and
Grounds Department for some years has been sold to S. A.
Elsifor for $200, who is to remove everything including the
concrete floor 6 inches below ground level. This will reduce
the cost of the work estimated at $8oo by $700.
(b) Work is progressing on the making of parking
space on the vacant property at the northeast corner of
Washtenaw Avenue and Volland Street.
We have not yet been successful in having Christman Company remove their materials from     the old
greenhouse site on South University Avenue but expect
to start work on this as soon as the materials are removed.
(c) This can be eliminated entirely as it does not seem
necessary.
(d) The first paragraph in this recommendation is to
be taken care of by the Buildings and Grounds Department
this fall.
The other items are the furnishing of estimates and
sketches of addition to Waterman Gymnasium which are now
in your hands and the plans and estimates for the enlarged
sewer on the Campus which we expect to have ready within
the next few days.
Yours very truly,
E. C. PARDON, Superintendent

Professor Edmund E. Day offered the following plan for
the organization of the School of Business Administration:
To the Members of the Board of Regents
of the University of Michigan:The Department of Economics of the University begs to
submit to the Board of Regents a plan involving a complete
reorganization of the work now carried on within the Department. The proposed plan involves changes requiring
formal action by the Board. The nature of the reorganization will appear from the following recommendations:I. That the three divisions (Economics, Sociology, and
Business Administration) of the work of the present Department of Economics be separated, and that, as soon as the
changes can be effected,
(a) the Department of Economics in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, confine its program to
work in Economics;
(b) a Department of Sociology be created in the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, to handle
such instruction as may be hereafter offered in Sociology;
(c) a School of Business Administration be established as a separate division of the University, with its
own administrative and instructional staff, to take over
and enlarge the present offering of courses in Business
Administration.




I38


DECEMBER MEETING, 1923


II. That the School of Business Administration be set
up with a two-year program of professional study, and that
the degree of Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.)
be awarded upon successful completion of the two years of
work.
III. That the requirements for admission to the School
of Business Administration consist of satisfactory completion
of the work of the first three years in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, at this University, or of equivalent work of collegiate grade.
IV. That the School of Business Administration be
allowed, with the approval of the Faculty of the College of
Literature, Science,- and the Arts, to avail itself of the customary privileges of the combined degrees, so that students
who have completed the first year's work of the School and
at least one year of resident work in the Literary College
with the required extra points, may obtain the A.B. degree
from the Literary College, upon recommendation of the faculty of the School of Business Administration.
V. That steps be taken for the earliest possible establishment of the School of Business Administration. It is
hoped that provision may be made for the opening of the
School in September 1924, with at least a skeleton organization and an offering of its full first-year program. Substantial expansion of the work in 1925-1926 should be definitely planned. These steps will involve, of course, immediate additions to the budget for 1924-1925, with the expectation that further increases will be possible in 1925-I926, But
it is earnestly hoped that financial means will be forthcoming since, in the light of progress made at other institutions,
the establishment of the School at this University would
seem to have been already too long delayed.
'The maintenance of a strong Department of Economics
in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will be
more important than ever if a separate School of Business
Administration is created. The work of the School of Business Administration should rest in no small measure on a
thorough training of the, students in Economics in the Literary College. Everything possible should be done, therefore,
to strengthen the Economics Department in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, that the Department may
continue to maintain the high standards of instruction which
have for many years brought distinction to its work.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1923


I39


The proposal of a separate Department of Sociology in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, calls for
relatively little comment. Sociology is as much entitled to
an independent departmental organization as many other
branches of study which have long since acquired departmental status in the Literary College. Separation of the work
in Sociology has long been considered, and should be definitely provided for in connection with the reorganization of
the work of the present Economics Department.
The organization of a separate School of Business Administration is highly important if this line of work is to
be developed as it should be here at the University. In the
first place, the present arrangement is objectionable in that
instruction in Business Administration is essentially vocational or professional and quite inappropriate for the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. In the second
place, many of the administrative problems involved in the
development of adequate instruction in Business Administration are unlike those of the Literary College, and can be dealt
with satisfactorily only through a separate administrative organization.
In the third place, it is desirable to develop a separate
administrative unit in order that the highly important contacts with outside business concerns may be properly developed and maintained. These contacts are known to be indispensable in the development of satisfactory instruction in
Business Administration, as well as in the pursuit of valuable
research in this field. Everything should be done to make sure
that the contacts are properly organized; a separate School
is needed to insure the effectiveness of the arrangements.
Finally, a separate School is imperative for the development of a professional spirit in the teaching staff and student
body. The creaton of this spirit is in many ways the fundamental objective in the organization of high-grade instruction
in this field. It is the firm belief of the members of the Department that a separate School is indispensable in the advancement of instruction in Business Administration under
standards worthy of this great University.
The proposed form of organization for the School of
Business Administration is in line with the standards set by
the best schools of business at other institutions. Forms of
organizations for collegiate schools of business vary widely.
In some institutions the work is given in a separate college,
offering a four-year undergraduate program. At the other
extreme, two schools of an entirely different sort offer two



I40


DECEMBER MEETING, 1923


year graduate programs given over to strictly professional
instruction. It is believed that the plan recommended above
effects a highly desirable compromise between the purely
graduate and purely undergraduate types of school. With
two years of professional study, following three years of
more general cultural work, the graduates of the School
should start with an excellent training for careers of responsibility in business.
Respectfully submitted,
(Signed:) EDMUND E. DAY
Chairman
December 14, I923
On motion of Regent Gore, the Board approved the above
plan except in so far as it applies to the proposed separation
of the work in Sociology from the Department of Economics
in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, which
subject was left open for further consideration. The above
action includes the establishment of the School of Business
Administration at the beginning of the next fiscal year and
the appointment of Professor Day as Dean of the School
and Chairman of the Department of Economics in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, with a combined
salary of $Io,ooo.
Regent Hanchett took his seat.
Following the recommendation of the Senate Council, the
Board, on motion of Regent Hubbard, voted certain honorary degrees to be conferred at Commencement in June
1924 under the usual conditions.

sum of $I,ooo for the purchase of books for the Chemistry
Library and for the Library of the Department of Chemical
Engineering.
On motion of Regent Gore, the Board declined at this
time to provide funds for the purchase of radium.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the Board declared that
in the matter of the remission of fees to members of the
Graduate School its policy would remain as at present; i.e.,
each case would be considered on its individual merits.
The Board considered the request for the remission of
fees in the case of Fellows on the Clarence Graff Foundation, the object of which is "to foster a better understanding




DECEMBER MEETING, I923


I4I


in Great Britain of social conditions and currents of opinion
in the United States of America and to establish friendly
contact." On motion of Regent Beal it was directed that the
Foundation should be notified that the University would
look with favor upon having its Fellows in residence and
that such conditions as to tuition as prevailed'at other MidWest universities would be acceptable here. This action was
taken with the understanding that the other universities in
question would be informed that the University of Michigan
would not look with favor upon the remission of fees and
that an indication of their proposed action would be appreciated.
Dean Cooley communicated to the Board that the Division
of Deans and Administrative Officers of Engineering Schools
and Colleges of the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Research would meet in Ann Arbor, January 25 and 26,
I924. On motion of Regent Hubbard, the sum of $300 was
appropriated for the expenses of a banquet to the members
present at the meeting.
On motion of Regent Hanchett, the fees of Dr. Alvaro
Lemnos Torres, Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation, who
is undertaking special researches in Cardiology in the Medical School, were remitted for the present year.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, Professor Arthur L. Cross
was authorized to extend a cordial invitation to the American
Historical Association to hold its annual meeting for the
year 1925 or I926 at the University. The sum of $500 was
allowed for the entertainment of delegates.

JANUARY MEETING
UNIVERSIT'Y OF M\ICHIIGAN, I
ANN ARBOR, JANUARY 24, I924    i
The Board met in the Regents' Room at 7:35 P. M. for
the evening session in advance of the normal day of meeting.
Present, the President, Regent Murfin, Regent Beal, Regent Sawyer, Regent Clements, Regent H-anchett, Regent
Gore, and Regent Stone whose term of office began January I, I924. Absent, Regent IIubbard and Superintendent Johnson.
The President and the members welcomed Regent Stone
to the Board.
On motion of Regent Gore, Regent Stone was chosen
to initial vouchers for the months of January and February.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the minutes of the meeting of December 20 and 21 were approved as submitted to
the members in proof with certain specified changes.
On motion of Regent Murfin, the. actions of the Executive Committee were approved as recorded in the committee's minutes as follows:December 21, 1923
The commlittee assembled in the office of the President
at 2:30.
Present, the President, Regents Beal and Sawyer.
Dr. C. G. Parnall and Dean Hugh Cabot appeared before the committee at different times.
It was voted that the President be authorized to
secure Dr. Joseph Howland, Superintendent of the Peter
Bent Brigham Hospital of Boston, as a Hospital Consultant in connection with the completion, equipment, and organization of the New University Hospital.




152            JANUARY MEETING, 1924
It was also voted that at the conclusion of Dr. Howland's work, Dr. William J. Mayo be invited to come to
Ann Arbor for a day or two to confer with the committee
about the problem in general.
The whole question of full-time was discussed at considerable length, including Dr. Wile's suggestion made in
his letter of November 26 to the President. In general
the consensus of opinion seemed to be that it would be best
to proceed upon the policy now in operation, namely, having
some of our men on full-time, others on part-time, with
the thought that the entire arrangement be a gradual evolution. No vote of this kind was passed, but this was the
general opinion which prevailed at this meeting.
January I5, 1924
Present, the President, Regents Beal and Sawyer.
The committee approved the request of Dean Cabot
for an increase at the rate of $300 per year in the salary
of William  Troy, animal keeper of the Department of
Surgery, to be effective as of January I. The $I50 required
will not increase the budget as there is an unexpended
balance in the department's account for salaries.
When the budget for the present year was adopted, the
Regents approved the payment to William  Troy of $300
from the Salary account of the Department of Homoeopathy. This arrangement was not found satisfactory and
consequently M\r. Troy has been receiving a total salary of
$300 less than provided in the Medical School budget.
The present action is taken to correct the situation.
January 17, I924
Present, the President, Regents Beal and Sawyer.
The committee added the sum of $3700 to the budget

lectures) on special topics and by nationally known public
health  workers.  These  courses  will be arranged  to
follow one another, that is, they will continue throughout a
session of six weeks. Estimated cost, $2,000.
2. Seven short lecture courses on medical topics to
be given by members of our medical staff. Estimated cost,
$700.




JANUARY MEETING, 1924

in the interest of public health instruction, has selected
Columbia University, the University of Iowa, the University of California, and the University of Michigan to conduct "Public Health Summer Schools" during the summer
months of I9,24. Announcements are to be mailed by the
Bureau to approximately eighty thousand physicians and
twenty thousand sanitarians of various kinds. It is expected
that the program. already arranged by Director Sundwall
for courses in public health during the summer session
will, with the above additions, prove so attractive that
sufficient students will enroll to reimburse the University
for all additional expense.
January I8, I924
Present, the President, Regents Beal and Sawyer.
The committee granted the request of Professor Jesse
S. Reeves of the Department of Political Science for leave
of absence for the coming semester under the usual terms
and conditions.

To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:It is obviously futile to expect successful results in
the administration of the Hospital without a spirit of
harmony prevailing throughout the organization. As it
is impossible, under present circumstances, to reconcile
my own views of administration with those which prevail, no other course is open to me than to sever my
connection with the University.
I, therefore, hereby tender my resignation as Director of the Hospital and Professor of Administrative
Medicine to take effect June 30, I924. My resignation
now will allow you ample opportunity to select my successor or to take such action as you may desire.
Respectfully,
C. G. PARNALT,"

Dr. Christopher G. Parnall as Director of the Hospital and
Professor of Administrative Medicine be accepted with regret
and that the Board hereby conveys to Dr. Parnall its gen

For the purpose of correcting previous minutes, the Assistant Secretary reported the following as the correct description of the property involved in the agreement between
the Regents and Sybrand Haaxma (R. P. I920-I923, page
722):At the meeting of the Board held March 29, 1923 (R.
P. I920-I923, page 747), the Secretary filed a copy of the
agreement between Sybrand Haaxma and Caroline Haaxma,
husband and wife, parties of the first part, and the Regents,
parties of the second part, in accordance with authority given
at the February meeting (R. P. 1920-1923, page 722).
When the abstract to the property deeded by Haaxma
and wife to the Regents in exchange for property deeded to
said Haaxma and wife was examined, it developed that the
title to the property was subject to a certain right of way
clause. This right of way clause was incorporated in the
deed received. Also, the property consisted of the EV2 of the
lot in question and not the W'2 as stated in the report of the
Executive Committee as referred to above. The following
is the description of the property with the right of way
clause as it appears in the deed as recorded:The East Thirty-Three (33) Feet of Lot Number
Eleven (II) in Block Two (2) North, Range Fourteen
(14) East, in the Eastern Addition to the City of Ann
Arbor, according to the recorded plat thereof.

It is Mutually Agreed by and between the parties hereto
that the agreement of July 26 A. D. 1922, shall be

tution or institutions will fully conform to all the provisions
of the present instrument.
Six: With regard to the maintenance and care of the
objects of art accepted as parts of the Albert M. Todd

transfer said objects to said art museum.
(c) That the University will at its own expense
cause The Albert M. Todd Collection to be properly
and constantly maintained, cared for, protected, repaired,
clearly labeled for defining each object, and kept clean

of the University will render better public service by
being so placed may be deposited in the University
Library.

library building, or other buildings, by suitable persons,




262               APRIL MEETING, 1924

have been made to the University by the party of the first
part prior to this agreement are to become parts of the
Albert M. Todd Collection and subject to the provisions of
this agreement.
Nine: It is agreed that any of the provisions of this instrument may be suspended or modified in any respect whatsoever should it seem desirable to do so for the best interests of the Albert M. Todd Collection and of the University;
provided, however, that no provision of this agreement shall
be suspended or modified without the written consent of both
parties to this agreement; but in case of the death of the
party of the first part, the trustees of his estate, or his heirs,
are empowered to act for him until the period of twenty-five
years above mentioned shall have expired.
Ten: This agreement is declared to be binding upon the

l MAY MEETING, I924


Honorable Ralph Stone,
Chairman, Finance Committee of Regents,
University of Michigan.
Dear Sir:At the meeting of the Regents June I4, 1923 (page
82I), "the University officers were instructed to secure appraisals by local authorities, preferably assessing officers,
of certain real estate forming part of the investment of a
number of trust funds, and when such appraisals should be
secured in satisfactory form, to include these amounts in
the trust fund inventory."
Officers of the University, including Messrs. Campbell,
Christensen, Springer, and Buckley have given considerable
attention to this matter, much of it under your counsel and
direction. During investigation, it proved to be more feasible
and in some respects better to secure appraisals by others
than assessing officers. You are familiar with the reasons
why we availed ourselves of the implied permission in the
Regents' action to secure appraisals from other competent
sources than assessing officers.
Attached herewith is a complete list of the University
real estate not on the books at the time of the Regents'
action and therefore covered by the direction of the Regents
quoted above. This list includes also, as stated in it, certain
real estate acquired since the Regents' action.
If you and the Board as a whole accept and approve
the report and authorize the placing of the property on the
books accordingly, the books will then show all of the real
estate owned by the University as investments of trust
funds.
Respectfully submitted,
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary

MAY MEETING, 1924


President Marion L. Burton,
University of Michigan.
My dear President Burton:I wish to present to you my resignation from the position
of Director of Homceopathic Laboratories of the Medical
School of the University of Michigan, such resignation to
take effect December 31, I924, and further to request that
a leave of absence be granted beginning July I, 1924.
The severance of my connection with the University is
in accord with the understanding that I had with you at the
time of the merging of the two medical schools-that is,
that my services in the new relation should be of temporary
duration. The merger has been in existence two years and I
feel that I must get back to my own especial work, which I
have had only small opportunity for in the last years.
It is my plan to accept the position of obstetrician in
the new Forest Hills Homoeopathic Hospital which is being constructed in Cleveland, confining my work to the practice of obstetrics and gynecology.
May I take this occasion to express to you personally,
President Burton, and to the Board of Regents of the University, my appreciation of the support and consideration accorded to me and to the three other members of the Homoeopathic group during a period of difficult change and adjustment. It is with deep regret that I sever my connection
with the University of Michigan.
Very respectfully yours,
ScorT C. RUNNELS
May I7, I924
On motion of Regent Murfin, Dr. Runnel's resignation
was accepted with regret in accordance with its terms. To
meet the situation created by the resignation of Dr. Runnels,
Assistant Professor Linn J. Boyd was promoted to be
Associate Professor of Homoeopathic Practice and Director
of the Homoeopathic Laboratory with salary of $4,500 for
the year 1924-1925, and the salary of Dr. Alfred G. Nast

regret the resignation of Miss Blanche Howell as Director

discussion of any subject in the whole field of knowledge.

and authorized the Treasurer to s'gn such receipt as might be
proper.
Regent Stone presented the following letter:To the Honorable Board of Regents,
University of Michigan.
Gentlemen:I am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Alice B. MartinHutsinpillar of Los Angeles, California, in which she expresses a desire to make a gift of $Io,ooo the proceeds of
which are to be made available for the Board of Governors
of the Adelia Cheever House for scholarships granted to residents of that house.  Mrs. Hutsinpillar's former husband
was Dr. Martin, long a member of the Medical Faculty of
the University, and she is deeply interested in the students
here. She desires to make an arrangement by which the income would be available for the use of herself and her husband during their lives. The gift will be in the form of real
estate mortgages in Los Angeles.  For special reasons it
would be very satisfactory if the gift could be accepted and
announced this commencement week, the necessary details between the University and Mrs. Hutsinpillar being arranged
later.
Trusting it will be possible to do this, I am,
Yours respectfully,
EDWIN C. GODDARD
June 12, 1924
On motion of Regent Stone, the Regents expressed their
deep appreciation of the purpose of the proffered gift and of
the generosity of the donor, and agreed to accept it if it might
be made under the following plan, or one of a similar nature
which would relieve the University from administrative responsibility during such time as the donors or the survivor of
them desired that the fund should be invested otherwise than
under the absolute control of the Board of Regents. The
method proposed by the Regents, above referred to, contemplated that the gift should be made as an irrevocable
transfer to a proper trust company, with the provision that
at the death of the donors it should come to the Regents
absolutely, in trust for the purposes stated in Professor Goddard's letter, or in such instrument as might later be drawn
expressing the same idea.
On motion of Regent Stone, the Board joined with the




ANNUAL JUNE MEETING, r924


321


Alumni Association in approving a transfer from the accumulated income of the Williams Professorship Fund to
the principal of that fund in such amount as might be necessary to bring the principal up to the sum of $36,000.00.
Further, the Regents joined with the Alumni Association in
granting the annual interest upon this principal up to $I,500
to Dean Wilbert B. Hinsdale, as a retiring allowance, beginning with 1924-1925.
Regent Stone presented the following resolution, adopted
by the Alumni Association:Resolved, That the Board of Directors of the Alumni
Association of the University of Michigan recommend that
the Williams Professorship Fund which was originally established by the old Alumni organization should be transferred
to the Alumni Fund, as a restricted gift, to be administered
by the Trustees in accordance with the present provision for
the distribution of the income.
In view of the fact that the Directors of the Alumni
Association are planning to transfer the endowment fund of
the Alumni Association, in a similar manner, to the Alumni
Fund, with the hope that these two funds will offer an adequate basis for, and stimulate interest in, the Alumni Fund,
the Regents, on motion of Regent Stone, approved the resolution of the Alumni Association quoted above.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, leave of absence with
salary was granted to Professor Reuben Peterson for six
weeks during the coming university year. It is understood
that Professor Peterson's work will be cared for during his
absence by his colleagues.
Dean Cabot and Mr. R. G. Greve, Acting Director of the
University Hospital, in a written communication, reported
progress on the problem of using the old hospital buildings
after the opening of the new hospital (page 268).
On motion of Regent Sawyer, Dean Cabot and Mr.
Greve were asked to continue their investigation, and the
Secretary was requested to consider with the committee the
question of lessening the fire hazard at the hospital.
A joint communication was received from Dean Cabot
and Professor Hickey, relative to the possible establishment
of an institute in connection with the Hospital and the Med

ANNUAL JUNE MEETING, I924


ical School, for research. On motion of Regent Murfin,
the Board appointed a committee of the Medical Faculty,
consisting of Dean Cabot, Professor Hickey, and Professor
Newburgh, to advise with the President, should the matter
develop to the point where it requires attention before the
next meeting of the Regents. The committee was empowered to carry forward the necessary negotiations without
committing the Regents to any permanent action.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, the Board granted the request of Dean Lloyd for an appropriation of $3,000.00 to
be expended for the benefit of the Graduate School for such
purposes as the Dean might find of greatest benefit to the
School. It was provided, however, that this appropriation
should not be effective unless it could be made available
properly out of trust funds (page 304). This action was
taken by the following vote:-Yes, Regent Sawyer, Regent
Clements, Regent Hanchett, and Regent Stone; no, Regent
Murfin, Regent Beal; not voting, Regent Hubbard.
The Secretary referred to the Regents the treatment of
the University by the fire insurance companies carrying the
University risk. He reported that, since the passage of the
so-called "Anti-Discrimination Law," the rates on the University buildings had increased, on the average, to two and
one-half times the rates at which the companies had originally solicited and accepted this business. During the last
seven years, the University has paid, according to the report,
premiums of over $107,000.00, and has collected fire losses
of less than $Io,ooo.oo. On motion, this matter was referred to Regent Clements, and the Secretary for such action
as they might deem wise.
On motion of Regent Murfin, Roger Leroy Morrison was

"regular" in the action taken at the September meeting 1923
(page 41) when the Board voted that regular leaves of ab.
sence should be disregarded in the payment of the Uni
versity's share in the premiums on annuities purchased by
members of the Faculty at the joint expense of themselves
and of the University. On motion of Regent Murfin, the
Board held that the word "regular" in this connection was
intended to cover leaves of absence granted under the socalled "Sabbatical plan," (R. P. 1920-I923, pages 434-435)
and that when a member of the Faculty had a leave of absence without salary or for the purpose of engaging in business or professional work for gain, whatever payments might
be made toward the purchase of annuities should, during the
period of such leaves, be made by the Faculty member alone,
without contribution from the University, excepting only

otherwise.

motion of Regents Clements, the committee adopted the following resolution:Resolved, That the University authorities proceed to let
contracts or do work as required to push the hospital to the
completion of building and equipment (a) with all possible
speed, but (b) absolutely within the total limit of the estimates of June 13. It is specifically understood (I) that
every possible economy consistent with good work be practised in completion and equipment, and (2) that those items
on which the committee depends for savings to meet possible
unforeseen contingencies, be held back until it is clear,
through the development of events, whether any items in the
schedule will overrun the figures therein presented. It is

be completed and equipped within the sum allowed.
A request was presented for an additional allowance for
equipment for the Physics Building. The committee voted
that, while thoroughly in sympathy with the department and
its needs, due to lack of funds this committee has no recourse
but to lay the matter on the table for the present, with the

by the Board of Regents (page II9).
The committee voted that, after reasonable notice to the
present tenant, the small, old house at 308 South I4th Street
should be razed, as the need for space for storage is greater
than the value of the small rent which these premises could
reasonably be expected to produce.
The question of drainage for Palmer Field and, indeed,
the general development of Palmer Field, were referred back
to the Secretary to secure further information from Messrs.
Pitkin and Mott, in conference with Superintendent Pardon.

from Dean Cooley, with respect to the efficiency of the University power plant, as compared with what would be obtainable if certain testing and measuring apparatus were installed and continuously operated by an expert mechanic,.

Mr. Kahn submitted designs of lamps for exteriors oi
new buildings. These were referred back to him for the
possibility of developing a design equally beautiful and artistic at less cost.

a certain lot on Observatory Street, at a cost not to exceed

motion of Regent Beal, this further generosity of Mr. Booth
was accepted, with the thanks of the Regents.
Professor Lorch gave notice that this fellowship for the
present year had been divided, on the basis of the competition between two out of a total of ten competitors. The
winners were Ralph R. Calder, '23 of Detroit, and Marion

A committee consisting of Professors C. H. Cooley, A.
E. Wood, and R. H. Holmes recommended to the Regents

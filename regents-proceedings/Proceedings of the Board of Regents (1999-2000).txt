JULY MEETING, 1999


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, July 15, 1999
The Regents convened at 9:10 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Homing, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Taylor,
and White. Also present were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin, Interim Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Vice President and General Counsel
Krislov, Executive Vice President Omenn, Interim Chancellor Schmoll, Vice President
and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Chancellor
Renick was absent; Provost Simpson attended in his place.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and announced the appointment of
Juan Mestas as chancellor of the University of Michigan-Flint. Dr. Mestas, who was
present, said that he was honored to be asked to lead the University of Michigan-Flint
campus and he was eagerly looking forward to joining the University of Michigan family.
A round of applause followed.
Resolution in honor of Beverly Schmoll
Regent Taylor called Interim Chancellor Schmoll to the podium and read the
following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan express their sincere
appreciation to Beverly J Schmoll for the leadership and vision she has
provided as interim chancellor of the University of Michigan-Flint since August
1, 1998.
A loyal and effective advocate for students, faculty, and staff as well as for
the City of Flint and surrounding communities, Interim Chancellor Schmoll has
provided strong representation for the campus at the Regents' table and in
Lansing.  She facilitated the smooth integration of the Northbank Center
property into the Flint campus and preparations for the new Professional
Studies Classroom Building to be built later this year. She also has made
important contributions to the UM-Flint's self-evaluation for the campus'
upcoming North Central Association accreditation visit.
Interim Chancellor Schmoll has maintained communication with members
of the UM-Flint community through monthly reports, open door sessions she
hostedfor individuals who wished to speak with her personally, and innovative
faculty and staff appreciation activities. Through her own positive outlook and
determination to keep the UM-Flint on course, Interim Chancellor Schmoll has
led the campus community through an important transition and prepared itfor
a new administration.
With deep gratitude and high praise for a challenging assignment
performed masterfully, the Regents commend Beverly J Schmoll for her
distinguished leadership to the University of Michigan-Flint and extend warmest




July Meeting, 1999


best wishes to her as she resumes her duties as dean of graduate programs and
research and as professor ofphysical therapy on the Flint campus.
A round of applause followed. Chancellor Schmoll said that it had been a privilege
to serve as interim chancellor this past year and thanked everyone for their support.
1999-2000 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
President Bollinger called on Executive Vice President Kasdin, who noted that the
University is in excellent financial shape, with a strong balance sheet, a sound health
system, and a general fund operating budget that is fully consistent with the
University's financial health. Maintaining the University's financial health, he said,
involves effectively tracking and managing financial performance; determining whether the
current circumstances are consistent with protecting the University's balance sheet, as
determined by the mix and quality of assets, the relationship of current assets to current
liabilities, and the size and nature of the University's liabilities; and evaluating the
proposed budgets to ensure they maintain the University's overall financial health.
Regarding performance, Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that the University
had rotated its outside auditors during the past year. He reported that significant progress
had been made in implementation of the M-Pathways system; that new and consistent
management reports were being developed across the University; and that an ongoing
internal controls task force had been created to review business operating procedures
throughout the University. He also emphasized that close collaboration continues among
the provost, the chief financial officer, and the executive vice president for medical affairs,
noting that this factor is crucial to maintaining the University's financial health.
Executive Vice President Kasdin displayed charts indicating the mix of assets and mix
of liabilities for FY 1998-99. He noted that in evaluating the FY 1999-2000 budgets, he
asked four questions: 1) Are diverse revenue sources being used? 2) Is there a demonstrated
ability to control costs? 3) Is there adequate maintenance of physical properties? and 4) How
is debt being utilized?
In response to the first question, he displayed charts indicating that the University
continues to have diverse revenue streams as compared to FY 1990-91. He pointed out
that the hospitals and health centers constitute a larger proportion of the revenue stream
than it did during 1990-91 (36 percent compared to 43 percent), which indicates that the
activities of the health system have a profound influence on the University's overall
financial circumstances. During this time, state appropriations have gone from 17 percent
of revenue to 12 percent. However, he pointed out that these funds are crucially important
and that the University is grateful to taxpayers for the support they provide.
Excluding the revenue provided by the UM Hospitals and Health Centers, student
fees comprise 30 percent of budgeted FY 1999-2000 revenues and state appropriations
provide 21 percent. He pointed out that investment income provides 5 percent of revenue,
whereas at peer private institutions, investment income provides 20 to 30 percent of the
operating budget. Therefore it is important to increase the role of endowment income in
the operating budget through development efforts and enhancing investment performance.
Vice President Feagin reported that gifts from individuals represent 62 percent of
the total of $175 million in gifts received in FY 1998-99. The fact that this figure


2




July Meeting, 1999


continues to rise is seen as a very positive sign, because these gifts tend to be more
directed toward academic priorities.
Executive Vice President Kasdin displayed a slide which illustrates the University's
demonstrated ability to control actual expenditures as compared to budgeted expenditures.
He observed that the University is committed to putting most of its resources into
rehabilitation of its existing physical plant, as compared to new buildings.
Regarding liabilities, he noted that the important point is not the amount of the
University's debt, but how it is used. The University's philosophy is that debt is a means
of financing, and not of payment, and therefore debt should be used largely to finance
cash flows. He noted that the University adheres to a consistent debt management policy
and it continues to look at opportunities to manage aggressively the related interest
expense.
In conclusion, he observed that the budgets being presented are fully consistent
with maintaining the University's overall financial health, and he recommends their
approval.
1999-2000 Ann Arbor Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student
Tuition and Fee Rates
Provost Cantor observed that as a great public research university, the
University of Michigan has several missions which include keeping pace with new
knowledge and imparting that knowledge to each generation of students and maintaining the
historical imperative of being inclusive and wide-ranging in programmatic offerings.
Permeable boundaries within the University and with the broader society are needed in order
to fulfill the University's mandate of creating knowledge and applying knowledge in the
public interest. Within the University, she continued, maximum advantage also needs to be
taken of a diversity of methods, people, and ideas so that research, teaching, and service all
contribute to the others' strengths. The hallmark of this budget is the degree to which
people and programs thrive beyond their immediate boundaries.
Provost Cantor asserted that being well-educated implies knowing that there are
multiple ways to an answer, with no sense of certainty that the first way chosen is the only
way. Provost Cantor thanked the state and its citizens for 150 years of support that has
enabled the University to provide a superb faculty, strong shared public culture, and the
richest possible learning environment. She noted that this year's unusually generous state
appropriation has made it possible for the University to seek the lowest increase in
undergraduate tuition rates in over a decade.
She described how the proposed budget reciprocates the generosity of the state and
fulfills the University's mandate, noting that every new venture is built on some prior
advances. Provost Cantor gave a number of examples of such innovation in the context of
existing strength in the proposed budget, including the Center for the Study of Complex
Systems; a laboratory for the study of brain function; reconfiguration and reinvigoration of
the International Institute and the Center for Afroamerican and African Studies to add to the
University's strengths in a global context; the Provost's Academic Program Support, which
allows the provost to respond quickly to emerging academic needs and demands for
innovation; establishment of a state and local policy center within the School of Public
Policy; and funding for the Arts of Citizenship program, a new dramatic writing series,

July Meeting, 1999


libraries, the Museum of Art, and the Media Union, all of which enrich the shared public
culture and stretch the classroom from its formal confines into the community. Other areas
of emphasis are LS&A learning centers in writing, languages, math, and science, which
create new forms of collaboration between students and faculty; and enhancement of the
Center for Community Service and Learning, the LS&A First Year Seminars Program, and
the College of Engineering's Curriculum 2000.
Provost Cantor noted that the University budgeting system is a combination of an
activity-based system, in which tuition and research revenues follow the activities that
generate them, and a system of conscious deliberation on the part of the president, provost
and others. This allows for a relatively high variation in the percentage change in budgeted
expenditures across units over a two year period.
The budgeting assumptions for the FY 1999-2000 Ann Arbor General Fund
Operating Budget are an increase in state appropriations of $15.4 million; tuition and fee
increases of 2.8 percent for undergraduate programs and 3.0 percent for most graduate
and professional programs (yielding an increase of $20.3 million); an increase of $1.9
million in indirect cost recovery from sponsored research; internal reallocations and cost
control in a number of areas; and growth in the budget directed as much as possible
towards academic activities. The total recommended General Fund Budget is $928.4
million, an increase of $38.1 million.
Provost Cantor emphasized that over 75 percent of the new General Fund revenues
in this budget is directed toward academic programs. The major initiatives in the FY
2000 budget are providing competitive salaries in order to retain faculty and staff;
strengthening of academic units, including the School of Public Policy, the College of
LS&A, the Museum of Art, and the University Library; and extending the boundaries of
the classroom, through such entities as learning centers, scholars programs, and the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program.
Provost Cantor concluded by observing that it is a privilege to speak on behalf of a
University that embraces diversity of people, methods, and ideas, where people do not shy
away from collaborations that are difficult. In this atmosphere, people recognize that
another person may have a better solution than one's own.
Regent McGowan commented that she welcomed the recognition in Provost
Cantor's presentation of the length and strength of generosity of the state. She also said
she appreciated the provost's early articulation from months prior of what the budget
priorities were likely to be, noting that this shows a respect for the funding provided by
students and the public.
1999-2000 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
Interim Vice President Harper introduced several students who were attending the
meeting to represent their student governments: Joshua Trapani from MSA; Seema Pai,
president of LS&A student government; and Damon Fairfield, president of Rackham
student government. She noted that neither MSA nor SLS is requesting additional
funding, but both are in full support of the modest requested increase of $0.50 per
student per term for school and college governments. She said that the funds would be
used to strengthen and support student governments at the school and college level that


4




July Meeting, 1999


provide funding for various student initiatives in the schools and colleges and pointed
out that the last funding increase occurred ten years ago.
Flint Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Interim Chancellor Schmoll observed that the UM-Flint budget reflects a generous
increase of 7.4 percent in state funding, as well as a proposed increase of 2.8 percent for
tuition and fees for lower division undergraduate resident student tuition and fees and
slightly less than 3.0 percent for all other programs. She noted that the budget will
allow the transfer of some programs to base funding that until this point have been
funded through soft funds. It will also provide an opportunity to experiment with
alternative modes of service delivery outside of the traditional classroom setting. The
budget also includes a 3.5 percent salary program.
Dearborn Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee
Rates
Provost Simpson observed that although much of the program on the Dearborn
campus focuses on the undergraduate level, the campus has consciously been expanding
its masters-degree level graduate programs in recent years. He also pointed out that in
keeping with the campus' founding principles of blending the theory of the classroom
and the practical application of work, over 40 percent of its students are engaged in
co-op and internship programs.
He noted that the proposed budget reflects a very generous state appropriation
increase of 8.6 percent and a tuition and selected fee increase of 2.9 percent.
Expenditure increases will focus primarily on three areas: a 3.0 percent merit-based salary
increase, new support for academic programs, and funding for the operation of new
facilities.
A break followed at 10:25 a.m., and the meeting resumed at 10:35 a.m.
1999-2000 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers Operating Budget
Executive Vice President Omenn observed that the Health System has four
components: the Medical School, whose budget is included in the provost's General
Fund Operating Budget; the Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC); M-Care, whose
budget will be presented in the fall; and the Michigan Health Corporation. This budget
presentation focuses on the UMHHC operating budget.
Executive Vice President Omenn observed that added value for patient care is
achieved through the UMHHC's research and training functions, while outstanding patient
services contribute to the strength of educational and research activities. He noted that the
UMHHC's customers include patients and families; referring physicians in other health
systems; people who pay individually for services; employers who purchase health care
services for their employees; private insurers and government agencies, which pay for and
oversee the provision of health care services; and students. He reported that the UMHHC
has improved patient and referring physician satisfaction scores and has increased its
business, thereby spreading fixed costs over a greater volume. He introduced several key
UMHHC administrators: Larry Warren, executive director; Thomas Biggs, chief financial
officer; Kathleen Moore, director of finance; and Douglas Strong, associate vice president
of the University of Michigan Health System for finance and strategy.

July Meeting, 1999


Executive Vice President Omenn displayed slides indicating a steady increase in
volume at the health centers, as measured by the number of discharges and clinic visits. To
illustrate the Health System's statewide mission and its focus on enhancement of patient
services, he noted that the UM Comprehensive Cancer Center has a number of
collaborative arrangements with other health centers around the state which work to the
benefit of all, providing the potential for improvements in patient care throughout the state.
Pressure for continuing to reduce costsisi exerted by Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Michigan and the federal and state payers for Medicare and Medicaid, he noted.  He
explained that each of these entities has reduced the rates of reimbursement, making it
necessary for the Health System to absorb more costs and improve productivity. The
combined cumulative impact of these reimbursement rate reductions is greater than $200
million over a five-year period, requiring savings of at least $40 million per year.
Executive Vice President Omenn noted that the proposed FY 2000 budget projects
total operating revenue of $864.1 million, an increase of 5.5 percent, which, he said, is
remarkable given the fact that payers are reducing their reimbursements by 4 to 5
percent. Total operating expenses are projected to be $856.941 million, yielding a
projected operating gain of nearly $7.2 million. At a time when other academic medical
centers are experiencing financial difficulties, he concluded that the University of
Michigan Health System is healthy and financially viable and has finished the FY 1999
year in the black. Health System officials believe they can achieve the same outcome for
FY 2000.
Regent Taylor noted that a national magazine had recently published ratings of U.S.
hospitals, and that in every category for which a Michigan hospital was included, the
University of Michigan Health System ranked substantially higher than the others.
Executive Vice President Omenn responded that the magazine had done a survey of 150
physicians in each specialty, asking them to rank the top five hospitals in their specialty in
the country. The survey indicated that the University of Michigan has earned a reputation
as one of the most outstanding hospitals in the st  country.
Regent Brandon commented that it is an extraordinary accomplishment for the hospital
to be in such excellent fiscal condition, especially given the current environment for health
care. Regent Deitch agreed, noting that the current situation is even more remarkable given
predictions made several years ago that the system would not survive unless changes were
made in the operation of the medical center and its relation to the University.
Regent Newman complimented Larry Warren, who has made a successful
transition from chief operating officer to executive director of the UMHHC and is doing
a terrific job. Executive Vice President Omenn also complimented Mr. Warren on his
outstanding achievements.
1999-2000 Department of Athletics Budget
President Bollinger called on Tom Goss, the Donald R. Shepherd Director of
Intercollegiate Athletics. Mr. Goss observed that the University of Michigan has the
best combination of academics and athletics in the country, and he had accepted the
position as athletic director to build on that tradition. He noted that for the past two years,
over 300 student athletes have had grade point averages greater than 3.0 for two semesters


6




July Meeting, 1999


in a row. He said the department intends to continue to field nationally competitive sports
programs and is committed to operating a financially sound program.
Mr. Goss reviewed the core values introduced two years ago in the athletic department.
These include honesty and integrity, accountability, responsibility, respect and compassion,
competitive spirit, and "the team must come first."
Mr. Goss reported that the department is a national and Big Ten Conference leader
in Title IX and gender equity issues. Within the NCAA, he said, the department has taken
a leadership role with its position on freshman eligibility, and is continuing to advocate
against instituting a football playoff game. He noted that during the past year Michigan
had won three national championships and numerous Big Ten Conference championships.
Mr. Goss reported that the department had a projected operating deficit of
approximately $2 million for 1998-99, which will be funded from reserves. As a result of
this situation, he said that the department will have a paradigm shift. In the past, he
explained that the department had been protected from rising costs by increases in royalty
revenues from the sale of licensed merchandise and by a seventh football game. During the
past year, there was no seventh game and royalty revenues hit an all-time low. Although a
strategic plan had been developed in 1997 which emphasized new revenue streams, he said
that in hindsight, it would have been more prudent to also focus on cost control.
announced earlier in the year was necessary and fair. Because the department's needs were
not communicated effectively and the plan was criticized, it was decided to implement a
more modest increase. This will have an impact of $2 million on the 1999-2000 budget. In
the future, the department plans to improve communications and to manage its resources
more effectively. He said that the department is committed to an operating surplus in future
years and will institute safeguards to insure the budget is adhered to. Contingencies are also
built in that will allow adjustments to be made in the second half of the fiscal year if
necessary. For the first time, a capital replacement fund has been established in the
1999-2000 budget.
Mr. Goss then presented details of the proposed budget. He pointed out that during
1998-99 the department had had a number of Academic All-American and Academic
All-Conference athletes. With 11 men's and 12 women's sports, the department won one
national championship, in men's gymnastics, and seven conference championships.
Regarding gender equity, 49.03 percent of the athletes are female.
Mr. Goss said that projected revenues from the FY 2000 budget are $47.6 million, an
increase of 8.2 percent, and that spectator admissions fees constitute the most important
source of revenue. Budgeted expenses total $46.72 million, an increase of 2.1 percent,
yielding a projected surplus of $880,000. This surplus will be used to fund the capital
expenditures budget.
Regent Taylor noted that capital replacement had not been addressed previously and
was now being instituted with symbolic funding. He suggested that a study be conducted to
determine what the capital requirements will be over the next 5-10 years and to then
consider transferring money from the reserve fund into the capital replacement fund so that
adequate funding can begin in this area. Mr. Goss responded that these measures are already
being taken into consideration.


7




July Meeting, 1999


In response to a question from Regent Maynard about implementation of men's
soccer and women's water polo as varsity sports, Mr. Goss noted that soccer will begin
in the fall of 2000 and water polo will begin in January 2001, as planned.
Regent Newman noted that athletic department expenses have increased by 31.4
percent over the last three years, while revenues have only increased by 17.5 percent,
and at this rate, expenses will soon exceed revenues. She said that we need to
understand why expenses are growing at such a high rate and why the rate of
expenditure exceeds the rate of revenue generation, and that these trends are disturbing.
Regent Newman expressed concern about "the misinformation provided
throughout the year to the Regents, the administration, and the general public through
the media." She noted that she had been surprised to learn of the 30 percent increase in
football ticket prices that had been approved by the Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics earlier in the year, because information previously provided had indicated that
such an increase was unnecessary. She had received a number of explanations when
she started inquiring about this and focused on the increase in operating expenses as the
only logical explanation.
Regent Newman praised the interim report of the review committee appointed by the
president, noting that it had properly outlined the challenges faced by the department.
However, the report did not address whether the decisions that have been made since then
have addressed the problems, and she believes the decisions need to be reviewed. She said
that it is a question of the management and execution of the plans, not the need to generate
revenue, and she believes that spending money to make money has not been a good
decision.
Regent Newman submitted the following questions: Why will tomorrow be different
from yesterday? What controls have been put into place to monitor the projected budget
for this year? What is the long-term plan for the Department of Athletics?
Mr. Goss responded that the department has instituted procedures to insure that all
teams and departments will operate within their budgets, including regular budget review
meetings at the senior management level. A process will also be developed that will
formally link each budget administrator's fiscal responsibility to that person's
performance evaluation and compensation. Over the long term, the department will
budget revenues realistically and conservatively, will manage expense growth as
described, and will systematically evaluate administrative functions, including staffing
levels and resource allocation.
Regent Newman inquired about the long-term strategic plan for the athletic
department. Mr. Goss said that this would be brought back to the Regents at a later date.
Regent Newman observed that the trend has been toward decreasing revenues and
increasing expenses, and that the long-term plan should describe what will be done to insure
that this trend will be reversed.
Regent Taylor commented that it would be helpful for Regent Newman to present her
questions in writing. He noted that he did not agree with her comments that the Regents
were given misinformation about departmental finances.
Regent Homing observed that the Athletic Department Financial Advisory Committee
was charged with a two-stage mission. The first stage, dealing with budgetary matters, has


8




July Meeting, 1999


been addressed, and the next stage, involving reporting lines, communications, and the role
of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, is yet to be completed. Executive Vice
President Kasdin clarified that the first report of the committee addressed the question of
whether the Department of Athletics is in financial equilibrium, and the second stage, which
is to be completed in the coming months, will be addressing issues of governance.
Regent Newman said that she did not mean to imply that Mr. Goss had provided
misinformation to the Regents. Rather, she was addressing the lack of information that
had been provided about issues that came to light in press coverage.
Regent Taylor observed that a recent newspaper article implied that the $2 million
deficit will have a profound impact, but his understanding is that this is untrue and the deficit
will not affect any planned programs. Mr. Goss confirmed this, noting that the department
has healthy reserves to cover the deficit.
Regent White commented that she is pleased that the department is approaching
gender equity. She noted that achieving gender equity can be expensive, and these
efforts could be contributing to the department's financial situation. However, she
commended the department's progress over the past two years.
Regent Brandon inquired at what point did the department realize that there would
be a deficit. Mr. Goss responded that the department had received a letter from its
licensing company on March 16, indicating that licensing revenues would be off by
about $2.1 million from the previous year. At that point, with 90 days left in the fiscal
year, adjustments had to be made very quickly. He noted that ticket prices are one of the
few revenue sources that the department can control, and thus ticket price increases are
critical to the department if it is to be a leader in building teams that can be nationally
competitive. Corporate sponsorships, which involve contracts, are the other predictable
source of income. He pointed out that costs are easier to control than revenues, and that
the management team is focusing on this aspect.
Regent Deitch commented that budget making is reflective of, and a driver of, policy
decisions, as exemplified by Provost Cantor's presentation of the General Fund budget. He
observed that policy choices involving both revenues and expenditures have influenced the
athletic department budget, in a manner similar to policy decisions that have driven the
Health System budget.  However, the Health System operates in a simpler, more
businesslike environment than has been imposed on the Department of Athletics.
For example, to increase revenues, Regent Deitch observed that the department
could institute a number of measures, such as adding additional football games, adding
sky boxes and seat licenses, and naming arenas for corporate sponsors. However, due
to academic and other considerations, University leadership has consciously decided
against pursuing these revenue enhancement options.
On the issue of football ticket prices, Regent Deitch noted that an increase from
$27 to $35 had been proposed earlier in the year. This was ultimately rolled back,
which had a revenue implication of $2 million per year. He believes the decisiobelieves to roll
back prices was wrong, due to the fact that Michigan athletics is an entertainment
product, and that this fact ought to determine pricing. Students are the only consumers,
he believes, who deserve subsidized, below-market prices and complete access to


9




July Meeting, 1999


Michigan athletic events. The remainder of the fans deserve fair pricing, but only in the
context of what the market will support.
Regent Deitch observed that he believes he was completely and properly informed
on all elements related to the ticket increase. He believes that if the University does not
allow the market to dictate prices, budgets will be constrained and will be politically
motivated, rather than motivated by sound business decisions.
On the expense side, Regent Deitch noted that achieving gender equity costs
money and is an example of the fact that policy decisions regarding the role of athletics
in the University drive expenditure decisions. He believes that the athletic department
budget reflects choices that have been made.
Regent Taylor and Regent White both associated themselves with Regent Deitch's
remarks.
The meeting recessed at this point, at 11:50 a.m. President Bollinger noted that
due to the absence of any speakers, the public comments session scheduled for the
afternoon session would not be used.
The meeting reconvened at 1:35 p.m. Present were President Bollinger and Regents
Brandon, Deitch, Homing, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Taylor, and White. Also present
were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin, Interim Vice President Harper, Executive Vice
President Kasdin, Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Executive Vice President
Omenn, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Chancellor Renick was absent; Provost Simpson attended in his place. Interim
Chancellor Schmoll was also absent; Provost McLaughlin attended in her place.

A native of Michigan, Professor Daly received his B.A. degree from      Central
Michigan University in 1963, his M.A. degree from The Ohio University in 1964, and
his Ed.D. degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1968. From 1968-73, he was a
faculty member at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. He joined the faculty of
the University of Michigan in 1973 as an assistant professor of speech pathology and
was promoted to associate professor in 1975. When the Speech and Hearing Sciences
Program became a part of the School of Education, he became associate professor of
education and speech pathology. Professor Daly also served as director of Shady Trails,
the University's speech and hearing camp, from 1973-81 and director of the
Communicative Disorders Clinic from 1978-80.
Professor Daly is an international expert on cluttering and stuttering, and he has had
considerable impact on how clinicians deal with such fluency disorders through his
numerous presentations and publications. Through his service as an officer and member
of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and the Michigan SpeechLanguage-Hearing Association, Professor Daly's influence has extended nationwide.
He also shared his expertise through workshops and seminars offered through school
districts and professional organizations.
When he joined the School of Education, Professor Daly expanded his focus to
include such special education areas as learning disabilities and attention deficit
disorders, both of which related well to his ongoing research interests in language/
learning disordered youngsters who clutter. This expanded focus proved invaluable to
students in the school's Master of Arts with Certification Program in which Professor
Daly participated extensively in recent years. He found his work with graduate students
very rewarding and the feeling was highly reciprocated.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming David A. Daly associate
professor emeritus of education and speech pathology.
Max A. Heirich, Ph.D., professor of sociology in the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, and research scientist in the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations, retired
from active faculty status on June 30, 1999.
Professor Heirich received his B.A. degree from Earlham College in 1953 and his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California at Berkeley in 1963 and 1967,


19




July Meeting, 1999


respectively. From 1954-60, he was projects director, then college secretary for the
American Friends Committee. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer
in January 1967. He was named assistant professor that same year and was promoted to
associate professor in 1970 and professor in 1998, serving both the Department of
Sociology and the Residential College. Additionally, Professor Heirich was appointed
associate research scientist in 1985 and research scientist in 1999 with the Institute of
Labor and Industrial Relations, where he also served as director of the Worker Health
Program from 1995-99.
Professor Heirich has made significant scholarly contributions to the sociological
study of social movements, religion, and health. Two early books (1970 and 1971)
analyzed "the spiral" of student protests in the 1960s and remain among the most
influential works on this topic. Professor Heirich's 1977 article on religious conversion
has become a citation classic among scholars of religion. More recently, Professor Heirich
has directed his scholarly efforts toward more applied research and policy evaluation
focusing on health and wellness. He is the author of five books and monographs and more
than 30 journal articles and has served as principal investigator on several federallyfunded research projects related to health and wellness. He chaired an effort to establish
national standards for wellness programs and played a leading role in the extension of
health care services to under served populations.
Professor Heirich has been an outstanding teacher at both the graduate and
undergraduate levels, shepherding many graduate students through their theses and
receiving awards for both undergraduate teaching and undergraduate counseling. Known
for his warmth and collegiality, Professor Heirich's many and unique contributions to the
University will be sorely missed.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Max A. Heirich professor
emeritus of sociology and research scientist emeritus.
Wilfred G. Marston, Ph.D., professor of sociology, College of Arts and Sciences,
University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1999.
Born in Seattle, Professor Marston received his B.A. degree in 1958 from Seattle
Pacific University and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees, in 1963 and 1966, respectively, from
the University of Washington. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan-Flint
in 1970 as associate professor and the first chair of the Department of
Sociology/Anthropology. He was promoted to professor in 1974 and served as chair
until 1976, as well as several other times in the 1980s and the 1990s. He also chaired the
Urban Studies Program, served on the College of Arts and Sciences Executive
Committee and was a member of the Masters of Liberal Studies faculty. Professor
Marston was instrumental in the formation of the department's social work and criminal
justice programs during his tenure as chair.  He initiated the highly successful
credit-producing student field trips to Toronto, Chicago, and New York.
Professor Marston's research and writing focused primarily on race, ethnic, and
class segregation in U.S. and Canadian urban communities. A number of his writings
have been published in professional journals, including the American Journal of
Sociology, Social Forces, and the Canadian Review of Sociology/Anthropology. He also
wrote a comprehensive monograph on the population and spatial profile of the Flint
community using data from 1940-70.


20




July Meeting, 1999


The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Wilfred G. Marston
professor emeritus of sociology.
David N. Williams, Ph.D., professor of physics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1999.
Professor Williams received his B.A. degree in physics and philosophy in 1956
from Maryville College and his Ph.D. degree in 1964 from the University of California
at Berkeley. He moved on to postdoctoral studies at the Eidgen6ssische Technische
Hochschule in Zirich, the Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires, in Saclay, France, and the Institute
for Advanced Study in Princeton. He joined the University of Michigan as an assistant
professor of physics in 1967 and was promoted to associate professor in 1973 and
professor in 1980. He served on various departmental committees and was a graduate
advisor from 1985-95.
His research interests have generally been in quantum field theory, with a mathematical
physics orientation. In the earlier part of his career, he did important work on invariant
scattering amplitudes free of kinematic singularities. He was a major author of the proof of
Stapp's Theorem on Lorentz covariant holomorphic functions. Later, he published work on
the mathematical theory of unstable particles and Euclidean quantum field theory. In recent
years, he has been interested in the triviality problem for quantum field theory. He has also
focused recently on the development of software for algebraic manipulation, related to M.
Veltman's Schoonschip program. He plans to remain active in these areas for the next few
years.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming David N. Williams professor
emeritus of physics.
Memorials. Vice President Tedesco reported the death of an active faculty
member.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with great sadness the
death on May 8, 1999, of Larry Karl Flanigan, associate professor of electrical
engineering & computer science, College of Engineering.
Professor Flanigan was born in 1934 in Indianapolis, Indiana. He received his B.S.
degree in electrical engineering and his B.S. degree in business administration, both in
1958, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received his M.S. degree in
management science in 1960, his M.S. degree in communication sciences in 1962, and his
Ph.D. degree in communication sciences 1965 from the University of Michigan.
Professor Flanigan joined the University of Michigan as an assistant professor in
the computer and communication sciences department in 1965. He was promoted to
associate professor in 1973. He served as the department chair from 1976-80. His
involvement with the Computing Center during the early years of computing at the
University of Michigan was instrumental in educating users by way of two manuals he
authored: "Introduction to PIL in MTS" and "Introduction to the Computing Center and
to MTS."
He served as the concentration advisor for computer science students with enthusiasm
and dedication. His love of teaching and respect for his students earned him many
accolades, including the department's Teaching Excellence Award. There was fierce
competition for the opportunity to attend both his graduate and undergraduate courses. His
graduate student instructors and students enthusiastically submitted letters of praise and


21




July Meeting, 1999


commendation for his style and ability to motivate them through his own example. The
combination of his knowledge in computing and his ability as a teacher led to invitations to
present lectures in Israel and Chile.
His desire for the programming curriculum at the University to be of the highest
caliber was evidenced by his consistent participation in curriculum review and
assessment activities.
He was admired, respected, and appreciated in every role he fulfilled. He will be
dearly missed by his colleagues, students, and support staff. His positive attitude and
broad smile brought warmth to the days of all those that came into contact with him.
Our deepest condolences go out to his children: Kevan, Bradley, Melanie, and
Elizabeth; his sister, Lyn Anzai; and his grandchildren: Alyson, Brooke, Christian, and
Catherine.
Degrees. Provost Cantor submitted for approval the final degree lists for April,
May, and June, 1999 commencements; the August 1999 doctoral degree list; and
changes to previously approved degree lists.
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by
Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
Camp Knight on Douglas Lake, Cheboygan County, Michigan
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted a request for purchase of Camp
Knight, located adjacent to the University's Biological Station on Douglas Lake in
Cheboygan County, Michigan, at a purchase price of $1.8 million. He noted that the
price is above the appraised value, but is equal to a written bid by a third party. He
reported that both the provost and dean of LS&A believe that the preservation of this
land from commercial development is crucial to the continued academic work at the
Biological Station. Funding for the purchase will be provided by private donations; the
Biological Station; the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; and the Office of
the Provost.
Regent Deitch moved approval of the acquisition of Camp Knight at a purchase
price not to exceed $1.8 million, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent
Maynard seconded the motion, noting that she was pleased that the University would be
able to purchase the property, as residents of Douglas had expressed concern over its
fate and had contributed funds towards its purchase.
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that the appraisal process can be
questioned in view of the fact that the bids received exceeded the appraised value.
However, these bids indicate that $1.8 million is a fair estimate of the market price.
Regent Horning observed that it appears that there is a large portion of property
around Douglas Lake that is not owned by the University and that the lake has already
been subjected to residential development. Executive Vice President Kasdin pointed
out that although property owners who live on the lake willingly donated money to
assist in the University's purchase of the property, the decision to purchase the property
was not based on considerations of property owners. Rather, it is viewed as a critically
important research facility for the College of LS&A.


22




July Meeting, 1999


Regent Deitch noted that a condominium development had been proposed for the
property, and this type of development leads to "funnel development," which increases
exponentially motorboat and similar types of activity as opposed to what occurs with
single-family homes, and that such development would in turn would have an impact on
the Biological Station.
Provost Cantor emphasized that acquisition of this property is considered critical
to the Biological Station, as faculty fear that any further development in the proximity
of the Biological Station would undermine their experimental work. These concerns led
to stopping work on another project closer to campus in order to divert those funds
toward acquisition of the Douglas Lake property.
Vice President Wilbanks reported that for many years, the Department of Natural
Resources has been interested in developing public access to Douglas Lake, and
language is inserted in the bill each year to encourage the state not to pursue this due to
the impact such access would have on the lake.
Regent Newman observed that she does not dispute the importance of the
academic mission, but disagrees with the notion of spending money above the appraised
value to purchase a piece of land merely to keep someone else from developing it.
Provost Cantor noted that private donations from homeowners on the lake are
supplying about one-third of the purchase price, but they will have no ownership rights.
Regent McGowan reiterated that this property is critical to the academic mission of the
College of LS&A.
The vote was then taken, and the motion passed, with Regents Brandon, Deitch,
Maynard, McGowan, Taylor, and White in favor, and Regents Horning and Newman
opposed.
Literature, Science, and the Arts Building Renovation Project
Executive Vice President Kasdin reported that the University is ready to initiate
planning for the Literature, Science, and the Arts Building renovation project, funding
for which will be partially provided by the state. On a motion by Regent Deitch,
seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the Literature,
Science, and the Arts Building renovation project and authorized contracting with the
firm of SHG Incorporated for its design.
Life Sciences Institute Building Project and Palmer Drive Parking Structure Project
Executive Vice President Kasdin presented a recommendation for commissioning
the firms of SHG Incorporated and Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Inc. (VSBA)
to design the institute building, with SHG as the architect of record, and the
appointment of VSBA as the design firm for the parking structure, working in
conjunction with Desman Associates. On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by
Regent McGowan, the Regents unanimously approved the site, the architects, and
initiating programming and design activities for the Life Sciences Institute building
project and the Palmer Drive parking structure project.

On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved a project for replacement of the domestic hot water piping in the
University of Michigan Hospitals.
University of Michigan Hospitals Patient Room Flooring Replacement Project
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved a project for replacing the flooring in approximately 300 patient
rooms in levels 4-8 of the adult hospital.
Regent Taylor left the meeting at this point, at about 2:00 p.m. and was not present
for any of the succeeding votes.
Purchasing Contract with Clark-MXR, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Maynard, all seven Regents
present unanimously approved a purchasing contract with Clark-MXR, Inc. Because
Professor Gerard Mourou is both a University of Michigan employee and a partial owner
of Clark-MXR, Inc., this contract falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.  The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.  The parties to the purchase contract will be the Regents of the University of Michigan
and Clark-MXR, Inc.
2.  The terms of the contract to support University of Michigan research, include the

July Meeting, 1999


Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and Mott Children's Health
Center (MCHC)
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Maynard, all seven Regents
present unanimously approved a research agreement between the University of Michigan
and Mott Children's Health Center (MCHC). Because Daniel M. Briskie, D.D.S., is both
the director of MCHC and is an adjunct faculty member at the University of Michigan, this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Mott Children's Health
Clinic.
2.   The terms of the proposed agreement conform to University policy. The period of
performance is two years at a total cost of $10,369.
3.   Dr. Briskie's pecuniary interest arises from his position as director of MCHC.
Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and T/J Technologies,
Inc. (T/J Technologies)
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Maynard, all seven
Regents present unanimously approved a research agreement between the University of
Michigan and T/J Technologies, Inc. (T/J Technologies). Because Levi T. Thompson,
Jr., is both a University of Michigan employee and chief executive officer of T/J
Technologies, and his wife, Maria, is president and chief operating officer of T/J
Technologies, and they hold 27 percent and 26 percent, respectively, of the company's
stock, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and T/J Technologies, Inc.
2.   Agreement terms: The award document is a purchase order issued by T/J Technologies
for billing purposes only. The period of performance will be one year at a total cost of
$29,950.
3.   Levi and Maria Thompson's pecuniary interests arise from their partial ownership of
T/J Technologies.
University of Michigan-Flint Professional Studies and Classroom Building
Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that bids received for this previously
approved project had come in over budget, but due to an additional pledge of financial
support from the Mott Foundation and "value engineering," the new budget was able to
be met. The current understanding is that state officials will allow the University to
re-bid only the portion of the project involving prefabricated concrete and some
mechanical equipment, rather than the whole project. If, however, it is decided that the
entire project needs to be re-bid, it will be brought back to the Regents for consideration
in September. Regent Maynard moved approval of the revised budget and authorization
of the award of a construction contract to Sorenson Gross Construction Company, Inc.,
as described in the Regents Communication. Regent Newman seconded the motion.
Following some discussion, the vote was then taken and the Regents authorized
proceeding with the project if the state agreed to allow the University to move forward
without having to re-bid the entire job.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1999


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, September 16, 1999
The Regents convened at 2:15 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and Taylor.
Also present were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin, Interim Vice President
Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Interim Chancellor Klein, Vice President and
General Counsel Krislov, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President and
Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent White
was absent. Interim Chancellor Schmoll was also absent; Provost McLaughlin attended
in her place. Regent Deitch arrived shortly after the start of the meeting.
Motion to Meet in Non-formal Session
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and called on Regent Maynard, who
read the following motion:
I move that we adjourn this formal session of the Regents and begin a
non-formal session for the purpose of conferring with legal counsel.
Regent Brandon seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. The
meeting continued in non-formal session until 2:40 p.m.
The meeting reconvened at 2:40 p.m. President Bollinger read the following letter
from Regent Katherine White, dated August 20, 1999:
Dear President Bollinger.
I am writing this letter to you to be read into the record at the September
meeting of the University of Michigan Board of Regents. I am currently on
sabbatical from the Wayne State University Law School for the fall semester. I
have won a Fulbright Senior Scholar Award to the Max Planck Institute for
Foreign and International Patent, Copyright, and Competition Law in Munich,
Germany. Pursuant to this award, I will be researching issues relating to
improving technology transfer between universities and industry. In particular, I
will be comparing and contrasting the technology transfer systems of Germany,
the United States, and the United Kingdom with the purpose of improving our
technology transfer system. This project will assist in furthering my mission to
build a bridge between education, science, and industry to benefit the state of
Michigan.
Established in 1946, under congressional legislation introduced by the late
Senator J William Fulbright of Arkansas, the Fulbright Program was designed
to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and
the people of other countries. During my time in Munich, I have already met
people from all over the world including scholars from Bulgaria, China, Costa
Rica, Columbia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Indonesia, Latvia, Japan, and
Thailand. Ifrequently converse with these scholars about various legal issues
regarding intellectual property and competition law, as we are all here to learn
from each other.


27




September Meeting, 1999


Because I am in Munich, I will not be able to attend the September and
October Board of Regents' Meetings. I will be available by phone, however.
Although I will not return to the U.S. permanently until January 15th, I will
return to attend the November and December Board of Regents' meetings.
Sincerely,
Katherine E. White
Regent
Death of William H. Polliey
President Bollinger expressed condolences on behalf of the University to the family
of William H. (Bill) Polliey, a University electrician who died August 30, 1999, following
an August 2nd accident that occurred during renovations to the G. G. Brown Building.
Department of Public Safety
Executive Vice President Kasdin introduced William Bess, director of public safety,
who was attending his first Regents' Meeting. He noted that Mr. Bess had been selected
through a very broad-based, rigorous interview process, and that the decision to offer him
the position of director had been unanimous. He also noted that members of the campus
community continue to be equally impressed by Mr. Bess since his arrival on campus, and
that he "is a tremendous addition to our community." A round of applause followed.
Dean of College of Literature, Science, and the Arts
President Bollinger announced that Shirley Neuman, newly appointed dean of the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LS&A), was present. He noted that she is a
very distinguished scholar who had come to the University from the University of British
Columbia and said that the University was extremely pleased to have her on its faculty. A
round of applause followed.
Revitalization of Central Campus Facilities
President Bollinger called on Executive Vice President Kasdin, who observed that
the Central Campus Plan is one of the most important initiatives to have been developed
during his tenure. He recalled commenting at the last meeting that in the coming years it
will be important to invest far more in the existing physical plant than in new buildings, so
that the University can remain strong for future generations.
Executive Vice President Kasdin presented several slides illustrating features of
the five buildings on which the revitalization effort is focused: the LS&A Building,
Haven Hall-Mason Hall, West Hall, and the Frieze Building, which are a part of the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; and the Perry Building, which will be used
by the Institute for Social Research. He emphasized that no action is being requested
on any of these renovation plans at this time; individual building renovation plans will
be brought to the Board over time for consideration.
LS&A Building. He noted that the LS&A Building, built in 1948, was designed
to house central administration offices, and that it needs major infrastructure renovation
and updating and enhancing of existing classroom space. He reported that 75 percent of
the funding for the $22 million project will be provided by the state. He recalled that the
principle underlying the most recent central campus planning initiative is the need to


28




September Meeting, 1999


reintroduce the academic mission of the institution in facilities planning. To this end, plans
also call for converting currently underutilized public areas into new programmatic space.
Perry Building. Executive Vice President Kasdin said that only minimal upgrades
had been done to the Perry Building since it was built in 1902. It requires a total
overhaul for safety, handicap access, code compliance, and better use of space. The
building will be used by the Institute for Social Research (ISR), and some of the
renovation costs will be recharged back to the institute.
West Hall. Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that West Hall, built in 1904,
is designated as a significant structure in the National Register of Historic Places. It is
also a cornerstone of the Diag and is crucially important to the visual image of that area
of campus. Although the portion of the building that houses the School of Information
has been renovated, the infrastructure and the remainder of the building will be updated.
The renovated building will provide space for the Department of Anthropology, which
is currently housed in several separate locations.
Mason Hall and Haven Hall. These buildings, built in 1952, were originally
intended for classrooms (Mason Hall) and faculty offices (Haven Hall). The groundfloor connecting space between the two buildings, which is known as the "Fishbowl,"
has become a crucial public space for the University.  The preservation and
enhancement of this space will be an important aspect of plans for these buildings.
Mason and Haven Halls have critical infrastructure needs, including electrical and
fiber optic cable wiring. To enhance the functionality and increase the amount of office
space in Haven Hall, an addition will be built that will move its front wall out 23 feet,
creating a continuous front line with Mason Hall. Space above the Fishbowl will be
used for faculty offices in a number of LS&A departments and programs, which will
enhance interdisciplinary contact. The addition will also make it possible to walk
between the buildings without going down to the ground floors of each building. The
expanded Fishbowl area on the first floor of Haven Hall will provide new programmatic
space for students.
Frieze Building.  Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that the Frieze
Building, originally a high school, has numerous infrastructure problems. The decision
has been made to delay addressing plans for this building until after the work has been
completed on the other LS&A buildings, which will be in four to five years. This will
allow time to develop a more complete understanding of what is needed in the Frieze
Building so as to make the best possible use of the available funds.
Executive Vice President Kasdin summarized that the LS&A building revitalization
project will be done over a five-year period. The total cost will be about $86 million,
with about $60 million provided by the state, through its Capital Outlay Program.
He then introduced Shirley Neuman, dean of the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts.
Dean Neuman observed that seven academic goals will be achieved in the College
of LS&A by the building renovations and the expansion of Haven Hall.
Every tenured and tenure track faculty member will have a private office and
every graduate student instructor will have shared office space in good condition. This


29




September Meeting, 1999


is important from a student perspective and from the perspective of recruiting and
retaining faculty, because when they have substandard office space, faculty and
graduate students tend to work at home and they become less accessible to
undergraduate students and less likely to contribute to a sense of academic community.
Academic units that are currently scattered across the campus, such as the
Department of Anthropology, will be consolidated. This department, which is rated the
best in the country, has four sub-disciplines that are currently housed in four separate
locations, which, as a consequence of their geographical dispersion, do not function
together as a department.
Units that by virtue of intellectual interests and joint faculty appointments should
have a high level of interaction will be able to be placed contiguously to each other.
Expanded and improved space will be made available for units that have grown
over the years, such as the Program in American Culture.
Dean Neuman noted that when departments share physical space, colleagues see
one another and develop a shared sense of intellectual and programmatic enterprise.
Departments that are dispersed across campus, on the other hand, tend to go in different
directions and can become divisive.
In particular, she noted that the Departments of History and Anthropology, the
Center of African and African American Studies (CAAS), and the Program in American
Culture will all benefit from the planned renovations. In addition, LS&A administrative
departments will all be brought together in the LS&A building, providing better
coordination, supervision, and cost savings.
The renovations will provide improved facilities for student learning, including
seminar rooms, conference rooms, and classrooms.
The renovations will help to address the need for the college to determine how
information technology and the Internet will be used across all levels of the curriculum.
Finally, the renovations will permit much more active learning, so that students
will learn not only how to solve problems defined by others, but how to identify what
the important problems are. This requires a different kind of learning space from the
traditional large lecture hall, including common study space, student conferencing
space, and computer facilities that allow students to study together and work together in
teams, which is not currently possible in the social sciences departments. Such student
learning space is planned for the common area adjacent to the Fishbowl.
In summary, Dean Neuman pointed out that the renovations will result in facilities
that are modern, efficient, technologically up-to-date, and appropriate for a leading
public research university.
"Michigan Greats"
Vice President Ulaby gave a presentation on the careers of David and Peter Tumley,
twin brothers and world-renowned photojoumalists, who are alumni of the Residential
College.

September Meeting, 1999


Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Bram Elias, president of Michigan Student
Assembly, about MSA/administration relationships for the coming year.
Following his comments, Regent McGowan encouraged Mr. Elias to take
advantage of the invitation that has been proffered to him and other MSA presidents in
the past to interact with the Regents during the regular Board session, rather than during
Public Comments. Regent Newman inquired about the possibility of students meeting
with Regents prior to the meetings. President Bollinger commented that no decision
had been made with respect to this suggestion because MSA already has an open
invitation to appear on the regular Regents agenda to express the views of students.
Regent McGowan emphasized that the MSA president is also free to include colleagues
in addressing the Board.
Mr. Elias said he was aware of this and that MSA planned to address the Board
every month about student issues. Regent Maynard complimented Mr. Elias about his
comments at the new student convocation.
Robert Alarie addressed the Board about obtaining an accredited engineering degree.
Motion to Meet in Non-formal Session
Following Public Comments, Regent Brandon made the following motion:
I move that we adjourn this formal session of the Regents and begin a
non-formal session, the purpose of which is to consider a personnel evaluation.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. The
meeting continued in a non-formal session from 4:05 until 5:30 p.m.
September 17, 1999
The Regents convened at 9:30 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and
Taylor. Also present were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin, Interim Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Interim Chancellor Klein, Vice
President and General Counsel Krislov, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice
President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent White was absent. Interim Chancellor Schmoll was also absent; Provost
McLaughlin attended in her place.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and called for consideration of the
meeting agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President and Secretary Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes
of the July 15, 1999, meeting.

September Meeting, 1999


Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.    Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established, July 1-August 31, 1999.
University of Michigan Health System.   Executive Vice President Omenn
commented about a retreat held earlier that week by the Hospital Executive Board about
the external environment and the performance of the Health System. He observed that
UMHS is on a path of sustained quality improvements as well as progressive reduction
in cost structure. He noted that other institutions have been visiting the UMHS to learn
how it has been able to achieve financial stability. President Bollinger remarked that
the retreat had provided outstanding examples of commitment by people from many
areas of the Medical Center, all of whom are important to the success of the Health
System.
Executive Vice President Omenn observed that the University in general and the
Health System in particular has enjoyed a long relationship with the Warner
Lambert/Parke Davis Company and that this close relationship would soon be enhanced
by the company's funding of a new program in bioinformatics that will be presented
later in the meeting.
Executive Vice President Omenn announced that the governor would be
presenting a "Workplace Silver Award" to MFit Health Promotion Division, which is
the Health System's employee wellness program.
Student Affairs. Interim Vice President Harper reported that the "move-in" had been
successful and students are now settled into residence halls.
Dearborn Campus. Interim Chancellor Klein reported that the UM-Dearborn had
been ranked as one of the best regional public universities in the Midwest by U.S. News
and World Report. He noted that a number of events have been scheduled throughout
the fall and winter terms to mark the campus's 40th anniversary. Construction of the
new CASL building is proceeding ahead of schedule, and the Field House Fitness
Center is about 85 percent completed. Finally, he reported that the search for a new
chancellor is well underway.
Flint Campus. Provost McLaughlin reported that Chancellor Juan Mestas would
be arriving on campus to begin his tenure as chancellor on Monday, September 20.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Feagin reported that voluntary support for
FY 1999 totaled $176,993,000. This is a decrease of $2.5 million from the previous
year, although if gifts-in-kind were eliminated, it would have been a better year than the
year before. She observed that the gifts reflect a continuing momentum and energy
from the capital campaign, especially among the gifts from individuals. In FY 1999
there was an increase of almost 7,000 donors from the previous year, resulting in a total
of over 100,000 individual donor gifts for the first time. This reflects the successful
collaboration of the schools and colleges with the central development office in
working together on the annual funds, as shown by the fact that annual fund receipts
were up 12 percent, and alumni donors increased by 7 percent.
Of the total gifts, she reported that 62 percent came from individuals. This is
important because individuals are more likely than corporations and foundations to


32




September Meeting, 1999


make gifts to high priority or flexible unrestricted purposes. The greatest potential for
growth in the development program will come from alumni and friends.
Vice President Feagin reported that in the coming year, the president, provost, and
deans will hold discussions about how University priorities and school and college
priorities fit together. These academic priorities will drive the fundraising agenda for
the Office of Development. She noted that the office is working with the schools and
colleges on staffing their development efforts, and that this year, the development office
also plans to focus on rejuvenating volunteer activities.
Vice President Feagin said that a survey had been conducted of donors who had
given at least $25,000 to determine what is important to them, and that she would be
pleased to present the results at a future meeting. President Bollinger observed that
development traditionally has been one of the most decentralized areas of the
University. However, current goals are to develop a set of university-wide development
objectives and to provide the highest quality development staff.      He noted that
University units that previously had functioned autonomously had welcomed the
involvement of the central development office.
Executive Vice President Omenn commented that it is important not to pigeonhole
individual donors as having limited interests. He noted that many individuals have
multiple interests and many programs are interdisciplinary, so it is important for units to
work together.

CANCELLATION OF
PREVIOUSLY APPROVED REGENTS COMMUNICATION
Boyd, lain D., Professor of Aerospace Engineering, College of Engineering (previously approved in
July 1999) see corrected communication submitted in September 1999
Retirement memoirs. Vice President and Secretary Tedesco submitted memoirs
for eight retiring faculty members.
Frithjof H. Bergmann, Ph.D., professor of philosophy, retired from active faculty
status on May 31, 1999, following forty-one years of service.
Professor Bergmann received his B.A. degree from Lewis and Clark College in
1951 and his Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1959. He joined the University
of Michigan faculty as an instructor in philosophy in 1958. He was promoted to assistant
professor in 1961, associate professor in 1965, and professor in 1974.
Professor Bergmann's interests include continental philosophy-especially Hegel,
Nietzsche, Sartre, and existentialism generally-and also social and political philosophy,
philosophical anthropology and philosophy of culture. His book, On Being Free (Notre
Dame, 1977), was issued in a paperback edition in 1978 and had twelve printings.
Professor Bergmann has published numerous articles on Hegal, Nietzsche, and Sartre
and on the emotions, values and morality, human rights, and work, as well as freedom.
In his teaching, Professor Bergmann is renowned for his breadth of vision, passion,
energy, and eloquence. Over the years, his courses on existentialism and on Hegel,
Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud were consistently oversubscribed. In 1971, he received the
Amoco Award for distinguished teaching, and he has also been recognized by national
publications as one of the most outstanding teachers on the Ann Arbor campus. He has
produced three series of philosophy videotapes:  "The Logic of Freedom," "The
Mentality of Modern Culture," and "Culture After the Elimination of Labor."
Since 1981, Professor Bergmann has been involved in the founding and
development of the Center for New Work in Flint. He has served as director of the
center since it opened in 1984. His contributions to the study of new work have reflected
his interest in practical, social, and cultural implications of philosophical thought, most
notably strands he has identified in Hegel and other nineteenth-century theorists.
Professor Bergmann has lectured widely on these themes and has consulted for major
corporations. He has held visiting appointments at the University of California at
Berkeley and at Santa Cruz; the University of Chicago; and Stanford University.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Frithjof H. Bergmann
professor emeritus of philosophy.
Sunil K. Das, M.D., professor of internal medicine, retired from active faculty
status on June 30, 1999, after a most productive career as a teacher and researcher.
A native of Malaysia, Dr. Das received his B.A. degree from Manchester College in
Indiana in 1955 and his M.D. degree from the University of Kansas in 1959. He served


73




September Meeting, 1999


his internship at Detroit General Hospital from 1959-60 and his residency at the
University of Michigan from 1960-62. Dr. Das joined the University of Michigan
Medical School as an instructor in cardiology in 1967. He was promoted to assistant
professor of internal medicine in 1968, associate professor in 1974, and professor in 1992.
Dr. Das has contributed strength and vitality to both instructional and research
programs in the Department of Internal Medicine. He has been an outstanding educator of
medical students, house officers, and fellows. His teaching skills were recognized when
he was given the H. Marion Pollard Award for Outstanding Resident Teaching in 1988.
Dr. Das' imaginative and outstanding clinical and teaching efforts have brought
distinction to the Division of Cardiology and Department of Internal Medicine. He has
been an outstanding member of the division and department for over 21 years.
The Regents now salute this distinguished clinician for his dedicated service by
naming Sunil K. Das professor emeritus of internal medicine.
Sally Holden, associate professor of dental hygiene in the School of Dentistry,
retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1999.
Professor Holden received her certificate of dental hygiene from Northwestern
University in 1955, her B.A. degree from the University of Colorado in 1965, and her
M.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1970. She received a certificate in
dental auxiliary faculty training in 1977 from the University of Washington. She was a
dental hygienist in the Denver public school system from 1955-57 and co-director of the
dental hygiene program at Rangley Junior College in Colorado from 1965-67. Professor
Holden joined the University of Michigan as a research associate in 1967. She was
promoted to instructor in 1971 and associate professor, with tenure, in 1977. She is both
a registered dental hygienist and a registered dental assistant in the state of Michigan.
Professor Holden has been an integral member of the dental hygiene program
faculty during her tenure at the School of Dentistry. She has been involved with 85
theses in the fields of periodontics, occlusion, dental hygiene, orthodontics, and
endodontics and has mentored students in the School of Nursing and at Kalamazoo
College. Her publications have been in the areas of occlusion and oral hygiene. She has
published workbooks on dental anatomy and occlusion and is a contributing author for a
textbook on physiology and occlusion. Over the years, she has also served on a number
of committees within the School of Dentistry.
Professor Holden has served as consultant to the Michigan State Board of Dental
Examiners, the Michigan Dental Hygienist Association, the New York Public Health
Department, and the American Research Center in Aswan, Egypt. She has also been
active in organized dentistry as a member of the Michigan Registered Dental Assistant
Examination Committee since 1978. Professor Holden holds professional memberships
in the American and Michigan Dental Hygienists' Associations and the Michigan
Association of Dental Hygiene Educators.
The Regents salute this distinguished health sciences educator by naming Sally
Holden associate professor emerita of dental hygiene.
Charles C. Kelsey, D.D.S., professor of dentistry in the School of Dentistry, retired
from active faculty status on June 30, 1999.
Dr. Kelsey received his B.S., D.D.S., and M.S. degrees from the University of

faculty as a clinical instructor in 1964 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1967,
associate professor in 1970, and professor in 1973. During his tenure at the School of
Dentistry, he served as interim director of the graduate prosthodontics program in 1992.
Dr. Kelsey has been a strong participant in the department's teaching and clinical
activity at the pre-doctoral and graduate levels and through continuing dental education
programs. He served as co-chair of the International Prosthodontics Workshop on

77




September Meeting, 1999


The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness the
death on August 14, 1999, of David L. Angus, professor of education.
Professor Angus earned his B.S., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from The Ohio State
University in 1956, 1960, and 1965, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan
School of Education as an assistant professor in 1966, was promoted to associate
professor in 1969, and to full professor in 1975.
Professor Angus was a nationally renowned historian of education and scholar of
comparative education. He was the author of numerous articles and studies on the
politics of education and the history of curriculum. His recently published book, The
Failed Promise of the American High School, 1890 —1995, is a path breaking study of the
problems of American secondary education.   His interests in international and
comparative education took him around the world. His remarkable ability to cross
cultures and engage people with very different perspectives led him to serve as a visiting
professor at the University of Edinburgh and Peking University. In 1966, he was named
Lingnan Scholar in American Studies and Comparative Education at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong/American Center. An adventurous and
intrepid traveler, Professor Angus particularly enjoyed leaving well-worn paths to
explore new and exciting places, particularly in East Asia.
A passionate teacher, Professor Angus routinely challenged the conventional
wisdom of his field. His classes were marked by lively exchanges about issues and
ideas. He has a legion of devoted students who hold positions at schools, universities,
and ministries of education across the globe.
In addition to his work as a scholar and teacher, Professor Angus' other great
passions were music and tennis. An accomplished percussionist, he worked his way
through college playing gigs in and around Columbus, Ohio, and following graduation he
spent his military service as a member of the Fifth Army Band. His love of music
continued during his years in Michigan playing with the Ann Arbor Civic Band, Ann
Arbor Civic Choir, and conducting the band for the Dexter Community Theater's musical
productions. He was also a superb tennis player known for his great competitive spirit.
David Angus is survived by his wife, Anna Wu Angus; his children, Amy Angus
Mees, Steven, Jonathan, and Sara; and his grandchildren, David and Emma Mees and
Fionn Angus. He is also survived by his mother, Helen Angus; sister Pat, and brother
Dick. David Angus' work was widely cited and his mentoring of students broadly
acclaimed but what will be especially missed is the passion he brought to everything he
tackled. He will be sorely missed. As we celebrate the life of this distinguished scholar
and teacher, our condolences go to his wife, Anna Wu Angus, as well as his children,
mother, sister, and brother.

Robert W. Haessler, Ph.D., associate professor of operations management in the
School of Business Administration, retired from active faculty status on August 31,
1999.
Professor Haessler received his B.S.E., M.S.E., M.B.A., and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of Michigan in 1962, 1963, 1964, and 1968, respectively. Upon completion
of his Ph.D., he worked in private industry for several years before joining the faculty at
Wright State University in 1971. He joined the University of Michigan as a visiting
associate professor in 1975 and was promoted to associate professor in 1976.
A very dedicated researcher and teacher, Professor Haessler recognized early the
importance and impact of computer-based technologies on improving production
productivity and managerial decision-making. This focus, combined with his research
on manufacturing control systems, led to his work as co-director of the ongoing Sloan
Trucking Industry Program, a sponsored research project shared with the College of
Engineering. Professor Haessler has also been involved with the Tauber Manufacturing
Institute, a joint program of the School of Business Administration and College of
Engineering.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Robert W. Haessler
associate professor emeritus of operations management.
Memorials. No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees. Provost Cantor submitted recommendations for approval of final degree
lists for the August 1999 commencements, as well as changes to previously approved
degree lists.
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by
Regent Taylor, the Consent Agenda was unanimously approved.
Vice President Ulaby announced that the University of Michigan had been
notified by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy that the
Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) had received a Presidential
Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring for 1999,
one of five such awards given nationwide. This award, administered by the National
Science Foundation, is a vehicle for the president to honor institutions and individuals
that had been exemplary in encouraging minorities, women, and persons with
disabilities to pursue careers in scientific, engineering, and technical fields. He noted
that this year nearly 1,000 students and more than 500 faculty at the University are
involved in mentoring partnerships through this program.

October Meeting, 1999


Michigan Greats
Vice President Ulaby gave a presentation on the career of James G. Blight, senior
research fellow and professor of international relations at Brown University, who is a
Flint native and an alumnus of the University of Michigan-Flint.
A five-minute break followed, from 3:05 to 3:10 p.m., after which regular agenda
items were taken.
Alternative Asset Commitments
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted a summary of alternative asset
commitments recently made to follow-on funds of previously approved partnerships.
Alternative Asset Commitment
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of up to $20.0 million from the Long Term Portfolio
to J. H. Whitney IV, L.P., pending favorable review of the legal documents by the
Office of the General Counsel. Executive Vice President Kasdin disclosed that he had
made a personal investment in a prior Whitney fund shortly after arriving at the
University after the University had declined an earlier offer to invest in it.
Replacement of Tunnel and Associated Utilities located under State Street near the
Michigan Union
Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that portions of State Street will have to be
shut down for short periods of time to complete this project. University officials are
working with city officials to minimize the inconvenience to the community.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved the project for replacement of the tunnel and associated utilities
located under State Street near the Michigan Union, as described in the Regents
Communication.
Display Technology and Manufacturing Building Renovations for Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Laboratory
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that creation of the fMRI laboratory,
which will be dedicated to basic research studies of cognitive processes, is an important
academic initiative to promote large-scale development of research in the life sciences.
Provost Cantor noted that both fMRI and PET scans visualize blood flow in the brain, but
the former are nonintrusive and result in a much sharper image. She pointed out that the
fMRI technology has revolutionized cognitive psychology. This project will involve an
interdisciplinary collaboration with the College of Engineering, Medical School, and the
Department of Psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved initiating the design of the proposed Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging Laboratory in the Display Technology and Manufacturing Building
and appointing Ann Arbor Architects Collaborative as the architect.

October Meeting, 1999


New Degree Program for A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture and Urban
Planning
Provost Cantor reported that the proposed "Master of Urban Design" program,
which will take advantage of the University's proximity to Detroit, will begin as a
relatively small program but is expected to become popular and grow, as there are
currently no other comparable programs in the Midwest.
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved the "Master of Urban Design" program to be offered in the A.
Alfred Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning.
Revision to Regents' Bylaw 3.07
Executive Vice President Kasdin explained that the delegation of signature
authority proposed in this bylaw revision refers to the execution of sponsored research
proposals, not contracts. The purpose is to streamline the review and signature process
and enhance the quality of the research proposal review process. Substantive changes
are in subsection 2 (b).
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents

October Meeting, 1999


Friday, October 22, 1999
The Regents convened at 9:30 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and
Taylor. Also present were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin, Interim Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Interim Chancellor Klein, Vice
President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President and
Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent White
and Executive Vice President Omenn were absent.
Resolution in honor of Martinus J. G. Veltman
Regent McGowan called to the podium Professor Emeritus Martinus J. G. Veltman,
and expressed that this resolution "comes to you with the admiration, the awe, and the
affection of the people of this University."
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan applaud and congratulate
Martinus J. G. Veltman, the John D. MacArthur Professor Emeritus of
Physics, on winning the Nobel Prize for physics. Dr. Veltman and his
colleague and former student Gerardus 't Hooft are being recognized by the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for their definitive contributions to
advances in theoretical physics.
Dr. Veltman developed the theories necessary for physicists to
mathematically predict properties of the subatomic particles that comprise
all matter in the universe and the forces that hold the particles together. In
so doing, he has provided the framework for some of modern physics' most
heralded discoveries, including the 1995 discovery of the "top" quark.
Dr. Veltman brings a profound respect for reality, considerable
intellect, and curiosity to a field so abstract it is difficult for friends, family
and even colleagues to imagine, let alone comprehend. In devoting his life to
asking and answering questions about the universe and how it works, Dr.
Veltman continues in the tradition of such great physicists and cosmologists
as Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, and Albert Einstein.
The Regents express admiration and deep appreciation to Dr. Veltman for
his many contributions to science and to the University's intellectual and
cultural life, and laud the accomplishments of Professor Emeritus Martinus J G.
Veltman, the first University of Michigan faculty member to win a Nobel Prize.
A standing ovation followed.
Professor Emeritus Veltman stated that he is overwhelmed by what has happened
to him since winning the Nobel Prize. He said that nothing in life can compare with the
experience of moving into unchartered territory, arriving where no one has ever been,
discovering something new, making a guess about it, and having it work out. He
thanked the Regents and administration for "creating a university in which it is a
pleasure to work."
Another standing ovation followed.

October Meeting, 1999


Y2K Preparedness
President Bollinger called on Jose-Marie Griffiths, University chief information
officer and executive director of the Information Technology Division. Dr. Griffiths
reported that over the past few months, significant progress has been made in readying
the University for the Y2K rollover. Among the activities that have taken place are
continued remediation and testing, the development of business continuity and contingency
plans, quality assurance activities, and a series of communications activities. Testing has
been completed on all legacy mainframe administrative systems, and the Medical Center
has completed quality assurance testing of its patient care data system. Payroll systems and
student systems have also been tested.
Extensive campus-wide communication has occurred through a variety of means.
Dr. Griffiths reviewed the Y2K priorities that have been set by the executive officers,
and noted that people throughout the University have prepared business continuity and
contingency plans with these priorities in mind. Quality assurance activities are currently
underway, including review of twelve units' contingency plans by the risk management
office.
Dr. Griffiths reported that a Y2K Communications and Event Management
Response Team has been identified, and a campus-wide Y2K Response and
Communication Center has been established that will operate during the rollover period.
A core team of key decision makers is being trained, decision-making authority and
responsibility of each command center participant is being identified, and additional
needed staffing needs are being assessed. A full simulated dress rehearsal will be held in
early December. She acknowledged Bill Bess, director of the Department of Public
Safety, and James Snyder, professor of architecture and urban planning, for sharing
their expertise in large-scale emergency management operations.
A communications plan has also been produced, and various communities who
have different kinds of communications needs during the rollover period are being
identified. Key messages are being prepared for dissemination before, during, and after
the rollover.
Dr. Griffiths emphasized that at every point the planners have worked to augment
and build upon existing failure response systems. The majority of the effort has involved
finding and fixing deficits and integrating the different systems into a comprehensive,
holistic system.
She reported that the University of Michigan has played a leadership role both
statewide and nationally in Y2K activities. Through the Michigan Community Outreach
program, Y2K training programs have been provided to community leaders throughout
the state. University officials were invited to participate in the U.S. President's Council
on Year 2000 Conversion Roundtable and the University of Michigan is one of only 20
higher education institutions on the U.S. Department of Education's "Honor Roll." The
University's materials for Y2K training have been sent by the U.S. Department of
Education to several thousand post secondary institutionand y s across the United States.
Finally, the University has been cited by the Gartner Group as a "great example" of
"effective, comprehensive Y2K testing, remediation, and contingency planning."


106




October Meeting, 1999


Dr. Griffiths reported that UM-based Y2K problems are not expected. If there are
externally-based Y2K problems, the contingency plans will operate. As a result of Y2K
preparations, the University will have gained an updated, campus-wide comprehensive
emergency preparedness and disaster recovery system.
Regarding the nuclear reactor, Dr. Griffiths noted that it will be powered-down to
a minimal level of operation during the rollover period, as it does not require power to
remain safe.
Announcements
In the area of faculty accomplishments, President Bollinger announced that four
University of Michigan medical researchers have been named to the Institute of Medicine:
David Ginsburg, Julian T. Hoff, James S. House, and Michael Marletta. He also noted
that "A View From the Bridge," composed by Professor William Bolcom, had
premiered on October 9 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and had received enthusiastic
reviews.
He noted that WUOM ("Michigan Radio") has been named "Best in the Nation" in its
market category by the Public Radio Program Directors Association, and that the School of
Public Health has been named the national program office of a community-based project
funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation designed to improve the quality of life for
children with asthma.
He also highlighted the identification of genes linked to an aggressive form of
breast cancer by University of Michigan researchers and commented on the deaths of a
number of emeritus faculty members.
University of Michigan Financial Report and Year-End Financial Information for
the Year Ended June 30, 1999
Executive Vice President Kasdin called attention to The University of Michigan
Year-End Financial Information for Fiscal Year 1998-99 ("ivory book") which had
been distributed at the meeting.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Management Report with University Responses
Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that this is the first year of the engagement
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its external accounting firm. The thoroughness of
the audit, and the fact that the auditing firm was new to the University following a
twelve-year engagement by the previous firm, has given him even greater confidence
that the University is in excellent and secure financial position. He introduced Jack
McCarthy, executive partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on this engagement.
Mr. McCarthy observed that the high quality of the University's initiatives in
implementing the PeopleSoft system, the increased emphasis on investment
performance, the review of business processes, and financial management practices are
equivalent to what is being done among the University's leading peer institutions, both
public and private, across the country. He introduced several of the partners involved in
the audit: Bill Gehrke, Don Christian, George Johnson, Cheryl Soper, and Darrell
Burks.


107




October Meeting, 1999


Mr. Burks reviewed the material handed out at the meeting. He observed that the
audits were conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that the audits be planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance of
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. He reported, "We
believe that the University's financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the University." He also said that the audits examined the
internal control structure of the University and noted that the internal control structure
is strong, with no material deficiencies.
Mr. Burks then reviewed the required communications set out in the Statement on
Auditing Standards No. 61. These include "significant new accounting policies and
unusual transactions," "management judgments and accounting estimates," "significant
audit adjustments," "disagreements with the administration," "consultation with other
accountants," "major issues discussed with management prior to retention," "difficulties
encountered in performing the audit," and "other information in documents containing
audited financial statements." He noted that separate reports were prepared for the
combined activities of the University of Michigan and its sub-units: the Board in
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, the Executive Education Center, the Hospitals and
Health Centers, Veritas, and Michigan Health Corporation.  Separate unqualified
reports were issued for the Alumni Association, William Davidson Institute, and the
University Musical Society. Audits are currently in process for the Schedule of Federal
Financial Assistance for the year ended June 30, 1999; the financial statements of
M-Care for the year ended December 31, 1999; and the annual agreed-upon procedures
of the NCAA intercollegiate athletic program and athletic booster information.
Mr. Burks noted that audit observations and recommendations have been included
in the management letter.
Regent Deitch observed that "great compliments are due to everyone involved in this
effort." To have a seamless transition while changing financial accounting systems is, he
said, "an astoundingly excellent accomplishment." He also pointed out that public
accountants are required to report the least aberrations, and to have an unqualified report is
a great compliment to Executive Vice President Kasdin and the University's financial staff.
Executive Vice President Kasdin thanked Regent Deitch and noted that the
compliments paid to staff are very meaningful. Executive Vice President Kasdin said
that he would be reporting back at the March meeting with progress on each comment
made in the management letter.
University of Michigan Financial Report
Executive Vice President Kasdin reported that this year responsibility for this
report had been switched from the chief financial officer to the Office of Development.
He noted that it is an important communication device both to financial professionals
and to the community at large and alumni, and he complimented Vice President Feagin
and the development staff for the results of their efforts.


108




October Meeting, 1999


Annual Report of Investments
Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that the annual report of investments had
traditionally been given in the spring, but the decision was made to change the timing to
the fall. Thus, the last report was given 18 months ago.
He introduced Erik Lundberg, chief investment officer, and Elizabeth Hokada,
director of investments.
Executive Vice President Kasdin reported that as of June 30, 1999, the University
had $4.1 billion in financial assets, with $2.5 billion in the endowment funds and almost
$1.2 billion in the University Investment Pool. The remainder of the assets is invested
in Veritas ($159.8 million), M-Care ($61.0 million), charitable remainder trusts ($63.6
million), Donor Pooled Income Fund ($10.0 million), the Business School Growth Fund
($2.2 million), and in bond, construction, and other funds ($127.6 million).
He noted that the Long Term Portfolio has a market value of $2.95 billion, and
noted that it is comprised of the endowment funds (85 percent); the University
Investment Pool (13 percent); Veritas (2 percent); and M-Care (less than 1 percent).
Executive Vice President Kasdin reviewed the strategic decisions made by the
Board of Regents in past years that serve as guidelines for management of the
University's investments.  One of these decisions is to use external investment
management (November 1986); as a result of this decision, essentially all University
assets are currently invested by external professional managers.  Executive Vice
President Kasdin indicated that this will continue to be the case with the ithiring of Mr.
Lundberg as chief investment officer.
Executive Vice President Kasdin next pointed to Regental directives for
maximizing the return on investments over long term time horizons by maintaining an
equity orientation, with up to 85 percent of the portfolio in equities (November 1986,
June 1989, and September 1994). In recent years, 80 percent of the portfolio has been
invested in equities and assets that will behave like equities.
Another important Regental directive has been to insulate University operations
from volatility (November 1986 and June 1995). A rule was established stating that 5
percent of the endowment funds would be used each year to support operations, based on
a 12-quarter average to reduce volatility. He noted that as a nonprofit institution, the
University is considered a "total return" investor, which gives it a great degree of
flexibility.
The final strategic decision made by the Board of Regents was the commitment to
invest up to 25 percent of the portfolio in alternative assets (June 1989 and September
1994). He noted that one of the important contributors to investment performance in
the fourth quarter of 1999 was the venture capital portfolio that the Board of Regents
has been building throughout the decade.
Executive Vice President Kasdin displayed a chart illustrating the asset allocation
of the Long Term Portfolio, which contains $2.95 billion of the University's total of
$4.1 billion in invested funds. The asset allocation includes 43 percent in market-traded


109




October Meeting, 1999


equities (29 percent domestic and 14 percent international); 22 percent in alternative
assets, which can be considered as an additional exposure to the domestic equity
market; 3 percent in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts); 15 percent in fixed income;
7 percent in cash equivalents; and 10 percent in absolute return investments. The basic
philosophy is identification of the core asset classes which over time will produce
superior returns.
Regent McGowan asked for an explanation of the absolute return investments and
whether they are the equivalent of hedge funds. Executive Vice President Kasdin
responded that "absolute returns" are a generic term given to a wide variety of
investment vehicles that have certain things in common. They are structured as limited
partnerships, investing as liquid assets. The investors get either quarterly or annual
withdrawal rights, so that these funds are not illiquid in the same fashion as alternative
assets in which funds cannot be withdrawn for 5-7 years. Finally, they are focused to
attain positive investment performance irrespective of broader market conditions.
Regent McGowan noted that "hedge funds" are comprised of derivatives, equities,
venture capital funds, and other similar instruments, and asked why are they not
considered to be alternative assets.
Executive Vice President Kasdin responded that the differences between absolute
return managers and alternative asset managers are that absolute return managers offer
liquidity on a periodic, regular basis. Moreover, they are assets that are supposed to
have low correlation to markets, whereas private equity/venture capital merely gives the
illusion of low correlation because in down markets they are carried at cost.
Regent McGowan asked for more clarity with regard to classification of
alternative assets, and also asked about the size of the University's investment in hedge
funds. Executive Vice President Kasdin responded that there is 10 percent in a variety
of absolute return managers. Regent McGowan asked to be provided with a list of the
University's actual investments in the absolute return category, including what each of
the funds is investing in and the names of the managers. At the suggestion of Regent
Maynard, it was decided to provide such a list for the entire array of the University's
investments.
Executive Vice President Kasdin continued that the market value of alternative
assets is $757.7 million, divided among venture capital (34 percent); real estate (25
percent); private equity (18 percent); energy (15 percent); and distressed debt (8
percent). He described the asset allocations for the University Investment Pool (UIP),
Veritas, and M-Care funds.
Executive Vice President Kasdin reported that he plans to reconstitute the
Investment Advisory Committee now that Mr. Lundberg has arrived and emphasized
that the University will continue to focus on ensuring use of the best managers and
understanding the risks of exposure for University funds. Finally, he said that Mr.
Lundberg will be developing a set of priorities for the Board's consideration over the
coming months.
Executive Vice President Kasdin introduced Lila Hunnewell, from Cambridge
Associates, the University's investment advisor. Ms. Hunnewell observed that the


110




October Meeting, 1999


University of Michigan, like other nonprofit, has a long-term investment horizon, with
an investment objective of having an inflation-adjusted total return, net-of-fees, greater
than its spending rate. The University has chosen to achieve this objective through
diversification; the question becomes one of degree of diversification.
Since the last report, she said that the first theme had been to reduce the level of
diversification but maintain concentrated value-added strategies in the diversifying
asset classes. She noted that since December 31, 1997, there has been a change in the
diversifying asset classes to position the portfolio so that it maintains the level of
diversification it needs and not have a volatile spending stream, and to reduce the risks
in the portfolio. Within the diversifying allocations, the goal is to focus on managers
who can add value either through their skills or their practice of operating in segments
of the market where inefficiencies can be taken advantage of. To this end, she noted
that the following categories were pared back: small capitalization equities, emerging
international, sector funds, real estate, and energy stocks.
The second theme was to focus on the asset classes that can add value, such as
venture capital, private equity, multi-strategy absolute return managers, and long-short
equity managers. Regent McGowan asked whether hedge funds were governed as to
what financial instruments they could include. Ms. Hunnewell replied that the types of
investments the funds make are determined by their partnership agreements which set
out the areas of focus for the partnerships and typically they are very broadly defined.
The types of long-short stock pickers that the University has chosen indicate in their
documents that they do not and will not do macro-trading. Ms. Hunnewell emphasized
that the University staff practices vigorous due diligence with managers, and this is
critical to all of these asset classes.
Ms. Hunnewell noted that exposure to commodities has been eliminated, which is
consistent with the decision to focus on areas where managers' skills can add value.
Fixed income exposure has been reduced from 20.9 percent to 15.2 percent.
The 13.5 percent return for the Long Term Portfolio was in the top quartile of 282
other endowed institutions. This was driven by the 141 percent return on the venture
capital portfolio, strong performance by the international equity managers, and by the
multi-strategy absolute return managers. Ms. Hunnewell observed that when the
venture capital returns are placed in context, they are extraordinary. This year's
average venture capital return among the institutions tracked by Cambridge Associates
was about 80 percent. The University's high quality portfolio provided a much greater
return, which she attributed to the importance of manager skill.
Over the coming year, goals include finalizing the strategy portfolio; reviewing the
marketable side of the portfolio, including evaluation of domestic and global managers
from both an asset allocation and manager structure perspective; and continuing to build
relationships with the highest quality venture capital, private equity, and absolute
return/long-short hedge fund managers.

October Meeting, 1999


Institute of Science and Technology (IST) High Bay Building Addition
Stephen Director, dean of the College of Engineering, reported that the proposed
new building will house the Department of Biomedical Engineering and will allow for
expansion of the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science (CUOS). He noted that the
project is the beginning of an evolving plan to create a locus of activity in biomedical
engineering on North Campus, and that it will contribute to the Life Sciences Initiative.
Executive Vice President Kasdin introduced Robert Powell, of Jickling, Lyman
and Powell Associates, Inc., to present plans for the building's design. Mr. Powell
displayed site maps, photographs, schematic designs of the interior, and a drawing of
the exterior. He also described the exterior treatment and displayed samples of the
materials to be used on the exterior. He noted that the current IST complex consists of
three buildings; at the completion of this project, it will become two buildings.
Regent Deitch moved approval of the design of the IST High Bay Building
Addition, and authorization for issuing the project for bids and awarding a construction
contract providing that bids are within the approved budget. Regent Horning seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Mason Hall and Haven Hall Renovation Project
Executive Vice President Kasdin introduced Mr. Steven L. Einhorn, of Einhorn
Yaffee Prescott, Architecture & Engineering, P.C. He noted that this firm is involved in
important restoration work throughout the U.S. and around the world.
Mr. Einhorn said that he would present issues regarding the exterior of the
building, and his partner, Mr. Thomas Birdsey, would comment on some of the
functional planning issues.
Mr. Einhorn noted that the challenge was to develop an exterior skin for the
addition and renovation that recalls some of the old buildings on campus but also
embraces the future. He displayed photographs of existing buildings and illustrated
how their outstanding features will be woven into the new facade. He displayed
renderings of the exterior treatment from a number of elevations.
Mr. Birdsey reviewed some of the planning ideas being incorporated into the
interior renovation, displaying diagrams of the ground floor plan for Haven Hall and for
a typical upper floor. He noted that the plans call for the introduction of a great deal of
natural light into the building.
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that state capital outlay funds earmarked
for infrastructure repair will be used for this building, so the project also includes
restoration and replacement of the infrastructure in both Mason Hall and Haven Hall.
Regent Deitch asked whether the project also includes any aesthetic improvements
to Mason Hall. Mr. Einhorn noted that the infrastructure improvements will enhance
Mason Hall. President Bollinger commented that in his opinion, the improvements
being made to Haven Hall do not need to be derived from features of Mason Hall,
because the goal would be to eventually replace Mason Hall.

October Meeting, 1999


Regent Horning observed that the cost per square foot for this project appears to
be nearly double the cost for the IST High Bay Addition project. Executive Vice
President Kasdin responded that the reason for this perception is that the actual
renovation and infrastructure improvement portion of the project represents a
significant part of the cost of the Mason Hall and Haven Hall project. The $38 million
project cost should be applied not to the 67,000 square foot addition, but to the entire
project, which consists of 213,000 square feet. This will yield a cost per square foot
equivalent to or less than other projects.
Regent Brandon commented that it would be helpful if in the future, project
descriptions could contain information about the cost per square foot for both new
construction and renovation. Executive Vice President Kasdin responded that this will
be done.
Regarding the exterior of the renovation, Mr. Einhorn commented that mockups of
several different options will be constructed so that an informed decision can be made.
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the revised scope of the Mason Hall and Haven Hall Renovation
Project and the design of the project as presented by Einhorn Yaffee Prescott,
Architecture & Engineering, P.C. Regent Newman was absent when the vote was taken.
Michigan Student Assembly Monthly Report
Mr. Bram Elias, president of Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), distributed a
document describing the work of MSA. He gave an overview of the structure of MSA
and described the projects MSA is working on this year, noting that much of the work
of MSA   is conducted by commissions and committees.   He emphasized that
commissions are the vehicle for administrators and Regents to obtain information about
specific issues, and he urged them to contact the commission chairs directly when they
have questions. He noted that MSA would be reporting on funding for club sports at
the November meeting and on civic activism on campus at the December meeting.
Mr. Elias commented that MSA would take advantage of the opportunities for
discussion with the Regents on a monthly basis. Their objectives in these reports will be
to build institutional momentum for specific projects; to seek Regental and executive
officer input and advice; to let the Regents know what students think about the direction
of the institution; and to affect institutional policy. He said that he welcomes input as to
how best to present the monthly reports and to work with Regents and the
administration.
In response to a question from Regent Maynard, Mr. Elias gave background
information about activities of the Peace and Justice Commission that had recently been
described in the Michigan Daily. He said that the issues were structural, rather than
political, and that in the future, the work of this committee will be vetted through MSA
prior to issues being raised publicly and independently by the group. This is due to
MSA's philosophy that it has an obligation to represent all students and to ensure that
the actions of commissions it empowers are in the interest of the entire student body,
rather than those who hold particular political views.

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1999


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, November 18, 1999
The Regents convened at 2:00 p.m. in the Kuenzel Room of the Michigan Union.
Present were President Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, McGowan,
Newman, Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin,
Interim Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Interim Chancellor
Klein, Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice
President Omenn, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and
Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Maynard was absent.
Naming of Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and introduced former United States
President Gerald R. Ford and Dean Rebecca Blank. He announced that this is a historic
occasion, in which the School of Public Policy will be named the Gerald R. Ford School
of Public Policy.
President Bollinger stated that President Ford has a deep personal connection to
the University of Michigan, dating to his days as a student in the 1930s, when he
enjoyed a distinguished career as both a student and an athlete. When he left the
University, he pursued a career in public service; while serving in Congress in the
1960s, he made a decision to leave his papers to the University of Michigan. The
Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library is now located on campus.
President Bollinger noted that President Ford has made many visits to the
University, and he chaired the successful capital campaign in the 1980s. More than any
other public figure, President Ford's actions during his presidency have exuded the
"cunning middle ground," as described by the poet, Seamus Heaney. This is exactly the
kind of person the University desires to hold up to its students as they think about
public policy and public service.
President Bollinger pointed out that the naming of the school also provides an
opportunity to build a closer connection with the Ford Library and Ford Museum in
Grand Rapids. He noted that volumes of documents related to the last days of the
Vietnam War are currently being reviewed and declassified and will be released for the
first time within the next several months. The School of Public Policy and the Ford
Library, he noted, are planning to hold a major conference in April 2000 on the close of
the Vietnam War and the effect of this event on the life and character of the country
since then. A celebration to commemorate the naming of the School of Public Policy
for President Ford will be held in Fall 2000.
Dean Blank observed that the naming opportunity comes at a good time for the
School of Public Policy, as it is the newest and smallest school at the University and is
seeking to expand. She described the school's current programs, noting that the
master's program attracts first rate students and faculty. Among the issues to be
addressed in expanding are determining the appropriate undergraduate components for
the school; revamping the Ph.D. program; creating closer connections with other


115




November Meeting, 1999


schools and colleges; creating closer connections and greater visibility in the world of
policy and practice; and moving into new space in Lorch Hall.
With such a full agenda, she commented that it is the right time to take a new
name, and there are a number of reasons why the name of Gerald R. Ford is so
appropriate. It creates visibility and identity for the school and it associates the school
with a man whose own career is a hallmark of commitment to public service. Gerald R.
Ford symbolizes the most desirable things students should learn: a commitment to the
common good and to the effective design and implementation of policy. The event held
to commemorate the naming will also provide an opportunity to kick off a major
fundraising campaign to help build an endowment for the school. Dean Blank
concluded that she was honored and excited about the prospect of becoming dean of the
Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. "President Ford honors us by giving us his
name," she noted, "and I very much hope that over time we will in turn honor him
through the excellence of our programs and through the commitment of our faculty and
students to promote and analyze effective public policies."
Regent Deitch commented that "This is a wonderful moment for the University of
Michigan." He noted that the goal of the School of Public Policy is to train new
generations of people who can make a difference in the critical issues that will face us,
and that under the leadership of Dean Blank and with the name of a former president of
the United States, the school will grow in influence in the coming years. He said it is
very fitting to name the school after one of the University's most distinguished alumni,
who has spent his life in the service of our country. Noting that President Ford's
generation has been described as a "generation of giants," Regent Deitch observed that
President Ford "is a giant of that generation." Regent Deitch thanked President Ford
"for upholding our republic in a moment of great stress," continuing that "All
Americans are forever in your debt."
Regent Newman observed that she was a student at the University when President
Ford became an adjunct professor. She recalled the high level of excitement that was
engendered by his presence and by the realization that a former University of Michigan
student had become president of the United States, "which allowed us to only imagine
what we could become." She reviewed the historical events, culminating in the
resignation of President Nixon, that led to Mr. Ford's becoming president. She noted
his presidency was marked by a determination to heal the country's wounds, including a
plan he enacted that allowed people who had fled the country to avoid service in
Vietnam to work their way home. She also commented on Betty Ford's courage and
candor in dealing with her diagnosis of breast cancer shortly after her husband assumed
office. Regent Newman highlighted some of the accomplishments of Mr. Ford's
presidency, including the origination of economic deregulation; the advancement of the
Middle East peace process and black majority rule in South Africa; and the Helsinki
Accord. "At a time of national cynicism and distrust," she concluded, "you healed a
nation in torment."
Regent White observed that "this is a great moment for the University of
Michigan." She noted that during his life in public service, President Ford had
embraced working together on a bipartisan basis for the good and the sake of the nation.
"It is an honor to have your name on our school," she commented, "and I also hope that
having your name there will encourage students to commit their lives to public policy."


116




November Meeting, 1999


Regent Brandon noted that this occasion provides "a unique opportunity to thank
you, on behalf of both the University and himself." President Ford's contributions both
to the University and the country, he said, have made the University "a more
meaningful place, a more important place, and a more fun place" for him to have
attended, been a student athlete, and now to serve as a Regent.
Regent Taylor observed that he was "privileged just to be here." He said that he
hoped President Ford knows how much his stature grows among all Americans with
each passing year. "As we come to appreciate and understand your courage, your
leadership, and your service to us, we will be forever indebted to you for the generosity
of your selflessness in saving this country and bringing it together during a period of
great turmoil."
Regent Horning noted that he knew President Ford as his congressman from Grand
Rapids in his youth. "This is your Michigan family saying thank you," he commented,
"and that's what's so special about it." He noted that former Regent Paul Goebel would
have been very proud on this occasion.
Regent McGowan observed that everyone on the board shares "an avocation for
public policy processes and import, and we admire especially those who choose public
life for their careers." Noting that the School of Public Policy "is one of the best," she
concluded that "it is an honor to entrust this noble school to your name."
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved the naming of the School of Public Policy the Gerald R. Ford
School of Public Policy. A standing ovation followed.
President Bollinger thanked President Ford for allowing the University to honor
him for his "outstanding public service to our nation." He noted that he was looking
forward to President and Mrs. Ford returning to campus next September for the
dedication of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. "The naming of this school
in your honor," he said, "will serve as a reminder to all of us at Michigan —especially
our students —what character alone can accomplish."
Former President Ford reflected on his long association with the University of
Michigan, both as a student and throughout the rest of his life, commenting that "at no
time in my lifetime would I ever have dreamed that the name of Gerald R. Ford would
be associated with a school of public policy here at this great University." He noted
that the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library is located on the University of Michigan
campus, and said that he'd always hoped that a closer relationship could be developed
between the library and the University. He said that the establishment of the School of
Public Policy is the culmination of this dream.
President Ford thanked President Bollinger and Dean Blank for making this dream
come true and promised to do whatever he could to make the School of Public Policy
one of the very finest in the nation. A standing ovation followed.
The meeting recessed at 2:30 p.m., at which time a press conference was held with
President Ford.
The meeting resumed at 3:20 p.m.

November Meeting, 1999


Annual Report of Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA)
President Bollinger called on Professor Sherrie Kossoudji, chair of SACUA, to
present the annual report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs.
Professor Kossoudji observed that new communications technologies are fostering
interactions among faculty, executive officers, Regents, and other members of the
University community that would have been unimaginable in the past. This enhanced
access to communication and information helps to disseminate knowledge.
Professor Kossoudji highlighted several issues that are currently of concern to
SACUA. These include divestment of tobacco from University portfolios, electronic
privacy, technology transfer and intellectual property issues, the reduction in the
number of nontenure track faculty, and the creation of "virtual" centers for higher
education that do not have a physical site.
President Bollinger commented that SACUA had done a good job of drawing
attention to and stimulating discussion of electronic privacy issues. Further discussion
followed.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Gary Hann, alumnus, about harassment by
University of Michigan police; Audrey Jackson, alumna, about affirmative action
remedies; Bram Elias, president of Michigan Student Assembly, about student activism
on campus; Peter Romer-Friedman and Susan Harter, students and members of Students
Organized for Labor and Equality (SOLE), urging the University of Michigan to join the
Worker Rights Consortium.
Motion to Meet in Non-formal Session
Regent Deitch made the following motion:
I move that we adjourn this formal session of the Regents and begin a
non-formal session, the purpose of which is to consider a personnel evaluation.
Regent Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. The
meeting continued in non-formal session until about 5:15 p.m.
Friday, November 19, 1999
The Regents convened at 9:35 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, McGowan, Newman, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin, Interim Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Interim Chancellor Klein, Vice
President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President
Omenn, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent Maynard was absent.
Annual State Funding Request, Ann Arbor Campus
Provost Cantor reported that the preferred funding model, which occurred last year,
calls for a generous state appropriation that allows a restrained tuition increase. The


118




November Meeting, 1999


request for 2000-01 is for a 5 percent appropriation increase, which will allow for tuition
restraint.
Provost Cantor pointed out that compensation represents 61 percent of the General
Fund Budget; therefore the key budget challenges for the coming year arise from
compensation issues, namely growth in faculty and staff salaries, growth in benefits
costs, and union contracts that are up for renewal.
Regarding financial aid, Provost Cantor noted that the University offers both
need-based and merit-based financial aid for undergraduate and graduate students and
pledges to meet the financial aid needs of resident undergraduate students. Financial
aid accounts for 10 percent of the General Fund Budget. Regent Taylor requested that a
report on financial aid be given at a future Regents' Meeting.
Regarding the growth in faculty salaries, Provost Cantor reported that the average
faculty salary increase nationwide last year was 4.8 percent, with higher increases at the
private institutions and research and doctoral institutions with which the University
competes.  A 4-5 percent average merit salary pool has just kept up with the
competition.
Because so much emphasis has been placed on faculty salaries, Provost Cantor
described the components. In the typical case, she noted, the merit pool will have four
components: promotions (5-8 percent); specific retention efforts to combat offers from
competing institutions (about 10 percent); market adjustments (15-33 percent) so as to
be proactive rather than reactive in retaining the best faculty; and increases based on
recent performance for the remaining 50-70 percent. Provost Cantor noted that all
salary assessments are really assessments of merit and productivity. They are not done
in any across the board fashion. Each school and college uses a unique set of
performance indicators on which to evaluate performance.
Regent Newman said that it would be helpful to receive a review of faculty
salaries for the past 4-5 years to examine the pattern of increases. It was noted that the
use of available funds for retention reduces the amount available for merit increases,
and this causes concern among faculty.   It is hoped that emphasizing market
adjustments will alleviate this situation.
Provost Cantor noted that a major factor creating pressure on staff compensation is
the low unemployment rate in southeast Michigan, especially for highly-educated
workers, and that this is particularly severe for information technology staff. Staff
benefits also create compensation pressures, she said, noting that benefits costs rose 10
percent this year and are projected to rise 8 percent next year and 7 percent the
following year. In addition, a number of union contracts will be up for renewal this
year, and these also affect the General Fund.
Provost Cantor observed that information technology is increasingly affecting
academic programs, and it is critical to have the highest quality technical staff to
support administrative systems, curriculum and research needs, and students.
Information technology also requires substantial capital renewal costs, for example $23
million for Internet2 wiring. Information technology is being integrated into the
curriculum in order to enhance fluency, train future professionals, study questions of
technology and society that are raised by technological innovations, and explore and


119




November Meeting, 1999


develop cutting edge fields, such as bioinformatics, that are emerging from
technological innovations.
Provost Cantor concluded by pointing out that in addition to the 5 percent base
budget request the total requested increase of $25.9 million for 2000-01 includes
beginning support for two special initiatives, in information technology and instruction
technology, and for continuing initiatives in learning communities and the life science
undergraduate curriculum.
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Horning, the Regents
unanimously approved the annual Ann Arbor campus operating request to the state for
FY 2001, as presented.
University of Michigan-Dearborn 2000-2001 General Fund Budget Request
Interim Chancellor Klein noted that the Dearborn campus is heavily engaged in
experiential learning through internship and coop programs and in outreach and
cooperation with the neighboring industrial and business communities. The budget
requests $975,000 to fund 12 new faculty lines for 2000-01 that are necessary to
incorporate the new degree programs that have been created; $1,250,000 to continue
expanding the use of information technologies in support of learning; and $250,000 for
continuation of the campus's outreach programs to help serve the needs of southeast
Michigan communities. The total requested increase is $2,557,000.
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the 2000-01 state appropriations request for the University of
Michigan-Dearborn.
University of Michigan-Flint 2000-2001 General Fund Budget Request
Chancellor Mestas noted that the UM-Flint budget request contains four
components: $950,000 for general operating costs; $800,000 to strengthen professional
programs, technological capacity, and applied research; $400,000 for increased
information technology access; and $425,000 for equipment maintenance, repair, and
replacement. He pointed out that the various components of the budget also reflect the
University's continuing commitment to the Flint community.
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Horning, the Regents
unanimously approved the 2000-2001 General Fund budget request for the University
of Michigan-Flint.

November Meeting, 1999


Michigan Student Assembly Report. Mr. Bram Elias, president of Michigan
Student Assembly (MSA), Mr. Glen Roe, chair of the Budget Priorities Committee, and
Mr. Andy Coulouris, vice president of MSA, gave a presentation on the process used by
the Budget Priorities Committee to fund student groups. Mr. Roe noted that 267
student groups across campus had requested funding during the fall term; 220 of those
received a total of $96,600. This amount represents only 19.75 percent of the total
funds requested by all groups. Over time, he noted the trend has been a greater
dependency on MSA for funding for student groups.
Mr. Roe reported that a large portion of funding requests were from club sports
organizations, and that each club sport charges dues to the participants, some of which
are rather substantial. He noted that the amount of funding available for club sports
from MSA is minimal and does not reduce costs significantly for each participant. The
high fees charged to people who wish to participate in club sports prohibits some
students from participating.
Mr. Coularis reported that MSA believes that the most important issue for MSA is
providing opportunities for students, and that a public commitment must be made to
provide financial assistance for those who cannot afford to participate on their own. To
this end, MSA decided to hold a referendum to see whether students would be willing
to contribute $0.25 per student per term for one year. This would raise an initial
endowment of $18,000 which would be complimented by fundraising activities by club
sports participants. He emphasized that the issue is one of access, and is a priority for
MSA.
Mr. Roe observed that most students who participate in club sports are in favor of
this initiative, and it is an important issue for students in general.
Regent Newman pointed out that if the ballot initiative is approved by the student
body, the additional MSA fee would have to be approved by the Regents before it could
be implemented. She suggested that MSA officers look at the additional MSA fee in
the context of the entire student fee schedule. It was also pointed out that there are a
number of student organizations that are in need of additional funding. Mr. Elias
responded that club sports groups as a category of student organization tend to charge
their members much more than other groups. Also, unlike other student organizations,
club sports require a certain level of funding in order to exist at all; they cannot reduce
their programming in order to make do with less.
Regent White commented that it would be helpful to have a schedule of the dues
charged by other student organizations as a basis for comparison.
Mr. Mike Stevenson, director of Recreational Sports, reported that club sports
receive a subsidy of $80,000 from Recreational Sports. They do not receive any
funding from the Athletic Department.
It was noted that the $.25 figure was arrived at as an amount that would be
palatable to students. It was also considered as a symbolic amount to determine the
degree of student support for this issue.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Omenn
commented on recent recognition received by the health system. MCare was one of 38
health plans nationwide to be cited as a leader in quality assurance by the National


121




November Meeting, 1999


Council on Quality Assurance. He noted that the medical readiness simulator and
trainer for extreme emergencies in the Department of Emergency Medicine had been
nominated for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institution's permanent research collection.
He also reported that the Health System's helicopter ambulance service, Survival
Flight, was recently named the best in the country.
Dearborn campus. Interim Chancellor Klein reported that the child development
center has been re-accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young
Children, one of only 7 percent of programs nationwide to earn this endorsement. He
also noted that a $2.5 million gift had been received from the Ford Motor Company
Fund which will serve as the basis of an endowment for the upkeep of the campus'
Henry Ford Estate.
Flint Campus. Chancellor Mestas reported that the NCA accreditation team
visited the campus last week and were very impressed. They are recommending a full
ten-year reaccreditation for the campus. He also noted that former Chancellor Clinton
Jones would be retiring in December 1999.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Feagin submitted the monthly report of gifts
received. She also acknowledged the University of Michigan's contributions to the
United Way campaign. Regent McGowan, chair of the University's campaign, noted
that the goal of $1 million had been exceeded and complimented the University
community for its extraordinary contributions to that effort.

November Meeting, 1999


Memorial statements. Vice President Tedesco submitted a memorial statement for
Neil M. Kalter, professor of psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts
and in the Medical School.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness the
death of Neil M. Kalter, Ph.D., professor of psychology, College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, and professor of psychology, Department of Psychiatry, Medical School.
Professor Kalter received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in
1971, at which time he joined the faculties of the Departments of Psychology and
Psychiatry. He served as director of the Center for the Child and Family in the Institute
of Human Adjustment from 1987-92. Under his directorship, the Center for the Child
and Family was described as a model for the training of doctoral students in clinical
psychology and of other mental health practitioners in child, adolescent, and family
psychotherapy.
As both clinician and scholar with an international reputation, Professor Kalter was
especially recognized for his outstanding contributions to the understanding of the
impact of parental divorce upon children, the subject of his 1990 book, Growing up with
Divorce, and his creation of a widely adopted model for prevention groups involving
children of divorce.
Professor Kalter was a gifted researcher, an excellent teacher, and a highly regarded
dissertation supervisor. He taught courses in statistics and child psychopathology and
provided statistical and methodological consultation to a wide variety of students. He
was honored in 1995 as Teacher of the Year in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
Revered and respected by his friends and encolleagues in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts and the thMedical School, Professor Kalter was a compassionate
professional who brought to his work a sincere dedication to understanding important
social problems faced by families. As we mourn the loss of this distinguished professor,
our condolences go to his wife Susan and his daughters Jennifer, Stacy, and Lindsay.
President Bollinger reported the death of Regent Emeritus Alfred B. Connable on
November 16 at the age of 95 and of William J. Gedney, professor emeritus of linguistics.
Degrees. Provost Cantor submitted the December 1999 Doctoral Degree List and
changes to previously approved degree lists.
Honorary Degrees. President Bollinger submitted recommendations for three
honorary degree recipients for the December 1999 commencement: Neeme Jarvi,
music director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra (Doctor of Music); Grace Paley,
writer, poet, and essayist (Doctor of Humane Letters); and Romano Prodi, economist
and president of the Commission of the European Community (Doctor of Laws).
Regent Taylor left the meeting at this point (10:55 a.m.).
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by
Regent Deitch, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.

unanimously approved an agreement between the University of Michigan and the
Transplantation Society of Michigan (TSM), whereby through a project funded by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for which Robert M. Merion serves as
principal investigator, an existing University of Michigan-based web site will be
expanded and linked to a statewide donor agency. The project involves a consortium, and
TSM is the principal grant awardee on behalf of the consortium. Because Robert Merion
is both a University of Michigan faculty member and president of TSM, this agreement


135




November Meeting, 1999


falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and the
Transplantation Society of Michigan (TSM).
2.   Terms of the proposed agreement are acceptable and conform to University policy.

executive director (who is also principal investigator for the consortium) and TSM's
financial director, to determine whether they are within the scope of the agreement and
chargeable to TSM.
3.   As president of TSM and principal investigator for this project at the University, Dr.
Merion will receive partial University salary support under the grant consortium
agreement; he will receive no compensation as president of TSM. As a continuing
board member, Dr. Merion receives a nominal honorarium for attendance at TSM
meetings.
Reassignment Agreement with Rui-Feng Wang
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved a reassignment agreement with Rui-Feng Wang for the invention,
"A Method for Combining Physical Objects Using Polar Coordinate Statistical Analysis."

invention internally. No continuing development of the invention will take place with
the use of University funds, facilities, or funds administered by the University, unless
appropriate formal University approvals are obtained.
3.   Mr. Wang's pecuniary interest arises from  his direct management of future
commercialization efforts of the invention.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and MedCharge, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Homing, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved a license agreement between the University of Michigan and
MedCharge, Inc. Because Ronald B. Hirschl and William P. Fleischmann are both
University of Michigan employees and part-owners of MedCharge, this agreement falls
under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and MedCharge, Inc.

Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and TIREM, Inc.
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Homing, the Regents
unanimously approved a proposed license agreement between the University of Michigan
and TIREM, Inc., for "Merit AAA Server" software. Because John Vollbrecht, a
University staff member, is also principal owner of TIREM, Inc., and six other staff
members will be employees with stock options at TIREM, this agreement falls under the
state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:

DECEMBER MEETING, 1999


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, December 16, 1999
The Regents convened at 1:50 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and White.
Also present were Provost Cantor, Interim Vice President Harper, Executive Vice
President Kasdin, Interim Chancellor Klein, Vice President and General Counsel
Krislov, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President and
Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Taylor
and Vice President Feagin were absent. Regent Deitch arrived at 2:55 p.m.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order. He commented on what a
privilege it had been for him and his wife, Jean, to attend the Nobel Prize award
ceremonies in Stockholm.
MSA Monthly Report: The Democracy Project
Bram Elias, president of Michigan Student Assembly, introduced Ms. Sherry Katz,
chair of the Democracy Project. Ms. Katz noted that the Democracy Project is a
component of the Voice Your Vote Task Force. Its mission is to facilitate the means of
civic participation for the campus community, and it believes that civic participation
can be achieved only through the robust exchange of ideas. The Democracy Project
will encourage this by creating opportunities for public discussion on state and national
issues on campus.
Ms. Katz noted that the topic of the first forum organized by the Democracy
Project was "Gun Control and the Right to Bear Arms." The goal is to institutionalize
this project by holding monthly forums, each of which would focus on a different issue.
Prior to each forum, every student who lives in a residence hall receives a newsletter
and questionnaire about the chosen issue. The next forum, to be held in January 2000,
will examine the United States' responsibilities in working with nations that don't
recognize human rights. It is hoped that by the time students graduate from the
University, they will have received not only a world class education, but training on
how to become effective and informed citizens.
The Perigee of the Moon
Vice President Ulaby reported that during the Winter Solstice, which occurs on
December 22, the moon will also be at the closest point it gets to the earth (perigee).
This combination happens only once every 137 years. The result is that the moon will
appear about 14 percent larger and will be about 7 percent brighter.
Annual Report on Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity at the University
of Michigan, FY1999
Vice President Ulaby said that his first year as vice president for research had been
fantastic. He observed that the zest for research and scholarship at the University is one
of its most distinguishing characteristics. He explored what motivates people to spend


139




December Meeting, 1999


20 years or more pursuing the answers to questions; the special chemistry that forms
between faculty and students who collaborate in scholarly pursuits; and what research
means from the standpoint of society and its needs.
The high caliber of the faculty is exemplified by the hundreds of awards and honors
received each year, including, for example, the election of five University of Michigan
faculty members to the prestigious Institute of Medicine. He also highlighted the
Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring
recently received by the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP).
He provided videotaped portrayals highlighting the research of five individual
faculty members, explaining their work and why it is so exciting to them. The five
faculty were James Bardwell (assistant professor of biology in the College of Literature,
Science and the Arts); Arlene Saxonhouse (professor of political science and women's
studies in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts); Thomas Gladwin (Max
McGraw Professor of Corporate and Environmental Management and professor of
business administration in the School of Business Administration and professor of
natural resources and environment in the School of Natural Resources and
Environment); Brian Athey (assistant professor of anatomy and cell biology in the
Medical School and assistant professor of art in the School of Art and Design); and
these faculty: devotion to inquiry, to students, and to understanding the unknown, is
University.
Vice President Ulaby next reviewed financial highlights of the research enterprise
for FY 1999. During this year, research expenditures totaled nearly one-half billion dollars
($499.7 million), an increase of 1.7 percent over FY 1998. Although expenditures have
risen steadily since FY 1990, he pointed out that the aggregate purchasing power of FY
1999 expenditures actually declined by about 1.5 percent compared to FY 1998. There
has been no change in the composition of research expenditures either by sponsoring
group or fields of study. He noted that federal funds account for the largest portion of
research expenditures (68.5 percent), and University funds the next largest (12.2 percent).
The remainder is divided among industry, other non-profit groups, foundations, trade and
professional associations, and other funding sources.
Life sciences accounted for the greatest expenditures by field of study (47.0
percent). Engineering accounted for 19.6 percent, and the remainder was divided
among social sciences (13.7 percent); physical sciences (9.3 percent); all other fields
(8.8 percent); and expenditures in support of all fields (1.6 percent).
Vice President Ulaby noted that based on FY 1997 data (the latest available), the
University of Michigan ranked first among the top ten universities and colleges in total
research and development expenditures.
Vice President Ulaby estimated that about 23,700 members of the University
community take part in a direct way in some kind of scholarly work. During FY 1999,
there were 4,650 sponsored projects, of which 4,400 were supported by external funds.
Excluding the hospitals and health centers, research expenditures comprised about 31
percent of total spending at the University. He noted that nationally less than 20 percent of
research proposals are funded, whereas the University's funding rate is almost 58 percent.


140




December Meeting, 1999


As a nonmonetary measure of the quality of the University's research output, Vice
President Ulaby reported that the University is ranked fifth in the nation in terms of
scientific impact and first among public institutions, by the Institute for Scientific
Information.
Vice President Ulaby described some of the challenges faced at both the individual
faculty level and the institutional level in making sure that the institution is positioned
to continue to succeed and contribute to the areas of research and scholarship. These
include focusing on entrepreneurial and commercialization activities at the faculty level
and recruitment and retention at the institutional level. Other challenges include all of
the activities involved in compliance with government regulations, including human
subject use and laboratory animal use.
Vice President Ulaby next described some recent examples of the transfer of
technology originally invented at the University, including laser technology,
ergonomics software, and a DNA "laboratory on a chip." He also noted that the Office
of the Vice President for Research is involved in government relations activities at the
state and federal levels.
He concluded by observing that the attention devoted to the life sciences during
the past year has generated a great sense of excitement and pride among the faculty by
demonstrating in a concrete way the commitment of the president and the
administration for the University of Michigan to remain among the top institutions in
the country.

Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted a request for authorization to enter into
an agreement with the City of Ann Arbor to jointly develop and operate the Forest
Avenue Parking Structure. He noted that the structure would provide almost 300
parking spaces for the University, and that pending Regental approval, the proposal is
to be submitted for approval by the Ann Arbor City Council on December 20, 1999.
Regent Maynard moved authorization for the executive vice president and chief
financial officer to enter into an agreement with the City of Ann Arbor to jointly


159




December Meeting, 1999


develop and operate the Forest Avenue Parking Structure and approve the budget, as
described in the Regents Communication. Regent Newman seconded the motion.
Regent McGowan inquired about the practices for space allocation between the
University and the general public. Executive Vice President Kasdin responded that two
types of parking would be available: short-term parking and long-term parking. The
short-term parking would be commingled between the University and the city, available
on a first-come, first-serve basis to anyone regardless of University affiliation. The
longer-term parking would be handled with permits from either the city or the
University. He noted that whether University spaces would be available to the general
public during evening and weekend hours remains to be determined, depending on
utilization by University permit holders.
There being no further discussion, the vote was then taken and the motion was
approved unanimously.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Environmental Interpretive Center
Interim Chancellor Klein submitted for approval a revised budget and award of a
construction contract for the UM-Dearborn Environmental Interpretive Center. He
noted that six bids had been received, and all were over budget. The recommendation is
for approval of the lowest bidder. He noted that the difference between the previously
approved budget and the current recommendation has been set aside from campus
funds. No additional money will be requested from the state.
Regent Newman moved approval of the revised budget for the UM-Dearborn
Environmental Interpretive Center and authorization for award of the construction
contract to F.J. Jones & Company, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent
Maynard seconded the motion.
Regent Newman pointed out that this is the second time, recently, that a revised
budget has been necessary for a project on the Dearborn campus. Executive Vice
President Kasdin agreed with her observation, stating that from his experience since his
arrival he had concluded that more support to the Dearborn campus for the preparation
of capital projects was needed. It was decided to bring the current project forward
because an acceptable quality level has now been achieved.
There followed a discussion about why the bids came in higher than the cost
estimates. Executive Vice President Kasdin stated that, in part, the estimates were
based on construction drawings that were not as complete as they should have been and
that this situation has since been rectified. Regent Newman expressed concern about
higher costs being necessary due to substandard estimating procedures, noting that she
does not believe that students should be penalized because of this. She wondered
whether there is any liability involved.
Vice President Wilbanks observed that state officials have raised a similar point
about capital projects that come to them with cost estimates that have not been fully
articulated. To discontinue the practice of having to come back with revised estimates
of project costs, the state has now determined that projects can be submitted, but the
appropriation will not be fully authorized until it is resubmitted with more precise cost
estimates. This change has been made in part because of the time lag and resulting cost
increases that occur between the time capital projects are initiated and the funds
appropriated, and in part because better information can inform the appropriations


160




December Meeting, 1999


process as to the true costs. The project in question was submitted under the previous
process. Executive Vice President Kasdin concurred, and said he was satisfied that the
process has now been improved.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Comments from President Bollinger
President Bollinger commented on the accomplishments of a number of faculty
and staff members over the past month and highlighted current and upcoming events on
campus. He also reported the deaths of two emeritus faculty members.
President Bollinger observed that the figures cited in recent newspaper reports
about a decline in minority enrollment are not entirely accurate, as the drop in
enrollment has not been as great as indicated in the reports. Nevertheless, he said that
any drop in minority enrollment is of concern and the University wants to understand
what is causing it. He said that the enrollment drop has no bearing on the University's
long-standing efforts to achieve racial, ethnic, or any other kind of diversity.
Executive Vice President Omenn reported that the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute had recently awarded the University of Michigan a grant of over $4 million in
the area of bioinformatics.
Public Comments
No Public Comments session was held, since nobody had signed up to address the
Board of Regents.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 3:35 p.m. The next
meeting is scheduled for January 20-21, 2000.

JANUARY MEETING, 2000


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, January 20, 2000
The Regents convened at 3:10 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin, Interim Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Interim Chancellor Klein, Vice
President and General Counsel Krislov, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice
President and Secretary Tedesco,, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent Deitch arrived at 3:30 p.m. Chancellor Mestas was absent.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order, noting that the meeting had been
preceded by a tour of the Kresge Medical Research Buildings.
Michigan Greats
Vice President Ulaby announced that over the coming year, faculty members
would be invited to Regents' Meetings to make ten-minute presentations on a major
research endeavor. During 2001, presentations would be made by graduate and
undergraduate students about their research.
Today's presenter was Dr. James Ferrara, professor of internal medicine, professor
of pediatrics and communicable diseases, and director of the combined Pediatric and
Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Center in the University of Michigan Comprehensive
Cancer Center. Vice President Ulaby noted that Dr. Ferrara arrived at the University of
Michigan in December 1998 and directs the bone marrow transplant research and
clinical programs.
Dr. Ferrara described the work of the bone marrow transplantation program,
noting that its mission is to create the state of the art in bone marrow transplantation
through innovation and collaboration. The program combines clinical care, basic
research, translational research, and education. It was noted that Dr. Ferrara came to
the University of Michigan following 15 years at Harvard University. He said the
major difference between the two institutions is that collaboration is easier at the
University of Michigan.
Motion to meet in nonformal session
Regent Maynard moved that the formal session of the meeting be adjourned and a
nonformal session be commenced for the purpose of considering a personnel evaluation.
Regent White seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The Regents met in nonformal session from 3:30-3:55 p.m.
Public Comments
The Regents heard from Reza Breakstone ("Superfan"), student, requesting support
of the Worker's Rights Consortium and ending sweatshops.
The meeting then adjourned until the following day.

White. Also present were Provost Cantor, Interim Vice President Harper, Executive
Vice President Kasdin, Interim Chancellor Klein, Vice President and General Counsel
Krislov, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice
President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Vice President Feagin, Chancellor
Mestas, and Regent Newman were absent. Provost McLaughlin arrived at 10:30 a.m. to
take the place of Chancellor Mestas.
Report: "Closing the Loop on Y2K"
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and called on Jose Marie Griffiths,
chief information officer. Dr. Griffiths briefed the Regents about the Y2K rollover
event and noted that she would address such questions as What happened?; Was it
worth it?; What would we have had to do anyway?; What benefits were derived? What
is coming next?
Dr. Griffiths reported that the "rollover" activities began at about 6:00 p.m.
December 31, with about 30 people staffing the emergency response center and about
400-500 other people located in various buildings across the campus. At 2:00 a.m. on
January 1, most people were sent home due to the fact that no major crises had
occurred. There were also no major difficulties reported on January 3, 2000, the first
day of work following the holiday break. Only a few minor glitches were reported
across the campus during the rollover, and these were easily remedied.
Dr. Griffiths reported that there is no doubt that there would have been significant
failures if systems had not been tested and remediated to be Y2K compliant. As for the
cost of the Y2K compliance effort, she observed that it added the need for contractors
and consultants for Y2K-specific testing and remediation and also required the purchase
of Y2K-specific software that has no further use. Other additional expenses included
overtime and on-call pay for some categories of staff during the rollover period and the
time leading up to it. Total expenditures for Y2K are estimated to be about $56 million,
including about $46 million for the Hospitals and Health System and about $10 million
for the rest of the campus. She noted that almost all of the hardware and software
upgrades would have had to be done anyway at some time in the future, and these
account for about $46 million to $49 million of the $56 million total cost. The
remaining portion of expenses that were only useful for Y2K were estimated at a
maximum of $7 million ($6 million for the Health System and $1 million for the
campus).
Among the benefits derived from the Y2K effort are a comprehensive inventory of
all of the University's technology-based services and systems and the interdependencies
between them. A second major benefit is the development of campus-wide disaster
recovery and contingency plans, along with an umbrella plan that coordinates all of the
individual plans. A state-of-the-art emergency response center was developed that can
be reassembled at short notice. Another significant benefit is the development of a
comprehensive power environment backup system that will protect research materials
in the event of any unexpected major power outages and can also be used to avoid
power interruptions that would normally be required for scheduled maintenance or
construction activities.


164




January Meeting, 2000


The functionality of many systems was also improved with the addition of newer
versions of software and more reliable equipment. Finally, there were improvements in
the ability to communicate across campus and among the three campuses, and this will
be of lasting value to the institution.
Dr. Griffiths concluded that no problems were expected and none were
experienced as a result of the onset of the Year 2000. She noted that at each annual
disaster training session there will be simulations of different kinds of disasters in order
to build up a body of knowledge at the institution. She thanked the executive officers
and Regents for their support, as well as all who participated in the planning and
coordination of the Y2K effort.
President Bollinger commented that this was a "job well done." He thanked all
staff members who sacrificed their personal celebrations of New Year's Eve by
participating in the event, noting that a reception was being planned in their honor.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted the minutes of the meeting of
December 16, 1999.
Business and Finance Reports. Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted
reports on Investment, Plant Extension, Human Resources and Affirmative Action, and
Noncompetitive Purchases over $5000 from single sources from September 16 -December 15, 1999.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established for December 1999, noting that research expenditures were up more than 16
percent over the previous year.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Mr. Bram Elias, president of Michigan
Student Assembly (MSA), and Rodolfo Palma-Lulion, co-chair of the MSA Peace and
Justice Commission, presented the MSA report.
Mr. Palma-Lulion reported that MSA had voted overwhelmingly to support the
Workers Rights Consortium (WRC) on November 2, 1999. He noted that the administration
had been working in good faith on this issue and that MSA understands that the options
must be carefully weighed before the University takes any action. However, students
believe that the process of choosing a monitoring system must be done as expediently
as possible, and they believe that the University administration will come to the conclusion
that the WRC is the best method for achieving an equitable environment for its
corporate sponsors and the workers who make licensed products. He urged the Regents
to support the administration as it continues to examine the issue and urged the
University to join the WRC.
Mr. Elias observed that students generally work on a one-year timeline, which is
different from that of faculty and administration. Therefore they need more immediate,
tangible results that can be concluded before the students involved in the issue graduate
and leave the University. When these students leave, the working relationship that they
have developed with the administration also disappears, and the process must begin all
over again.


165




January Meeting, 2000


Mr. Elias explained that the students involved with the WRC do not want to
boycott the companies committing the violations. Rather, they want to wear the
licensed garments they manufacture to represent their pride in being Michigan students,
while at the same time they want to be proud of the companies that produce the
merchandise. They believe that organizations such as the University of Michigan for
whom the merchandise is produced have the power to change the standards for the
entire industry, and that doing so will ultimately improve the lives of the workers
around the world who make the clothing. Students believe that signing the WRC would
be a pragmatic way for the University to address the issue of sweatshop labor with little
risk and to exert national leadership on the issue.
Mr. Elias observed that a year ago, student activists involved in this issue had little
trust in the administration. Since that time, the same students have become engaged in
the systematic process employed by the University for addressing such issues. Students
have learned, therefore, that when they organize around a reasonable cause, the
administration will listen and will involve them in the process. This has resulted in the
development of a high degree of trust in the administration among student activists.
He noted that MSA is pleased with progress made so far, as long as a report can be
provided in a quick and timely manner, before the deadline of February 2. Meeting this
deadline will allow MSA to illustrate to students some concrete accomplishments that
will have been made over a one-year time frame. He noted it is important that the
administration be aware of and reflect the students' sense of urgency surrounding this
issue.  Otherwise, there is a concern that trust will fade in the administration's
commitment, students will become frustrated, and there will be a setback in the
significant improvement that has been made during the past year in the working
relationship between students and the administration.
Regent Maynard inquired about the significance of the February 2nd deadline.
Mr. Elias responded that this date emerged as a reasonable date by which a progress
report could be issued following the sit-in by student activists in President Bollinger's
office last year. He noted that the final deadline for joining the WRC is the first week
in April, when there will be a national meeting in New York City for universities to
finalize the document that will spell out the terms of the agreement. The February 2nd
deadline is necessary to allow sufficient time to finalize strategy and arrangements for
attending the convention, and it is the original date by which students have been
expecting a response.
Vice President Krislov clarified that Mr. Elias was referring to a meeting
consisting of President Bollinger, students, and himself, during which the students
requested that they receive a response by February 2nd.  President Bollinger stated
during that meeting that "we will do our best to get back to you at that time."
Regent Maynard noted that she shared the concerns of the activists and agreed
with their strategy of trying to solve the systemic problems rather than conducting a
boycott. She said she believes it is more important to reach a wise, considered decision
than to adhere to an arbitrary deadline.
Mr. Elias responded that he agreed, but that the depth of passion among students
on this issue is very great, and given students' historic skepticism of the administration,
MSA wants to avoid a confrontation. The chances of this will be improved, he said, if
the administration will send a message that "we respect and reflect your urgency."


166




January Meeting, 2000


University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Omenn
reported on several issues of significance to the health system. He noted that the
hospital is in the black financially and that patient volumes continue to rise. NIH
funding also continues to increase. He noted that Ann Arbor Township had approved
the addition of an MRI facility at the East Ann Arbor Ambulatory Care Center. He
observed that the Medical School is working hard to increase the diversity of its
students and faculty. Finally, he noted that the he and Vice President Ulaby have been
working with the University's Michigan Life Sciences Corridor partners, and that the
governor would soon announce the appointment of a 14-person steering committee.
Student Affairs.  Vice President Harper noted that there have been recent
incidents of hazing and initiation rites reported among campus fraternities and said that
these are unsafe, dangerous, and demeaning. Therefore, the University intends both to
enforce its existing policies and to implement practices to insure the safety and
well-being of students. She observed that although students say they are opposed to
these practices in the abstract, when some are involved with their peers under the sway
of their organization's traditional practices, judgment can become considerably
impaired and sometimes results in behavior that is irresponsible and harmful to others.
Vice President Harper stated that students must be held accountable for their behavior,
and the apparent gap between their thoughts and their behavior needs to be challenged
act.
To this end, and in keeping with the University's responsibility to create a safe
learning environment for all of its students, she indicated that the University intends to
examine the current anti-hazing policy and improve the policy where necessary. She
also discussed implementing an anonymous hazing hotline, strengthening our
relationships with national fraternal organizations, and exploring the optimal time for
first-year students to affiliate with fraternal organizations.
President Bollinger asked Vice President Harper to clarify the current hazing
policy. Vice President Harper observed that the Regents had adopted a broad umbrella
policy in 1982, which basically states that the University condemns hazing but leaves it
to the individual student organizations to develop enforcement procedures. The latter
task has never been completed, and there has been no enforcement of the policy. The
Code of Student Conduct mentions hazing as being offensive, but does not provide
sanctions.  Regarding off-campus behavior, Vice President Harper observed that
fraternal organizations are considered to be personal residences and the University can
only exert its authority when behavior constitutes a threat to the community.
Regent Deitch observed that the recently reported hazing incidents are abhorrent
and he supports the concept of a thoughtful investigation of approaches toward
eradicating the behavior. However, he said that it is important to point out that for the
overwhelming number of people who participate in the Greek organizations, there is a
consistency between their actions and their words. He believes the leaders of these
organizations will come to the table with the same sense of commitment to eradicating
inappropriate practices as would other student leaders with whom the Regents work.
Vice President Harper agreed, noting that the majority of students act in good
faith. She called on Mr. Adam Silver, president of the Interfraternity Council (IFC),
who reported that the IFC and the Panhellenic Association do plan on implementing
their own policy. They also plan to send letters to the parents of students who join


167




January Meeting, 2000


Greek organizations with the hope that they will get involved as well. Other measures
are also planned to reinforce the message that the Greek organizations will not tolerate
any hazing and will work with the University to enforce this. They plan to have a
policy in place by the end of the semester. He noted that IFC leaders have found that
the three most serious problems with hazing are physical and mental harm and poor
academic performance, and the policy will address these and will hold individual
organizations accountable for their actions.
Noting that a fire had recently occurred in a residence hall at Seton Hall
University, Vice President Harper commented that for the past several years the
Housing Division has been working aggressively to make sure that fire protection and
life safety issues are attended to, both in residence halls and fraternal organizations.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Interim Chancellor Klein reported that the
UM-Dearborn Wellness Center celebrated its official opening on January 14, 2000. He
also noted that on Martin Luther King Day hundreds of students had performed
community service work.
University of Michigan-Flint. Provost McLaughlin noted that UM-Flint students
had also performed community service work on Martin Luther King Day. She reported
that Chancellor Mestas has been extremely well-received by the campus community, by
alumni, and by other constituencies within the broader community.
Voluntary Support. The Regents received the Report of Voluntary Support for
December 1999.

retirement memoirs.
Charles M. Butter, Ph.D., professor of psychology, retired from active faculty
status on December 31, 1999, after a 37-year career at the University of Michigan.
Professor Butter received his A.B. degree from Harvard University in 1955 and his
Ph.D. degree from Duke University in 1959. Following a three-year appointment as a
postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health (1959-62), he came to the
University of Michigan as an assistant professor of psychology in 1962. He was
promoted to associate professor in 1965 and professor in 1968. He has held research
fellowships at Harvard University (1969-70); Oxford University (1976-77); Erasmus
University (the Netherlands; 1983-84); and the University of Florida (1986).
Professor Butter is a leading scholar in the field of brain mechanisms of attention.
His studies have illuminated the nature of deficits of visual attention that are caused by
various types of lesions of the neocortex or subcortical brain structures. A major focus
of his work has involved the perception of spatial relations and of visual objects in space
and the processing of space in relation to self, in order to clarify the neural controls that
direct attention. His research over the decades has also touched on other topics in
behavioral neuroscience and physiological psychology, ranging from associative
learning to the brain mechanisms of motivation and emotion. He is the author of over 65
research articles in peer-reviewed publications, a number of book chapters, and a book.
Currently he is at work on another book.
Professor Butter has been active in the American Psychological Association and is
a fellow of the American Psychological Association, the American Psychological
Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Within the
University, he has served on numerous committees and on the civil rights board of
SACUA. Professor Butter has mentored several generations of Ph.D. students in
biopsychology and has taught undergraduate courses in human neuropsychology and
physiological psychology.
The Regents now salute this distinguished psychologist by naming Charles M.
Butter professor emeritus of psychology.

Salaries
President Bollinger noted that the annual report of faculty and staff salaries was
being released that day.
President's Salary. Regent Deitch made the following statement:
"The Board of Regents has conducted President Bollinger's annual
performance review, as called for in his letter of engagement. During that
review, we unanimously agreed that the president's performance has been
superlative. In my judgment, there are two principle reasons for that. First,
Mr. President, you are a pleasure to work with. You lead with a unique
combination of logic, values, data, and heart. You are a person with whom one
may disagree without needing to be disagreeable.  Second, and most
importantly, you brought to your position an uncompromising commitment to
excellence which has manifested itself in a wide array of tangible achievements
and intangible benefits.
Therefore, I move that the president's annual base salary be increased
approximately 50, from $295,996 to $311,000, effective September 1, 1999,
and continuing through August 31, 2000. I would note that we are taking
action on this increase at this time in an effort to coincide with the release of the
general institutional salary schedules, all of which carry an effective date of
September 1, 1999. "
Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
President Bollinger thanked the Board, noting that he enjoys his work and feels
very fortunate to be serving as president. He thanked his wife, Jean, for her many
contributions to the University and acknowledged the spouses of the executive officers
and all of those who work in administration. He concluded by thanking the Regents for
all of their efforts on behalf of the University.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:05 a.m. The

Thursday, February 17, 2000
The Regents convened at 9:50 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Taylor, and White. Also
present were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin, Executive Vice President Kasdin,
Interim Chancellor Klein, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice
President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Interim Vice President Harper, Vice
President and General Counsel Krislov, and Vice President and Secretary Tedesco
arrived after the start of the meeting. Regents Deitch and Horning were absent.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and called on Executive Vice
President Kasdin.
Burton Tower Renovation Project
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that the Regents had previously approved
the Burton Memorial Tower Renovation Project and appointment of Quinn
Evans/Architects as designers. He noted that the architects have determined that relocating
the main entrance and maintaining the existing door as a second means of egress from
the building will be necessary for improving fire safety. He called on Mike Quinn of
Quinn Evans/Architects.
Mr. Quinn noted that the renovation was meant primarily to address improvements
in life safety features and infrastructure. He reviewed the modifications that are being
planned to address these and the inadequacy of the existing two means of egress as
well. He noted that the original windows are also going to be rehabilitated.
Following the presentation, Regent Newman moved approval of the design of the
Burton Memorial Tower Renovation Project, as presented. Regent McGowan seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Review of Capital Initiatives and Capital Projects
Fiscal Year 2001 Capital Outlay Submission. Executive Vice President Kasdin
noted that the Fiscal Year 2001 Capital Outlay submission is included in the agenda as
an information item. He emphasized that although in the coming months plans for a
number of new facilities will be put forward, the majority of resources are being
invested in rehabilitation and reuse of the existing capital plant.
1997 Master Planning Initiative. Executive Vice President Kasdin reviewed
efforts being made to implement the Master Plan initiative approved by the Regents in
1997. These include an overview of the master planning effort with a focus on concept
planning for the Palmer Drive area presented in May 1999, a discussion of central
campus facilities held in September 1999, a review of Medical Center facilities today, a
presentation on East Ann Arbor properties scheduled for Spring 2000, and a discussion
of North Campus to be held in Fall 2000. He observed how important and helpful the
conceptual framework provided by the master planning effort has been to setting
priorities for capital planning from an academic perspective.

February Meeting, 2000


Executive Vice President Kasdin announced that Marina Roeloff has been appointed
as director of plant extension and noted that the appointment of Ms. Roeloff as director
will greatly enhance the development of capital project planning over the next few years.
He also announced that from this point onward, the University will be outsourcing
construction management of many major projects, which is a departure from the past
practice of managing all projects internally.
Executive Vice President Kasdin also suggested a method for increasing the
flexibility in the process by which action requests for capital projects are brought to the
Board. Under the existing system, a series of three requests are typically made per major
project (approval of project and appointment of architect; approval of schematic design;
and authorization to present project for bids). He pointed out that time and money could be
saved by bidding some projects in segments, rather than the traditional method of not
bidding the project until all construction drawings have been substantially completed. This
process will be invoked selectively, and a rationale will be given each time plans are made
to bid this way on major projects.
Executive Vice President Kasdin also said that he intended to institute the practice
of conducting audits of certain construction projects after they have been completed,
comparing actual costs to projected costs.
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that rehabilitation of the physical plant
is financed through the infrastructure and maintenance fee assessed to students and
through the state capital outlay program. He called on Vice President Wilbanks to
describe the recently revised capital outlay process.
Capital Outlay. Vice President Wilbanks described the recent history of capital
outlay on the Ann Arbor campus. She noted that although the University submits a
request for capital outlay priority annually, the state does not fund a capital outlay
project for higher education on a yearly basis. In addition, even when the state
approves capital outlay projects for every university, the financing for these projects is
dependent upon raising the state bonding authority cap, which doesn't always occur.
She displayed a chart illustrating the capital outlay expenditures that have been
approved for the Ann Arbor Campus since 1990. These total about $200 million.
Vice President Wilbanks noted that since 1996 there have been two significant
changes in state capital outlay procedures: For the first time, universities were required
to provide a 25% match to the state's 75% funding for all projects, and the 25% match
must be spent before the state's share is applied. Secondly, in 1999 a new process for
authorizing capital outlay projects was established, requiring the development of a
five-year capital outlay "master plan" from each institution. The expectation is that all
requests for major projects will arise from this five-year comprehensive planning
document.
The new process was established to reduce the number of approvals required for
capital outlay projects. During years when capital outlay programs are authorized, the
first thing that is authorized is for project planning. This is meant to enable the
production of detailed planning documents in order to provide a firmer cost estimate
which is likely to be maintained for the term of the project's construction. She noted
that further changes to the capital outlay process are being considered by the Joint
Capital Outlay Committee.

February Meeting, 2000


Fiscal Year 2001 Capital Outlay Submission. Executive Vice President Kasdin
noted that the Dana Building renovation project has been approved and is in process. The
current top priority for funding is the School of Public Health Building. Next in priority are
the Horace H. Rackham Building renovation and Hill Auditorium renovation. The remainder
of the project priorities are designed to be flexible to adjust to state funding opportunities.
Regarding the Frieze Building, Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that
consideration is now being given to replacement, rather than renovation, of the Frieze
Building. He also said that there are a number of projects not on the capital outlay list
which will require fundraising and noted deans have been asked to consider their
academic priorities in preparation for the upcoming capital campaign.
Zina Pitcher Site and Medical Center Master Planning. Executive Vice
President Kasdin said that a recommendation for a major laboratory research facility on
the Zina Pitcher block would be presented in the coming months and observed that this
raises the question of whether construction of this type of building at that site would be
consistent with master planning underway in the rest of the medical center. He displayed
photographs, maps, and diagrams illustrating past and current uses of the Medical Campus
area. He pointed out how the Medical Campus is divided from the rest of the campus by
Huron Street and Washtenaw Avenue and the impact this dividing line has on activity
between the two campuses.
He displayed a site plan of the Palmer Drive Project Site Plan, which will include
a research laboratory building, a pedestrian bridge, and a skyway connecting the
laboratory building to the "sliver building" or "commons building," which will become
a common area containing dining facilities and meeting rooms. The medical research
laboratory building and Life Science Institute building will both be used for life science
research.
He displayed several other photographs and site plans that illustrate potential
building sites for the Medical Campus, describing the capacities of the various sites. He
noted that a strong diagonal can be created through the two Zina Pitcher blocks and into
the heart of the Medical Center. Executive Vice President Kasdin commented that there is
no recognizable sense of place from an architectural perspective on the Medical Campus,
and that one goal is to rectify this. He also noted that long-term plans include moving
traffic more around the perimeter of the Medical Campus, and this could include
closing Zina Pitcher (between Ann and Catherine Streets) and converting Glen Street
into a two-way thoroughfare. More efficient use of buses is also being examined. He
also discussed possible uses of the "Old Main" site and illustrated potential building
and parking sites on Wall Street.
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that the goal of these studies is to give the
Health System a framework for evaluating its priorities and future development options.
Regarding parking, he noted that staff are evaluating traffic and parking issues together
and are considering adding on to existing structures in addition to building new structures.
It was pointed out that most Medical Campus buildings are connected, and that they
would continue to be in the new configuration. Regent Newman noted that it is very
confusing for patients to find their way around to the various clinic and hospital sites on
the Medical Campus and to determine which structure to park in for which site. Executive
Vice President Kasdin and Executive Vice President Omenn pointed out that a


199




February Meeting, 2000


wayfinding project has been initiated, but many of the improvements have not yet been
implemented. He noted that efforts are being made to improve this situation by
including maps and other wayfinding information in appointment confirmation mailings
and phone calls, but that officials are aware that much more needs to be done with
traffic patterns, exterior signage, and interior wayfinding.
Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that the transportation and parking departments
have been combined, in an effort to get the University community to think of transportation
and parking as one system. He and Executive Vice President Omenn noted that innovative
programs, both within the University and in conjunction with the city, have been put into
place in an effort to alleviate crowding in parking structures and on thoroughfares, and
that these are beginning to have an effect.
Further discussion ensued about the chronic shortage of parking on campus. It
was noted that the addition of the Palmer Drive structure and Forest Street addition will
alleviate the situation, but that ultimately, people need to be convinced alternative
measures will be convenient and reliable enough for them to change their habits.
Improvements in bicycle security and convenience was mentioned as another option to
automobile transportation.
Medical Center Master Planning. Executive Vice President Omenn indicated
that the Kresge Medical Research Buildings would be replaced, and that a new research
laboratory building will be organized by program area. He observed that there are two
important priorities: to have clinicians and basic scientists in closer proximity to each
other and to have the Medical Campus more integrated with the rest of the University.
Medical Center officials are satisfied that building the large complex on the Zina
Pitcher site, along with the pedestrian crossways to the Palmer Drive site and commons
area to be located there will serve the second priority.
Regarding the other priority, it is expected that scientists involved in basic
research will be located in the new Zina Pitcher site, and that active clinical faculty who
also conduct research will most likely be housed in the Medical Science Buildings I and II
that have direct connections to the hospital. He noted that a complete presentation on the
facility proposed for the Zina Pitcher site will be given at the next meeting by Dean
Lichter.
Michigan Greats
Vice President Ulaby introduced two professors associated with the Office of Tax
Policy Research in the School of Business Administration: Joel Slemrod, the Paul
McCracken Collegiate Professor of Business Economics, professor of business economics
and public policy, and professor of economics; and James Hines, professor of business
economics and public policy. Professors Slemrod and Hines discussed the activities of
the Office of Tax Policy Research.
The meeting recessed at 11:35 a.m.
The meeting reconvened at 1:45 p.m. Present were President Bollinger and
Regents Brandon, Maynard, Newman, Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost
Cantor, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Interim Chancellor Klein, Chancellor Mestas,
Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President
Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Interim Vice President Harper and Vice President
and General Counsel Krislov arrived after the start of the meeting; Regent McGowan


200




February Meeting, 2000


arrived at about 2:20 p.m. Regents Deitch and Horning and Vice President Feagin were
absent.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and began consideration of the
business agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President and Secretary Tedesco submitted the minutes for the
January 2000 meeting.
Business and Finance Reports. Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted
reports of Investment, Plant Extension, and Human Resources and Affirmative Action.
Litigation Report. The Regents received the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of projects
established for January 2000. He noted that according to figures recently released by
the National Science Foundation, the University of Michigan continues to have the
largest volume of research of any U.S. college or university. He commented that all of
the funding is awarded on the basis of competitive peer review, and that the University
has a policy of not participating in "set-aside" funding.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Mr. Bram Elias, president of Michigan
Student Assembly, and Mr. Abe Rafi, chair of MSA Student Rights Commission,
addressed the Board about MSA's proposed amendments to the Code of Student Conduct.
The recommendations include having the code apply to faculty and staff as well as
students, based on MSA's perception that there are a sizable number of staff filing
charges on behalf of students who do not want to file a charge.
Regarding concerns expressed about the scope of the code, Regent Maynard
pointed out that a lot of things taking place off campus, such as in fraternity and sorority
houses, affect students and involve the University community. Mr. Rafi responded that
MSA recognizes the concern about Greek organizations, but in general, does not believe
that the code should apply to behavior occurring off campus.  Following some
discussion, it was determined that there is no real discrepancy between what the current
language says and what is desired by MSA in this regard.  President Bollinger
commented that he is in favor of exploring seriously the question of regulating hazing.
Other concerns include when and under what circumstances the code should
apply, as opposed to civil or criminal proceedings, as well as how code hearings should
be conducted and what standards of evidence should be applied. A copy of the
proposals can be found in the Regents Communication.
Following the discussion of code revision proposals, President Bollinger thanked
Mr. Elias and Mr. Rafi for the thoughtful input they had provided.
Regarding the next steps, it was noted that several other groups will be reviewing
all proposed amendments, after which they will be submitted to President Bollinger,
who can choose to either approve them or return them for further revision and
resubmission for the president's consideration.
Mr. Elias emphasized that it is difficult to disseminate information about the code
to the general student body. He also stated that although MSA is eager to participate in


201




February Meeting, 2000


the process of amending and improving the code, this does not imply that MSA
supports the idea of a code per se.
Health System Report. Executive Vice President Omenn distributed press
packets to the Regents highlighting the fact that an entire issue of the Journal of the
American    Medical Association    had   been   devoted   to  a  celebration  of the
sesquicentennial of the University of Michigan Medical School.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Interim Chancellor Klein reported that the
campus was preparing its testimony to the Michigan Senate Higher Education
Appropriations Subcommittee, at a meeting to be held on the Dearborn campus. He
also noted that the state attorney general would be the guest speaker at the campus'
annual Susan B. Anthony Awards Dinner.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas reported that all is well on the
Flint campus.

Retirement memoirs. Vice President Tedesco called attention to the retirement
of three faculty members.
Richard G. Lawton, Ph.D., professor of chemistry in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1999.
Professor Lawton received his B.S. degree from the University of California at
Berkeley in 1956. From 1956-57 he worked in Dr. Karl Folker's research group at
Merck, Sharp, and Dohm Research Laboratories in Rahway, New Jersey, and from
1957-59 he served in the U.S. Army as a chemist at Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research. In 1959 he entered graduate school at the University of Wisconsin, where he
received his Ph.D. degree in 1962. He joined the University of Michigan as an instructor
in 1962 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1964, associate professor in 1967,
and professor in 1970. He held an Arthur F. Thurnau professorship from 1993-96.
While in graduate school Professor Lawton independently conceived, accomplished,
and published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, the first example of a
ring-closure demonstrating non-classical ion pi-participation to give the bicyclic
norbomyl system. This seminal work was concurrently being pursued by Professor Paul
D. Bartlett at Harvard University.
Professor Lawton's research interests are highly varied. Early in his career at
Michigan, he developed strategies for the synthesis of strained aromatic compounds. He
synthesized the first bowl-shaped compound called corannulene that has the same carbon

February Meeting, 2000


skeleton as a portion of the framework as buckminsterfullerene or Buckyball. A
continuing interest of his research is the design, synthesis, and chemistry of reagents and
structures which serve as tools for the identification of interactions between reactive
functional groups on peptide and protein chains. This theme has had universal applications
for organic, bioorganic, and molecular biochemistry.
In the area of teaching, Professor Lawton has been an innovator and major
developer of a new curriculum for undergraduate chemistry students. He received the
University's Amoco Teaching Award in 1989 and the LS&A Excellence in Teaching
Award in 1991 and 1992, in addition to being named a Thurnau professor in 1993.
The Regents now salute this dedicated faculty member by naming Richard G.
Lawton professor emeritus of chemistry.
Sujit K. Pandit, M.D., Ph.D., professor of anesthesiology, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 1999.
Born in a small village in India, Dr. Pandit moved to Calcutta as a twelve-year-old
refugee in 1947. He received his M.B.B.S. degree from the University of Calcutta in
1959 and his M.S. degree from the University of Punjab in 1966. From 1960-67 he
pursued postgraduate training in anesthesiology in Delhi and Chandigarh, and he was a
lecturer at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGI) at
Chandigarh from 1964-67. In 1968 he went to Queen's University in Belfast, Ireland,
where he received his Ph.D. degree in anesthetics in 1971. He then returned to PGI,
serving as an associate professor of anesthesiology from 1971-73. From 1974-76 he was
an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Medical Center. He came to the
University of Michigan as an associate professor of anesthesiology in 1976 and was
promoted to professor in 1978.
Dr. Pandit has published more than 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals. As a
result of his contributions to the field of ambulatory anesthesia, the Department of
Anesthesiology is well-known at the national and international levels. The National
Society of Ambulatory Anesthesia (SAMBA) honored him by electing him president for
1997-98. He has served as the editor of Ambulatory Anesthesia, the SAMBA newsletter,
for more than 5 years. Dr. Pandit has also been known as a humble teacher, always in
quest of new knowledge. In recognition of his teaching contributions, he received the
Robert B. Sweet, M.D., Teacher of the Year Award in 1986.
Dr. Pandit has been an esteemed colleague who has encouraged and helped many
young faculty members to develop their careers as academic anesthesiologists. He has
been a role model in many ways, but the role in which he will be missed most is that of a
dedicated and compassionate physician who always taught and practiced quality patient
care. In keeping with this, following his retirement he plans to travel to India and
developing countries to promote quality care for patients as an honorary consultant.
The Regents salute this distinguished health care educator for his dedicated service
by naming Sujit K. Pandit professor emeritus of anesthesiology.
Chung-Tuo Shih, Ph.D., associate professor of mathematics in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1999.
Professor Shih received his B.A. degree from National Taiwan University in 1956
and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Washington in 1965. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor of mathematics in 1966 and was
promoted to associate professor with tenure in 1971. He has held visiting positions at
Cornell University, the University of California at San Diego, and National Taiwan
University.


222




February Meeting, 2000


During most of his career, Professor Shih has worked in the area of probabilistic
potential theory, otherwise known as the general theory of Markov Processes. This is an
outgrowth of the surprising discovery that two quite distinct branches of physics,
Brownian motion and Newtonian potential, have an intimate mathematical connection.
Some of Professor Shih's early publications have been described as among the deepest in
the field and as marking a turning point in its development. For much of his time at
Michigan, he has been the mainstay of the program in probability.
In his teaching, Professor Shih concentrated his efforts on the courses in probability
at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and was responsible for several changes
and developments in these courses.  He also frequently taught first-year courses,
particularly Math 116, and for many years was also the coordinator of this course. He
served often on the Master's Committee and as an advisor to both undergraduate and
Master's Degree students. He supervised one Ph.D. student and served on the Ph.D.
committees of many others, both in mathematics and in statistics.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Chung-Tuo Shih associate
professor emeritus of mathematics.

February Meeting, 2000


The meeting reconvened at 4:00 p.m. President Bollinger observed that there have
been a number of controversies on campus over the past several weeks, one of which
concerns students who are protesting in the tower of the Michigan Union and another
having to do with sweatshops and licensing practices at the University. He noted that
an advisory committee, chaired by Professor John Chamberlin and composed of
students and others throughout the University, had been meeting to consider the latter
issue for over a year. He noted that those discussions are ongoing, and the hope is that
there will be a prompt and reasonable resolution.
President Bollinger then read the following statement:
Statement Regarding the Tower of the Michigan Union
For the past ten days, we have been engaged in discussions with students
including the students occupying the tower of the Michigan Union. We do not
believe that occupation is the way to resolve issues within the University. In
this instance, we felt that it was in the best interests of our educational process
for the University to pursue that discussion to a reasonable resolution.
Any conversation must have starting points.  For a university, a
fundamental principle is that, with rare exceptions, students, faculty, and staff
must not be treated differently because of their beliefs or the expressions of
those beliefs. That principle has direct application to this controversy. Some
have argued that one of the societies using the Union tower space,
Michigamua, should be stripped of its University affiliation and lose its
exclusive use of that space because it has a history ofpractices that demean and
degrade Native American culture and spirituality. Under our principles it is
clear that student organizations must not be recognized or de-recognized or
suffer any other penalty because the ideas they espouse or beliefs they adhere to
are offensive, or even dangerous, to our community. I have spoken to leaders of
the groups occupying the tower, other students, andfaculty and they, too, value
this principle.
Neither viewpoints nor legacy necessarily entitle any group within the
campus to privileged space. We will address, in a neutral way, the process of
space allocation among student organizations within the University.
It must be said, again and again, that responsible membership in our
University community implies caring about the perceived impact of one's
actions on others.  Of particular importance are perceptions, however
unintended, of cultural offense and those behaviors that cause others in the
community to be excluded and under-appreciated. Whether conscious or not,
practices that negatively stereotype groups in our society cause unjust pain and
humiliation.  I believe such practices are not acceptable behaviors in a
university that values and fosters diversity. We must never take lightly the
effects of such perceptions and behaviors.
Current students of Michigamua acknowledge that its history has included
practices demeaning of Native American culture. None of us, however, can
count ourselves free of embarrassment and even shame for what we have once
believed or practiced, not even the University of Michigan.


231




February Meeting, 2000


Our students are continually reminding us of the challenge embedded in
Pascal's enduring words, inscribed on the walls of our University, "Justice and

May 1999. Under this program, 30 faculty members traveled to various communities
around the state for a period of 5 days to get acquainted with areas where many students
come from, but with which they were unfamiliar. She noted that Provost Cantor had
agreed to fund this program on a pilot basis for a 2 year period, in conjunction with the
offices of state outreach and government relations. Vice President Wilbanks observed
that all of the objectives of the program had been met during the inaugural trip, and she
was confident that the coming trip in May 2000 would be equally successful. She then
introduced Dean Earl Lewis.
Dean Lewis reported that the goals of the program are to:
* Develop among faculty an awareness of the state's distinctive geography,
economy, culture, government and politics, history, educational systems,
health and social issues;
* Learn about the communities that a majority of students call home;
* Encourage service to the public and research to address state problems;
* Show how the University of Michigan is connected to the entire state;
* Introduce faculty to areas of the state some of them might otherwise never see;
* Promote interaction among faculty across the disciplines.
Dean Lewis noted that as chair of the tour's advisory committee, he had responded
to Provost Cantor's charge of building on the University's history of connecting with
the state and its communities, and enhancing the University's academic mission by
creating new opportunities and possibilities for collaboration among faculty and
between faculty and Michigan communities. This goal was met and would become
apparent in the videotape of the 1999 trip. Dean Lewis observed that a unique feature
of the Road Scholars program was that faculty members departed from their roles as
teachers and assumed roles as students, listening to and learning from state residents.
A videotape describing the 1999 Road Scholars Tour was then shown. Following
presentation of the videotape, some of the faculty who had participated in the tour were
introduced and commented on the trip. Dean Lewis announced that as a result of this

trip, the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies has provided seed funding for
five collaborative projects involving teams of faculty and communities around the state.
President Bollinger commented that this is a terrific program and thanked the
faculty for their participation.
Comments from President Bollinger
President Bollinger commented on a number of recent awards and accolades
received by faculty and called attention to several upcoming campus events.

Michigan Student Assembly Report. Mr. Bram Elias, president of Michigan
Student Assembly, noted that his tenure as MSA president would be ending this month,
and reviewed the progress that had been made in improving communications between
MSA and the Regents under his administration. (A complete report is included in the
agenda materials.) Whereas previously, MSA issued a biannual report to the Regents
and made all other presentations during public comments, under the current system,
MSA issues a written monthly report in the Regents agenda and reports regularly to the
board as part of the consent agenda. He reviewed the topics that had been covered each
month since he took office in April 1999 and then reflected on how communications,
input, and information gathering might have been improved.
Mr. Elias commented that the notion of a student Regent was originally brought
forth because it was important to MSA that students have an opportunity to comment on
issues that affect them that might be coming up for a vote by the Regents. However,
conversations with several executive officers convinced them that this is already
possible under the current system.
To help institutionalize the process for MSA/Board of Regents interaction, Mr.
Elias presented some general principles for maximizing the effectiveness of student
input to the Board of Regents that he planned to pass on to the person who succeeds
him as president. These include providing frequent written reports to the Regents
regarding student issues via e-mail; maintaining close contact with the administration so
that students become aware of upcoming issues with as much advance notice as
possible; and improving communications with the Regents outside of Regents'
meetings so that Regents understand the context of an issue before it is presented at a
meeting.
Regarding the notion of whether there should be a student Regent, Mr. Elias noted
that students within MSA understand the arguments against it, although they and many
other students do not agree and still believe having a student Regent would be
preferred. He explained that it is difficult to make the student body understand the level


234




March Meeting, 2000


of interaction between the administration and Regents that has been achieved to date
under the current system, and he pointed out that many other institutions do have
student representatives on their board.
University of Michigan Health System Report. Executive Vice President
Omenn distributed copies of the University Record that highlighted articles about the
Health System that had recently been published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association. He also noted that the website WebMD had recently featured a live
surgery performed at the University of Michigan Hospital.
In response to a comment about a recent newspaper article highlighting the long
wait for routine mammograms at the University of Michigan Health System, Executive
Vice President Omenn said that the high demand for mammograms and other factors
related to the current managed care environment have led to this situation. He noted
that a new mammography facility has been approved for the East Ann Arbor Health
Center, and that officials are also working very hard on a number of fronts to alleviate
the situation.
Student Affairs Report. Vice President Harper reported that the students who
had been occupying the Michigan Union Tower had ended their occupation on Monday,
March 13, and that the University is continuing to work on many of the broader issues
that were raised during the protest. She also noted that staff continues to address the
issues raised by Mr. Elias during the MSA report.

March Meeting, 2000


Retirement Memoirs.     Vice President and Secretary Tedesco submitted
retirement memoirs for five faculty members.
Robert S. Holbrook, Ph.D., associate provost and professor of economics in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on
January 31, 2000.
Professor Holbrook received his A.B. degree in 1961 from the University of San
Francisco and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in 1964 and 1965, respectively, from the
University of California at Berkeley. He came to the University of Michigan as an
assistant professor of economics in 1965. He was promoted to associate professor in
1970 and professor in 1975.
Professor Holbrook specialized in the area of monetary economics.    He
distinguished himself by the outstanding quality of his research and writings, which
employed advanced techniques to shed light on issues of very practical importance. Two
of his research contributions stand out as particularly insightful and seminal. His 1972
publication, "Optimal Economic Policy and the Problem of Instrument Instability"
(American Economic Review, 62), demonstrated to the profession the existence of a
potentially significant side-effect of monetary policy and coined the term "instrument
instability" by which it has since become known. In the early days of the application of
optimal control techniques to issues of economic policy, Professor Holbrook produced a
series of outstanding papers in which he developed practical procedures for the
application of these techniques in the context of complex, non-linear, stochastic
economic models.
Professor Holbrook departed academic economics for academic administration in
the late 1970s, serving as associate dean in the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts from 1978-81. What was initially to have been a quick stint of service turned into a
nearly two-decade-long career of exceptional distinction, in which economics lost
someone special, to the benefit of the entire University community. In 1981, Professor
Holbrook was appointed associate vice president for academic affairs in the Office of the
Vice President for Academic Affairs. He served in a number of administrative
appointments, including interim vice president for academic affairs, interim provost, and
associate provost. In addition to his distinguished academic career, Professor Holbrook
will be remembered for his major contributions to the development and restructuring of
the University of Michigan budget.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Robert S. Holbrook
professor emeritus of economics.
George W. Jourdian, Ph.D., professor of internal medicine and professor of
biological chemistry in the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 1999.
Professor Jourdian received his B.A. degree from Amherst College in 1951, his
M.S. degree from the University of Massachusetts in 1953, and his Ph.D. degree from
Purdue University in 1958. From 1958-61, he undertook postdoctoral training at the
University of Michigan Rackham Arthritis Research Unit. He joined the faculty as an
instructor in the Department of Biological Chemistry in 1961. He was promoted to
assistant professor in 1963, associate professor in 1965, and professor in 1974.
Professor Jourdian's work has focused on the biochemistry of glycoproteins and
carbohydrates and the relationship of carbohydrate-containing macromolecules to the
biology of cartilage. He is best known for discovering the phosphomannosyl receptor, a
molecule that controls the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes between intracellular and


245




March Meeting, 2000


extracellular compartments. This discovery, reported in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Science in 1981, is a landmark achievement. Professor Jourdian has also
developed a method of culture of chondrocytes in alginate beads that simulates the
microenvironment of cartilage.  This technique has been adopted by investigators
worldwide.
Professor Jourdian has been a respected and effective teacher of graduate and
professional students. His expertise in the biochemistry of glycoconjugates has been
sought by colleagues throughout the University and indeed, throughout the world. He
served on the editorial board of the Journal of Biological Chemistry for five years and on
the Physiological Sciences Study Section of the National Institutes of Health. He has
held several positions as an officer in the Society for Glycobiology and was president of
this group from 1987-89. In 1989, he organized the meeting of the Society for Complex
Carbohydrates which was held in Ann Arbor that year.
Throughout his career, Professor Jourdian has continued to personally conduct
experiments in his laboratory, rather than be content to direct the efforts of technicians
and students. He has been a role model for young scientists in training for over three decades.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming George W.
Jourdian professor emeritus of internal medicine and professor emeritus of biological
chemistry.
December 31, 1999, after nineteen years of service.
Born in Seoul, Korea, Ms. Lee received her B.S. degree from Korea University in
1963, her M.S. degree from Mississippi State University in 1966, and her M.L.S. degree
from the University of California at Berkeley in 1968. Ms. Lee worked in a number of
libraries before joining the University of Michigan in 1977 as a research assistant in the
Division of Research Development and Administration (DRDA). She moved to the
University Library in 1978 and worked as an assistant, then associate librarian in the
Undergraduate Library until 1981. She joined the staff of the Engineering Library as an
assistant librarian in 1984. She was promoted to associate librarian in 1988 and senior
associate librarian in 1997.
Within the Engineering Library, Ms. Lee took on the challenging duties of
selection, reference, and departmental liaison for one of the most prestigious professional
schools in the country. Over the years, Ms. Lee's role within the Engineering Library
grew. She supervised the Technical Processing Unit and oversaw the coordination of
collection development. She was the University Library's representative to the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office.   Later, when the Engineering Library merged its
operations into the Media Union Library, Ms. Lee was named the head of collection
management. As such, she was responsible for the fund management of the Media
Union Library's 1.9 million-dollar materials budget. Her patient and impartial handling
of collection issues allowed her to work with selectors in both engineering and the arts.
Ms. Lee has been active on a variety of committees. Most notable has been her chairing
of the Media Union Library's E-resources Team. Through her contributions, she has
significantly helped the library in the transition from paper to digital resources.
Her colleagues in the University Library and the College of Engineering will miss
Ms. Lee's dedication to service and her gracious manner.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming Theresa S. Lee
senior associate librarian emerita.

March Meeting, 2000


Carl H. Rinne, Ph.D., associate professor of education at the University of
Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1999.
Professor Rinne received his A.B. degree from DePauw University in 1957 and his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University in 1963 and 1967, respectively. From
1967-70, he was an assistant professor at the University of Chicago and principal of the
University High School.  In 1970, he was appointed education director of the
Environmental Simulation Laboratory, School of Natural Resources, on the Ann Arbor
campus. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan-Flint in 1972 as assistant
professor of education and was promoted to associate professor in 1975.
An innovator in the area of classroom management, Professor Rinne coined the
term "low profile" teaching methods in teacher education literature. He demonstrated in
his own teaching and public lectures just how effectively skilled teachers can focus
student attention on lesson content automatically, without coercion or distraction. His
two published textbooks, Attention: The Fundamentals of Classroom Control (1984) and
Excellent Classroom Management (1997) elucidate low profile methodology for teachers
at all levels of instruction.
In 1991, Professor Rinne invented a futuristic training technology called the Skills
System which has been used to train pre-service teachers on the Flint campus and
graduate teaching assistants on the Ann Arbor campus. During his years on the
University of Michigan-Flint faculty, Professor Rinne created and taught courses in
classroom management, ethical issues in public administration, leadership theory and
practice, and instruction gaming and simulation.
Professor Rinne has served on numerous departmental and University committees,
including chair of the graduate board on two different occasions. He was instrumental in
establishing a chapter of the American Association of University Professors on the Flint
campus, and he has long been a member of the American Educational Research
Association and the American Society for Public Administration.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Carl H. Rinne associate
professor emeritus of education.
James C. Sisson, M.D., professor of internal medicine, Division of Nuclear
Medicine, Medical School, retired from active faculty status on March 15, 2000, after an
outstanding career as a clinician, teacher, and researcher.
Born in Tecumseh, Michigan, Dr. Sisson received his B.S. and M.D. degrees from
the University of Michigan in 1951 and 1954, respectively. From 1954-58, he received
postgraduate training in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of
Michigan Hospitals. After serving as a captain in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from
1958-60, he joined the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School as an
instructor in 1960. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1963, associate professor
in 1967, and professor in 1972.
Very early, Dr. Sisson established an outstanding reputation in the new specialty of
nuclear medicine, introducing new uses for radioisotopes in the diagnosis and
therapeutics of thyroid and adrenal disorders. He attracted patient referrals from distant
medical centers and contributed important publications as a leader in the diagnosis of
benign and malignant diseases of endocrine organs. At the same time, he filled an
important teaching role with medical students and house officers who graded him highly
as a model physician. In 1991, the Michigan Chapter of the American College of
Physicians honored him with their prestigious Laureate Award. Dr. Sisson's reputation
as one of the top care-giving physicians in nuclear meicine was reflected by his recent
listing in the publication, Best Doctors ofAmerica.


247




March Meeting, 2000


The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated service
by naming James C. Sisson professor emeritus of internal medicine.
Memorial Statements.   Vice President and Secretary Tedesco submitted a
memorial statement for Professor Clarence Chrisp.
Clarence Chrisp, D.V.M., professor of comparative veterinary pathology, died of
pancreatic cancer on February 8, 2000, following a seven-month period of illness under
the loving care of his wife, Rosalind.
Professor Chrisp was born on May 26, 1934, on his grandfather's cattle ranch near
Broken Bow, Nebraska. He first attended college at Colorado A&M, then transferred to
Iowa State. In need of additional funds, he took a break to teach in one-room schools in
Nebraska and Idaho. He then enrolled in the University of Idaho, where he received his
B.S. degree in microbiology. He earned his M.S. degree in veterinary microbiology
from Washington State University and his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree at the
University of California at Davis in 1967. From 1967-69, he taught at the University of
Michigan Medical School. He then returned to the University of California at Davis to
continue his studies in veterinary pathology. While there, he co-authored two articles in
the journal Science on the mutagenetic nature of fly ash. In 1980, he took a position with
the Battelle Corporation in Westerville, Ohio. In 1982, he returned to the University of
Michigan Medical School, Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine.
Professor Chrisp provided training in pathology to veterinarians in the Unit for
Laboratory Animal Medicine's postdoctoral training program in comparative medicine.
Many leaders in the field of laboratory animal medicine learned about the pathology of
the many species used in research by sitting across from him at the teaching microscope.
In his role as a pathologist, he also made significant contributions to studies on cancer
and aging in laboratory rodents and, more recently, to the understanding of the
pathobiology of genetically modified mice.
Professor Chrisp had a lifelong interest in bird watching; at the time of his death he
had documented seeing at least 700 species of birds. Through the outreach program of
the Memorial Christian Church, where he was an active member, he became involved in
a medical mission project, making two separate journeys to Vietnam to assist with
setting up a clinic.
Professor Chrisp is survived by Rosalind Chrisp, his wife of 39 years, as well as
his sister, June Stone; his brother, Jerry Chrisp; his sons, Bruce and Eric; and his
daughters-in-law, Laura and Anna.
Degrees. President Bollinger submitted the following recommendations for
recipients of honorary degrees for the Spring 2000 Commencement: William Ferris,
Doctor of Humane Letters; David Halberstam, Doctor of Humane Letters; David
Hermelin, Doctor of Laws; Bernice Johnson Reagon, Doctor of Music; Lawrence
Kasdan, Doctor of Humane Letters; and Martinus Veltman, Doctor of Science. He
noted that David Halberstam would be the speaker at the undergraduate exercises and
that Bernice Johnson Reagon would speak at the University graduate exercises.

review by the commission. Provost Cantor pointed out that the commission will be


255




March Meeting, 2000


studying all aspects of student life at the University. Its work will include an analysis
of the local rental housing market, determining whether the number of miles away from
campus that students are living has increased, parking issues, and residence hall

APRIL MEETING, 2000


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, April 13, 2000
The Regents convened at 1:45 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin, Interim Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Interim Chancellor Klein, Vice
President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President
Omenn, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent Deitch was absent.
Comments from President Bollinger
Vice President for Communications. President Bollinger called the meeting to
order and announced that he would be recommending the appointment of Lisa Rudgers
as vice president for communications. He noted that she is a person of extraordinary
talent, and that her fundamental goal will be to make sure that University issues and
identity are accurately and honestly presented.
Gift from Richard and Susan Rogel. President Bollinger announced that
Richard and Susan Rogel had committed $22 million for financial aid, which is the
largest gift for financial aid in the history of the University and "an outstanding act of
generosity." He observed that Richard Rogel has played many different roles at the
University, including his current service as president of the Alumni Association and
member of the Commission on Undergraduate Education and has given gifts to a wide
variety of schools, colleges, and programs. He noted that this gift also establishes a
high standard for the upcoming capital campaign, as it will help communicate the needs
and fundraising potential for the University.
Provost Cantor commented that it is becoming more difficult for the University of
Michigan to compete for students, because many instate students receive aid packages
from outstate institutions and there is fierce competition for nonresident students. She
noted that the Commission on Undergraduate Education has identified financial aid for
both undergraduate and graduate students as a critical need.
President Bollinger indicated that the University hopes to reach beyond the $1.4
billion total raised in the last capital campaign during the upcoming campaign. He
recognized the special efforts of Associate Vice President Chacona Johnson with regard
to the recent gift from the Rogels.
Symposium: "After the Fall: Vietnam Plus Twenty-five." President Bollinger
commented that in conjunction with the recent release of a number of previously
classified documents having to do with the end of the Vietnam War, the Gerald R. Ford
Library had recently sponsored a symposium to consider the legacy of the Vietnam
War. He noted that speakers at the conference had praised the Regents' action in
naming the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy for President Ford, and that there
would be a formal celebration of this action in September 2000.


257




April Meeting, 2000


Course on gay culture. President Bollinger noted that there had been significant
publicity surrounding the introduction of a course on gay culture to be offered by the
Department of English. He said that "It is the role of a university to think about what it
means to be human —to think about the physical world and the human world and what it
means to be human, and this course is one facet of that study." He noted that over the
past 20 years one intellectual interest has been to think about popular culture and the
way in which people create their identity in the world, and that this course follows that
tradition. He noted that "we believe this course has academic value and that the process
by which it was been created is sound."
The Naked Mile. President Bollinger observed that University officials have
mounted an extensive public relations campaign in an effort to discourage students from
participating in the "Naked Mile," slated to be held on the evening of the last day of
classes.  He emphasized that the University does not condone this activity and
encourages students not to participate.
Space allocation for student organizations. President Bollinger noted that a
panel had been appointed to make recommendations about the allocation of space for
student organizations, and its report would be issued within the next few days.
Media Rights Across the Campus
Provost Cantor introduced Professor James Hilton, special assistant to the provost
for media rights, who has been assigned the task of looking at the implications of new
media on campus, especially with respect to intellectual property rights, copyrights, and
fair use issues and policies. She also indicated that the Office of the General Counsel
and the Office of the Vice President for Research were collaborating with the Office of
the Provost in the examination of these issues.
Professor Hilton explained that intellectual property rights issues arise in the
classroom and in publishing on the Internet and in many other settings across the
University where the use of multimedia is prevalent.  He explained the purpose of
copyright, noting that owning a work has nothing to do with copyright and that it
protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. He observed that copyright
happens at the moment of creation, so that the majority of works are protected by
copyright.
Professor Hilton noted that copyright has become a major issue because of
increased visibility and the prevalence of technology, which by its nature requires that
ideas be copied electronically in order to be accessed. The commodification of
information and academic tradition and economics has also made intellectual property
an important issue.  He pointed out that as creators, users, and distributors of
copyrighted material, universities are in a unique position to address the balance among
these interests.
He concluded by describing activities being undertaken at the University of
Michigan in this regard, including engaging the University community in conversations
about these issues, coordinating the delivery of services, and documenting current
policies and developing new policies to address any gaps.
Regent Newman requested that there be a follow-up presentation on this and other
intellectual property issues. President Bollinger thanked Professor Hilton and said that
he would be invited back in the near future to continue this discussion.


258




April Meeting, 2000


Campus Development in Support of the Life Sciences Initiatives
President Bollinger reviewed the work of the Life Sciences Commission and
emphasized that they laid the foundation on how to proceed with developing initiatives
in the life sciences at the University. A number of steps have been taken, including the
hiring of additional faculty, the development of an expanded undergraduate curriculum
in life sciences, the development of an interdisciplinary program in bioinformatics, and
the enhancement of biomedical engineering. The next stage is the development of the
physical structures to support the academic initiatives.
President Bollinger introduced Professor Jack Dixon, chair of the Life Sciences
Advisory Committee. Professor Dixon praised the Regents for their courage and
foresight in supporting the establishment of a life sciences initiative at the University of
Michigan, noting that this early support enabled the University to have a number of
advantages over its competitors. He noted that the advisory committee is currently
considering candidates for director of the Life Sciences Institute and pointed out that
the publicity garnered in soliciting candidates has led to the University being widely
recognized for its efforts nationally and internationally.
Professor Dixon observed that another goal of the program was to construct a new
research facility that would link the Medical School and the main campus both
physically and intellectually. This building would house the scientists who work in life
sciences areas whose goal is to interact in a synergistic way. He said the committee had
spent months working with the architects planning the inside of the building, which will
be state-of-the-art and flexible in the kinds of laboratories that can be set up. The
design will maximize interactions among various groups and among scientists within
those groups. Professor Dixon concluded that this facility represents a milestone in that
it will provide a physical representation of the efforts being undertaken in the life
sciences.
President Bollinger noted that the University needs to take long term views of such
investments. At times such as this, when the world is changing in terms of research and
teaching to the extent and scope that is now being seen, the University has to have the
courage to make a commitment early and to be willing to stay in over the long haul,
despite any setbacks that might occur along the way. He noted that it is important to
maintain the current pace in developing the physical space necessary to achieve these
goals so as to be able to recruit top scientists.
Dean Allen Lichter noted that the Regents had toured the Kresge Medical
Research Buildings and had discussed research needs in the Medical School. He cited
three reasons for construction of a new facility on the current site of the Kresge Medical
Research Buildings: 1) the need to replace the Kresge buildings; 2) the need for the
Medical School to be an active participant in the life sciences initiative by creating
buildings that will arise simultaneously with the Life Sciences Institute; and 3) the fact
that there are no facilities currently available to accommodate needed growth in the
Medical School.
Dean Lichter pointed out that although the Medical School is one of the leading
institutions in terms of the amount spent on research and development, five of the top
ten research institutions are growing at a rate substantially faster than the University of
Michigan. In order to retain its leadership position, the University must increase its
research expenditures in all areas. With life sciences research accounting for 50 percent


259




April Meeting, 2000


of total research expenditures, however, growth in total research expenditures is
dependent upon growth in life sciences research, and the new buildings will make this
possible.
Executive Vice President Kasdin reiterated the three-step process by which construction
projects are reviewed by the Regents, noting that the four projects to be considered at
this meeting as part of the life sciences initiative are in different stages of development.
He pointed out the location of each building on a campus site plan.
Life Sciences Institute Building
Executive Vice President Kasdin introduced Mr. Victor Cordone, partner in the
Smith Group, architects for the interior of the Life Sciences Institute Building. Mr.
Cordone displayed diagrams of the proposed interior of the building, which will consist
of six stories plus a seventh floor that will house mechanical equipment. He said that it
will be 230,000 gross square feet, with the first floor (underground level) housing
animals and the second floor (ground level) consisting of mechanical space and
building services. He displayed schematic designs of floors three-six, noting that the
third floor will house the director's office suite and laboratory as well as space for
visiting scientists and will be the most "public" floor, and the remaining floors will
contain the majority of the laboratory space.  The goal is to create flexible,
state-of-the-art, laboratory space in the building.
Next, Robert Venturi of Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates described plans for
the exterior of the building. He noted that the approach would be to retain the look of
the traditional loft buildings found in a number of locations on the central campus. He
showed examples of the building materials that are being considered for the exterior.
Responding to a question from Regent McGowan about the impact that this
complex will have on the view as seen from automobiles driving on Washtenaw
Avenue toward Huron Street, Mr. Venturi stated that there will be an appealing variety
among the complex of buildings with a harmonious connection among buildings. The
quality will derive from variety as opposed to consistency.
Regent Newman inquired about the source of funds for each building. Executive
Vice President Kasdin clarified that of the four buildings under consideration, the Life
Sciences Institute Building is being funded by the $200 million from Hospital reserves
authorized by the Regents, and that construction will not begin until the design is
complete. Funding for the Commons Building will come either from gifts or from
central administration; the parking structure will be funded by parking revenue; and the
Zina Pitcher project will be funded by the Medical School. Executive Vice President
Kasdin noted that there is a strict policy with regard to funding for building projects:
either the money needs to be in the account; or auxiliary activities operations that have
certain types of revenue can be debt-financed; or if the project is identified by the
provost as so important to the University it is financed with a debt obligation from the
General Fund. He emphasized that all of the building projects will be returned to the
Regents for approval with financing plans in place before being put out to bid.
Medical Research Laboratory Facility Project
Regent McGowan moved approval of the Medical School's Medical Research
Laboratory Facility Project. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.


260




April Meeting, 2000


Palmer Drive Commons Building Project
Regent McGowan moved approval of the Palmer Drive Commons Building
Project and authorized commissioning SmithGroup, Inc., and Venturi, Scott Brown and
Associates, Inc., as architects/engineers. Regent Newman seconded the motion.
President Bollinger observed that the way in which this combination of buildings
interact with and affect the community have been part of the planning from the very
beginning. The University understands that these structures will be located on a route that
many Ann Arbor citizens take hundreds of times in any given year and therefore they
have an important effect on the community. He noted that University officials have a
policy of communicating with city leaders about any campus projects that will have an
impact on the community.  In some cases, such as Michigan Stadium and Hill
Auditorium, use of University facilities by the broader public is such that they require
even broader engagement with the community.
Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that the University has made a
commitment to the community to engage it in the University's master planning process
as it unfolded. To that end, the Ann Arbor community as well as the Regents have been
presented with the three of the five phases of the master planning effort that have now
been completed. He observed that the University receives good ideas from community
members and that it will continue to seek community input. Although there has been
excellent cooperation on the staff level for years between city and University officials
on many projects, Executive Vice President Kasdin pointed out that more recently,
community leaders have experienced that their input is really valued at the senior levels
of administration at the University.
President Bollinger concluded that these buildings are important to University
faculty and staff as members of the Ann Arbor community and have been discussed over a
long period of time. Discussions will continue as more detailed design plans become
available.
The vote was then taken and the motion was approved unanimously.
Life Sciences Institute Building
Regent McGowan moved approval of the schematic design of the Life Sciences
Institute Building. Regent Maynard seconded the motion and it was approved, with
Regents Brandon, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and Taylor in favor and
Regent White opposed.
Palmer Drive Parking Structure Project
Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that a firm budget has been established for
this project and that its expected completion date is early winter of 2002. On a motion
by Regent White, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents unanimously approved
the Palmer Drive Parking Structure Project design and authorized issuing the project for
bids and awarding a construction contract.
Executive Vice President Kasdin thanked the architects, Dean Lichter, and
Professor Dixon for their efforts in bringing these projects to fruition. President
Bollinger thanked everyone who had worked on the projects, commenting "There is, in
my view, genius behind this broad conception of how to use this space, and we really
appreciate it. This is a great moment for the University."


261




April Meeting, 2000


ROTC
Regent Newman reported that the LS&A curriculum committee had recently
approved three ROTC courses to receive LS&A credit. She said that she and Regent
White appreciate the efforts of the LS&A faculty in bringing this about, noting that it
will enable ROTC students to graduate in four years instead of four-and-a-half years.
Regent White associated herself with Regent Newman's comments, noting that having
participated in ROTC on a no-credit basis herself, she could appreciate how meaningful
this action would be for ROTC students.
Regent White left the meeting at this point, at 3:20 p.m.

Report and Recommendations of the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on Tobacco
Investments
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted for information the report and
recommendations of the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on Tobacco Investments.
Appointment of Auditors for 1999-00
On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors for
1999-00.
Implementation of the Regents' Policy on Research Grants, Contracts, and
Agreements, FY99
Vice President Ulaby submitted the annual report on implementation of the
Regents' Policy on Research Grants, Contracts, and Agreements, FY99.
Regents' Meeting Schedule for 2001
Regent Horning moved approval of the proposed Regents' Meeting schedule for
2001. Regent Newman seconded the motion.
Regent Newman proposed consideration of changing to a one-day meeting
schedule, to be held all day on Thursday, rather than the current Thursday
afternoon/Friday morning schedule, with Public Comments to be held in the late
morning prior to breaking for lunch. Regent Horning expressed support for this notion.
Regent Maynard commented that she preferred the flexibility of having the
two-day period on the schedule, with the decision on whether a meeting would last one
or two days would be decided on a case-by-case basis.
President Bollinger commented that there are times when the overnight period
provided by the two-day meeting schedule becomes useful for reflection prior to acting
on items raised Thursday afternoon or during Public Comments. He noted that there are
times when more can be accomplished over a two-day period than when a meeting is
condensed into one day, but that the administration continues to work to make meetings
as efficient as possible.
Regent Brandon expressed support for a meeting that would last one full day.
Regent McGowan observed that arrangements for meetings occurring over two
days allows time for board members to come to campus and accomplish more than
would be the case with a one-day-only meeting, and this time spent on campus is
important to the campus community. Regent Maynard pointed out that the free time on
Thursday morning allowed by the current schedule gives Regents the opportunity to
meet with people and to learn more about the University.
It was decided that it would be advisable to have all Regents present in order to
resolve this issue. Regent Newman moved to amend the current motion so as to table
the item until next month. Regent Horning seconded the motion, and it was approved,
with Regents Brandon, Horning, Maynard, Newman, and Taylor in favor and Regent
McGowan opposed.

in the city of Flint, and both the University and the community would be very pleased
by honoring Mr. White in this fashion. Regent Maynard moved approval of naming the
Professional Studies and Classroom Building at the University of Michigan-Flint the
William S. White Building. Regent Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.

April Meeting, 2000


The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Kenneth J. DeWoskin
professor emeritus of Chinese language and literature and professor emeritus of
business administration.
Tsung Yen Na, Ph.D., professor of mechanical engineering in the College of
Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, will retire
from active faculty status on April 30, 2000, after 36 years of dedicated service as a
teacher and scholar.
Professor Na received his B.S. degree from National Taiwan University in 1955, his
M.S. degree from the University of Houston in 1960, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Michigan in 1964. He joined the faculty of the University of
Michigan-Dearborn as an assistant professor of mechanical engineering in 1964 and was
promoted to associate professor in 1966 and professor in 1969. He held the William E. Stirton
Professorship in Mechanical Engineering from 1984-89.
Professor Na was recognized for his dedication to teaching and for the clarity of his
lectures. A very versatile teacher, he offered a wide range of courses, including
undergraduate courses in turbomachinery, fluid mechanics, and design of thermal
systems and graduate courses in engineering analysis, conduction heat transfer,
convection heat transfer, viscous flow theory, and dynamics and thermodynamics of
compressible flow. He also served the University in a variety of ways, including as a
member of the graduate committee, executive committee, faculty search committees, and
mechanical engineering chair search committee.
Professor Na has achieved a reputation as a world class scholar. His publications
include 3 books (Computational Methods in Engineering Boundary Value Problems,
Academic Press, 1979; Perturbation Methods in Heat Transfer, Hemisphere, 1982; and
Group Invariance in Engineering Boundary Value Problems, Springer-Verlag, 1985)
and over 140 research papers in technical journals.  These works have been
well-received by researchers and practicing engineers alike and have been
widely-recognized and referred to by his peers.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Tsung Yen Na professor
emeritus of mechanical engineering.
Memorials. Vice President Tedesco submitted memorial statements for two
faculty members, Arthur F. Coxford, Jr., and Jonathan Raz.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with great sadness the
death on March 5, 2000, of Arthur F. Coxford, Jr., professor of mathematics education.
Born in Holland, Michigan, Professor Coxford received his B.A. degree in
mathematics, summa cum laude, from Albion College in 1959, and his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from the University of Michigan in 1960 and 1965, respectively. He taught
mathematics at Lawrence University in Wisconsin from 1960-62 and at University High
School from 1962 until it closed in 1969. He joined the faculty of the University of
Michigan School of Education in 1965 and was promoted to professor of mathematics
education in 1973.
Professor Coxford was a devoted and much-beloved teacher and mentor and a
valued colleague and a friend. He was known as a scholar's scholar and a person of great
fairness and integrity. He was co-author with his longtime friend and colleague, Joseph
Payne, of several editions of well-known high school mathematics texts published by
Harcourt Brace. As a writer with the Core Plus Mathematics Project and co-author of
the book Geometry, A Transformational Approach, he was at the forefront of innovative
reform efforts to improve the quality of mathematics teaching and learning. He was very


276




April Meeting, 2000


active in preparing teachers of mathematics and hundreds of his students have gone on to
successful teaching careers. At Michigan, he was a strong supporter of undergraduate
teacher education and served as director of the teacher education program. Active in
mathematics and mathematics education organizations at the state and national levels,
Professor Coxford was recognized for his leadership qualities. He was president of the
Michigan Council of Teachers of Mathematics and served on many MCTM and
Michigan Department of Education committees. At the national level, his work with the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics included service as chair of the
publications committee, author and editor of the yearbooks, journal reviewer, and other
committees. He was also president of the national organization, School Science and
Mathematics Association.
We join Professor Coxford's wife, Diane, and two daughters, Anne McIntosh and
Cynthia Tyner, their spouses and children, in mourning the loss of our dear colleague. He
was a beautiful person and a wonderful colleague and friend, and will be sorely missed.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with great sadness the loss
of Jonathan Raz, Ph.D., associate professor of biostatistics, who passed away unexpectedly
on February 23, 2000, from complications of a systemic bacterial infection.
Professor Raz received his B.S. degree in statistics and his Ph.D. degree in biostatistics
from the University of California at Berkeley and joined the faculty of the University of
Michigan as an assistant professor in 1991. He was promoted to associate professor with
tenure in 1995. Professor Raz left Michigan in 1999 to assume a faculty position at the
University of Pennsylvania, but retained an appointment without salary at Michigan and
continued to supervise doctoral students and collaborate with colleagues here.
Professor Raz was internationally renowned for his innovative research on
statistical methods for the analysis of repeated-measures data, biomedical signals and
images. His research papers appeared in the top scholarly journals in statistics and
electrical engineering and were widely cited for their depth and rigor. His research was
very interdisciplinary in nature and attracted external research funding from NSF and
NIH. Professor Raz was a dedicated teacher and a very clear expositor of complex ideas.
He was rigorous in his demands on students but also very sympathetic to their needs and
interested in their welfare. He introduced a number of courses to the biostatistics
graduate program on time series and repeated measures analysis, which added important
dimensions to the teaching program. Because of his strong leadership and innovations as
chair of the Ph.D. Candidacy Committee in Biostatistics, the department is henceforth
naming the award for outstanding student performance on the Ph.D. qualifying exam the
Jonathan Raz Award.
Professor Raz loved to debate the issues of the day in statistics with his colleagues
and students. He was an enthusiastic, energetic person with wide-ranging interests.
Besides his work in statistics, he also wrote science fiction and poetry and enjoyed
astronomy, art, and classical music. He was also a devoted family man who loved to
spend time with his beloved wife Jennifer and make up bedtime stories for his two
delightful daughters, Amelie and Abigail. He will be sorely missed by his many friends
at Michigan and throughout the statistical community.
Degrees. Provost Cantor submitted for approval the doctoral degree list for the
April 2000 commencement, the final degree list for the December 1999 Law School
commencement, and changes to previously approved degree lists.
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by
Regent Taylor, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Regents of the University of Michigan, as
follows:
1. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Notes of the Issuer, in
multiple issuances on various dates, to be designated REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, SERIES C, in the aggregate principal amount outstanding from time
to time as shall be designated by any two Authorized Officers, but not in excess of $170,000,000, to be
dated as of a date of issuance of each Note, or otherwise as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer,
for the purpose of financing and refinancing all or part of the Projects (including refunding the Prior
Notes), and to pay all or part of the costs incidental to the issuance of the Notes. The Projects as a whole
are hereby determined by the Issuer to constitute a single governmental purpose of the Issuer. The Notes
shall not be subject to redemption prior to maturity. Each Note shall mature not later than 270 days after
its date of issuance, as shall be determined as provided in the Issuance Certificate and Paying Agent
Agreement, and all Notes must mature on or before the date three years after the date of issuance of the
first Notes hereunder. Interest on each Note shall be payable on the maturity date thereof, at the rate, not

on deposit in the Note Payment Fund created pursuant to the Issuance Certificate, as provided therein.
The Notes shall also be payable from Available Investments, as provided in the Issuance Certificate. The
Issuer shall covenant in the Issuance Certificate that so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, the
Issuer will not issue any new series of Senior Lien Indebtedness.
In support of its obligation to repay the Notes, the Issuer may, if deemed appropriate by an
Authorized Officer, enter into a letter of credit, line of credit, note purchase agreement or other liquidity

the Liquidity Facility shall be a limited and not general obligation of the Issuer, payable from General
Revenues, and may be secured by a pledge of General Revenues. The Authorized Officers are, or any
one of them is, authorized to negotiate, execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, such
agreement or agreements (the "Liquidity Agreement") as an Authorized Officer may deem appropriate to

under the Liquidity Agreement, or any claim based thereon against the State of Michigan, or, except as
provided in the Issuance Certificate and the Liquidity Agreement, the Issuer, or against any officer or
agent of the Issuer or of the University, as individuals, either directly or indirectly, nor shall the Notes
and interest with respect thereto nor the obligations under the Liquidity Agreement, become a lien on or
be secured by any property, real, personal or mixed of the State of Michigan, the Issuer, or the
University, other than the General Revenues and the moneys from time to time on deposit in the Note
Payment Fund created by the Issuance Certificate.
3. The right is reserved to issue additional bonds, notes or other obligations payable from and
secured by General Revenues on a parity basis with the Notes as to the lien on General Revenues, but

bank to be Issuing and Paying Agent, and one or more Dealers, and any two of the Authorized Officers
are authorized and directed, in the name of the Issuer and as its corporate act and deed, to negotiate,

with applicable law, the Offering Memorandum, as the same may have been updated or supplemented
from time to time, in the offering, sale and delivery of the Notes.

observed that Dr. Little was a distinguished scholar and administrator and welcomed
him to the campus. A round of applause followed.

May Meeting, 2000


Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established for April, 2000.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Hideki Tsutsumi, president of MSA,
reported on projects underway during the summer months. These include a voter
registration drive and creation of a website listing required textbooks that would be
completed before classes start so that students can save money by purchasing books
online. He introduced Siafa Hage, treasurer of MSA. Mr. Hage reviewed activities
planned for the next academic year, which include continuing with the voter registration
drive; increasing lobbying efforts in Lansing and Washington; making student
organizations aware of funding available from sources other than MSA; and continuing
to work on the club sports initiative. He concluded that MSA also plans to continue to
foster a positive relationship with the administration. President Bollinger responded
that he is looking forward to working with MSA.
Communications to the Board. President Bollinger submitted a memorandum
from the Arthur Miller Theatre Advisory Committee in support of the proposed
Walgreen Drama Center and the Arthur Miller Theatre. He noted that Charles and Jean
Walgreen have been tremendous friends of the University in many different areas.
They have given $11.3 million towards this project, and a bequest of $5 million from
another source will also be designated for it, bringing total gifts to $16.3 of the
approximate $18 million total project cost.
President Bollinger observed that Arthur Miller, one of the greatest playwrights of
our time, is devoted to the University of Michigan and is greatly in favor of a theatre
being named in his honor. He distributed copies of a handwritten postcard from Mr.
Miller expressing that "The theatre is a lovely idea. I've resisted similar proposals from
others but it seems right from Ann Arbor." President Bollinger noted that this "is a
linkage between the University and a great, great figure of our time that we do not want
to let pass by."
President Bollinger observed that there is currently more demand for theatre space
than there is supply at the University, and this demand will not be met even once the
Arthur Miller Theatre has been completed. The idea is to create a complex of theatres,
including the Power Center at 1400 seats, the Arthur Miller Theatre at 600-800 seats,
and an experimental theatre at 100 seats, along with facilities that would provide other
forums for education and research. President Bollinger observed that the plan for the
theatre complex and the programming for the various theatres, including co-productions
with other regional theatres, was developed with assistance of Professor Emeritus John
Russel Brown, a renowned authority in this area. He also noted that the University
Musical Society has recently begun to integrate its offerings with the educational
activities of the University, and that next year for the first time in many years it will be
developing a theatre program. The signature event of this program will involve the
Royal Shakespeare Company, which will be in residence in March and will stage three
of Shakespeare's historical plays in addition to holding classes and workshops. He
observed that the potential of the Arthur Miller Theatre was important to the Royal
Shakespeare Company's decision to develop a long-term relationship with the
University.

May Meeting, 2000


President Bollinger called attention to the memorandum from the faculty advisory
committee endorsing the Arthur Miller Theatre and the theatre complex. He noted that
building the University's reputation in the area of cultural activities is as important as
creating venues in the various schools and colleges that are meant to draw visitors from
across the world to the campus.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Omenn
reported on a number of activities and events underway in the Health System.
Student Affairs. There was no report from the Office of the Vice President for

University   of Michigan-Dearborn.        President Bollinger thanked     Interim
Chancellor Klein for his service as interim chancellor. A round of applause followed.
Interim Chancellor Klein said that he has enjoyed serving the University in this
capacity. He observed that the Dearborn campus includes over 70 acres of natural area,
including a portion of the Rouge River, and that a conference on the Rouge River was
being held on campus.

mentoring him since he has come to campus.

May Meeting, 2000


Annual Recommendations for Promotion to the Ranks of Professor and
Associate Professor. Provost Cantor observed that she and others who had reviewed
the promotions were "breathless" about the quality of the faculty. She noted that "the
integration of scholarship and teaching on our campus is alive and well and is
enormously impressive." Noting that she is "completely convinced that the best
scholars make the best teachers," she described four faculty who exemplified the
integration of scholarship and teaching among this year's promotion recommendations:
Frieda Ekotto, assistant professor of French (being recommended for associate
professor with tenure); Paul Resnick, associate professor of information (being
recommended for the granting of tenure); Edward W. Sarath, associate professor of
music (jazz and improvisation studies) with tenure (being recommended for promotion
to professor); and Ann Marie Sastry, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and
applied mechanics (being recommended for promotion to associate professor of
mechanical engineering and applied mechanics with tenure).
Executive Vice President Omenn highlighted the achievements of four faculty
being recommended for promotion: Eva Feldman, associate professor of neurology
with tenure (being recommended for promotion to professor); Sally Ann Camper,
associate professor of human genetics with tenure (being recommended for promotion
to professor); Douglas Quint, associate professor of radiology with tenure (being
recommended for promotion to professor); and J. Stuart Wolf, Jr., assistant professor of
surgery (being recommended for promotion to associate professor with tenure).
President Bollinger commented that review and evaluation for tenure is "the most
important thing we do throughout the year." He described the process and the amount
of effort expended on tenure review.
Interim Chancellor Klein presented six promotion and tenure recommendations for
the Dearborn campus. He highlighted the accomplishments of Professor Barbara Klein,
assistant professor of management information systems (being recommended for
promotion to associate professor with tenure).
Chancellor Mestas presented eight faculty members for promotion and tenure on
the Flint campus, noting the large role that teaching plays in their academic work and
that the quality of faculty publications is on a par with the Ann Arbor campus.
Personnel Actions. Provost Cantor submitted a number of other personnel actions.

Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report - Ann Arbor
Campus
This report was presented by Professor Rudi Lindner, chair of CESF. Professor
Lindner reviewed compensation guidelines that had been forwarded to the provost last
year. These include nondiscrimination; openness about the determination of compensation;
consistency in the application of policy; peer review; communication; and accountability.
He noted that CESF is working with the administration to get a better understanding of the
distribution and nature of faculty compensation across the University.
Professor Lindner also discussed what CESF believes to be the growing impact of
the use of merit salary pools available to units for meeting outside offers for faculty
members. He noted that it is the best departments whose faculty are most frequently
raided, and thus faculty in these departments may be impacted multiple times. As one


319




June Meeting, 2000


of the remedies for this, he suggested that faculty join in University-wide fundraising
effort.
UM-Dearborn Faculty Senate Budget and Finance Board Report
This report was given by Professor James Knight, chair of the UM-Dearborn
Faculty Senate Budget and Finance Board. Professor Knight described the report's four
recommendations:  1) development of global fiscal and academic performance
measures; 2) development of a long-term plan for improving faculty salaries; 3)
addressing the significant financial risks posed by the large and growing debt load on
the Dearborn campus; and 4) providing a formal mechanism through which faculty can
have more informed input into the budgetary decision-making process.
Professor Knight also observed that compared with its Michigan IIA public
university peer institutions, UM-Dearborn ranks below average in most comparative
measures of academic quality, including faculty salaries. Administrative expenses and
tuition, however, are high relative to peer institutions.
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report - Flint Campus
Professor Robert Stack presented the report for the Flint campus. He noted that
the Flint CESF report underscores the "alarming drop" in real and relative salary
position the UM-Flint faculty has experienced for more than five years, to the point
where faculty salaries are in the lowest tier of peer institutions and have failed to keep
pace with inflation. The committee has focused on examining the impact of this salary
trend on faculty inversion and compression. It also plans to develop, in cooperation
with the administration, a reliable and useful salary database and data collection process
that will enable faculty and administrators to monitor and correct salary deficiencies
and inequities in the future. He praised Chancellor Mestas for his supportive attitude
and openness in the budget process and expressed the hope that this openness will lead
to improvements in the budget process and in faculty and staff compensation across the
campus.
Regent Maynard observed that it might be helpful if the Flint and Dearborn
campuses would collaborate on their reports so that it would be easier to compare data
between the two campuses as well as against peer institutions.
Regent Newman arrived at the meeting at this point.
University of Michigan Alumni Association Update
President Bollinger called on Mr. Steve Grafton, executive director of the
University of Michigan Alumni Association. Mr. Grafton indicated that notebooks with
material from the Alumni Association had been distributed at the meeting.
Mr. Grafton stated that the Alumni Association is an independent, worldwide
organization that nurtures lifelong relationships with and among current and future
Michigan alumni. Underlying the association's activities is a belief in the value of
education to the well-being of society and a commitment to integrity, diversity, and
service. He noted that the alumni association was incorporated in 1897 and is a
not-for-profit organization.
Mr. Grafton explained the relationship between the Alumni Association and the
University, noting that staff members receive University checks and benefits, but that


320




June Meeting, 2000


he reports to a volunteer board of directors and not to anyone at the University. The
Alumni Association raised the money to build its building, then donated the building to
the University for the use of the association. In support of the Association's help with
development efforts, the University has been allocating $267,000 annually to the
association for about 30 years.
Mr. Grafton reviewed Alumni Association programs, which include a travel
program, Camp Michigania, sponsorship of bowl tours, legislative advocacy, on and
off-campus alumni education programs, and publishing of the alumni magazine. He
noted that the association is in a strong financial position. He also pointed out that the
association has a long-standing, firm commitment to diversity, and that this is an
important issue for the association.
Mr. Grafton pointed out that although the Alumni Association membership of
100,000 represents about 28% of alumni, the remaining 72% remain unconnected. He
described efforts underway to engage segments of alumni who traditionally remain
uninvolved in alumni affairs.  These include offering programs in the areas of
networking, career services, continuing education, and e-mail. To broaden its appeal,
the association is taking a life-stage approach by dividing alumni into four market
segments, and it is continuing to do research so that it can more directly meet the needs
and desires of alumni. He described some recent nontraditional events that have been
targeted to alumni at different life stages.
The association's membership policy is changing so that individuals who join the
Alumni Association will automatically become members of their local clubs. Mr.
Grafton concluded that the goal is to create an association that is valuable enough to
alumni that they will want to be a part of it, as this will create alumni that will be most
helpful to the University.
President Bollinger commented that although some of the changes the association
is trying to make are controversial for some groups, he supports the goal of becoming
more of a force in the University.
Athletic Department Update
President Bollinger called on Mr. Bill Martin, interim athletic director, who
reviewed what he has learned about the Athletic Department in just over 100 days on
the job. Mr. Martin introduced several department staff members who were present.
He also thanked former athletic director Tom Goss for the wholehearted cooperation he
has shown in assisting him during the transition in leadership of the department and
praised the Athletic Department staff.
Mr. Martin reported that with the addition of men's soccer and women's water
polo in the fall, there will be 25 varsity sports and 44 club sports. The University is
consistently ranked among the top five of 318 Division I colleges and universities
nationally and is currently number 3, as measured by the Sears Cup. The University
leads the Big 10 in gender equity, and it grants the maximum number of scholarships
permitted in every sport. The budget is approximately $45 million.
The goals of the Athletic Department, he noted, are to continue Michigan's
tradition of national excellence in competitive sports, support academic excellence,
remain committed to gender equity and diversity, and achieve long-term financial


321




June Meeting, 2000


equilibrium. The two major challenges facing the department, he noted, are academic
alternatives for student-athletics, and returning to financial equilibrium.
Regarding academics, he said that as a guiding principle, the Big 10 conference
states that student athletes must be provided with "viable and attainable opportunities
for academic success." He noted that historically, 10 percent of student-athletes are "at
risk" academically (lower than 2.21 GPA), and that at-risk student-athletes are
over-represented in the Division of Kinesiology. Mr. Martin observed that Provost
Cantor has agreed to consider a pilot program for enhanced academic support, and that
efforts are going to be made to strengthen the ties among coaches, student-athletes,
faculty, and administration. He praised Provost Cantor for all of her help to date.
Mr. Martin described the major financial issues facing the Athletic Department.
He pointed out that the department is not in financial equilibrium, and its budget for
2000-2001 will most likely have a deficit. However, he said he is confident the deficit
can be eliminated in the following fiscal year. He noted that the mission of competitive
excellence for all sports carries with it a significant financial commitment, since the
University funds the full NCAA scholarship limit available for each of its 25 sports, and
70 percent of athletic scholarships go to nonresident athletes. In addition, expenses
have escalated faster than revenues as a result of adding sports, infrastructure
maintenance, and inflation. Several needed capital improvements are being deferred,
but will need to be addressed in the future. He observed that although football tickets
are a major source of revenue, ticket prices will not be raised for the coming season.
Mr. Martin noted again that in 2000 there will be 12 men's and 13 women's
sports, and that there are not enough resources to add any additional sports. He
reviewed the methods used by other Big Ten institutions to raise revenues for athletics,
which include naming rights, preferential seating programs, seat licenses, suite rentals,
and scoreboard advertising.
Regarding costs, he noted that the University of Michigan spends more than any
other Big Ten institution in annual grant-in-aid costs ($8.3 million). Unlike the
University of Michigan, some Big Ten athletic departments receive funding from
administrative support and have other approaches for tuition of student athletes. In the
area of debt service, Michigan's debt load ($15 million) and debt service costs ($2.7
million) are substantially less than those of many peer Big Ten institutions.
Mr. Martin said that $20-25 million will be needed over the next five years to fund
facility infrastructure renovations, including $5 million for Crisler Arena. Planned
facility expansions will cost an additional $30 million, but many of these expenses will
be derived through fundraising efforts. Among the alternatives being examined for
reaching financial equilibrium beyond FY 2000-2001 are increasing football ticket
prices in line with those of peer institutions; implementing preferential seating plans
(including sky boxes) and seat license programs; adding seating in Yost Ice Arena and
Michigan Stadium; and exploring new sources of revenue that could be derived from
such initiatives as facility rentals and advertising.
Mr. Martin then reviewed cost containment initiatives planned for the coming
fiscal year. These include a seven percent target budget reduction for most sports;
reducing publications expenses; reducting facility staff overtime; and making more
effective use of the department's production studio.


322




June Meeting, 2000


Mr. Martin concluded that the only way the Athletic Department can continue its
traditional mission and record of excellence is by acquiring additional resources. These
resources can be generated within the department with the support of the Board of
Regents and administration.
Resolution in Honor of Michigan Academic Competition Team
President Bollinger called on Regent Brandon, who read the following resolution:
REGENTS' RESOLUTION
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate the 1999-2000
Michigan Academic Competition team for another superb season, culminating
in the winning of the College Bowl National Tournament April 30 at Bentley
College in Waltham, Massachusetts.
Led by Coach Ati Tislerics, the five-member team was comprised of
Craig D. Barker, Michelle LaLonde-Reaume, Stephen Traicoff, Noel Erinjeri,
and captain and tournament all-star Michael Davidson. It was the third time
in five seasons that a Michigan team has captured the national championship.
The academic team's triumphant showing over leading contenders from
other regions and ultimately the University of Arkansas crowned a season
characterized by outstanding training and teamwork.
The Regents proudly salute all the students who participated in the
Michigan Academic Competition program and thank this year's College Bowl
National Champions for so ably representing the University of Michigan.
The team members came forward to accept the resolution and were introduced. A
round of applause followed. Team member Craig Barker thanked the Regents for
supporting the team through funding of the University Activities Center over the years.
Resolution in Honor of Interim Chancellor Bernard W. Klein
Regent Taylor called Interim Chancellor Klein to the podium and read the
following resolution:
REGENTS' RESOLUTION
Once again the Regents of the University of Michigan express their
gratitude to Dr. Bernard Klein as he steps down following an unprecedented
third term as interim chancellor of the University of Michigan-Dearborn.
A highly regardedfaculty member and gifted administrator, Dr. Klein
has demonstrated a keen understanding of the campus and its students. His
deep love for the University of Michigan-Dearborn is abundantly clear.
Dr. Klein brought to this position his profound ability to communicate
with all members of the University community, his renowned sense or humor,
and his access and influence among decision-makers in southeastern
Michigan.  Through his career in public service and elected office, he
developed strong ties with many leaders in metropolitan Detroit, ties that


323




June Meeting, 2000


have benefited the Dearborn campus and the larger University over the past
thirty years.
Although some may conjecture that he has reached his term limit as
interim chancellor, Bernie Klein knows that a good leader never says "never. "
The Regents commend Dr. Bernard Klein and convey their heartfelt
appreciation for his loyalty and dedicated service to the Dearborn campus and
to the University of Michigan.
A round of applause followed. Dr. Klein thanked the Board for its support, noting
that he had enjoyed the experience and was very gratified by the tribute.
Michigan Greats
Vice President Ulaby announced that this month's presentation would highlight
the work of Michael K. Daugherty, professor of music (composition). Professor
Daugherty is currently also composer in residence with the Detroit Symphony
Orchestra, and his new work, "Rosa Parks Boulevard," had just been premiered by the
orchestra.
Professor Daugherty gave a presentation illustrating the process by which he
developed "Rosa Parks Boulevard." The presentation included demonstrations of
various elements of the piece by trombonist Robert Meyer and a video of the premier
performance by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.
Motion to Meet in Informal Session
Regent Maynard read the following motion:
I move that we adjourn this formal session of the Regents and begin a
nonformal session, the purpose of which is to consider a personnel evaluation.
The meeting continued in informal session until 4:10 p.m., at which time it
reconvened in formal session for Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals on the topics
indicated: Audrey Jackson, alumna, Douglas C. Kelley, former staff member, Eugene
Feingold, faculty member, Ronald C. Bishop, professor emeritus, Clifford E. Douglas,
alumnus, and Andrew Lurie, student, in favor of divestment of tobacco stocks; Michael
Edwards, president of ASFCME Local 1583 and Warren Jenkins, bargaining chair of
ASFCME Local 1583, on plans to privatize the UM Hospitals cafeteria; Larry Harvilla,
student, on the possible merger of AATA and the University bus system; and Nicholas
Waun, student, on corporate influence in universities.
Following public comments, the informal session resumed from 4:50 until 5:30 p.m.
Friday, June 16, 2000
The Regents met at 9:45 a.m. Present were President Bollinger and Regents
Brandon, Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and Taylor. Also present
were Provost Cantor, Vice President Feagin, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Interim
Chancellor Klein, Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Mestas,


324




June Meeting, 2000


Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President Rudgers, Vice President and Secretary
Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent White and
Interim Vice President Harper were absent.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order. He announced that Professor
Susan Alcock, associate professor in the classical studies department and assistant
research scientist in the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, had just been awarded a
prestigious MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted the minutes of the May 2000 meeting.
Business and Finance Reports. Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted
reports of Investment, Plant Extension, and Human Resources and Affirmative Action.
Regarding the Investment Report, he noted that the December 31, 1999, proportion of
the asset allocation in venture capital has increased due to the fact that a number of
publicly traded stocks that will be distributed to the University are still being held by
the partnerships. Although the target allocation for alternative assets is 30 percent, the
allocation as of December 31 was 34 percent. However, when the publicly traded
stocks still being held by the partnerships are not counted, the allocation is well before
the 30 percent target.  He noted that this situation is being closely watched by
investment office staff.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report on Projects
Established for May 2000. He noted that awards to date are at a record high,
representing a 42 percent increase over last year, for a total of $699 million.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Omenn
reported that the health system projects at least a $13 million increase in external grant
support for its medical research programs, and it expects to close the current fiscal year
with a positive balance. For the upcoming fiscal year, he noted that the health system
has set an expense reduction target of $35-$40 million.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Interim Chancellor Klein noted that the
campus was eagerly awaiting the arrival on July 1 of newly appointed chancellor Daniel
Little.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas shared the accomplishments of
two students from the Flint campus: Sean Michael Welch and Jason Holt. Mr. Welch
is an award-winning playwright, who won the John Cauble Short Play Award at the
Kennedy Center/American College Theatre Festival in Washington, D.C., in April
1999. Mr. Holt is a multitalented individual with an almost perfect academic record
who just received three degrees from UM-Flint and will begin pursuing a Ph.D. degree
in the fall.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Mr. Hideki Tsutsumi, president of MSA,
reported that one of MSA's major initiatives in the coming year will be expanding the
student lobbying effort with the state legislature in an effort to gain increased support
for higher education from Lansing.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Feagin submitted the report of Voluntary
Support. She noted that the University had recently received two irrevocable trusts
325

from Lincoln Knorr, and that there has also been a significant increase in outright gifts
from individuals.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted retirement memoirs for
23 faculty members.
Loren S. Barritt, Ph.D., professor of education in the School of Education, retired
from active faculty status on May 31, 2000, following thirty-six years of service.
Professor Barritt received his A.B. degree from Blackburn College in 1958 and his
M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Indiana University in 1961 and 1964, respectively. He
joined the faculty of the University of Michigan School of Education in 1964 as an
assistant professor and was promoted to associate professor in 1968 and professor in
1973. During the 1973-74 academic year, Professor Barritt held a Senior Fulbright


341




June Meeting, 2000


Lectureship at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands.  He worked at the
Netherlands Institute for Basic Research on a visitors grant in 1978-79 and was awarded
a research grant by the Dutch Ministry of Education in 1985-86.
Professor Barritt served on a number of committees within the School of Education.
At the University level, he served on the Budget Priorities Committee, the Faculty
Senate Assembly, and was vice president of the University chapter of the AAUP. He
taught courses in educational psychology and human development, and his strong
mentoring skills were highly valued by students.  Professor Barritt also worked
extensively in the community, as evidenced by his involvement in the planning and
maintenance of the New School in Ann Arbor. Through his dedication to the art and
science of teaching, Professor Barritt brought together a diverse group of people-from
the University, from the public schools, from the city of Ann Arbor, from as far as the
Netherlands-and encouraged them to think about teaching in new and exciting ways
and to share those thoughts and ideas with each other and with the community.
Professor Barritt maintained memberships in the American Educational Research
Association, the American Anthropological Association, the Netherlands America
University League, and the American Association of University Professors. His articles
appeared in Review of Education, Phenomenology and Pedagogy, American Educational
Research Journal, and College Composition and Communication, among others.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Loren S. Barritt
professor emeritus of education.
Lynne K. Bartholomew, associate professor of music (piano), retired from active
faculty status on May 31, 2000.
A native of Pennsylvania, Professor Bartholomew received her B.Mus. degree in
1963 and her M.Mus. degree in 1965, both from the University of Michigan. She
received the University's James L. Babcock Award in 1963, John Wolaver Award in
1965, and was elected to Pi Kappa Lambda and Phi Kappa Phi societies. During
1965-66, she studied as the Frieburg Hochschtile fur Musik in Germany on a Fulbright
grant and later undertook advanced studies at the University of Southern California. She
joined the faculty as a lecturer in music in 1966 and was promoted to instructor in 1968,
assistant professor in 1969, and associate professor in 1976.
Professor Bartholomew spent many summers as a teacher in the All-State Piano
Program at Interlochen and served there as director of the University division in the
summers of 1985 and 1986. She served on numerous committees concerned with
affirmative action, minority recruitment, and fundraising and was a member of the
school's executive committee from 1982-85. She held the post coordinator of the piano
department from 1988 until her retirement.
During her forty-year association with the University of Michigan School of Music,
first as a student and then as a faculty member, Professor Bartholomew has been
conscientious, hardworking, loyal, and dedicated to making the school a special place in
which to study and to learn. Her students have revered her with good cause.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Lynne K. Bartholomew
associate professor emerita of music (piano).
John H. D'Arms, Ph.D., Gerald F. Else Professor of Humanities, professor of
classical studies, professor of history in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and
former dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, will retire from active
faculty status on June 30, 2000.
Professor D'Arms received his B.A. degree from Princeton University in 1956, his
B.A. degree from Oxford University in 1959, and his Ph.D. degree from Harvard
342




June Meeting, 2000


University in 1965. He came to the University of Michigan as an assistant professor in
classical studies in 1965 and was promoted to associate professor in 1968 and professor
in 1972. He was appointed to the Gerald F. Else professorship in 1983 and was named
professor of history in 1986. He served two terms as chair of the Department of
Classical Studies, from 1972-76 and from 1980-85. He served as dean of the Horace H.
Rackham School of Graduate Studies from 1985-95 and vice-provost for academic
affairs from 1990-95.
Professor D'Arms research focuses on reconstructing the social world of the
Roman upper classes. In his many publications, he makes abundant use of primary
sources to demonstrate the important information hidden behind a facade of propriety.
Thus, in his first book, which examined the privileged life of Roman aristocrats in their
luxurious villas around the Bay of Naples, he revealed the elaborate social and economic
interconnections between these Roman nobles, their dependents, and the local
aristocracies of Campanian cities. In his second book, he showed that despite their
expressed disdain for those who assembled wealth through trade, most Roman aristocrats
participated, through their slaves and freedmen, in commercial activities that provided
them with important sources of income and influence.
Professor D'Arms has served as president of the Association of Graduate Schools
for the AAU (1989-90) and as member of the National Council on the Humanities. He is
currently president of the American Council of Learned Societies. He is a fellow of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Philosophical
Society.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming John H. D'Arms the
Gerald F. Else professor emeritus of humanities, professor emeritus of classical studies,
professor emeritus of history, and dean emeritus.
Edward S. Davidson, Ph.D., professor of electrical engineering and computer
science in the College of Engineering, retired from active faculty status on May 31,
2000.
Professor Davidson received his B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1961, his
M.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1962, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Illinois in 1968. From 1962-65, he was an engineer at Honeywell EDP,
and from 1965-68 he was a researcher in the Digital Computer Laboratory at the
University of Illinois. He was an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Stanford
University from 1968-73 and was a faculty member at the University of Illinois from
1973-87, achieving the level of professor of computer science in 1984. He served as
president of Illinois Computer Research, Inc., from 1981-87, associate director of the
Center for Supercomputing Research and Development at the University of Illinois from
1985-87, and executive vice president of Paracomp Technologies from 1986-87.
Professor Davidson joined the University of Michigan as professor of electrical
engineering and computer science and chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science in 1988. He served as the director of the Center for Parallel
Computing from 1994-97 and was named associate chair of the computer science and
engineering division in 1997.
Professor Davidson is internationally respected in the field of computer science,
having made significant contributions in the areas of computer architecture, design, and
performance analysis.  He helped establish the University of Michigan's Center for
Parallel Computing in 1992 and was the primary architect of the mission statement and its
expansive vision. His publication record includes 4 books or monographs and 78 refereed
papers. Professor Davidson received a prestigious Eckert-Mauchly Award jointly from the


343




June Meeting, 2000


ACM and IEEE Computer Society in 2000, as well as the Taylor L. Booth Award in 1996
and the Harry Goode Memorial Award in 1992 from the IEEE Computer Society. He
received the EECS Department Research Excellence Award in 1994 and the College of
Engineering Excellence in Research Award in 1995. He became a Golden Core member of
the IEEE in 1996 and is listed in American Men of Science and Who 's Who in Technology.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Edward S. Davidson
professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science.
William  R. Farrand, Ph.D., professor of geological sciences, director of the
Exhibit Museum, and curator, Museum of Anthropology, College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on June 30, 2000.
Professor Farrand received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in 1955 and 1956,
respectively, from The Ohio State University and his Ph.D. degree in 1960 from the
University of Michigan. From 1960-64, he was on the faculty of Columbia University
and in 1964-65 he was a visiting professor at the University of Strasbourg in France. He
joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1965 as an assistant professor and
was promoted to associate professor in 1967 and professor in 1974. He was named
curator in the Museum of Anthropology in 1975 and director of the Exhibit Museum of
Natural History in 1993.
Professor Farrand's early work centered on the glacial history of Michigan and the
American/Canadian Midwest. He studied landforms and their evolution, the crustal
rebound that occurs after the ice sheet load is removed from the earth's surface, and the
history of the glacial advances and retreats. He was among the first to apply the
techniques of radiocarbon dating to elucidate the timing of some of these events. Much of
Professor Farrand's scholarship lay at the interface between geology and archaeology; in
fact, his career helped to define the field of geoarchaeology. He was particularly
interested in the sedimentology, stratigraphy, and paleoclimatology of archaeological and
early man sites around the Mediterranean and has spent extensive periods of time working
on sites in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, Turkey, Greece, and elsewhere in Africa and the
Far East.
Professor Farrand taught courses at all levels and assisted with directing and
teaching in the department's summer field program at Camp Davis, Wyoming. He

development of modern developmental plant physiology, carrying out groundbreaking
345




June Meeting, 2000


studies on the effects of light, other environmental factors, and plant hormones on lettuce
seed germination. Working with Walter Bonner at the University of Pennsylvania, he
was among the first investigators to describe the properties of carefully isolated plant
mitochondria. At the University of Michigan, Professor Ikuma's research has emphasized
discovery and characterization of factors that regulate plant growth and development.
He continued his pioneering work on the properties of plant mitochondria, focusing on
energy coupling reactions and on the metabolism of organic acids in the organelle. He
also initiated new research programs that have revealed new roles of light, temperature,
and hormones in regulation of the complex series of metabolic events that culminate in
seed germination.
Within the Department of Biology, Professor Ikuma has played a leading role in
teaching. He developed new laboratory exercises for introductory courses and for the
department's flagship plant physiology offering, which he also taught with distinction for
a number of years. Likewise, his contributions to the department's one-term, accelerated
introductory course made this a very popular first-year offering for entering
undergraduates with prior course work in biology. He served as associate chair for
undergraduate curriculum from 1983-87.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Hiroshi Ikuma professor
emeritus of biology.
Ludwig Koenen, Ph.D., Herbert C. Youtie Distinguished University Professor of

papyrology in 1995.
Professor Koenen is among a handful of classical scholars internationally acclaimed
as editors and interpreters of the texts which have come down to us on Egyptian papyrus;
he is widely acknowledged as the most distinguished papyrologist active in North
America. A prolific scholar, Professor Koenen is admired for his scholarly range and for
his ability to place particular texts in their wider literary, social, historical, and
intellectual contexts. His publications on the Mani Codex have virtually rewritten the
history of manichaeism by establishing the primarily Judaeo-Christian background of
Mani and his theology. He has published literary papyri and has done important work on
the cultural interaction between Greeks and Egyptians in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt.
Most recently, he has organized an international team to decipher and conserve a group
of carbonized papyri found in a Byzantine church at Petra in Jordan.
Professor Koenen served as chair of the Department of Classical Studies from
1985-94.  In 1995, he was awarded the John H. D'Arms Faculty Award for
Distinguished Graduate Mentoring in the Humanities and was appointed Henry Russel
Lecturer, the highest honor the University can bestow upon a faculty member. Professor
Koenen is cofounder and coeditor of the Zeitschrift fur Papyrologie und Epigraphik,
which has published 120 volumes since 1967. He was elected president of the American
Philological Association and is an elected member of the American Philological

Professor Lee also held appointments in the Medical School as associate professor and
then professor (1982) of medical and biological illustration and as assistant professor of
medical plastic surgery sculpture from 1978-89.
Professor Lee is a talented medical illustrator who has received national and
international recognition for his accurate and innovative illustrations. His interest in
alleviating human disfigurement also led to pioneering work in medical sculpture and the
development of prosthetics which produced extraordinary advances in the field. He was
at the forefront of new developments in cosmetic prostheses, using innovative
techniques, new materials and casting procedures to improve cosmetic prosthetic
appliances. A skilled artist, dedicated teacher, and vigorous researcher, in 1971 Professor
Lee initiated and established a medical sculpture unit. Its purpose was to supply
disfigured patients with external prosthetic appliances and implants as a means of
artificial cosmetic reconstruction. This unit attracted many patients to the University of
Michigan Hospitals to receive the benefit of his talent.
Professor Lee has served as director of the graduate program in medical and
biological illustration since 1986. In this capacity, he has trained artists, medical
students, and residents in the plastic surgery section. A renowned medical artist,

of Michigan as an associate professor in 1961 and was promoted to professor in 1963.
Professor Lewis served as chair of the Department of Mathematics from 1984-94, with a
break of one year to visit the Institute for Advanced Study.
Professor Lewis' research lies in an area of number theory concerned primarily
with diophantine problems and encompasses the theory of algebraic number fields and
function fields and arithmetic geometry. It is characteristic especially of his earlier work
that he was the first to obtain any kind of result on a problem, and that this decisive
progress cleared the way for subsequent developments. The work in his thesis
concerning the local solubility of cubic forms, however, remains definitive. Also
noteworthy is a series of papers produced in collaboration with Harold Davenport which
laid the foundation for the investigation of a number of diophantine problems, especially
diagonal variants. He is the author of 55 research papers and a number of survey papers,
and he directed 24 doctoral theses.
From 1995-99, Professor Lewis was based in Washington, D.C., as the director of
the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the Natural Science Foundation. He has
received numerous awards, including a Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award from
the University in 1978 and an Alexander von Humboldt Preis Award in 1980. He was

ecological relationships of cicadas (insects) of the world, especially their acoustical
behavior in nature.   He also researched periodicity and associated behavior,
development, nature of sound-producing and sound-receiving structures, species-specific
physiology of acoustic nerves, and long-term interactions among animals and plants and
soils. More recently, he studied functional morphology and neural control of live insect
robots (biobots) as carriers of environmental sensors and their MEMS-engineering and
artificial intelligence applications. He had extensive field experience in the United
States, Mexico, Central America, and South America.


348




June Meeting, 2000

can truly be learned and understood only in its artistic, social, historical, and political
context. By integrating into her teaching of Spanish a genuine understanding of the
cultures of Latin Americans and of North Americans of Hispanic origin, she created a
forum for students to develop a deep understanding and appreciation of the diversity of
cultures and societies. Her innovative contributions turned the Residential College
Spanish program into an extremely successful, proficiency-oriented, language immersion
experience —enabling many generations of Residential College students to go forth
confidently and knowledgeably into the Spanish-speaking world.
Over the years, Ms. Moya-Raggio also taught numerous courses in English on
Latin American and Latino/a culture and literature, both in the Residential College and in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. She has been committed to diversifying
the curriculum by teaching about marginalized groups and nontraditional forms of
expression.  Especially valued by students has been her co-teaching of a Residential
College course on cultural confrontations in the arts and her teaching of an upper-level
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts course on the Latina —both of which she was
instrumental in creating. She also participated for many years in the College of

Center. From 1968-69, he was a Fulbright lecturer at J. W. Goethe Universitat in Frankfurt.
Professor Rosenwald made diverse contributions to the fields of personality theory,
psychopathology, and clinical psychology, from experimental studies of psychological
defenses to discussions of psychodiagnosis and assessment to critiques of prevailing
theoretical and empirical paradigms. His broad-ranging scholarship and rich array of
interests extended well beyond psychology, to Thomas Mann, Shakespeare, structuralism,
semiotics, creativity, philosophy of science, and social science methodology. While he
published valued experimental papers, he was an articulate and compelling proponent for
qualitative, phenomenological, narrative, multiple-case, and life-history research. His
students learned well his admonition that they not mistake counting for thinking and
found such lessons couched in the context of the philosophy and history of science hsen rather
than in easy attacks on vulgar operationism.
Professor Rosenwald authored two books and numerous journal articles, chapters, and
reviews; he also served on a number of editorial boards. He was a devoted and deeply
respected mentor to several generations of students at the University of Michigan, a much
sought out speaker at national and international conferences, and an organizer himself of

Sanctions Task Force.
Professor Tanter taught graduate and undergraduate courses in the area of
international security and also taught a regular, large lecture course on the Arab-Israeli
conflict. In the latter, he used innovative new approaches to teaching, including most
notably an interactive simulation that involved students in research and role playing. In
all his teaching, Professor Tanter was also able to use his Washington experience to
enrich his courses and to help his students get a more realistic sense of decision-making.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Raymond Tanter professor
emeritus of political science.
John F. Ward, Ph.D., professor of physics in the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2000.
Professor Ward received his B.A. (1957), M.A. (1961) and his D.Phil. (1961) degrees
in physics from Oxford University. He joined the University of Michigan's physics
353




June Meeting, 2000


department in 1961 as a lecturer and research associate. In 1964, he returned to England as
a research fellow at the Clarendon Laboratory and lecturer at Wadham College, Oxford
University. He rejoined the University of Michigan in 1967 as associate professor and was
promoted to professor in 1975.
Professor Ward arrived at Michigan shortly after Professor Peter Franken had
launched the field of nonlinear optics, and that became the focus of his subsequent
research. Much of Professor Ward's work involved the use of experimental nonlinear
optical techniques to investigate the electric properties of small molecules. The
calculation of these molecular data (by others), although well understood in principle, is
not yet satisfactory despite the dedicated efforts of quantum chemists using substantial
amounts of supercomputer time. Professor Ward's work has furthered the understanding
of both nonlinear interactions and of small molecules, while encouraging the
development of improved quantum chemical calculation techniques. Professor Ward has
also conducted initial demonstrations of such new nonlinear optical effects as optical
third harmonic generation in gases and dc-induced optical rectification. He investigated
resonant nonlinear processes, developed and utilized nonlinear optical interferometers,
and with other physics faculty developed nonlinear perturbation theory in a form
appropriate to the field of nonlinear optics. Professor Ward also investigated the
industrial applications of lasers and was awarded patents in that area.
As an active member of the physics faculty, Professor Ward served as associate
chair for the graduate program (1987-90), associate chair for research and facilities
(1992-93 and 1996-99), acting chair (1993), and interim chair (1993-94). He represented
the department's interests in several substantial construction and renovation projects,
including the recent addition of 10,000 square feet of space in Randall Laboratory. In
addition, he served as chair or co-chair for 20 doctoral committees and as a member of
an additional 38 committees.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming John F. Ward professor
emeritus of physics.
Edward C. Weber, senior associate librarian, retired from the University Library
on January 4, 2000, after more than forty-five years of service.
Mr. Weber received his B.A. degree from the University of Rochester in 1944, his
M.A. degree from Columbia University in 1948, and his A.M.L.S. degree from the
University of Michigan in 1954. He was appointed junior divisional librarian in the
social science library in 1954 and was promoted to associate divisional librarian in 1955.
Mr. Weber was appointed curator of the Labadie Collection in 1960 and retained this
position until his retirement.
The Labadie Collection, established in 1911, is rich in materials on civil liberties,
anarchism, socialism, sexual freedom, labor history, and underground presses and is
recognized throughout the world as one of the leading collections of social protest and
radical literature. In his forty years as curator of the Labadie Collection, Mr. Weber has
augmented, expanded, and given a high profile to the Labadie Collection. He has a
special ability to work successfully with both donors and book dealers and has had the
foresight to acquire collections before their value was widely recognized. Through his
progressive and intelligent work with the Labadie Collection, Mr. Weber has come to be
known as one of the leading collection development specialists for radical and social
protest publications.
In addition to his outstanding work with the Labadie Collection, for many years Mr.
Weber was responsible for building collections in Latin American studies, theatre, and
minority literature at the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library. His attentive work has


354




June Meeting, 2000


contributed to the strength and breadth of these collections. He has been an active
supporter of LILA (Lavender Information and Library Association), serving as a
resource person for the history of gay rights.
For forty years, Mr. Weber has assisted generations of faculty and students and has
been the face of the University to a multitude of scholars from around the world who used
the Labadie Collection. He is an individual of remarkable honesty, compassion, and
intelligence, who will be deeply missed by his colleagues in the library and the
University.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming Edward C. Weber
senior associate librarian emeritus.
Memorials. Vice President Tedesco submitted a memorial statement for Stuart
Sankey, professor of music (double bass).
Stuart Sankey, professor of music (double bass) died in Ann Arbor on May 1, 2000.
He was born in Los Angeles on New Year's Eve in 1927. He studied at The Julliard
School where he received his B.S. and M.S. degrees and then joined the faculty at the
University of Texas at Austin. He became a faculty member at Indiana University in 1980
and was named professor of music at the University of Michigan in 1986. During summers
from 1951 until his death, Professor Sankey was a member of the artist faculty at the Aspen
Music School and Festival in Colorado. He also held guest teaching appointments at the
Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing and the Toho Academy in Tokyo.
Professor Sankey was a master performer on the double bass, and in his work at
Aspen, Texas, Indiana, and Michigan he was an equally masterful teacher. His former
students currently can be found in very many symphony orchestras throughout the
United States, including the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, Boston Symphony
Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic,
and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and as faculty members in such prestigious
institutions as the Eastman School of Music, Northwestern University, and many others.
Professor Sankey was the author of numerous articles on double bass performance
and revised and edited the Simandle New Method for String Bass, which is by far the
most widely-used teaching method for the bass. He transcribed a great amount of music
for use by double bassists and was for much of his life also active as a composer.
The Regents acknowledge his death with sadness and offer sincere condolences
to his wife, Li Ting, and daughters, Laura and Lili.
Degrees. President Bollinger submitted a recommendation for award of an
honorary degree to Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech Republic.
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by
Regent Brandon, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
Divestiture of Tobacco Securities
President Bollinger commented that he had sent a memorandum to the Regents in
support of the recommendation of the Tobacco Advisory Committee that the University
divest itself of tobacco stocks. He emphasized that this proposal had emanated from
within the University many months ago, and that the precedent for considering the issue
was set in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the issue was divestiture of stocks of
companies doing business in South Africa. The standard set at that time was that a
company or organization must be acting in ways that are deeply abhorrent to University


355




June Meeting, 2000


principles and inconsistent with the mission of the University. The process followed at
that time led to divestiture of such stocks.
In the current case, it was decided that divestiture would only be considered after
there had been extensive consideration within the campus from groups representing
students, faculty, and staff. If these recommendations were positive, an ad hoc advisory
committee would then be set up to consider the issue. This is the process that did, in
fact, occur, and the advisory committee has returned a recommendation in favor of
divestment.
President Bollinger observed that this is a matter on which people of reasonable
minds can differ. He noted that the University needs to be careful not to politicize such
decisions due to the danger that taking a position on a major public issue might
discourage people who disagree from expressing their views. It is also important not to
discourage the openness to all points of view that is one of the defining characteristics
of a University. On the other hand, he commented that Universities must not consider
themselves completely outside of any moral or ethical norms. When there is behavior
that is against the norms of the University and inconsistent with its mission, the
University must consider taking a position. The committee report describes the
harmfulness of tobacco and the duplicity of the companies in denying that this is the case.
The major points, he concluded, are that this request has emanated from within the
institution and has been considered extensively and carefully, and the community is
calling upon the Regents to act on the belief that it would be inconsistent for the
University to maintain its principles and simultaneous be an owner of these organizations.
Regent Maynard moved divestiture of direct holdings of stock in tobacco
manufacturing companies and requested that the vote be made by a show of hands.
Regent Taylor seconded the motion.
Regent Brandon commented that this is the hardest vote he has had to consider
since joining the Board, because he does not like either choice. Voting against it, he
believes, would show sympathy towards tobacco companies, and this does not reflect
his opinion. However, a vote in favor would also be problematic due to the inconsistencies
and hypocrisies inherent in the "symbolism" argument. Therefore, he indicated that he
would abstain from voting.
Regent Taylor stated that he is angry about the fact that this issue has come up for
a vote. He noted that tobacco is a dangerous substance, and that when companies
produce products that research confirms have the effects inherent in cigarettes, they
should be shut down or the production and sale of the products should be made illegal.
It angers him, he said, that the only recourse is the symbolic action the Regents are
being asked to take. However, he concluded, "the University's position as a premier
institution in health education and health research, and as a health care provider,
dictates a yes vote."
Regent Maynard indicated that she intended to support the motion. She noted that
she had to separate her own personal abhorrence toward tobacco companies and their
products and what actions the institution should take. Thus she carefully considered the
report of the ad hoc committee and the deliberative process established during previous
divestiture discussions. She observed that this is a very troubling, serious issue and she
has concluded that she concurs with the arguments of the ad hoc committee. She


356




June Meeting, 2000


pointed to a statement made by one of the speakers at Public Comments that tobacco is
different from other harmful products in that it kills when used as directed. She
concluded that she will be voting yes because she believes it is an important step for the
University to take.
Regent McGowan observed that Board members have responsibility for the policy,
and that there have been abundant opportunities to examine it. She noted that the
deliberative process by which this policy has been considered has been extensive,
including review by the ad hoc committee, the general counsel, the CFO, the president,
and it is the Regents' responsibility to either implement the policy or to change it. She
stated that she is "absolutely in support of divestiture."
Regent Deitch stated that certain basic principles govern his actions and
decision-making. In this case, tobacco companies make products that kill people when
used as directed, and in addition, there is evidence of cynical manipulation of the public
by tobacco companies. From a business perspective, he said he doesn't believe
investment in tobacco companies is necessary to fulfill the Board's fiduciary duty to
maximize return.  That being the case, he asked, "why own the investments?"
Furthermore, he expressed that it is "absolutely appropriate" for a university to make
value judgments and to state that it is not going to participate. He pointed out that
divestiture of stocks from companies that did business in South Africa during the 1970s
and 1980s actually worked over time. When institutions such as universities have the
opportunity, he stated, they should align themselves with people with conscience and
"put their money where their mouths are." He concluded that he was happy to have the
opportunity to cast an affirmative vote in favor of divestment.
The vote was then taken and the motion to divest direct holdings of stock in
tobacco manufacturing companies was approved, with Regents Deitch, Maynard,
McGowan, and Taylor in favor, Regent Horning opposed, Regents Brandon and
Newman abstaining, and Regent White absent.
Payment for Services of Ply LLC
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved a purchase contract with Ply LLC for a signage project.
Because one of the partners in Ply LLC, M. Craig Borum, is also a University faculty
member, this contract falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the purchase contract will be the Regents of the University of Michigan
and its International Institute and Ply LLC.
2.  The service provided was design and fabrication of prototype signage in
March 2000 for a total cost of $1,475.00.
3.  Professor Borum's pecuniary interest arises from his position as equal partner
of Ply LLC.
Lease Agreement with M. Melissa Gross
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved a lease agreement with M. Melissa Gross. Because M. Melissa
Gross is also a University faculty member, the agreement falls under the state of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:


357




June Meeting, 2000


1.   Parties to the lease agreement will be the Regents of the University of Michigan
and its Center for Ergonomics and M. Melissa Gross.
2.   The service provided is the lease of Professor Gross' house from June 1, 2000,
through July 6, 2000, at a total rent of $1,000.00.
3.   Professor Gross' pecuniary interest arises from her ownership of the house to be
leased.
Amendment to License Agreement between the University of Michigan and
MiTex Solutions, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved an amendment to a license agreement with MiTex Solutions,
Inc. for the Generic Cell Controlling Method and Apparatus for Computer Integrated
Manufacturing System and related software (collectively "GCC") (Technology
Management Office files #683 and 683sl). Because James R. Moyne holds equity
interest in MiTex Solutions, Inc. and is also a University employee, this agreement falls
under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and MiTex Solutions,
Inc., a company in which James R. Moyne holds an equity interest.
2.   Contract terms for the amendment include:
A fee of $10,000.00 in consideration for the amendment.
Royalties to the University remain as in the original license: 12.5% of net
sales of the software that was developed at the University (not less than
$750.00/copy) and 3% of net sales of software independently developed by or
for MiTex that implements the patented aspect of GCC (not less than
$200.00/copy). These rates are the same as included in an agreement in which
the same technology has been licensed to another small corporation that is
located in another state. So long as MiTex has its headquarters and principal
place of business in the state of Michigan, the royalty rates shall be reduced
respectively to 6% (not less than $250.00) and 1.5% (not less than $100.00).
Royalty of 20% on sublicense revenue remains as in original license.
Non-exclusive license for all fields replaced by an exclusive right to practice
and commercialize the technology in the fields of semiconductor, display and
memory manufacturing. The University retains ownership.
Minimum annual royalties revised to be $500.00 for 2000; and $1,000.00 for
2001 and each year thereafter during the term of the agreement.
Term of the agreement remains as for the life of the patent and the copyright,
as applicable.
No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University
employees, is obligated under the agreement or this amendment.
Consent for MiTex to assign the agreement to Brooks Automation, Inc.:
If assigned to Brooks Automation, revised terms: Fee of $30,000 up front to


358




June Meeting, 2000


the University on completion of the assignment to Brooks; the University to
receive 5% of all compensation to MiTex from Brooks for all intellectual
property involved in a sale of substantially all MiTex assets to Brooks,
including technologies developed by MiTex and technologies licensed by
MiTex from other parties; no other royalties due to the University from MiTex
or Brooks.
3.   Dr. Moyne's pecuniary interest arises from his ownership interest in MiTex
Solutions, Inc. He has waived any personal participation in the sharing of
royalties received by the University from that company. Since the amended
license will reduce the field of use originally licensed, Dr. Moyne's waiver
will no longer apply for fields of use outside what will be licensed to MiTex.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and Living
Text, LLC
On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved a license agreement between the University of Michigan and
Living Text, LLC for a non-exclusive license to a program called "Kids as Global
Scientists 2000" (KGS). Because the owner and president of Living Text, LLC, Perry
J. Samson, is also a University of Michigan employee, this agreement falls under the
state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information if provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Living Text, a
company owned by Dr. Perry Samson.
2.   Contract terms include:
Non-exclusive right to further develop and commercialize the software.
No monetary consideration.
The University retains ownership of the program and may continue to further
develop it, use it in research tool, and license it to others.
No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University
employees, is obligated under the agreement.
3.   Dr. Samson's pecuniary interest arises from his ownership in the company.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and
FreshOnLine, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved a license agreement between the University of Michigan and
FreshOnLine, Inc. Because the owner of FreshOnLine, Inc., Warren C. Whatley, is also
a University of Michigan employee, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and FreshOnLine, a
company owned by Dr. Warren C. Whatley.
2.   Contract terms include:
Exclusive right to further develop and commercialize the software.


359




June Meeting, 2000


License fees are $1,000 due on signing the Agreement and $1,000 a year.
The University retains ownership of the program and may continue to further
develop it and use it as a research tool.
No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University
employees is obligated under the agreement.
3.  Dr. Whatley's pecuniary interest arises from his ownership in the company.
Supplemental Information to the Certified Audited Financial Report of the
Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics of the University of Michigan
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted Supplemental Information to the
Certified Audited Financial Report of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics
of the University of Michigan. Regent Newman commented that it is curious that the
University should have to provide financial information about organizations over which
it has no control. Executive Vice President Kasdin stated that he would report back as
to why these particular clubs are included in the audit and not others.
Alternative Asset Commitments
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted information about investments made
in follow-on funds of previously approved alternative asset partnerships. The funds are
Battery Ventures VI, L.P., and Thomas H. Lee Equity Fund V, L.P.
Lease of Surgical Facilities from the Department of Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor
VA Health System
Executive Vice President Omenn informed the Regents that the University of
Michigan Health System is in the process of proceeding with a lease arrangement with
the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Healthcare System for the use of operating room space
in the VA Hospital by the Department of Surgery. He commented how important the
relationship is between the University of Michigan Health System and the Ann Arbor
Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. He observed that this has been an ongoing,
long-term relationship and that the Ann Arbor VA Hospital is an important academic
resource for many clinical departments of the Medical School. He noted that because
Congress has mandated that the VA facilities must obtain at least 10 percent of their
revenues from nonfederal sources, this arrangement, which will help the University of
Michigan to expand its operating room capacity, is also very much in the interest of the
VA.
Expenditure of the Julian A. Wolfson and the Marguerite Wolfson Endowment
Funds for the Fiscal Year 2000-2001
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved expenditure of the Julian A. Wolfson and the Marguerite
Wolfson Endowment Funds for the fiscal year 2000-2001, as described in the Regents
Communication.


360




June Meeting, 2000


Authorization for Expenditures for the 2000-2001 Fiscal Year

of Michigan Health System
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved authorization for temporary expenditures for the University of
Michigan Health System for the 2000-2001 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2000.
Chrysler Center for Continuing Engineering Education Renovation of Room 143
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved a project for renovation of Room 143 in the Chrysler Center for
Continuing Engineering Education Building. Executive Vice President Kasdin pointed
out that the cost of the project will be $525,000, as reflected in the document in the
supplemental agenda.
Institute of Science and Technology (IST) High Bay Building Addition
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved a revised budget and expanded scope for the originally approved
addition to the IST High Bay Building on North Campus and authorized issuing the
project for bids and awarding a construction contract providing that bids are within the
approved budget.
Medical Research Laboratory Facility Project
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted a recommendation for the appointment
of Polshek Partnership Architects for the Medical Research Laboratory Facility. Regent
McGowan moved approval of the recommendation, and Regent Horning seconded the
motion.
Regent Taylor left the meeting at this point, at 10:30 a.m.
President Bollinger commented that he is pleased at the progress that has been
made to date in the Life Sciences Initiative. He noted that the project involves
improving and enhancing the connections among the schools and colleges, among
departments, and among various segments of the campus, and that it is already yielding
tremendous benefits for students.
Provost Cantor said that a set of four interdisciplinary introductory courses for
undergraduates covering a broad array of subjects in the life sciences has already been
set up, and these build on the connections mentioned by President Bollinger.
Executive Vice President Omenn commented that the Life Sciences Initiative is
incorporated into many activities at the Medical School, and the Life Sciences Institute
and Medical Research Laboratory Facility are vital components of it.  He also
commented that the Biological Sciences Scholars Program has had a very positive
effect on faculty and student recruitment.


361




June Meeting, 2000


Regent Newman inquired whether there were sufficient financial resources to
pursue this project. Executive Vice President Kasdin and Executive Vice President
Omenn responded that funding has been identified for this and the Life Sciences
Institute, two critically important projects for the University.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan Hospitals (UMH) Autoclave Technology Project
Executive Vice President Omenn noted that this project for replacement of the
University Hospital Incinerator had been previously endorsed by the Hospitals'
executive board and has been viewed with great favor by the Ann Arbor community.
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Horning, the Regents
unanimously approved the UMH Autoclave Technology Project, as described in the
revised Regents Communication.
M-Care Bylaws
Executive Vice President Omenn described proposed technical revisions to
Article IV, Section 4.02, Paragraph 1 of the M-Care Bylaws. On a motion by Regent
Brandon, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved revision to
Article IV, Section 4.02, Paragraph 1 of the M-Care Bylaws, as described in the
Regents Communication.
Regents' Meeting Schedule for 2001
Given the absence of two board members, it was decided to table this item until
the next meeting.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 10:45 a.m. The
next meeting is scheduled for July 13-14, 2000.
Lisa A. Tedesco

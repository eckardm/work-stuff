JULY MEETING, 2004


The JUnivers.ity oft Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thurstday, July 15, 2004
The Regents convened at 1:25 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and White.
Also present were Provost Courant, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President
Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice
President Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and
Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Deitch and Regent Taylor were absent.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She commented on the fiscal year
2005 budget and noted that it is a particularly challenging time, given the uncertainty of
the state budget situation and the continued reduction in the University's appropriations
funding. She pointed out that the Ann Arbor campus has had to cut nearly $20 million
more from the 2005 budget, in addition to the $37 million cut last year.
President Coleman updated the Regents on recent developments surrounding the
Sexual Assault, Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC). She noted that changes
are being made to SAPAC that will enable it to enhance professional services in critical
areas and to provide a greater degree of counseling for sexual assault survivors. In
response to concerns that have been expressed at public comments and elsewhere, the
University has decided to retain its campus crisis line but to have it staffed by full-time
professionals with specialized training. In addition, space modifications will be made
within the counseling services area. Continued dialogue and feedback will be very
important to ensure that community needs are being met.
President Coleman also noted that University Housing staff is exploring a range of
options to accommodate the record first year class arriving in fall 2004. She said that
there would be a detailed discussion in the fall of the Residential Life Initiative, which
would include a plan for long-term comprehensive renewal of the residence hall system.
Introductory Comments - 2004-2005 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
Executive Vice President Slottow stated that maintaining the University's financial
health requires that the chief financial officer effectively track and manage financial
performance, protect and strengthen the balance sheet, evaluate proposed operating
budgets to ensure they maintain the University's overall financial health, and identify
long-term financial challenges and develop alternative strategies. In addition, this officer
is required to ensure adherence to core financial principles in difficult financial times.
Executive Vice President Slottow described how each of the responsibilities listed
above are carried out. In the area of tracking and managing financial performance, he
noted that there is a continued focus on financial controls and compliance, as illustrated
by continued unqualified audit opinions, the oversight of the Regents' Finance, Audit
and Investment Committee, and the operations of the Financial Controls Task Force,
which has redefined many of the University's core transactions. The Financial Controls


1




July Meeting, 2004


Task Force has also issued a fiscal responsibilities policy, which defines the core
financial responsibilities of supervisors and managers at all levels of the University. He
described some of the dozens of initiatives that are underway that continue to leverage
administrative system investments in financial operations and student business
administration areas, including a number of areas which were formerly done on paper
or in person that can now be accomplished on-line via the web.
Executive Vice President Slottow gave an update on strategic procurement
activities. These include pre-negotiated prime vendor contracts, which save an average
of 22% compared to prior prices or $7.5 million annually; managed contracts for basic
supplies purchased through MStores, which has resulted in $9.7 million in savings
annually; and in utilities, which has yielded $4.6 million in savings annually. He also
noted that the competitive procurement process for purchases over $5,000 has saved
approximately $30 million over prices previously paid for those items.
Executive Vice President Slottow reviewed the balance sheet and noted that the
relationship of total assets to total liabilities and of debt to financial resources is
healthy. He also commented that liabilities do not include the $1 billion commitment
needed to fund retiree health benefits for active employees. Deferred maintenance
needs of $600 million to $800 million are also not included in liabilities.
Mr. Slottow displayed a graph illustrating that the University continues to invest
more money into existing facilities than in new facilities, which has contributed to the
favorable ratio of total renovation costs versus replacement costs. He also described the
savings and efficiencies yielded through practices in proactive cash management.
Mr. Slottow pointed out that human capital is one of the University's most
valuable assets.  He noted that representation of minorities and women on the
University of Michigan staff is higher than that for the work forces of both the state and
the local region. Among the investments being made in human capital are a redesign of
the classification system, ongoing benefits design, encouraging increased participation
in flexible spending accounts, creation of the office of institutional equity, and
successful completion of labor agreements.
Indications of prudent liability management include strong credit ratings, a prudent
policy, aggressive interest expense management, and obtaining the lowest premium
rates for insurance coverage. He noted that there are a number of key challenges in
maintaining the University's healthy financial condition and pointed out that the annual
operating budget is only one indicator of the University's financial condition. He
concluded that the proposed budget is consistent with maintaining the University's
overall financial health and quoted from a statement by Moody's Investors Service that
the University's Aaa bond rating is based on the University's disciplined budget
process, appropriate expense controls, powerful market draw, diversified revenue base,
manageable plans for borrowing, and a capable management team.
Ann Arbor Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee
Rates
Provost Courant displayed a slide denoting the current funds budget totals by fund
for all campuses for 2004-2005. Total revenues will total $4.231 billion, while total
expenditures will total $4.287 billion. The seeming discrepancy in revenues and


2




July Meeting, 2004


expenditures is due to a technicality in accounting methods for capital expenditures in the
Auxiliary Activities Fund.
Provost Courant presented the General Fund budget for the Ann Arbor campus.
He cautioned that the assumptions on which the budget is based may not hold, due to
the fact that the higher education appropriation has not yet been approved by the state
legislature. He said that the current understanding is that if campuses limit the increase
in resident undergraduate tuition to 2.8%, 3% of the 5% midyear cut made in 2003-04
will be restored in their base appropriation. If tuition is not held to the incentive
amount of 2.8%, campuses will receive a further 3%  reduction to their base
appropriations.
Provost Courant noted that the budget is based on six guiding principles. The
most important of these is that the University will assure that students continue to have
access to an excellent "Michigan" education despite an environment of decreasing
revenues. This includes the long-standing commitment to meeting the demonstrated
financial need of all resident undergraduate students. The focus on students is also
demonstrated in the budget by increasing the number of sections for heavily subscribed
courses and by increasing expenditures for a number of vital programs in the Office of
the Vice President for Student Affairs. Other guiding principles include assuring that
the University is thoughtful and honest about budgeting and that it focuses on the long
term. The result will be that once the budget crisis has eased, the University will have
maintained its historical depth and breath of academic excellence.
Provost Courant noted that the total budget challenge amounts to $50.7 million,
including cost increases in general operating expenses and essential new initiatives such
as responding to increased demand for some courses, improving computer security, and
increased costs surrounding the research enterprise and admissions procedures. This
challenge is being met through expenditure reductions, including elimination of staff
and faculty positions, reduction in the use of overtime, temporary employees, and
consultants, and in other areas.
Provost Courant displayed graphs illustrating various factors in the relationship
among General Fund revenues, state appropriation, and tuition over a period of decades.
Comparing the University of Michigan's 2004-05 tuition increase for resident
undergraduates to those of the other Big Ten institutions, he pointed out that Michigan's
increase is the lowest among the Big Ten for the current year as well as the average for
the past five years. He noted that three Big Ten institutions have higher tuition for
resident freshmen students than Michigan.
Provost Courant gave further details of General Fund cost reductions that have
been made in centralized operations, including $20.1 million continued savings
achieved in energy costs, pharmacy benefits, health insurance, and other areas; and
non-centralized cost containment and expenditure reductions of $19.8 million achieved
in academic programs, academic support, and administrative areas.
Provost Courant then presented the recommended 2004-2005 General Fund budget
of $1,163,382,000.00 and a tuition and fee rate increase of 2.8% for resident
undergraduate students and 5% for most other students. He noted that if the state's
tuition restraint incentive changes materially, or if the state reneges on its


3




July Meeting, 2004


appropriations/tuition increase proposal or enacts a mid-year funding recision, revisions
to the tuition and fee rates will be requested.
Provost Courant commented that in the face of budgetary challenges, the
University's primary obligation is to maintain its excellence and to insure its
availability to students regardless of their financial circumstances. The focus on
academic programs requires a high-quality faculty and staff, and the requested budget
and tuition and fee rates are designed to ensure that these goals are reached. To that
end, he requested approval of proposed operating budget and tuition and fee rates.
Regent McGowan asked for an update on the current status of the budget within
the legislative process.  Vice President Wilbanks reported that there is still no
resolution, as state policy makers have been working for several weeks to come to an
agreement on what revenues will be available to support higher education as well as
other budget priorities.
President Coleman commented that the Cherry Commission is dealing with the
long term implications of some of these issues. The previous day she had had
discussions with a number of legislators and the lieutenant governor, and it did not
appear likely that there would be an immediate resolution.
Dearborn Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Chancellor Little commented that maintaining academic quality is the main principle
that guided preparation of the Dearborn campus budget. Other principles include
preserving accessibility through maintaining current levels of financial aid, and continuing
to create and nurture an equitable and humane workplace. He noted that there has been
broad participation in developing a budget which would serve the campus's priorities
while being consistent with fiscal realities.
Chancellor Little commented that enrollment growth is central to the campus's
recent and continued success, and the 2004-2005 budget is based on an assumption of
1.5% enrollment growth of 1.5%, while aiming at 3.0% growth. Revenues raised
through enrollment growth will fund a small number of new faculty positions as well as
increases in financial aid greater than the increase in tuition. The budget also reflects a
2% reallocation (about $1 million) from academic and other departments and a salary
program of 1.5%.
Flint Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Chancellor Mestas noted that the past year had been the most challenging in his
experience and that the coming year promises to be equally challenging. During the past
year, the combination of budget cuts and enrollment decline forced implementation of
decisions that had a severe impact on the life of the University. He noted that although
the Flint campus had been unable to provide salary increases, it had continued to function
without a loss in academic quality and with a minimal disruption in services. He reported
that resources provided by Vice President Rudgers and President Coleman had helped to
alleviate the consequence of the large cut that had been made to Michigan Television.
Chancellor Mestas cautioned that the temporary sacrifices that were made during
the past fiscal year could not be maintained without doing permanent harm to the Flint
campus and to the education provided to its students. Specifically, it would be


4




July Meeting, 2004


"'inconceivable" to go another year without providing adequate compensation to faculty
and staff. At the same time, he praised the solidarity shown by faculty and staff in the
face of the drastic measures that had to be made last year.
Chancellor Mestas noted that the 2004-2005 budget had been developed with
broad participation by the campus community and reflects assumptions and planned
expenditures addressing the top priorities. Assumptions include a flat enrollment and
adhering to a tuition increase that is in accordance with the agreement reached by the
state legislature. The budgetary priorities include enrollment growth to meet the
campus's capacity of 8,000 students, which will be challenging because the UM-Flint is
a commuter campus in the middle of an area experiencing a population decline. The
second priority is improving compensation for faculty and staff through a 3% salary
increase. The third priority is to ensure that the amount of financial aid matches the
increase in tuition. The fourth priority is to maintain the high quality of technology.
Comments from President Coleman
President Coleman commented that the University supports the efforts of the
legislature and governor to keep higher education affordable and is pleased that they have
developed a plan that will restore a portion of its base funding. Restraining the rate of
tuition increase has resulted in continuing cuts to programs across the University.
However, she repeated that this is not a long-term funding model and that a more
sustainable model for higher education funding needs to be found that achieves not only
affordability, but academic excellence. Tuition restraint, she emphasized, must be
coupled with more robust and predictable state support in addition to an emphasis on
financial aid.
Division of Student Affairs Budget
Vice President Harper noted that while the Division of Student Affairs was initially
asked to plan for a budget reduction in 2004-2005 of up to 5 percent. However, due to her
concern that a reduction of this magnitude would harm the University's ability to provide
sufficient support to student communities, she has worked with President Coleman and
Provost Courant to identify resources that would protect student affairs from cuts and
restore some funding that had been cut in previous years. Internal reallocation has led to
increased funding for a number of efforts, including enhanced safe space for sexual
assault survivors, restoration of funding for the Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs
programs and the Powwow; expanding a position in the Office of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
and Transgender Affairs; and additional support for student activities and leadership
efforts and the International Center. She noted also that funding has been set aside from
investment proceeds to provide infrastructure repairs and improvements and interior and
exterior enhancements for the William Monroe Trotter House Multicultural Center.
In addition, Vice President Harper noted that $80,000 in recurring funds has been
identified to support the long-term development of multicultural programs connected
with the Trotter House. Due to this commitment, the leadership of Michigan Student
Assembly decided not to bring forward a request for a $1.00 student fee increase to
support Trotter House.

July Meeting, 2004


2004-2005 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
Vice President Harper commented that the University is focusing its efforts on
keeping student programs and services as strong as possible under current budget
constraints. She noted that the recommended fees remain the same as the 2003-2004 rates
of $6.69 per student per term for MSA, $5.50 per student per term for SLS, and $1.50 per
student per term for school/college governments.
Proposed FY 2005 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Harper reported that the University Health Service fee allows
students to have unlimited visits, laboratory testing, X-rays, and other services without
additional out-of-pocket costs. It also supports extensive health education programming
across the campus. Due to reductions in revenue streams, market-driven increases in
salaries and commodities, and increased regulatory costs, a rate increase of 5.4%, to
$137.37, per term is being requested.
Michigan Student Assembly Financial Report
Vice President Harper submitted the Michigan Student Assembly financial report for
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) FY 2005
Operating Budget
Executive Vice President Kelch reported that the goals of the budget are to achieve
an operating margin consistent with the 10-year financial plan to facilitate investments in
new facilities, information technology, Medical School faculty, and routine capital
requirements and to support the goals and objectives of the Hospitals and Health Centers.
Just to maintain these at current levels will require more than $800 million over the next
decade. He explained that senior leadership at UMHHC is focused on achieving moderate
growth within capacity constraints; keeping fixed costs fixed plus inflation; limiting
increases in variable costs to activity plus inflation; increasing prices according to a
pricing plan; and making improvements in throughputs and capacity.
Executive Vice President Kelch displayed a chart illustrating the operating margin
trend from FY 1999 through FY 2005. He commented that the expected operating
margin for FY 2005 will exceed the amount originally budgeted for. Dr. Kelch
reviewed details of the FY 2005 operating budget of $1.281 billion, which includes an
operating margin of 4.0%. He noted that it is an ambitious, but achievable, budget that
is necessary to fulfill the mission, goals, and aspirations of the University of Michigan
Health System.
Regent Brandon congratulated Dr. Kelch and his colleagues on the terrific job they
have done in managing the Health System.
Discussion of 2004-2005 Budgets
Regent McGowan moved approval of the following budgets: 2004-2005 Revenue
and Expenditure Operating Budgets; Proposed Ann Arbor FY 2004-05 General Fund
Operating Budget; Proposed Ann Arbor FY 2004-05 Student Tuition and Fee Rates;
Proposed Dearborn Campus FY 2004-05 General Fund Operating Budget; Proposed

FY 2004-05 General Fund Operating Budget; Proposed Flint Campus FY 2004-05
Student Tuition and Fee Rates; 2004-2005 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student
Assembly (MSA), Student Legal Services (SLS), and School/College Governments;
Proposed FY 2005 University Health Service Fee; Proposed FY 2005 University of
Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers Operating Budget. Regent Newman seconded the
motion.
Discussion of Proposed Budgets
Regent Newman observed that she is troubled by the state being involved in the
tuition-setting process for state universities, as this is the responsibility of the governing
boards. She stated that while she understands why it is necessary to move forward and
accept the offer made by the legislature, she is concerned about having no choice but to
vote in favor of this budget. She stated that she would support it but is troubled by the
fact that it is happening. She believes it is a mistake on the part of the board to go along
with it, and she would not support it in subsequent years.
Regent McGowan stated that she appreciates the tough choices the University was
forced to make this year, and she hopes that the legislature will eventually respond
favorably to the Board's willingness to go along with its proposal. She noted that the
Regents appreciate the efforts being made on each of the three campuses to not allow
their effectiveness to be compromised.
Regent Brandon associated himself with the remarks of Regents Newman and
McGowan and noted that he will not respond favorably to any more proposals from the
legislature that dictate tuition rates for the University. Regent Richner agreed and noted
that this situation is unprecedented.
Regent Maynard commented that the budget situation was really difficult this year
because of the proposal put forth by the legislature. She said she supported the
proposed budget and respects that the excellence of the academic setting must never be
sacrificed.
Regent White stated that Michigan citizens need to reevaluate their priorities and
understand that there is a cost associated with high quality and to understand that taxes
are necessary to provide necessities. She concurred that this is the last year the Board
will be willing to accept deals from the legislature and that after this year, quality will
start to suffer if the fiscal situation does not improve.
The vote was then taken, and the motion to approve all of the 2004-2005 budgets
was approved unanimously.

FY 2005 Athletic Department Operating Budget
Athletic Director Bill Martin next presented the FY 2005 Athletic Department
operating budget. He noted that in 2003 the graduation rate for Michigan student-athletes
(82%) was almost the same as that for the general student body (84%). In the area of
athletic performance, he reported that Michigan had come in second to Stanford
University in the prestigious Directors Cup for 2003-04, and that Michigan had won 8 Big
Ten championships and the CCHA hockey championship. Seven of the Big Ten
championships were won by women's teams.
Mr. Martin reviewed historical financial trends and the FY 2003-2004 financial
performance for the Athletic Department. Since 2001, the department has maintained
an operating surplus, with a projected surplus for 2003-2004 of about $8.0 million. The
projected surplus for 2004-2005 will be about $2.3 million. He reviewed revenues and
expenses for FY 2003-2004 and noted that projected revenues from gifts increased by
more than 26%. Increased sales of student football tickets have led to a decrease in
ticket revenue due to the lower price charged for these tickets.         However, he
emphasized that student ticket demand will continue to be fulfilled. He also pointed out


11




July Meeting, 2004


that expenses are impacted by the need for the department to fund out-of-state tuition
for the 70% of student athletes who are not Michigan residents.
Mr. Martin noted that the balance sheet is in good shape, with $11.7 million in
operating reserves, $25 million in scholarship endowment, a quasi-endowment fund of
$16 million, and a deferred maintenance fund which provides a stable resource for
facility renewal.
Mr. Martin noted that the work plan for Fiscal Year 2004-2005 includes
implementation of the priority seating program, construction of the Academic Center,
continued focus on fundraising for capital projects and scholarship endowment, and
continued study and analysis of press box and stadium renovation.
Regent White left the meeting at this point, at 2:55 p.m.
Medical School Update
Provost Courant noted that Dean Lichter had recently been reappointed for another
five-year term as dean of the Medical School and observed that the school had recently
been reaccredited with extraordinarily high scores. Executive Vice President Kelch
commented that the school is thriving under Dean Lichter's leadership, and that he has
never been part of a reaccreditation review  that had received such strong
recommendations.
Dean Lichter noted that the Medical School, the Hospitals and Health Centers, and
M-Care have been integrated into a single organization, the University of Michigan
Health System, which, through its executive group, reviews all major decisions,
allocates resources, settles issues among the main units, and sets a unified strategy.
Dean Lichter described the new Medical School curriculum that was implemented in
2003-04 and noted that it features earlier clinical experiences and is web-enhanced for
distance and time-independent learning.  He described the "Family Centered
Experience" in which pairs of students are matched with volunteer patient families for
ongoing home visits and discussions of experiences with chronic or serious illness.
Following each home visit, students participate in theme-based discussions facilitated
by trained faculty.
Dean Lichter noted that this past year the Medical School had undergone a review
by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) which resulted in an
extraordinarily positive review. He described some of the areas of research currently
underway in which the Medical School is a national leader. He noted that in 2003 the
Medical School ranked 1lth among medical schools in NIH funding in a field of
extraordinarily stiff competition and described how these rankings have changed over
time among the leading institutions. Dean Lichter expressed excitement about progress
being made toward completion of the Biomedical Sciences Research Building (BSRB),
but he noted that a good deal of additional space is still needed to house the expanding
research faculty who have been recruited.
Dean Lichter then turned to measures that can be used to assess the quality of
clinical operations, which include process, outcome, safety, and appropriateness. In all
of these measures, the University is at or near the top of the scale compared to other
leading institutions. In addition, the Medical School was ranked seventh in a recent
national ranking. He expressed confidence that in all of the areas discussed the


12




July Meeting, 2004


University of Michigan Medical School will advance further and continue to enhance
its reputation in the years to come.
A five-minute break followed, from 3:20-3:25 p.m.

indicated: David Johnson, student, Steven Albee-Scott, student, John Norton, student, on
changes in family housing; Jim Mogensen, citizen, on the town-gown relationship; Carol
Dunitz, alumna, on her book, Louder Than Thunder; Mark Hindelang, student and
president of the University Activities Center (UAC), on the Regents' support of UAC; and
David Boyle, alumnus, on second-best SAPAC solutions.
Committee Reports
Regent McGowan announced committee appointments for the coming year. Regent
Brandon will continue as chair of the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, and
Regent Maynard will continue as chair of the Compensation and Personnel Committee.
She stated that, in general, the committee chair assignments will circulate among the
Regents, but given the current juncture of each committee in pursuing its work, she felt it
was important that the current leadership remain in place for the coming year. The other
members of the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee will be Regent White and
Regent Taylor. Regent Richner and Regent Deitch will serve on the Compensation and
Personnel Committee.
Finance, Audit, and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and that both Regent White and Regent Taylor had
been present. The committee received a regular bimonthly update from the interim
director of University audits, Fred White, who assured the committee that there were no
irregularities and that he was receiving a high level of cooperation from the
administration. Other topics included a review of risk management and an update on
the Sarbannes-Oxley work plan. He reported that the committee was continuing work
on a draft of a new, more comprehensive charter.
Compensatiion and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard reported that she
and Regent Richner had met that morning; Regent Deitch had been unable to attend.
They met with the president and provost to discuss processes established for succession
within the University leadership, and began discussion of a work plan for September
2004.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.
inutes Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of June 17, 2004.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report, the
Plant Extension Report, the Quarterly Report on Non-Competitive Purchases over
$5,000 from Single Sources, and the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report.
Regarding the Plant Extension report, Executive Vice President Slottow reported that
since the installation of the million-gallon storm water retention basin under the Palmer


13




July Meeting, 2004


Drive parking deck and the new storm water collection system on North Campus, no
flooding has occurred and sediment has been removed from the discharge that flows
into the Huron River.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.    Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of projects
established, June 1-June 30, 2004. He updated the Board on research expenditures and
noted that the University ranked third nationally in 2001 and second in 2002. He
displayed charts showing that the University's technology transfer activities have
increased in a variety of measures, including disclosures, the number of patents issued,
license agreements, and new business startups. Total revenues have increased from
$3.5 million in 1999 to $11.7 million in 2003.
Vice President Ulaby observed that so far this year, total research expenditures
have increased about 1.4%, but federal spending for research has dropped significantly
and will continue to do so next year. To compensate, the number of research proposals
submitted by University researchers has increased significantly. He reviewed federal
research expenditure projections for FY 2005 and noted that the overall budget will
decrease about 4%. Challenges include greater competition among universities and the
fact that less money is available at the University to invest in facilities and
infrastructure.
University of Michigan Health System. No additional report was submitted.
Division of Student Affairs. No additional report was submitted.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. No additional report was submitted.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas reported that Professor Richard
Gull had been selected as the 2004 recipient of the University's Jackie Lawson
Memorial Award, which recognizes exceptional distinction in faculty governance
service.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. MSA President Jason Mironov informed
the Regents about the Housing Information Storage Center, an MSA-sponsored website
containing information about off-campus housing. He noted that, for a number of
reasons, there are major problems with off-campus housing, and the website is meant to
alleviate many of these problems. The website will include reviews of off-campus
housing units by students who have lived in them, along with advertisements by
landlords about their units.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May noted that the reports for Fiscal Year
2003-04 and for June and July 2003 will be submitted at the September meeting. He
called attention to the recent gift from Edwin and Mary Meader in support of the Kelsey
Museum.
Personnel Actions Reports. Provost Courant submitted the following personnel
actions. He noted that five faculty members were being recommended for appointment
as distinguished university professor and said that it is one of the highest honors that the
University bestows.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted 3 faculty retirement
memoirs.
George D. Cameron, III, J.D., Ph.D., professor of business law in the School of
Business Administration, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2004.
Professor Cameron received his B.A. (1953) and M.A. (1962) degrees from Kent
State University and his J.D. (1969) and Ph.D. (1975) degrees from the University of
Michigan. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1971 and was
promoted to professor in 1976.
From the beginning, Professor Cameron distinguished himself as an outstanding
teacher with enviably high teaching ratings, and he has been a cornerstone of the
business law curriculum    for B.B.A. and M.B.A. students for over two decades. He
received the students' award for teaching excellence several times as well as the B.B.A.
alumni best teacher award and the State of Michigan Undergraduate Teaching Award.
In 1998, Professor Cameron's course in enterprise organization law (LHC 306) was
named the best course on campus by the Michigan Daily. He was also named among
the school's outstanding faculty in the Business Week Guide to the Best Business
Schools.
Professor Cameron's research activity focused on Korean law, Soviet commercial
law, jurisdiction over international corporations, and Chinese law. Within the
University, he served on the Faculty Senate, the Civil Liberties Board, the Senate
Advisory Committee on University Affairs, and the University-wide Faculty Grievance
Board.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming George D. Cameron, III,
professor emeritus of business law.

July Meeting, 2004


David B. Moody, Ph.D., professor of psychology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts and research professor in the Kresge Hearing Research Institute,
retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2003.
A native of New York, Professor Moody received his B.A. degree from Hamilton
College in 1962 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University in 1964 and
1967, respectively. He pursued postdoctoral research at the University of Michigan's
Kresge Hearing Research Institute and joined the faculty as a lecturer in psychology
and a research associate in 1968. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1970,
associate research scientist in 1979, associate professor in 1980, professor in 1989, and
senior research scientist (now research professor) in 1997. He was an assistant
professor of otorhinolaryngology from 1970-79.
Professor Moody is considered a leading expert in the use of behavioral training
techniques for the assessment of auditory function in animal subjects. His early
investigations focused on discovering the relationship between hearing loss and damage
to the inner ear. These studies resulted in the development of procedures through which
various aspects of auditory perception could be assessed in non-verbal subjects. An
outgrowth of this work was a research program that evaluated specializations for
dealing with biologically relevant communication signals in non-human primates.
More recently, Professor Moody employed behavioral procedures to assess the
functional effects of various interventions to restore function to the deaf inner ear. In
addition to his research, he trained a number of students and fellows in the field of
hearing studies and participated in other areas of the teaching program in the
Department of Psychology.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming David B. Moody
professor emeritus of psychology and research professor emeritus.
Michael J. Ryan, D.B.A., professor of marketing in the School of Business
Administration, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2004.
Professor Ryan received his B.S. and M.B.A. degrees from Xavier University in
1969 and 1971, respectively, and his D.B.A. degree from the University of Kentucky in
1974. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an associate professor in 1981
and was promoted to professor in 1984.
Professor Ryan's major interests are in marketing management and theory,
strategic marketing planning, industrial marketing, sales management, customer
satisfaction, and linking quality, satisfaction, and profitability. He has numerous
refereed articles, book chapters, and conference proceedings to his credit, and he was an
early pioneer in the field of customer satisfaction preferences and statistical
measurement.
Professor Ryan has been a dedicated and effective teacher in all of the school's
degree programs, including the Global MBA program, the Multidisciplinary Action
Projects (MAP), and the Executive Education Program, in which he has been teaching
since its inception. He has served on numerous School of Business Administration
committees, including doctoral committees, the executive committee, and the
curriculum committee. He served as the chair of the school's marketing area from
1995-2000.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Michael J. Ryan professor
emeritus of marketing.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported this month.

Under Dean Dolan's leadership, she noted, the school has been committed to
melding theory and practice, and graduates are highly praised for their excellent
education. The Board is being asked to rename the school the Stephen M. Ross School
of Business in honor of Mr. Stephen M. Ross, who is providing $100 million to the
school, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1962. President Coleman pointed out
that this is the most generous gift in the history of the University and will provide
transformative possibilities for the school.
Regent Deitch moved to rename the University of Michigan School of Business
Administration the Stephen M. Ross School of Business. Regent White seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously.

Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan applaud the 16
members of the University of Michigan faimily who participated in the
Twenty-eighth Olympiad in Athens, Greece.
In sports ranging from rowing and swimming, to track, wrestling,
and the triathlon, the University was well-represented -- and represented
well -- by current andformer student athletes and coaches at the 2004
Olympic games.    We salute them for achieving the pinnacle of
recognition in their respective sports.
The Regents take great pride in Michigan's Olympic athletes of
the past, present, and future who have and will continue to so nobly
uphold the honor and tradition of the yellow and the blue.


29




September Meeting, 2004


A standing ovation followed. Coach Warhurst thanked the Board on behalf of all
of the resolution recipients. President Coleman again praised the athletes and coaches
and commented on how proud the University is of the volunteer service contributed by
Bill Martin to the U.S. Olympic Committee. She noted that after having led the
organization through a restructuring process, he graciously ceded his responsibilities
once the newly-formed leadership was in place.
A five-minute break followed.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman commented on the successful conclusion of the "Welcome
Week" activities for newly arriving students. She also called attention to the recent
recognition of the gift of $100 million from Stephen Ross for which the Regents had
approved renaming the School of Business Administration the Stephen M. Ross School of
Business, and she announced that this school had just been named the number one
business school in the nation by the Wall Street Journal.
President Coleman also discussed the recently-instituted advertising campaign
calling for the community to "Take a Stand Against Sexual Violence," and she
displayed some of the print advertisements that have been created to enforce this
message.
Residential Life Initiatives
President Coleman commented that Vice President Harper and Carole Henry,
assistant vice president for student affairs and director of housing, would next present the
results of a study on residence life and would outline a comprehensive, ten-year plan, for
major renovations to Michigan student housing. President Coleman noted that the
University's residence hall system currently does not adequately meet students' needs.
The goal is to create interactive neighborhoods within the residence halls to foster the
sense of community and also to expand the connections between students' residence lives
and academic lives. The residence system will be renewed in a way that supports
collaborative learning and living communities in a digital age.
President Coleman noted that as part of her presidential initiatives, she had
established a task force to recommend innovative approaches for linking students'
academic and residential experiences. These recommendations will be used to help
shape the renewal plan, which includes construction of a new residence hall, major
renovations to two existing halls, technology upgrades, new dining concepts, and
completion of life safety initiatives at a total cost of $250-$280 million. Specific
project requests will be submitted for approval later in the fall. She thanked Vice
President Harper, Assistant Vice President Henry, and the University Housing team for
their efforts and input into the planning process.
President Coleman introduced Vice President Harper, who announced that
following the presentation and discussion of the Residential Life Initiative findings and
recommendations, specific action items for each component in the plan would be
submitted in upcoming board meetings. She introduced Carole Henry, assistant vice
president and director of housing, and noted that she had led successful housing renewal
efforts at other institutions prior to her recent arrival at the University of Michigan.


30




September Meeting, 2004


Ms. Henry gave a slide presentation updating the Board on the Residential Life
Initiatives (RLI), which, she noted, is basically a master plan for student housing
covering a ten-year period through 2014. The plan's guiding principles include creating
inclusive, supportive communities that provide a variety of learning experiences and
foster connections between life inside and outside of the classroom. She pointed out
that University residence halls and dining halls are critical to the undergraduate
experience, and they provide a different experience than that provided by the private
housing sector.
The RLI's guiding principles include: 1) creating inclusive communities where
students participate fully and take responsibility; 2) fostering connections between the
in- and out-of-classroom experience; 3) supporting students in ways that are consistent
with the University's mission, ideals, and traditions; and 4) providing a variety of
learning experiences. She noted that the housing system currently consists of 17
residence halls, 5 apartment complexes, 12 dining halls, and 5 retail operations, with a
total of almost 4.7 million square feet and $89 million in revenue. These facilities were
built between 1915 and 1972 and are in need of renewal.
Ms. Henry reported that there is a certain baseline experience that the University
would like to provide for its students, and current facilities do not meet contemporary
standards related to technology, study space, privacy, and dining. Security, safety, and
accessibility also need updating. She noted that the undergraduate population has
increased by over 7.5% over the past 30 years but capacity has remained the same, at
about 9,600.  Because the University has historically guaranteed housing for all
first-year students, the size of the freshman class has an enormous impact on facility
configuration and program offerings. When the last residence hall was completed in the
late 1960s, the first year class averaged 4,500 students, as compared to 5,100 students
during the 1990s and almost 5,500 from 1999-2003.
Ms. Henry described the planning process that had been used to develop the
Residential Life Initiatives and noted that a broad range of input had been gathered.
Key findings are that there is a demand for more housing, especially among
undergraduate and single graduate students. The type of housing desired is suite and
apartment-style units, along with conveniently located dining facilities that have a wide
variety of quality food, combined with a convenience store or snack bar to supplement
the dining hall offerings. She pointed out that small dining facilities are inefficient and
more costly to operate than larger halls, and she noted that of the existing dining halls,
the two largest have the highest satisfaction rates among students.
Ms. Henry reported that the RLI analysis had yielded several planning guidelines.
These are that the University needs to reinvest in its current facilities to preserve them
for future generations; selected residence halls should be renovated in priority order,
although life safety upgrades will be made in all halls; construction of at least one
residence hall will be necessary to meet demand; and the renovation of existing housing
will result in units that meet contemporary standards, including suites or apartments, as
well as life safety, electrical, mechanical, and technology standards.
In renovation  and new    construction, the planning  guidelines state that
undergraduate students are the first priority; student experiences will be personalized


31




September Meeting, 2004


and will be in small, welcoming communities with clusters of 20-25 students.
Connections will be enhanced between experiences within and outside the classroom.
Preliminary recommendations in the ten-year plan for student housing, which will
cost between $250 million to $280 million, include construction of one or more new
residence halls on a site that will complement campus planning efforts. Two
architecturally distinctive buildings, Mosher-Jordan and Stockwell will be in the first
priority for renovation. Next in priority will be Barbour and Newberry Halls and West
Quad. Ongoing capital projects and improvements in the remaining facilities will
continue at an annual rate of $7 million to $10 million. Life safety improvements,
including fire alarm upgrades and installation of fire suppression systems, upgraded
wiring, and IT system improvements are also planned.
The RLI also includes major, comprehensive improvements in residential dining
facilities involving a substantial reconfiguration of dining operations to incorporate
contemporary lifestyle and menu preferences of the student population. These will
include "marketplace"-style facilities that are envisioned for new dining centers in the
"Hill" and central campus neighborhoods. In some residential neighborhoods there will
be supplemental retail operations, such as snack bars or convenience stores. There will
also be "emporiums," which are a blend of a restaurant and convenience store.
Ms. Henry displayed the preliminary planning calendar for programming, design,
and construction of the Residential Life Initiatives. They include completion of
programming and design of one of the Hill dorms, a new dining center/emporium, a
new residence hall, and fire alarm and suppression projects, along with installation of
fire alarm and fire suppression systems at certain halls by the end of the Fall Term,
2004. The preliminary calendar delineates other projected programming, design, and
construction projects through 2008. She noted that the projected opening date for the
first renovated residence hall, new residence hall, and new dining center is Fall 2008,
and she said that the design of the new and renovated spaces will remain flexible to
ensure their utility well into the future.
Regent Newman commented that throughout her ten years as a member of the
Board, she had been advocating for new housing on campus, and she asked when the
new hall is expected to be completed. Ms. Henry responded that the schedule calls for
the new hall to open in fall 2008, along with a new dining hall and a completely
renovated existing hall, either Mosher-Jordan or Stockwell. Regent Newman said that
the Regents have been urging the president to move forward with this project because
the need for new housing is long-standing.
Regent Deitch expressed agreement with Regent Newman's comments and noted
that most board members share her feelings about the urgency of the need for new
housing on campus. Regent Maynard observed that the board would like to see specific
recommendations as soon as the next meeting.
Regent McGowan asked for assurance that the new facilities would be flexible
enough to be able to adopt to the needs of students decades from today. Ms. Henry
responded that all of the facilities would be designed with flexibility and multi-purpose
use in mind, and said that this is one reason that new structures would not include
communal bathrooms. And she pointed out that all halls are constantly being renovated
and updated as part of the general maintenance process.


32




September Meeting, 2004


Regent Newman commented that consideration must also be given to ongoing
maintenance costs for these projects and questioned whether maintenance costs were
higher for apartment-style bathroom arrangements than for large communal bathrooms.
Ms. Henry responded that maintenance costs are often more favorable for smaller
bathrooms because students take ownership of them and that maintenance costs are
included in the overall project evaluation. President Coleman agreed that this is a
critical question and that financial operations staff continually take maintenance and
operational costs into account in planning new projects. Executive Vice President
Slottow added that the design teams for all new buildings include building services staff
who will be responsible for maintaining the buildings once they are built.
Regent Brandon expressed concern about the logistics of accomplishing major
renovations in existing residence halls.  Ms. Henry responded that during the
renovations of both Mosher-Jordan and Stockwell Halls, the halls (one at a time) would
be closed for a full year. The 450 beds lost would be made up, and capacity
maintained, by using some apartments in Northwood. Work such as roof replacements
can, with careful planning, be accomplished with minimal disruption to academic life.
She said that the manner in which capacity is used in such locations as Northwood can
be reallocated and reconfigured to suit undergraduate students.
It was noted that it is not anticipated that there would be a first-year class as large
as the current one, so the Northwood space currently being used to house all students
who wished to live on campus this year would be available to serve as surge space in
the future. Executive Vice President Slottow pointed out that previously it was thought
that new construction and renovations of existing buildings could not be done
simultaneously. But the creative use of existing space described by Ms. Henry has led
to the realization that this is not the case.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and that both Regent White and Regent Taylor had been
present. The committee reviewed audit results for FY 04 with representatives of the
external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. He noted that it was an unqualified report and
that details of the audit would be discussed at the October meeting. The committee
members also met privately with the external auditors and were assured that there had
been a good level of cooperation, communication, and information exchange with internal
staff.
Regent Brandon reported that the committee had also reviewed a draft of a revised
committee charter that will eventually be brought to the full Board for consideration.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard reported that the
committee, consisting of her, Regent Deitch, and Regent Richner had met that morning.
They first planned the committee's work calendar for 2004-05 and then reviewed
searches currently underway for four new deans and the process to be used for future
dean searches, in consultation with the president and provost.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.

Stephen A. Eklund, D.D.S., Dr.P.H., professor of dental public health in the
School of Public Health and adjunct clinical professor of dentistry in the School of
Dentistry, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2004, after a most productive
career as a distinguished researcher and teacher.
Dr. Eklund received his B.S., D.D.S., M.H.S.A., and Dr.P.H. degrees from the
University of Michigan in 1969, 1973, 1977, and 1981, respectively. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in dental public health in 1979 and was
promoted to assistant professor in 1981, associate professor in 1987, and professor in
2001. Dr. Eklund received an additional appointment as assistant professor of dentistry
in 1981. He was appointed adjunct associate professor in 1992 and adjunct clinical
professor in 2002.
Dr. Eklund is widely acknowledged, both nationally and internationally, as one of
the leaders in his field. Several of his publications have been highlighted by journal
editors and are described as classics with exceptionally high impact, and a textbook he
co-authored is considered the standard for the field. His efforts to meld research in the
epidemiology of oral disease with research on the provision and financing of dental care
have created a new model of research outside of the usual "boxes." After many years of
intense efforts, Dr. Eklund was able to accumulate a unique and unmatched set of
records that provide the most comprehensive population-based data on dental treatment
ever assembled, covering 60-70% of the child population and nearly 40% of the adult
population in Michigan since 1991. As a result of this work, he is now acknowledged
as one of the best dental epidemiology methodologists in the world.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Stephen A. Eklund professor emeritus of dental public health.

lecturer in 1980 and was promoted to instructor in 1981 and assistant professor in 1982.
In 1991, Professor Foss was appointed director of the athletics and recreation
office. In this position, she coordinated the health and physical education curriculum,
which offered a wide variety of health, physical, and recreational courses. Under her
steadfast management, the campus's athletic program grew to include women's
volleyball and basketball; men's basketball, hockey, lacrosse, and soccer; and
intramural and recreational sports. Professor Foss also invested a great deal of time and
talent to the inception, planning, and completion of the Wellness Center. Built in 1998,
this state-of-the-art health and physical exercise facility is available for use by
university students, faculty, and staff and by area residents.
Professor Foss has been a recipient of the Faculty Recognition Award and the
Distinguished Service Award, and she served on the Advisory Committee on

Professor MacCallum conducted research on the structure and interaction of oral
epithelia and the epidermis with underlying supporting tissues and developed model
systems that are still in use today to permit the reformation of oral and skin epithelia
outside the body. He is an expert in the microscopic organization of tissues and organs.
Professor MacCallum also studied the cornea of the eye and developed methods for
studying how the loss of the inner cellular lining of the cornea results in blindness.
Most recently, he developed model systems that facilitated formation of the tongue
outside the body which are used to study the signaling pathways that operate during
development with special emphasis on the formation of nervous system taste pathways.
As course director for 20 years, Professor MacCallum provided crucial
leadership in maintaining the quality of the medical histology course. He developed a
computer-based teaching program  in basic histology that is widely used in
undergraduate and graduate programs at Michigan and elsewhere. All of the current
teaching faculty in cell and developmental biology have benefited from his mentorship.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated
service by naming Donald K. MacCallum professor emeritus of cell and developmental

Mary R. Townsend, senior associate librarian in the University Library, retired
from active faculty status on June 30, 2004, after a long and distinguished service of
thirty-one years.
A native of Columbus, Ohio, Ms. Townsend received her B.S.Ed. degree from

Michigan in 1974. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
librarian in the Public Health Library in 1974 and was promoted to associate librarian in
1977 and senior associate librarian in 1981.
As head of the Public Health Library from 1982-93, Ms. Townsend not only
provided reference services and helped to develop the collection, but she also created
and maintained a pamphlet collection and oversaw the serials collection.  From
1990-2000 she led the Information and Library Studies Library, and from 2000-04 she
was a rare book librarian in the Taubman Medical Library. Within the medical library,
Ms. Townsend expanded her knowledge of rare book practices and book conservation
and provided an enhanced level of service, including in-depth consultations with
scholars as well as public open houses and exhibitions.
Ms. Townsend's career in the University Library was marked by almost
constant change, both in the schools with which she was associated and in the services
the libraries provided. Primary among these changes was the evolution from print
resources only to the mixture of print and electronic resources prevalent today. Among
Ms. Townsend's many strengths were her keen problem-solving skills and her ability to
effectively communicate with faculty members. A life-long learner, she pursued
education throughout her career to help her meet professional and career challenges.
She was active in numerous professional associations, including the Public

provide funding for the salary of Ms. Proft and her secretary as well as the operating
expenses of the corporation. CTA will pay the University rent of $20 per square foot
per year plus $6.18 per square foot per year for utilities for the period of July 1, 2004
to June 30, 2005. Costs will increase by the greater of 2.5% or the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) annually on July 1, 2005; July 1, 2006; July 1, 2007; and July 1, 2008.
3.   There is no pecuniary interest as Fawwaz T. Ulaby, a University of Michigan
employee, will receive no compensation for his service as a director and officer of the
corporation.
Joan and Sanford Weill Hall Project
President Coleman noted that in June 2004 the Joan and Sanford Weill Hall Project
in the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy had been approved for bids and awarding of
construction contracts, providing that bids were within the approved budget. She reported
that the University had received two pre-bid cost estimates that were very similar.
However, all of the six bids received from construction companies for the project came in
higher than anticipated; the low bid was provided by Clark Construction Company.
To complete the project as originally presented, therefore, a request is being made
for approval of revising the project budget from $32 million to $35 million. Regent

September Meeting, 2004


McGowan moved approval of the revised budget for the Joan and Sanford Weill Hall
Project, and Regent Deitch seconded the motion.
Regent Brandon commented that from his perspective as chair of the Finance,
Audit and Investment (FAI) Committee, it is not a good precedent for the board to
approve a project of this scope and scale and find out later that cost estimates were
incorrect. He said that due to the critical nature of this project and to a number of
factors involved, he would make an exception and vote in favor of the revised budget.
However, he suggested that the board and FAI Committee will need to examine
carefully the process being used to arrive at budgets for major projects in an effort to
prevent this situation from reoccurring.
Regent Richner stated that due to the importance of this project, he would support
the revised budget. However, he expressed his hope that the University would continue
to look for ways to cut costs and make due with the original budget.
Regent Maynard agreed and noted that she will support the motion but hopes that
the University can learn from this experience how a project could cost more than
originally estimated.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project
Vice President Ulaby noted that the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project was
originally established as a memorial to people who died during World War II, for the
purpose of examining peaceful uses of atomic energy. Since then, interest in nuclear
energy has changed, and the Ford Nuclear Reactor that was part of the project was
deactivated in July 2003. The current proposal is to expand the scope of the project to
include research on the development of all forms of energy.
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the expanded scope of the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project,
as described in the Regents Communication.
Correction to Degree Program Name
Chancellor Little commented that the name of the new degree program, "Master of
Arts in Public Policy," approved by the Board in July 2004, was erroneous. The correct
name of the degree program is "Master of Public Policy."
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved correcting the name of the University of Michigan-Dearborn
degree program, "Master of Arts in Public Policy," to "Master of Public Policy."
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Jim Mogensen, citizen, on the town-gown relationship; Amy Keller, student
and president of the Residence Hall Association, on the Residential Life Initiative; and
David Boyle, alumnus, on not business as usual.

OCTOBER MEETING, 2004


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, October 21, 2004
The Regents convened at 2:15 p.m. in the Michigan Rooms, University Center, on
the campus of the University of Michigan-Flint. Present were President Coleman and
Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White.
Also present were Provost Courant, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President
Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice
President Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and
Vice President Wilbanks.
Performance
Chancellor Mestas introduced a special performance of the University of
Michigan-Flint Wind Symphony, conducted by Robert G. Southard.    The first
performance was "Lincoln Portrait," by Aaron Copland, narrated by Regent Olivia
Maynard, and the second performance was "Block 'M' March," by Jerry Bilik.
Call to Order and Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order at 2:40 p.m. She thanked Chancellor
Mestas for arranging the performance and commented on the hospitality of the campus
and the community. She noted that she had attended an event last week on campus which
marked the establishment of a new award for community service known as "The Libby,"
in honor of Regent Maynard. The ceremony was notable for its recognition of how
integral the University of Michigan-Flint is to Flint's future.
President Coleman noted that there were residence hall update and renovation
projects on the agenda that are part of the major residential life renewal initiative on the
Ann Arbor campus. She commented that the Frieze Building site had been selected as
the location for a new residence hall that would be co-located and interacting closely
with new academic space.
President Coleman noted that a celebration in honor of the 40th anniversary of the
Center for the Education of Women (CEW) had just been held, and she called on
Regent McGowan. Regent McGowan pointed out that CEW had been one of the
"parents" of the Flint Center for Women and noted that Regent Maynard had attended
the celebration held the previous weekend.
Regent Maynard commented that at the celebration she had read letters in honor of
the 40th anniversary from both the Regents and President Coleman. To her, the most
remarkable testament was that in response to the question of how many people in the
room had been helped by CEW, almost everyone stood up. This speaks to the value of
CEW, not only to Ann Arbor and the other UM campuses, but around the country.


95




October Meeting, 2004


Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard reported that the
committee had conducted an evaluation of President Coleman's performance during the
summer. She had received a solid evaluation, and she will be working with the committee
during the year to ensure that her goals and visions will come to fruition.
Regent Maynard noted that the committee had approved a proposed salary
increase for President Coleman. She emphasized that the amount of the recommended
increase would be independent of the evaluation, as prior to the evaluation President
Coleman had requested that she receive no more than a two percent raise as a
commitment to fiscal responsibility. For that reason, the committee is recommending to
the full board only a two percent raise.
Regent Maynard reported that the remainder of the committee meeting was spent
discussing proposed changes to the committee bylaw and charter.
President's Salary. Regent McGowan moved that President Coleman's salary be
increased by two percent, effective September 1, 2004. Regent Taylor seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Finance, Audit, and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and that both Regent White and Regent Taylor had
been present. The committee reviewed the most recent draft of the proposed revised
charter, which is almost complete.
Annual Report of Investments. The committee also received the Annual Report
of Investments, presented by Erik Lundberg, chief investment officer. Mr. Lundberg
reported that as of June 30, 2004, total endowment funds equaled nearly $4.2 billion,
and the University Investment Pool was just over $1.5 billion. Combined with the
University's other assets (Veritas, M-Care and subsidiaries, and others), the
University's financial assets total just over $6 billion. Regent Brandon reported that
from 2003 to 2004 the endowment had increased by $700 million. Compared to its
one-year benchmark, the portfolio achieved a gain of 20.7%, exceeding the average
benchmark performance by 4.6%. Compared with the three-year benchmark, the
portfolio outperformed it by 3.8%, and compared with the five-year benchmark, the
portfolio achieved a 5.8% better performance.
Regent Brandon reported that the University Investment Pool, consisting of shorter
term funds, doubled the industry benchmark for one year and also bettered the
three-year and five-year benchmarks. He praised Mr. Lundberg and his colleagues for
"a truly outstanding performance." Mr. Lundberg responded that the work is the result
of a team effort, involving individuals in a number of offices across the University.
Regent Brandon reported that the committee had also met with Laura Patterson,
associate vice president for administrative services, and Paul Howell, chief information
technology security officer, regarding information technology security and disaster
recovery.
The committee was also updated on internal audits, welcoming newly appointed
executive director of internal audits Carol Sennef along with interim executive director
Fred White. The auditors assured the committee that all interactions with University


96




October IMeeting, 2004

last update was in the area of health benefits initiatives, from Laurita Thomas, associate
vice president and chief human resource officer, and Tim Wood, director of benefits.

October IMeeting, 2004


Martin B. Einhorn, Ph.D., professor of physics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2004.
Professor Einhorn received his B.S. degree from the California Institute of
Technology in 1965 and his Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1968. He was a
postdoctoral fellow at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory (1968-70), Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory (1970-72), and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
(1972-73), and a staff physicist at the latter from 1973-76. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an associate research scientist in 1976 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1979 and professor in 1983.
Professor Einhorn's research spans a broad range of topics in relativistic quantum
field theory and focuses on relating theory to existing or potential experimental results.
His work includes studies of cosmology and phase transitions in the early universe,
quantum gravity, the cosmological constant problem, and superstring theory. He was
editor of the book, The Standard Model Higgs Boson. Professor Einhorn also played a
significant role in government and university advisory positions. He was a member of
the original national panel that established the Institute for Theoretical Physics and a
member of the Department of Energy's High Energy Physics Advisory Panel. He
served on the executive committee of the Division of Particles and Fields of the
American Physical Society, was deputy director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics
at the University of California-Santa Barbara, and was a long-time consultant for the
Department of Energy. Within the University, he served on the Department of Physics
Executive Committee and chaired the Research Policies Committee for the vice
president for research and the Financial Affairs Advisory Committee for the executive
vice president and chief financial officer.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Martin B. Einhorn
professor emeritus of physics.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported this month.
However, President Coleman announced and commented upon the deaths of two
individuals: Thomas M. Donahue, Edward H. White II Distinguished Professor
Emeritus of Planetary Science, professor emeritus of physics, and professor emeritus of
atmospheric, oceanic, and space sciences; and Gail W. Rector, president emeritus of the
University Musical Society.
Degrees. Provost Courant submitted for approval final degree lists for April 2004
and August 2004 commencements and approved changes to previously approved degree
lists.
Approval of Consent Agenda. On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by
Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
Annual Report of Investments
The Regents received the Annual Report of Investments as of June 30, 2004.
Alternative Asset Commitment
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of up to $25 million from the Long Term Portfolio to
Graham Partners II L.P.

October Meeting, 2004


Alternative Asset Commitment
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of $20 million from the Long Term Portfolio to
Elevation Partners, L.P.
Alternative Asset Commitment
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of up to $50 million from the University Investment
Pool to Canyon Capital Realty Advisors to manage a Mortgage Investment Account.
University of Michigan Financial Statements for the Year ended June 30, 2004
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that the Regents had received the
comprehensive certified financial statements for fiscal year 2004 in September and had
just received the report about the statements from the Finance, Audit and Investment
Committee. He reported that the external auditors had issued an unqualified opinion and
praised the team that had compiled the financial statements.
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the University of Michigan Financial Statements for the Year
ended June 30, 2004.
Regent Richner inquired about whether there is a different rating system for the
long-term debt issued for the University of Michigan Health System as opposed to the
rest of the campus. Executive Vice President Slottow explained the rating system and
noted that each bond issue has its own specific rating. When bonds are issued to
support hospital activities, they are generally backed only by hospital gross revenues,
which receive their own rating. Regent Richner inquired whether hospital debt could be
issued under general University debt to take advantage of lower interest rates.
Executive Vice President Slottow responded that some institutions do operate in this
manner, and that this is a policy issue with pros and cons that needs to be explored with
the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee.
Executive Vice President Slottow called attention to the condensed version of the
financial report that had been prepared in cooperation with the offices of the vice
president for development and vice president for communications.
Athletic Department Junge Family Champions Center
On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the schematic design for the Junge Family Champions Center
project and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding construction contracts,
providing that bids are within the approved budget.
Replacement of Jordan Hall Elevator in Mosher-Jordan Residence Hall
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved the Jordan Hall Elevator Replacement Project in Mosher-Jordan
Hall as described and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding construction
contracts, providing that bids are within the approved budget.

Executive Vice President Slottow commented that this project represents the first of
the major "Residential Life Initiatives" projects and is meant to address infrastructure and
life safety needs in West Quad. It includes fire protection enhancements, information
technology upgrades, and a new electrical substation to provide enhanced capacity and
reliability.
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent White, the Regents

Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   The parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
SensiGen, Inc.
2.   The licensing terms grant SensiGen, Inc., an exclusive license with a right to grant
sublicenses to UM File No. 1758. SensiGen, Inc., will reimburse the University's
patent expenses and pay patent expenses incurred during the license term. The terms
of the agreement also include a license fee, equity, royalties on net sales, minimum
annual fees, and developmental milestones.

NOVEMBER MEETING, 2004


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, November 18, 2004
The Regents convened at 2:45 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and
White. Also present were Provost Courant, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice
President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,
Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, Vice
President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent Taylor was absent; Regent White left at about 4:00 p.m.
Call to Order and Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order at 2:40 p.m. She commented on some
recent, noteworthy University events, including the groundbreaking for Weill Hall which
was attended by President Ford. She called attention to the Hill Dining Center request
that is on the agenda, as well as several other items. President Coleman also commented
on the importance of maintaining the University's core academic quality while continuing
its commitment to affordability. She noted that a recent study had concluded that after the
various types of financial aid are considered, the real cost of a public university education
among the state's 15 higher education institutions, including the University of Michigan,
is less now than it was in 1998. This is the result of the University's commitment to
providing financial aid at a rate equal to or greater than tuition increases each year.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning, with Regent White in attendance and Regent Taylor
absent. The committee received written reports on the first quarter of FY 05 for the Life
Sciences Institute and the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers
(UMHHC). He noted that the UMHHC results are above budget and congratulated the
leadership on this accomplishment. Other agenda items included a discussion with Carol
Senneff, executive director of University audits, and a discussion of the overall University
debt structure and strategy with Associate Vice President Peggy Norgren, Treasurer Greg
Tewksbury, and Assistant Treasurer Milagros Dugan. He commented that the balance
sheet is very strong in every category compared to competitive benchmarks.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard reported that the
committee had met that morning. In addition to herself and committee members Regent
Deitch and Regent Richner, participants had included Regent McGowan, Vice President
Tedesco, and President Coleman. The committee had conducted a final review of its
proposed revised charter and bylaws. It had also reviewed the status of current dean
searches with Provost Courant and had discussed the annual report of SACUA with
chair Stan Berent.

November MIeeting, 2004


College of Engineering Strategic Assessment
Provost Courant noted that after becoming provost, he had initiated a process
involving regular strategic assessment of all academic units at a rate of about two per year.
Assessments are conducted by two committees, one internal to the University but external
to the school or college, and the other external to the University. He noted that the overall
assessment of the College of Engineering had been highly positive, and he introduced
Dean Stephen Director.
Dean Director gave a slide presentation describing the college and its programs.
He noted that all of its departments are ranked among the top ten nationally, and he
highlighted some of the notable achievements of its graduates. He commented that
although the college has twice the national average of women and underrepresented
minority undergraduate students, it is committed to enrolling more. To that end, the
college has developed a partnership with the Atlanta University Consortium, under
which the college has enrolled its first class of dual-degree engineering program
students from Morehouse and Spellman Colleges. The college is also committed to
increasing the diversity of its graduate student body and its faculty.
Dean Director described some of the entities created to address the "grand
challenges" that provide a focal point for research in the college. These include the
NSF Engineering Research Center (ERC) in Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems,
the NSF ERC for Wireless Integrated MicroSystems, the Automotive Research Center,
and the Dioxin Exposure Study. Other advances developed by College of Engineering
faculty include engineered cementitious composite (used for bridges), "animal on a
chip," and advanced brain machine interfaces. Dean Director commented that almost
50% of the University's technology transfer activities are generated by the College of
Engineering.
Dean Director concluded by noting that the college's participation in the
"Michigan Difference" campaign had been dubbed "Progress and Promise" and would
allow the college to achieve its vision through construction of new facilities and
enhancement of educational programs.
Regent Deitch observed that the College of Engineering is "one of our gems" that
has gone from strength to greater strength, and he asked about the dean's goals for the
coming years. Dean Director responded that the college will focus on addressing the
grand societal challenges. This will require significant technological innovation and
collaboration with other schools and colleges. Other challenges will include continuing
to provide educational programs that will allow students to go on and have an impact on
the world.
Regent White commented on the number of international students in the doctoral
programs. Dean Director responded that 47% of the college's graduate students are
international, which is low compared to many other colleges of engineering. He noted
that it is desirable for the college to have a large percentage of international students, as
those who attend the University of Michigan are among the best in the world.
However, the college has also been working hard to continue to attract American
students.


122




November Meeting, 2004


Regent Richner inquired as to how the college had responded to the difficult
budget situation of recent years. Dean Director responded that the administration was
able to take some measures centrally to reduce the impact of budget cuts on programs,
although some programs have had to be reduced and some classes consolidated. The
college was able to absorb some of the impact of budget strain by increasing the number
of students and increasing research funding.
In response to a question from Regent Brandon about the challenges faced by the
college over the next five years, Dean Director responded that he mostly sees
opportunities. The most notable challenges involve recruiting and retaining outstanding
faculty and ensuring the college's accessibility for students. With respect to recruiting
and retaining women and minority faculty, he noted that to ensure that the environment
is supportive, the college has worked on improving family-friendly policies and
addressing the needs of dual career couples. Increasing the number of minority faculty
has been a difficult challenge, one which requires continued attention.
Annual Report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA)
Professor Stanley Berent, chair of SACUA, delivered the committee's annual report.
He pointed out that the relationship between formal faculty governance and the
University's executive officers is exemplary. He identified the following seven issues that
represent the current focus of SACUA's work: 1) faculty quality of life issues; 2)
evaluation of administrators by faculty; 3) tenure/non-tenure track faculty; 4) the
importance of tenure to the institution; 5) shared governance; 6) grade inflation and
alteration; and 7) research support for junior faculty.
Professor Berent also described some of the recent SACUA activities, including
the annual Faculty Governance Luncheon, the annual meeting, the work of the
Administration Evaluation Committee, the Regent Candidates Forum, and the Davis,
Markert, Nickerson Lecture on Academic and Intellectual Freedom. He acknowledged
with appreciation the role of faculty representation that the Regents has granted to
SACUA and noted that the positive atmosphere of collegiality that results allows an
informed faculty perspective to influence important institutional decisions.
Annual Operating Requests to the State
Ann Arbor Campus. Provost Courant reported that state officials had indicated
that no funding would be available for new initiatives and pointed out that the
University's costs are expected to increase in FY 2006 by $30-$35 million. The request
for the Ann Arbor campus is for restoration of as much as possible of the $43.5 million in
appropriation that had been reduced since FY 2002, and that the state not tie its action on
the state appropriation to tuition restraint. Regarding the criteria that should be used in
determining the amount of state appropriation, he noted that the University of Michigan
leads the state in such measures as number of degrees awarded, graduation rates, spin-off
companies, amount spent on financial aid for Michigan residents, ability to attract
sponsored research from outside the state, and jobs created in the state.
eaborn   Campus.    Chancellor Little noted that the cumulative effect of
reductions in appropriations on the Dearborn campus has been extremely harmful. The
campus is requesting restoration of the $3.1 million that has been cut over the last three
years and an increased allocation of $1 million.


123




November Meeting, 2004


Flint Campus. Chancellor Mestas said that the Flint Campus is requesting
funding that will allow it to continue to provide an excellent education at a reasonable
cost. Specifically, funding is needed to increase the number of faculty positions, to
continue to expand campus technology, and to enhance community partnerships.
Although the request reflects the genuine need of the institution, they realize this level
of funding is not likely to be met.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of October 21, 2004.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report, the
Plant Extension Report, and the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report.
Liitigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of projects
established, October 31, 2004. He reported that expenditures are up 5.5% compared to
this time last year.
University of Michigan Health System.    Executive Vice President Kelch
commented that the Hospitals and Health Centers had recently completed the joint
accreditation commission survey and that the outcome was remarkably positive. He
called attention to the appointment of Karin Muraszko as chair of the Department of
Neurosurgery. Provost Courant concurred that this was a "spectacular" appointment
recommendation.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper observed that the business
agenda includes a request for approval of another significant step in the Residential Life
Initiative: the renewal of residence hall dining operations. The Hill Dining Center will
allow the University to offer a dining program that is better suited to their preferences
and expectations, and it will include a "marketplace" dining environment.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little called attention to the
reappointment of Subrata Sengupta as dean of the College of Engineering and
Computer Science.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas commented that four alumni of
the University of Michigan-Flint had been either elected or re-elected to office during
the recent election. He also reported that Provost Renate McLaughlin had announced
her retirement, and he praised the leadership she had provided during her long tenure.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Jason Mironov, president of MSA,
introduced Amy Keller, president of the Residence Halls Association. Ms. Keller
announced that the University of Michigan had just been named "School of the Year"
by the Great Lakes Affiliate of College and University Residence Halls. Mr. Mironov
noted that Ms. Keller had also won the "Student of the Year Award" by the residence
halls association.


124




November Meeting, 2004


Mr. Mironov commented that MSA mid-term elections were underway. He
informed the Regents that MSA would be requesting a fee increase for fiscal year
2004-05 and noted that the organization was only able to fill 23%      of the funding
requests it had received this year. He said that a new framework is being developed for
making internal funding decisions.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted the Report on Voluntary
Support for October, 2004, and thanked the Regents and executive officers for their
support of the building dedication events for the Gerald R. Ford School of Public
Policy.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted one faculty retirement
memoir.
Robert K. Lindsay, Ph.D., professor of psychology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts; research professor in psychiatry in the Medical School; and
research professor in the Mental Health Research Institute, retired from active faculty
status on August 31, 2004.
Professor Lindsay received his B.S. (1956) and Ph.D. (1961) degrees from the
Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and his M.A.
degree (1957) from Columbia University. From 1960-65 he was on the faculty of the
University of Texas. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as associate
professor and research psychologist in 1965 and was appointed research psychologist in
the Mental Health Research Institute in 1967. He was promoted to research scientist in

November Meeting, 2004


1974, senior research scientist in 1997, professor in 2001, and research professor in
2003. He was also associated with the University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
and the Center for the Study of Complex Systems.
Since the inception of the field of artificial intelligence, Professor Lindsay has
made significant contributions, including extensive review and critical analysis of the
field. Early in his career, he modeled the understanding of utterances to help define and
solve the problems computers have with understanding natural language--a significant
departure from the statistical and syntactical approaches to language processing at the
time. Professor Lindsay contributed to expert systems that endow computers with the
decision-making capabilities used by human experts, and he collaborated on the
DENDRAL project, one of the earliest expert systems and the defining contribution of
the field. He was a pioneer in diagrammatic reasoning; one of his key influences was
the use of inference by simulation as a basis for using diagrams to understand concepts
in mathematics. His recent research uses computer simulations of variations of genetic
algorithms to discover possible genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of
complexity.

RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF
GENERAL REVENUE BONDS AND PROVIDING FOR
OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO
WHEREAS, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer") is a
constitutional body corporate established pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the
Michigan Constitution of 1963, as amended, with general supervision of the University
of Michigan (the "University") and the control and direction of all expenditures from
the University's funds; and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties and in order to properly
serve the needs of students attending the University, the Issuer has authorized the
acquisition, construction, installation and equipping of the capital improvements
described in Exhibit A (collectively, the "Project"); and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously issued its General Revenue Bonds (the
"Outstanding Bonds"), in several series, and other obligations secured by a lien on
General Revenues, and has reserved the right to issue additional series of General
Revenue Bonds, secured on a parity basis with the Outstanding Bonds and other
obligations by General Revenues (as defined in Trust Agreements pursuant to which
the Outstanding Bonds were issued); and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously issued and has outstanding bonds, notes
or other obligations (collectively, the "Senior Lien Indebtedness") payable from and
secured by liens on certain revenue streams of the University, including Student Fees,
Housing System Revenues and Medical Service Plan Revenues (sometimes known as
Patient Care Revenues), and it may be appropriate and economic to refund all or a part
of the Senior Lien Indebtedness; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has issued and has outstanding Commercial Paper
Notes, Series F (the "Series F Notes"), and Series E (Taxable), (the "Series E Notes",
and together with the Series F Notes, the "Notes"), which are payable from and secured
by General Revenues and it may be appropriate and economic to refund all or a part of
the outstanding principal of the Series F Notes; and
WHEREAS, the financing of all or a portion of the Project and the refunding
of a portion of the Senior Lien Indebtedness and the Series F Notes through the
issuance of General Revenue Bonds will serve proper and appropriate public purposes;
and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties, and in order to control
and direct prudently expenditures from the University's funds, the Issuer determines it
is necessary and desirable to authorize the issuance of General Revenue Bonds (the
"Bonds") in order to provide funds which, together with other available funds, will be
used to pay all or part of the costs of the Project, the costs of refinancing a portion of
the Senior Lien Indebtedness and the Series F Notes, and costs incidental to the
issuance of the Bonds and the refinancing; and


147




November Meeting, 2004 - Appendix A


Remarketing Agreement (the "Remarketing Agreement") or a Broker Dealer
Agreement (the "Broker Dealer Agreement") with the Underwriter setting forth the
terms and conditions upon which the Underwriter will agree to purchase the Bonds and
the interest rates thereof and the purchase price therefor; and
WHEREAS, in order to be able to market the Bonds at the most opportune
time, it is necessary for the Issuer to authorize the Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, the Associate Vice President for Finance, and the Treasurer (each an
"Authorized Officer") or any one of them individually, to negotiate, execute and
deliver on behalf of the Issuer, the Trust Indenture, the Bond Purchase Agreement, the
Remarketing Agreement or Broker Dealer Agreement, and other related documents, to
establish the specific terms of the Bonds and to accept the offer of the Underwriter to
purchase the Bonds, all within the limitations set forth herein; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has full power under its constitutional authority for
supervision of the University, and control and direction of expenditures from the
University funds, to acquire, construct, furnish and equip the Project, to pay all or a
portion of the costs of the Project and the costs of refinancing a portion of the Senior
Lien Indebtedness and the Series F Notes by issuance of the Bonds, and to pledge
General Revenues (as hereinafter defined) for payment of the Bonds;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to determine (i) the specific amount of the cost of
each component of the Project to be financed from the proceeds of the Bonds, (ii) the
portion of the Series F Notes to be refinanced using the proceeds of the Bonds, and (iii) the
portion of the outstanding Senior Lien Indebtedness to be refinanced using the proceeds of
the Bonds, based on whether such refinancing would produce interest costs savings, more
favorable debt service schedules, or more flexible documentation, and to cause to be called
for redemption such of the Senior Lien Indebtedness as is appropriate and consistent with
the foregoing objectives. The Issuer may subsequently approve additional components of
the Project and specify that such additional components shall be financed in whole or in
part from the proceeds of the Bonds, upon which occurrence such components shall
thereupon become components of the Project hereunder.
2. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Bonds in one or
more series to be designated GENERAL REVENUE BONDS, with appropriate series
designations, if any, in the aggregate original principal amount to be established by an
Authorized Officer, but not to exceed the principal amount necessary to produce proceeds
of One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000). The Bonds shall be dated as of the date or
dates established by an Authorized Officer, and shall be issued for the purpose of providing
funds which, together with other available funds, will be used to pay all or a portion of the
costs of the Project, all or a portion of the costs of refinancing a portion of the Series F
Notes, all or a portion of the costs of refinancing a portion of the Senior Lien Indebtedness
and the costs related to the issuance of the Bonds and the refinancing, including capitalized
interest, if any for such period as an Authorized Officer may determine appropriate, and
bond insurance premiums, if appropriate. The Bonds shall be serial Bonds or term Bonds,
which may be subject to redemption requirements, or both, as shall be established by an
Authorized Officer, but the first maturity shall be no earlier than April 1, 2005 and the last
maturity shall be no later than December 31, 2037. The Bonds may bear no interest or may
bear interest at stated fixed rates for the respective maturities thereof as shall be established
by an Authorized Officer, but the weighted average yield (computed using the stated
coupons and the stated original offering price) for the Bonds shall not exceed 6.5% per
annum, and the Bonds may be issued in whole or in part as capital appreciation bonds,
which for their term or any part thereof bear no interest but appreciate in principal amount
over time at compounded rates (not in excess of 7.0% per annum) to be determined by an
Authorized Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds may bear interest at a variable


148




November Meeting, 2004 - Appendix A


rate of interest for all or a portion of their term, and the variable rate of interest shall not
exceed the lesser of the maximum rate permitted by law or the maximum rate, if any, to be
specified in the Trust Indenture. In addition, all or part of the Bonds may be issued in
related series, one of which bears interest at a variable rate and one of which bears interest
at a residual rate determined by subtracting the variable rate from the fixed rate paid by the
Issuer, but the combined rate on such Bonds, taking the two related series together, which
shall be determined by an Authorized Officer, shall not exceed 7.0% per annum. The
Bonds may be subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the times and
prices and in the manner as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but no
redemption premium shall exceed 3% of the principal amount being redeemed. Interest on
the Bonds shall be payable at such times as shall be specified by an Authorized Officer.
The Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form in denominations, shall be payable as to
principal and interest in the manner, shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be
executed and authenticated, all as shall be provided in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds shall
be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement for a price to be
established by an Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of original
issue discount, shall not exceed 0.7% of the principal amount thereof) plus accrued interest,
if any, from the dated date of the Bonds to the date of delivery thereof.
In relation to the debt service on the Bonds any of the Authorized Officers may, at any time,
on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into an interest rate swap, cap, forward
starting swap, option, swaption or similar agreement or agreements (collectively, the "Swap
Agreement") with a counter-party or counter-parties to be selected by the Authorized
Officer. Such Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the Issuer and the
counter-party related to interest on all or a portion of the Bonds, or to indexed or market
established rates. If the Swap Agreement is entered at approximately the same time as the
issuance of the Bonds, the expected effective interest rates on the Bonds, taking into
account the effect of the Swap Agreement, shall be within the limitations set forth herein.
Any Swap Agreement in the form of an option, swaption or forward starting swap, may, if
the Bonds to which such agreement relates are not ultimately issued, be required to be
terminated, with a possibility of a resulting termination payment due by the University.
Any or all of the Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the option of the
holder thereof. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any Bonds subject to tender options
may be made payable from General Revenues, from available cash reserves of the
University, subject to such limitations as may be specified in the Trust Indenture, or from a
letter of credit, line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity device, or
one or more of the same, or any combination thereof (collectively, the "Liquidity Device"),
all as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer. The Liquidity Device, or any part
thereof, may also be used to provide liquidity for any other indebtedness or obligations of
the Issuer, including the Notes, the Outstanding Bonds, any variable rate Senior Lien
Indebtedness and any variable rate Hospital Revenue Bonds. Any reimbursement obligation

deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any agreements or instruments necessary to obtain,
maintain, renew or replace, and provide for repayments under, any Liquidity Device
deemed by such officer to be required for the purposes of this Resolution. In the alternative,

November Meeting, 2004 - Appendix B


NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE
UNJIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Bonds of the Issuer
to be designated as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer (but which designation shall
include the words "HOSPITAL REVENUE BONDS") with appropriate series designation, in
the aggregate original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but not to
exceed the principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of $160,000,000, to be dated as of
the date or dates established by an Authorized Officer, for the purpose of providing funds
which, together with other available funds, may be used to pay all or a portion of the costs of the
Project, to pay all or a portion of the costs of refinancing a portion of the Series F Notes, and to
pay costs incidental to the issuance of the Bonds and the refinancing, including capitalized
interest, if any for such period as an Authorized Officer may determine appropriate, and bond
insurance premiums, if any. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to determine the specific
amount of the cost of each component of the Project to be financed from the proceeds of the
Bonds, and the portion of the Series F Notes to be refinanced with the proceeds of the Bonds.
The Issuer may subsequently approve additional components of the Project and specify that such
additional components shall be financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of the Bonds,
upon which occurrence such components shall thereupon become components of the Project
hereunder. The Bonds shall be serial Bonds or term Bonds, which may be subject to redemption
requirements, or both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first maturity
shall be no earlier than June 1, 2005 and the last maturity shall be no later than December 3 1,
2037. The Bonds may bear no interest or may bear interest at stated fixed rates for the
respective maturities thereof as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the weighted
average yield (computed using the stated coupons and the stated original offering price) for the
Bonds shall not exceed 6.500 per annum, and the Bonds may be issued in whole or in part as
capital appreciation bonds, which for their term or any part thereof bear no interest but
appreciate in principal amount over time at compounded rates (not in excess of 7.0%0 per annum)
to be determined by an Authorized Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds may bear
interest at a variable rate of interest for all or a portion of their term, and the variable rate of
interest shall not exceed the lesser of the maximum rate permitted by law or the maximum rate,
if any, to be specified in the Series Indenture. In addition, all or part of the Bonds may be issued
in related series, one of which bears interest at a variable rate and one of which bears interest at
a residual rate determined by subtracting the variable rate from the fixed rate paid by the Issuer,
but the combined rate on such Bonds, taking the two related series together, which shall be
determined by an Authorized Officer, shall not exceed 7.O0% per annum. The Bonds may be
subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the times and prices and in the
manner as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but no redemption premium shall
exceed 300 of the principal amount being redeemed. Interest on the Bonds shall be payable at
such times as shall be specified by an Authorized Officer. The Bonds shall be issued in fully
registered form in denominations, shall be payable as to principal and interest in the manner,
shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be executed and authenticated, all as shall be
provided in the Series Indenture. The Bonds shall be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the
Bond Purchase Agreement for a price to be established by an Authorized Officer (but the
Underwriter's discount, exclusive of original issue discount, shall not exceed 0.7%o of the
principal amount thereof) plus accrued interest, if any, from the dated date of the Bonds to the

line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity device, or one or more of the
same, or any combination thereof (collectively, the "Liquidity Device"), all as shall be
determined by an Authorized Officer. Any reimbursement obligation for draws under the
Liquidity Device shall be a limited and not a general obligation of the Issuer, payable from
Hospital Gross Revenues (as defined in the Master Indenture), and may be secured by a pledge
of Pledged Hospital Gross Revenues (as defined in the Master Indenture), and may, additionally
or alternatively, be payable from General Revenues and may be secured by a pledge of General
Revenues, as an Authorized Officer shall determine appropriate. Any Authorized Officer is
authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any agreements or instruments
necessary to obtain, maintain, renew or replace, and provide for repayments under, any
Liquidity Device deemed by such officer to be required for the purposes of this Resolution. In

officer or agent thereof, as individuals, either directly or indirectly, nor shall the Bonds or any

Hospital Gross Revenues and the moneys from time to time on deposit in certain of the funds
established by the Master Indenture and the Series Indenture or the Swap Agreement or
documents entered into in connection with the Liquidity Device; provided, that as set forth
above, the Issuer's obligations under the Liquidity Device may be made payable from, and may
be secured by a pledge of, General Revenues.
Any pledge of Pledged Hospital Gross Revenues, General Revenues, and funds specified in the
Master Indenture, Series Indenture, Swap Agreement or agreements entered into in connection
with the Liquidity Device, if any, shall be valid and binding from the date of the issuance and

DECEMBER MEETING, 2004


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, December 16, 2004
Panel Discussion: "New Technology, Libraries, and Scholarship"
The formal meeting was preceded by a panel discussion on the topic of new
technology, libraries, and scholarship.  The event took place at the Video and
Performance Center in the Duderstadt Center on North Campus, from 2:00-3:00 p.m.
Panelists were Professors Margaret Hedstrom, Paul Courant, Daniel Atkins, James Hilton,
and John Wilkin, associate University librarian.
Regents' Meeting
The Regents convened at 3:25 p.m. in the Lurie Engineering Center on North
Campus. Present were President Coleman and Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan,
Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Vice President
Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President
Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regent Deitch was absent.
Call to Order and Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order at 3:25 p.m. She announced that
University of Michigan students had received two of the world's most prestigious
academic awards. Joseph Jewell, a graduate student in aerospace engineering, was named
a Rhodes Scholar, and Jacob Bourjaily, an undergraduate student majoring in physics and
mathematics, has received a Marshall Scholarship. She expressed the University's
enormous pride in these most distinguished achievements.
Regent McGowan commented that at a future date, the Regents would invite Mr.
Jewell and Mr. Bourjaily to be recognized at a Regents' Meeting. She observed that
these are very significant awards and noted that the University's last Rhode's
scholarship recipient, Fiona Rose, went on to earn a Ph.D. in classical studies from
Oxford University and is now a faculty member there. The Regents look forward to
having the two latest honorees join them to celebrate this fantastic achievement.
President Coleman reported that she had recently participated in an event in
Washington at which the National Innovation Initiative Report was presented to the
president and federal government officials. The purpose of this study, commissioned by
the Council on Competitiveness, was to determine what the country needs to do to stay
competitive in the global economy. The same day, the report of the statewide Cherry
Commission which had been appointed by the governor to look at issues of economic
development, was submitted as well. She commented that she had been a member of
both of these groups and that both had come to many of the same conclusions.


159




December Meeting, 2004


Education, investment in science and technology, and support of entrepreneurship
emerged as principal themes of both reports.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning, with Regents Taylor and White in attendance. The
committee was briefed by Provost Courant, Associate Provost Philip Hanlon, and
Executive Vice President Robert Kelch about the business model for development of the
General Fund budget, including revenue allocations, transfer costs, treatment of gifts, and
other issues. Next, the committee met with Associate Vice President Peggy Norgren,
Controller Cheryl Soper, and Ed Jennings, corporate tax manager, on issues regarding tax
exposure and risk and compliance issues pertaining to tax matters. The committee also
had a brief update on the Sarbannes-Oxley work plan and met with Carol Senneff,
executive director of University audits, regarding results of the October and November
audits. The committee also met privately with Ms. Senneff and was assured that the
University auditors have been receiving a high level of cooperation with management.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard reported that the
committee had met that morning, with Regents Deitch and Richner in attendance. The
three topics covered included a discussion with President Coleman about the executive
officer evaluation process, a discussion with Provost Courant about the process of
evaluation of deans, and a review of the annual salary report, which will be released to
the media on Monday, December 20.
Parking and Transportation Update
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that a parking and transportation strategic
plan had been presented to the Board in September 2004, and an update will be presented
annually. He introduced Mr. Dave Miller, director of parking and transportation.
Mr. Miller commented that the department's philosophy is to provide mobility
options and transportation choices, and not just to add parking spaces as the University
grows. He said that challenges include responding to growth in employment of faculty
and staff, as well as providing off-site parking for contractors, meeting the
transportation needs of students, enhancing the University's relationship with the Ann
Arbor Transportation Authority (AATA), promoting alternative transportation options,
delivering new parking facilities, and maintaining existing parking facilities.
Mr. Miller noted that all structures are now controlled by "Automatic Vehicle
Identification" (AVI) devices, which not only help limit unauthorized access to parking
structures, but allow for perpetual permits for employees, saving more than $40,000
annually in the cost of renewals. There is also a new handicap parking decal program.
Mr. Miller observed that the UM buses now transport 4.7 million passengers per
year, up 7% from last year, and that additional service hours and routes were added this
fall in response to the increased population of students on North Campus. He described
the new "MRide" program, which provides free AATA rides for UM faculty, staff, and
students, noting that this program had no impact on the department's budget due to the
use of federal transit funds. The program has resulted in a 12% increase in AATA
ridership, with the University now accounting for 40% of AATA ridership. Compared


160




December Meeting, 2004


with the joint UM and AATA programs that were in place in 2003, MRide has resulted
in a ridership increase of 92%. It was noted that much of the success of the program
among the student population can be attributed to a very successful marketing campaign
explaining how students can receive free transportation around the entire campus region
through MRide.
Mr. Miller noted that the University also provides a van pool service that is free to
users, and he said that usage has tripled over the past 3 years. Regarding parking
structures, he pointed out that a 450-space structure for patients and staff is being
constructed at the site of the Cardiovascular Center and that the remaining half of the
1,000-space Palmer Drive structure had been opened on Central Campus. The Ann
Street parking structure, which will have 536 spaces, is expected to open in the spring
of 2006. He commented that a future parking deck is planned for Division Street,
parallel to the Thompson Street structure. Since 1998, a net total of 1,300 faculty and
staff ("blue") parking spaces have been added on central campus, along with 1,300
remote spaces. Another net total of 1,000 "blue" spaces will be added on the central
and medical campuses by 2007.
Mr. Miller reviewed the plan for parking rate increases previously provided to the
Board at the February 2004 meeting. Over the next three years, "gold" permits will
experience the highest increase, to make them comparable to rates charged by the City
of Ann Arbor for downtown parking. He commented that all of the steps the
department has taken resulted in its being the first Midwest university to be recognized
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as one of "Best Workplace for
Commuters." He reviewed possible locations for new parking decks and transportation
plans for 2008 and beyond.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of November 18, 2004.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report, the
Plant Extension Report, and the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of projects
established, November 30, 2004.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Kelch called
attention to the retirement memoir for Dr. Lazar Greenfield, who had served as interim
executive vice president for medical affairs.
ivsion of     tden  Affairs.  Vice President Harper acknowledged the
exceptional leadership being provided by the leaders of Michigan Student Assembly
and the Residence Halls Association.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little called attention to the
Urban Environmental Outreach Program, which brings scientific and environmental
education to underserved elementary school students, and to the completion of the


161




-villicember Mteeting, 20)04


thermal spray laboratory, which spray-forms metal parts from CAD drawings and has
received significant external funding.
University of Michigan-Flint.      Chancellor Mestas commented that Regent
Maynard would be attending the campus's winter commencement and that for the first
time, the commencement speaker would be a recently retired staff member, Lydia
Henry. Her selection as speaker is meant to send a message of appreciation to all staff
members on the Flint campus.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Jason Mironov, president of MSA, noted

Rashid L. Bashshur, Ph.D., project director of Clinical Information Systems in
the University of Michigan Hospitals Telemedicine Program and professor of health
management and policy in the School of Public Health, retired from active faculty
status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Bashshur earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the American
University of Beirut in 1954 and 1956, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Michigan in 1963. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as
research associate in 1963 and served in that capacity until 1972. Professor Bashshur
was also appointed as a lecturer in 1966 and was promoted to associate professor in

Information Systems in the Telemedicine Center.
Professor Bashshur conducted some of the earliest research on the determinants
of choice of health plans by individuals for whom prepaid group practice plans were
among the options. He also studied the effect of geographic distance on the use of
medical and mental health services, and he later extended this line of work to more
general issues related to access to medical care, including lack of health insurance and
underinsurance.
A pioneer in his field, Professor Bashshur's contributions to the development
and evaluation of telemedicine systems span a period of over thirty years and have
earned him an international reputation. For the last six years, Professor Bashshur has

174




December Meeting, 2004


Professor Bilello is recognized as an expert in the use of high intensity x-ray
diffraction imaging, microdiffraction, grazing angle incidence scattering, and other
associated techniques as a tool for non-destructive materials characterization. These
techniques have been used to study a wide range of problems in metals, alloys, and
semiconductors where it is necessary to control the structure-property relationships on
both the micro and macro scale to achieve improved performance or to create new
materials. Currently, Professor Bilello's research is focused on surface and interface
studies in controlling the fabrication and mechanical properties of thin films and
multilayer nanocomposites and on the role of grain boundaries in fatigue and fracture.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar and teacher by naming John C.

Ejner J. Jensen, Ph.D., professor of English language and literature in the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 2004.
Professor Jensen earned his B.A. degree from Carleton College in 1959 and his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Tulane University in 1960 and 1965, respectively. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty as an instructor in 1964 and was promoted to
assistant professor in 1965, associate professor in 1970, and professor in 1979.
In both teaching and service, Professor Jensen's interests have extended beyond
the drama of the English renaissance through his thoughtful and influential reflections
on the education of young people and how they should experience poetry, drama, and
fiction. In the 1980s, he joined a team organized by the College Board to recommend
practices for Advanced Placement courses in high schools, and he was chief reader for
the AP exams for the Educational Testing Service from 1984-87. In 1983, Professor
Jensen convened an international conference on George Orwell's dystopian novel,
Nineteen Eighty-Four, to see which of the predictions Orwell had made in 1948 still
merited attention. Of the several volumes then published to examine Orwell's vision,
Professor Jensen's is by far the broadest and most thought provoking.
Professor Jensen's remarkable devotion to the University of Michigan became
evident early in his career. He served as a member of the department's executive


177




ecember Meeting, 2004


committee for 18 years, was director of First and Second Year Studies from 1997-2002,
and he was called upon regularly to serve on review and search committees. In 1992-93
he served as chair of SACUA. From 1994-97, he held the post of special counsel to the
president, and he served as interim secretary of the University in 1995. That year, he
also organized and published Changing in a World of Change: The University and Its
Public. Professor Jensen concluded his administrative service by directing the Gayle
Morris Sweetland Writing Center from 2002-03.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar, teacher, and administrator by
naming Ejner J. Jensen professor emeritus of English language and literature.
Lewis J. Kleinsmith, Ph.D., professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental
biology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active
faculty status on December 31, 2004.
Professor Kleinsmith received his B.S. degree from the University of Michigan in
1964 and his Ph.D. degree from Rockefeller University in 1968. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as assistant professor of zoology (now molecular,
cellular, and developmental biology) in 1968 and was promoted to associate professor in
1971 and professor in 1974. He was also professor of chemistry from 1979-86, research
scientist in developmental and reproductive biology from 1985-98, and faculty
counselor in the Comprehensive Studies Program from 1986-88.
In his research, Professor Kleinsmith made one of the earliest attempts to reveal
the mechanism of gene regulation. As a graduate student, he and colleagues discovered
that proteins in the cell nucleus react with phosphate molecules in the course of
activation of genes.  At Michigan, he worked to further elucidate the role of
phosphorylation of proteins of the cell nucleus in regulation of gene expression. This
area of study has become recognized as one of the most important issues in cell biology
and will improve our understanding of the molecular changes underlying cancer
development.
Professor Kleinsmith was a popular and innovative teacher of introductory biology
for many years and also taught an extremely popular course on the biology of cancer.
He believed every student could learn at a high level, and he avidly developed
educational tools to help his students succeed. In the early 1980s, he recognized the
potential power of personal computers in education, and he developed an extensive
array of educational software. He is the author of an introductory cell biology textbook
that is now in its 5th edition, and he authored several informational reports distributed
by the National Cancer Institute to the general public. Professor Kleinsmith was
awarded an Arthur F. Thurnau Professorship in 1988. He is a fellow of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science and has received numerous other honors.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Lewis J. Kleinsmith
professor emeritus of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology.

of Michigan faculty as a professor in 1988 and was appointed the A.D. Moore
Distinguished University Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in
1996.
Professor Mourou has brought great distinction to the University through his
outstanding achievements in research and scientific leadership. In 1991, he founded the
Ultrafast Science Laboratory (now the National Science Foundation Science and
Technology Center for Ultrafast Optical Science (CUOS)), and he has directed the
center since its inception. Under Professor Mourou's direction, CUOS has been at the
forefront of many fields, such as ultrafast and high-peak power lasers, ultrafast solid
state physics and electronics, and chemical dynamics, and the center has provided
students with unparalleled research experiences. His research groups made significant
contributions to the field and introduced several powerful techniques such as chirped
pulse amplification, which revolutionized the field of laser-matter interaction.
Among Professor Mourou's numerous awards and recognitions are the R.W.
Wood Prize, the Harold E. Edgerton Award, the IEEE D. Sarnoff Award, the
IEEE/LEOS Quantum     Electronics Award, and the University's Henry Russel
Lectureship. He is a Fellow of IEEE and the Optical Society of America and a member

JANUARY MEETING, 2005


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Wednesday, January 26, 2005
The Regents convened at 8:10 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Provost Courant, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice
President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,
Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, Vice
President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent Deitch was absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order and said that the meeting would begin
with the presentation of three Regents' Resolutions.
Regents' Resolutions
Marshall Scholarship Recipient. Regent Richner welcomed Jacob Bourjaily to the
podium and read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate and
commend Jacob Lewis Bour/aily on his selection as a 2005 Marshall
Scholar.
It is not easy to stand out among the large, diverse, student body
at the University of Michigan, but Jacob Bourjaily hit the ground
running and has not stopped. A senior in the honors program with a
major in physics and mathematics, he was the first undergraduate
student ever chosen to be an associate member of the Michigan Center
for Theoretical Physics.   This past summer, he was the only
undergraduate student at the 42nd International School of Subnuclear
Physics in Sicily, where he earned the Paul A.Mi. Dirac Diploma, was
named "Best Student, " and was chosen "Best Presenter of a Theoretical
Subject.Y" He has also presented at conJerences in Edinburgh, Vienna,
Geneva, Paris, and Marseilles and has several research papers pending
publication.
Both in high school and in college, Jacob has enjoyed sharing his
enthusiasm for science - particularly in the areas of gravity, particles,
and other components of the universe that are not generally understood
- by developing and regularly participating in outreach programs fbr
younger students. His interest in every facet of physics and mathematics
is further expressed through his hobby of collecting currency faturing
pictures of mathematicians and physicists. Along the way, he has also


199




January Meeting, 2005


found the time to become an accomplished photographer and jazz
guitarist.
Jacob Bourjaily epitomizes the "Michigan Difference."  The
Regents take great pride in celebrating Jacob's many accomplishments
and look forward to following his career as he completes his education
and takes his place among the august body of illustrious Michigan
alumni.
A round of applause followed.
Rhodes Scholarship Recipient. Regent White welcomed Joseph Jewell to the
podium and read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The egents othe University of Michigan commend Joseph
Jewell on his selection as a 2005 Rhodes Scholar.
As one of only 32 U.S. students selected annually to receive
this most prestigious honor, Joseph Jewell has attained the pinnacle
of achievement in the academic world. A Michigan native and
graduate student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, he
will attend Oxbfrd University beginning in the fall of 2005 to pursue
a master's degree in engineering science.
It came as no surprise to those who know him that Joseph
Jewell was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. As a high school
senior, Joseph was named a United States Presidential Scholar, an
honor which recognizes the nation's most outstanding high school
students. With interests ranging from music to photography to
medieval history to outer space, he completed his undergraduate
studies at the California Institute of Technology, where he was an
honors student in both medieval history and aeronautics, an
accomplished musician who played percussion in the campus band
and orchestra, and a leader in student government. He has
published three technical papers and a study guide for improving
SAT scores, and spent three summers doing research at NASA,
where he tested his physical endurance by flying aboard its
zero-gravity experimental plane. Joseph aspires to be an astronaut
or a college professor, working on advanced jet engines for
powering spaceships. While at Oxford, he plans to spend his time
outside of the classroom by playing timpani in the symphony
orchestra, improving his skills as a photographer, and traveling
throughout Europe.
Joseph Jewell has been described a   young person of
uncommon decency, who shows great humility and thoughtfulness
despite his many achievements.  It is with great pride and


200




January Meeting, 2005


admiration that the Regents congratulate Joseph Jewel! for his
Rhodes Scholarship and look forward to following his career in the
years to come.
Vice President and Secretary of the University Resolution. Regent Brandon
called Vice President Tedesco to the podium and read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend Dr. Lisa A.
Tedcesco as she steps down jfom the position of vice president and
secretary of the University and re-immerses herself in her role as a
faculty member.
Vice President Tedesco received her M.Ed. and Ph.D. degrees
from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1975 and 1981,
respectively. In 1992, following an 18-year career at SUNY Buffalo, she
came to the University of Michigan as profssor of dentistry and
associate dean for academic affairs in the School of Dentistry. A health
psychologist and nationally-recognized expert on diversity in the health
professions, in 1996 Interim President Homer Neal appointed her to
oversee projects related to diversity and the advancement of women,
including the publication of "Climate and Character: Perspectives on
Diversity " and the work of the Council on a Multicultural University.
Her work on campus climate and broad knowledge of the University
brought her to the attention of President Lee Bollinger.
In September 1998, Dr. Tedesco was appointed vice president
and secretay of the University, and in 2001 she held an additional
appointment as interim provost and executive vice president for
academic affairs. During this period, she skillfully balanced the full
range of responsibilities of these two extraordinarily demanding
positions. In her role as provost, she helped lead the University's
response to the September 11 terrorist attacks and oversaw important
academic initiatives, such as the final report of the President's
Commission on the Undergraduate Experience, while as vice president
and secretary she provided crucial assistance to the Regents with the
presidential search.
An active University citizen, Dr. Tedesco has made significant
contributions in a number of areas across the campus. She is a
long-standing member of the President's Advisoly Commission on
Women's Issues and has served as chair of the Campus Safety and
Security Advisofy Committee for six years. As the administrative liaison
to the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, she serves on the Advisory
Board for Intercollegiate Athletics and was appointed by President
Coleman to chair the steering committee for the NCAA Division I
Athletics Recertification Program in 2003. This complex assignment led


201




January Meeting, 2005


to lasting enhancements in academic opportunities fobr student athletes
and to improvements in other aspects of our athletic program.
Dr. Tedesco received the University K s prestigious Sarah Goddard
Power Award in 2002 in honor of her distinguished leadership and
sustained service on beha'lf of women. She has also received the
Department of Public Safety's Director's Award fbor her service in the
development and revision of departmental policies and procedures. She
is the recipient of numerous other honors and has held national
leadership positions in pro/essional organizations related to her
academic work.
The vice president and secretary of the University is a pivotal
position that touches nearly every facet of this complex, diverse,
decentralized, and highly-visible institution. It is a rare individual who
can successftdlly navigate around all the issues, constituent groups, and
decision-makers, working towards consensus, while being mindful of the
path that is in the best long-term interests of the institution. The Regents
greatly admire Lisa's ability to sustain and enhance relationships among
the Regents and between the Regents and members of the University
community, and, indeed, among the multitudes of individuals who cross
her path daily, always displaying   her characteristic sensitivity,
profssionalism, and goodjudgment.
The Regents express their great admiration for Lisa's skill and
wisdom  in leading  and supporting  them, both collectively and
individually. She has set the gold standard fbor the position of vice
president and secretary of the University, in which she has served with
such distinction f)r nearly seven years. She has perfbrmed her
challenging responsibilities in a truly exceptional manner and has done
an outstanding job of communicating, problem-solving, and providing
sound guidance and advice to all. The Regents express their deepest
respect, admiration, and gratitude to Lisa for her outstanding efforts on
behalf of the University; we will miss her very much.
With much affection and appreciation, the Regents recognize and
thank Dr. Lisa A. Tedesco for her sefless, distinguished service as vice
president and secretary of the University and send her best wishes as she
returns fidl time to her academic career.
A standing ovation followed. President Coleman called on Nancy Asin, assistant
to the vice president and secretary of the University, who commented on how much
Lisa would be missed by her staff.
tby Vice rsi        Tedesco  Vice President Tedesco responded that
she was deeply touched by the comments she had received, both publicly and
personally. She noted that she has always been motivated by learning and had learned
an extraordinary amount by serving in this position. She commented, "I leave the post
with a deep appreciation for what university governance means, and what it means to
hold an institution in trust for the future. It is not a trivial matter." She noted that her


202




January Meeting, 2005


work with Regents, presidents, faculty, and students has taught her extraordinary
lessons and has been a wonderful experience. "All of this has deepened my love for
Michigan, has deepened my love for all of you in service to this fine institution, and I
say thank you for the honor and privilege of serving you and Michigan as vice president
and secretary of the University."
A round of applause followed.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order and noted that the morning session
had been reserved for discussion, public comment, and action regarding the North Quad
Residential and Academic Complex.
President Coleman called attention to the death on January 25th of Gerard M.
Faeth, Arthur B. Modine Distinguished University Professor of Aerospace Engineering,
Professor of Aerospace Engineering, and Professor of Mechanical Engineering, noting
that he was to have given an annual lecture in accordance with his distinguished
University professorship in several days. She also called attention to the retirement of
former dean and interim president B. Joseph White.
North Quad Residential and Academic Complex.        President Coleman
commented that this is an important and exciting project for the University, envisioned
as a major northern gateway to the central campus. The concept is for a combination of
residential and academic space and is the first of its type in the country. This project
will fulfill several institutional priorities: it will increase the amount of residential
space on campus, it is a major component of the Residential Life Intitiative plan to
renovate the residence hall system, it will enhance and link students' living and learning
experiences, and it addresses the deteriorating state of the Frieze Building, which has
been a top priority for a long time. It also provides an opportunity to bring together
academic programs in very innovative ways. She called on Provost Courant.
Provost Courant commented that this is an exciting, unique project, built on the
idea of collaboration on the cutting edge. The multiple collaborations include those
between the offices of the provost and vice president for student affairs, among the
deans of several schools and colleges, and eventually among students and faculty, once
the facility is up and running.
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that this project is one if a series of
projects that are part of the Residential Life Initiative (RLI) described in September,
2004. The five major components of the RLI are life safety upgrades and IT upgrades,
both of which have been done in a number of residence halls, dining upgrades (Hill
Dining Center), a new residential complex (North Quad) and its associated academic
space, and renovations of heritage residence halls. He noted that since buildings are
constructed "from the inside out," the deans' and student affairs' programmatic vision
for this structure is critical.
Executive Vice President Slottow said that this complex would include
approximately 500 beds and about 190,000 gross square feet of academic and support
space. He pointed out that this is a replacement project, replacing the academic space at
the Frieze site. The estimated cost of the residence hall portion of the complex is $58


203




January Meeting, 2005


million, and the budget estimate for the academic and support space is $74 million, plus
an additional $5 million for demolition and site work.
Terrance McDonald, dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
expressed the college's enthusiasm for the project and gratitude for the foresight of
President Coleman and the Regents in supporting this project. He noted that students
arrive on campus with a deep curiosity about the way that media and information shape
their lives, society, and the world. One of the college's goals is to help them become
sophisticated consumers and evaluators of media and information, he said, and the new
North Quad complex will allow the college to mount an enriched curriculum in media
and information studies, will leverage the high technology demands of the units that
provide that instruction, will help drive the University's global agenda, and will
strengthen the teaching of language, which is the foundation of that agenda.
The three units on campus that focus on information and media studies--Film and
Video Studies, Communication Studies, and the School of Information--will be brought
together for the first time and will be made available to undergraduate students in a
variety of ways. He noted that housing these units in the same building will also be
efficient from a cost perspective by concentrating all of the technology-intensive
equipment in one place.  He also noted the benefits of providing access for
undergraduate students to the renowned strengths and scholarly pursuits of the School
of Information. Dean McDonald pointed out that the building will be equipped to
handle the technologically intensive needs of language instruction, and the
concentration of language instruction facilities within and nearby the North Quad
facility will also be a primary benefit of the space.
Dean John King, of the School of Information, noted that his school had been
holding discussions with the departments of Film  and Video Studies and
Communication Studies about how they might collaborate and about how housing all of
these units in the same facility made sense. He said that the goal is for students at the
University of Michigan to dramatically increase their global vision and ability to
communicate and collaborate with people all over the world, and that this collaboration
will be a catalyst toward achieving that goal.
Dean King noted that these ideas have been germinating for a number of years,
following up on the vision laid out by the institution that advised that we have to rethink
the nature of the learning community, which would involve more than students and
teachers as it becomes a global community. The other notion was that "we have to
build an ecology of experiments" because nobody knows how to achieve this goal. He
observed that the North Quad project embodies both of those visions, laid out 4-5 years
ago by the institution.
Dean King reported that the first demonstration of the "Connection Project" that
connects the two locations of the School of Information, occurred last week, and that it
provided an astounding example of the difference that new and evolving technology can
make. He predicted that North Quad will only further this process.
Steven Kunkel, dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, who
noted that his unit will be the largest University unit located next to the new complex,
pointed out that following up on the extensive renovation of the Rackham building, "the
time has come to invest in our undergraduates in this residential living/learning center."


204




January Meeting, 2005


He said that the Graduate School is extremely excited about having new neighbors and
welcomes the opportunity to interact both with the academic units and the students
housed in the residence hall.
Vice President Harper noted that the focus of this project has been to meet the
needs and desires of students while at the same time reframing the way that students
learn and live. She noted that students' lives are centered more on computer screens
than TV screens as had been the case for past generations and that the intentional
blending of classroom and living space creates opportunities to provide a transformative
learning experience for students. The goal is to create an environment that includes
opportunities for both classroom learning and informal, lifelong skills learning and that
facilitates learning in every domain--cognitive, social, personal, and spiritual. She
noted that North Quad will be a gateway to the University of Michigan that will
dramatically connect living and learning.
Vice President Harper introduced Carole Henry, director of University Housing,
chair of the President's Task Force on Residential Life and Learning, and recognized
staff who have been working on this project.
Ms. Henry reported that the task force had been charged with determining how to
integrate residential life and academic life more fully on campus, how to provide
opportunities for personal and intellectual development that compliment the academic
experience, and how to provide a framework for the bold concepts outlined by the
deans.
Ms. Henry noted that North Quad would contain a mix of living options, including
suites with various configurations. There would be music practice rooms, performance
rooms, hall kitchens, laundry facilities, and multi-purpose spaces in addition to student
government and organization space. Many dining options would be provided. She
emphasized that students will be involved in all aspects of planning for the space. The
central theme would be that learning takes place everywhere, and the hall will help
elucidate the meaning of the concept of the lifetime learner. She noted that the task
force has been discussing several possible themes for the complex, and it will release a
formal report in about a month.
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that in order to achieve the vision
that has been described for the project, it will be necessary to demolish the existing
Frieze Building. However, every attempt will be made to incorporate the existing
Carnegie Library. He said that the recommended architect is Einhorn Yaffee Prescott, a
firm which has designed over 90 residence halls and an equal number of academic
buildings for campuses across the country.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals on the subject of the
proposed North Quad Residential and Academic Complex. Caroline Smith, alumna; Amy
Keller, student and president of the Residence Halls Association; Thomas Heywood,
citizen, executive director of the State Street Area Association; Rese Fox, student,
external relations chair, Michigan Student Assembly; and Jason Mironov, student,
president of Michigan Student Assembly.


205




January Meeting, 2005


Discussion of North Quad Residential and Academic Complex
It was noted that the residence hall is intended to house mostly sophomores and
juniors.
Regent McGowan said that she had attended the community meeting on the
proposed project and had high regard for the sentiments expressed. She commented
that graduates of Ann Arbor High School, which had at one time been housed in the
Frieze Building, had expressed opposition to the project, and drew comparisons
between the Frieze Building and the former Perry Elementary School building, which is
also owned by the University. The Perry Building had undergone a magnificent
renovation because it was found to be a solid structure and fit a strategic aim of the
University. She noted that Fourth Ward residents had expressed legitimate concerns
about quality of life issues and that the University should address these concerns over
time. She pointed out that students are excited by the project and have every reason to
be thrilled, and she noted also the enthusiasm expressed by the local business
community. The historic preservationists, she pointed out, have a great responsibility to
advocate for retaining and renewing buildings in Ann Arbor that are of considerable
significance to the city's history, and they have done a good job of carrying out this
responsibility.
So the Regents' decision on this issue must bear in mind their responsibility to
assure the continued prosperity of the University. In light of that, she stated that the
University needs to be absolutely clear about its intentions with respect to the future of
the Frieze Building and requested that Executive Vice President Slottow respond.
Executive Vice President Slottow stated that "we will be demolishing the Frieze
Building, and we will do what we can to protect and renovate all or portions of the
Carnegie Library." He described the three considerations that led to this conclusion.
The first is the physical condition and layout of the Frieze Building, which was
designed in 1907 to teach high school students. The second consideration is the need to
achieve the academic and RLI vision, which includes having a meaningful number of
residence rooms in a configuration suitable for the University's needs and to have a
sufficient number of gross square feet to meet academic and support space needs.
Lastly, the project needs to be consistent with master planning principles, which include
issues of density, careful use of the land, sensitivity to the surrounding community,
building heights, open space, parking, transportation, utilities, storm water, and other
infrastructure considerations. All of these aspects have been under intense scrutiny, he
noted, and for these and many other technical reasons, to achieve these three objectives
and remain appropriate fiduciaries of the University's facilities and mission, the Frieze
Building will need to be demolished.
Associate Vice President Hank Baier further noted that to work within the existing
structure, it would be necessary to retain the existing floor-to-floor heights in the
building with the same corridor and stairwell areas. To maintain the current structure
and accomplish the project vision, create collaborative learning environments, and put
in beds and a residence hall in an orderly and efficient fashion while adhering to the
master planning principles would be insurmountable. He noted that a tower had been
suggested by some, but this would not be appropriate for a residence hall and would not


206




January Meeting, 2005


produce a collaborative, cutting-edge learning environment. He pointed out that these
considerations have all been discussed with a number of architects.
Regent McGowan emphasized that it needs to be understood that approval of this
action will mean that the Frieze Building will be demolished and that there will be no
further discussion about attempting to save it. Executive Vice President Slottow
confirmed this and reiterated that a number of architects have been consulted, the
condition of the building has been known for a long time, and the building cannot be
saved if master planning principles are to be maintained.
Regent Richner requested information about financing of the structure. Executive
Vice President Slottow noted that current estimates for the project are imprecise, as they
always are at the initial phase of a project. They represent best estimates, given market
conditions, site conditions, benchmarking, and the cost of building a residence hall and
an academic center of this quality. The housing portion will be funded with borrowing
backed by residence hall rates and the academic portion will be funded from central
administration sources as well as funds from the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts and the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. He
emphasized that because it has been known for some time that the problems of the
Frieze Building would need to be addressed, the financing plans have been well
established.
Regent Maynard inquired about asbestos issues in the Frieze Building and how
this would be dealt with. Associate Vice President Baier responded that all asbestos
and lead will be removed from the building prior to any demolition. A detailed survey
of the building will be done, and an asbestos abatement contractor will remove it and
any lead materials prior to proceeding with the demolition. These expenses are
included in the cost for site preparation and demolition in the action request.
Regent Brandon commented that the Frieze Building was an embarrassment to
him when he was a student, that it has been ignored for decades, and that it continues to
be an embarrassment to the University. So as both a Regent and an Ann Arbor citizen,
he is especially enthusiastic about supporting the transformation that will occur on this
site.
Regent McGowan moved approval of the North Quad Residential and Academic
Complex project as described in the Regents Communication and authorization for
commissioning Einhorn Yaffee Prescott for its design. Regent Brandon seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting recessed at 9:35 a.m.
iWednesda, JanICuary 26, 2005
The Regents reconvened at 4:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Brandon, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and Taylor.
Also present were Provost Courant, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President
Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor
Mestas, Executive Vice President Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, and
Vice President Ulaby. Regents Deitch, Maynard, and White were absent, as were Vice
Presidents Rudgers and Wilbanks.


207




January Meeting, 2005


President Coleman noted that Committee Reports would be the first item on the
agenda and called on Regent Brandon.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and considered four agenda topics. First they met with
Executive Vice President Kelch, Hospitals and Health Centers Executive Director Larry
Warren, and chief financial officer Doug Strong for an update on the operating
performance and ten-year strategic capital plan of the Hospitals and Health Centers.
Regent Brandon reported that through December 31, 2005 the Hospitals and Health
Centers had positive variances in budget versus revenue and budget versus operating
margin. The committee next received an initial review from Provost Courant and
Associate Provost Phil Hanlon on the FY 2006 General Fund Budget. The committee
also received a routine update from Carol Senneff, executive director of University audits,
and a preliminary look at the audit plan for next year. The committee met privately with
Ms. Senneff and was assured that she was receiving a high level of cooperation and
receptivity from management in the schools and colleges. The committee also received
internal audit reports regarding the Hospitals and Health Centers.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. President Coleman announced that
Regent Maynard was not able to attend this portion of the formal meeting and would
report on that morning's committee meeting at the next Regents' Meeting.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of December 16, 2004.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report, the
Plant Extension Report, the Regents Report on Noncompetitive Purchases over $5,000
from Single Sources, September 16, 2004 through December 15, 2004, and the Human
Resources and Affirmative Action Report.
Executive Vice President Slottow announced that the Hill Auditorium renovation
had received a 2005 Honor Award for Outstanding Architecture from the American
Institute of Architects. He noted that architects of two of the other award-winning
projects are currently working on University of Michigan projects.
Ltigatigon Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of projects
established, December 31, 2004. He noted that compared to a year ago, available
federal funding has increased by about 1.2%, but the funds awarded to the University
have increased by 6.5%, indicating that the University is receiving a larger share of
available funds.
University of  ihigan Iealth System.     Executive Vice President Kelch
announced that the University of Michigan Health System recently received one of ten
national Premier Healthcare Employer awards for 2005 by the Premier Workplaces
organization. He recognized the efforts of Laurita Thomas, Larry Warren, and Deborah


208




Childs, among other past and present administrators, for the Health System having
achieved this recognition.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper had no additional report.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little informed the Regents about
an event that had occurred on campus two weeks ago, through which, in partnership
with Michigan Public Media, the campus had hosted the kickoff event for the Michigan
public television broadcast of a series about the Auschwitz concentration camp.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas had no additional report.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Jason Mironov, president of MSA, wished
Vice President Tedesco well. He also thanked University administrators for working
with the MSA committee chairs on their various projects. He announced that MSA is
planning an event featuring several nationally prominent political figures and updated
the Regents on several other MSA activities.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted a "Michigan Difference"
Campaign Update and the Report of Voluntary Support for December 2004. Regarding
the first report, he noted that with 53% of the time period having elapsed, the campaign
had so far reached $1.6 billion, or 65%, of its $2.5 billion goal. He also pointed out that
in December 2003, the University had received $30 million in cash gifts, whereas in
December 2004 these gifts totaled $47 million. This exceeded expectations and is a
credit to the efforts of a number of people both inside and outside the University. Vice
President May thanked the Regents for all of their assistance and advice during this
campaign and noted that it has really made a difference.
Regent Newman observed that a number of University development officers,
faculty, and staff members have also contributed their own funds to the campaign.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted three faculty retirement
memoirs.
Roy A. Glover, Ph.D., associate professor of cell and developmental biology in
the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2004, after a
productive career as an educator and researcher.
Professor Glover received his B.S. degree at Calvin College in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, in 1959 and his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees at The Ohio State University in
1963 and 1968, respectively. Professor Glover joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an instructor in 1968 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1970 and
associate professor in 1990.
Professor Glover was heavily engaged in discovering innovative methods and
educational uses for plastination research, and he served as director of the Plastination
Laboratory from 2001-04. He served on and chaired numerous school and departmental
committees and was a member of the Senate Assembly. As an active member of the
gross anatomy teaching team and director of the medical neuroscience course, Professor
Glover played a major role in the education of medical students. Widely recognized as
an outstanding teacher, he was voted "Neural and Behavioral Science Teacher of the


232




January Meeting, 2005


Year" eight times. His other major teaching awards include the University's Kaiser
Permanente Award for Teaching Excellence (1982), the Amoco Outstanding Teaching
Award (1985), and a national award for teaching excellence from the University of
Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey (1989).
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated service by
naming Roy A. Glover associate professor emeritus of cell and developmental biology.
Stevo Julius, M.D., Sc.D., Frederick G. L. Huetwell Professor of Hypertension,
professor of internal medicine, and professor of molecular and integrative physiology in
the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on January 14, 2005.
A native of the former Yugoslavia, Dr. Julius received his M.D. and Sc.D
degrees from the University of Zagreb in 1953 and 1964, respectively. He joined the
University of Michigan as an instructor in internal medicine in 1965 and was promoted
to assistant professor in 1967, associate professor in 1971, and professor in 1974. He
was appointed associate professor of physiology in 1980 and was promoted to professor
in 1983. In 1996, Dr. Julius was named the Frederick G. L. Huetwell Professor of
Hypertension.
Dr. Julius' research led to the concept of the hyperkinetic borderline
hypertensive state and demonstrated the fundamental pathophysiological role of the
sympathetic nervous system in the hyperkinetic state. He transformed the Tecumseh
Community Health Study, a landmark epidemiological investigation, into the Tecumseh
Blood Pressure Study and demonstrated that hyperkinetic borderline hypertension was
not a response to the stress involved in invasive hemodynamic studies and that there
was a link between sympathetic activity and the metabolic syndrome. In recent years,
he has focused on international clinical trials. One particularly intriguing ongoing
study, the Trial of Preventing Hypertension ("TROPHY"), could lead to the
development of an entirely novel approach to hypertension prevention.
As chief of the Division of Hypertension for 25 years, Dr. Julius trained a cohort
of young investigators and had a profound effect on hypertension education. His
contributions in this area were recognized in 1989 when the International Society of
Hypertension established the Stevo Julius Award for Excellence in Hypertension
Education, awarded to a person with a distinguished record in hypertension-related
teaching. His work in the areas of cardiology and hypertension and on cardiovascular
diagnosis and therapeutics and has had a profound effect around the world.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated
service by naming Stevo Julius professor emeritus of internal medicine and professor
emeritus of molecular and integrative physiology.
B. Joseph White, Ph.D., Wilbur K. Pierpont Collegiate Professor of Leadership
in Management Education, professor of business administration, and former dean of the
Stephen M. Ross School of Business, will retire from active faculty status on January
31, 2005.
A native of Michigan, Professor White received his B.S. degree from
Georgetown University in 1969, his M.B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1971,
and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1975. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1973 and was promoted to assistant
professor in 1975 and associate professor in 1978. In 1981, he took a leave of absence
to join Cummins Engine Company, Inc., where he served as vice president for
management development and vice president for personnel and public affairs. He


233




January Meeting, 2005


returned to the University in 1987 as professor and associate dean. He was appointed
interim dean in 1990 and dean in 1991 and served as dean until 2001. Professor White
was appointed the Wilbur K. Pierpont Collegiate Professor of Leadership in
Management Education in 1999, and he served as interim president of the University of
Michigan in 2002.
Under Professor White's leadership, the school engaged in a challenging period
of self-examination that involved faculty, students and administrators. The resulting
curricular revision and innovation catapulted the school into the top tier of competition.
Professor White devoted considerable energy and resources to building and maintaining
a stellar faculty across all disciplines by sustaining those who had already achieved
prominence and developing those who had languished. As a result the faculty became
one of the strongest in its history and is nationally recognized on multiple fronts.
Professor White also focused on making Michigan the school of choice for minority
M.B.A. students and fostered a strong and supportive environment for female students
by supporting such programs as the Women's Initiative, which annually brings in top
professional women for focused workshops and seminars. The doctoral program was
also thoroughly re-examined and revamped.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming B. Joseph White dean
emeritus of the Stephen M. Ross School of Business Administration and professor
emeritus of business administration.

FEBRUARY MEETING, 2005


The University oftMichigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, February 17, 2005
Panel Discussion
Prior to the start of the Regents' Meeting, the Regents attended a panel discussion on
the University of Michigan's "ADVANCE" project, funded by the National Science
Foundation, whose purpose is to reduce the gender gap among faculty in science and
engineering disciplines.  Participants included Professors Abigail Stewart, Pamela
Raymond, Melvin Hochster, and Anthony England and Dean Terrence McDonald.
Regents' Meeting
The Regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies Building, Assembly Hall. Present were President Coleman and Regents Deitch,
Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost
Courant, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov,
Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers,
Executive Vice President Slottow, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent Brandon was absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She commented on the recent death
of playwright and alumnus Arthur Miller and noted that he had returned to campus many
times and had been honored on Broadway in 2004. She distributed a special edition of the
Michigan Daily devoted to Arthur Miller. She commented that the forthcoming Arthur
Miller Theatre will serve as a lasting memorial and tribute to Arthur Miller and said, "We
will remember him as a great icon, a monumental talent, and a man of conscience. And
we will remember him as a student who came to the University of Michigan not with
privilege, but with promise, and with an unshakable belief that he could make a
difference. And he did."
State Budget Situation. President Coleman reported that the governor had
recently proposed a mid-year cut of nearly 2% for public universities that would
continue for fiscal year 2006. This would be in addition to the 12% cut in base funding
that has been made over the past two years. If enacted, the proposed additional cuts
could mean that the University's General Fund will have been reduced by more than
$50 million for the three campuses combined.
President Coleman stated that the University does not believe it would be fair to
students and their families to institute a mid-year tuition increase should the governor's
proposed mid-year cut be enacted, and thus a mid-year tuition increase will not be
recommended no matter what happens. President Coleman reiterated her statement of
last year, that the University would not be able to sustain a continual decline in state
support in combination with artificially restrained tuition increases if quality is to be


239




February lMeeting 2005


maintained and "if the University of Michigan is to remain the University of Michigan."
She stated that the University would not compromise academic excellence and that the
guiding principle in developing the FY 2006 budget would be maintaining the
University's quality. She continued that charting the course of the University goes
beyond reacting to a year-to-year state funding cycle. The governor's proposal for the
FY 2006 budget is a starting point for continued debate, she noted, and policy-makers
will be strongly encouraged to reconsider the state's investment in higher education.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. President Coleman announced that
due to extenuating circumstances, the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee had not
met.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard noted that this
committee had held informal discussions with President Coleman regarding her goals
for the 2004-05 academic year and with Provost Courant regarding the status of
ongoing dean searches.
Annual Report on Research
Vice President Ulaby presented the Annual Report on Research and Scholarship for
2004 and reported that research expenditures that year were $752 million, which is a
0.42% increase from the previous year. Reviewing research expenditures over the last five
years, he noted that the flattening of the rate of increase corresponds to a decrease in the
level of available federal funding, which grew only grew by 1.6% in 2004, and funding
from industry, which dropped 16.6%. University funding grew only by 1.6%. Vice
President Ulaby explained anomalies in research expenditures by the five units with the
largest research expenditures over the past three years.
Vice President Ulaby noted that in 2004, research expenditures in the Medical
School, the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and School of Public Health
had experienced increases, whereas expenditures in the College of Engineering had
decreased. For 2005, he expects total research expenditures to reach about $800
million, an increase of 6.9%. Indirect costs are projected to increase by about 7.3%.
He reported that the federal research funding outlook for 2006 is not very positive
since the total federal research and development request in the president's budget
proposal is up overall only by 0.6%, and for the agencies most important to the
University of Michigan (NIH, NSF, DoD) is only modestly increased (NIH, NSF) or
substantially decreased (Department of Defense). Consequently, there will be greater
competition among academic institutions for federal funding, and there will be a greater
tendency to encourage members of Congress to fund projects through earmarks rather
than through a competitive, peer review process.
Vice President Ulaby observed that one way to maximize the University's share of
federal research expenditures is to obtain more grants for large centers from such
agencies as NIH and NSF. He noted that discussions are underway with state officials
about how to enhance the University's competitiveness in obtaining these large grants.
Internally, strategic plans need to be put into place to help determine the areas in which
the University should emphasize its research investments.

February Meeting, 2005


Vice President Ulaby reviewed the research accomplishments of members in a
variety of disciplines. He also described the "eResearch" project, which provides an
electronic means of managing and tracking research activities. The first component of
this project is a system for ensuring compliance with all of the rules and regulations for
research involving the use of human subjects. The eResearch Project, funded jointly by
the Office of the Provost and the Office of Vice President for Research, will be fully
operational by May 2005.
He also described Ann Arbor Tech Central, a public-private partnership organized
as a non-profit organization aimed at accelerating technology-based economic
development in Ann Arbor and the surrounding areas. The goals are to have the Ann
Arbor area become known as a national hub for technology development, to double the
number of technology companies in the area, to triple the number of technology jobs in
the area, to become a "hot spot" for technology events, and to become one of the
nation's best regions for business creation and acceleration.
Vice President Ulaby concluded by explaining the challenges posed by the greatly
expanded use of export control regulations in federally funded projects since the events
of 9/11. These carry restrictions on the publication of research findings and on the
participation of foreign nationals in research projects that involve information, physical
items, or computer programs pertaining to a wide array of items that are on the U.S.
Munitions List or the Commerce Control List. These export controls have impacted
every major campus across the country, as they prohibit exposure of foreign students to
a number of common research-related items, such as GPS devices or computers with
advanced processors.  Another requirement of the export control restrictions is
pre-approval of publications, which generally contradicts University policy, and
segregating students into categories based on national origin. Those from certain
countries require either a lengthy process to become licensed, or are unlikely to be
granted a license to participate in federal research projects. Academic institutions have
joined together to work with U.S. government officials on this issue that is of very
serious concern to all universities.
In conclusion, Vice President Ulaby predicted that although research spending for
FY 2005 looks bright, the University must develop a plan to ensure that it remains
competitive in the years ahead. He also noted that research restrictions imposed by
federal regulations will likely challenge the core values of academic institutions and test
the resolve of their administrations.
Following some discussion, the Regents then turned to consideration of the regular
agenda.

Kenneth L. Campbell, Ph.D., senior research scientist in the University of
Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI), retired from active faculty status
on August 10, 2001.
Dr. Campbell received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the University of
Wisconsin in 1967, 1968, and 1971 respectively. He was a research engineer at General
Motors from 1971-74 and joined the University of Michigan as an assistant research
scientist in 1974. He was promoted to associate research scientist in 1977, research
scientist in 1991, and senior research scientist in 1997, and he served as director of the
Center for National Truck Statistics from 1988-2001 and division head of the UMTRI
Survey Analysis Division from 1997-2001.
Dr. Campbell applied statistical methods to the analysis of transportation safety.
His work included the design and management of large-scale accident and travel survey
programs, creation of models of factors associated with accident risk, identification of
prevalent collision situations for advanced collision avoidance technology, and
development of deterministic models to predict the probability of injury in a collision.
His research focused on the application of multivariate statistical techniques to
determine the relationship of driver, vehicle, highway, and environmental factors to
accident risk. His work with proposed Intelligent Transportation Systems helped
develop collision typologies to classify accidents so as to identify the collision
situations with the greatest potential for the use of advanced collision-avoidance
technology. More recently, he applied statistical methods to distributions of time to
collision in normal driving to estimate the effect of advanced technologies on the
probability of collision.
Dr. Campbell received the Society of Automotive Engineers' Excellence in Oral
Presentation Award and the Arch T. Colwell Award. He held leadership positions on
the UMTRI Executive Committee and the Motor Vehicle Safety Research Advisory
Committee at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Dr. Friedman studied the interplay of bacterial viruses (phage) and their bacterial
hosts to answer basic questions about the molecular biology of the cell. He did
pioneering work to characterize the developmental pathway governing growth of phage
lambda in Escherichia coli, focusing on lytic gene expression regulated by the phage N
protein. This led to the discovery of several host factors required for N function, which
he called Nus factors, and revealed that regulation of transcript elongation is a key
mechanism for controlling gene expression. Dr. Friedman also discovered the himA
gene, which encodes the Integration Host Factor required for a vast number of
important protein-DNA interactions in the cell, and he has been studying the role of
phage development in the pathogenesis of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). He
demonstrated that toxin released by these bacteria is dependent on phage lytic growth

Executive Vice President Slottow commented that the need for a large classroom
auditorium on North Campus has been identified by the deans on that campus as their
highest common priority. It has been determined that the most suitable location for this


265




February Meeting, 2005


auditorium would be to connect it to the Walgreen Drama Center. The recommended
architect for this project, KPMB, is the same architect approved for the Walgreen Drama
Center. On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved the North Campus Auditorium Project as described and authorized
commissioning Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg (KPMB) for its design.
Stephen M. Ross School of Business Facilities Enhancement Project
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that this project evolved from the strategic
facilities plan developed for the School of Business over the last year. Provost Courant
commented that this project will provide the kind of facility that is essential for a top
notch business school, and he introduced Dean Robert Dolan.
Dean Dolan reported that the school's facilities have for some time been
insufficient for properly supporting and enhancing its students' educational experiences.
A team of faculty, staff, and students had formed to study the issue and concluded that
there were three major dimensions that needed to be addressed: the design of the
classrooms needs to be changed to enhance the opportunity for discussion and
interaction, group study rooms are needed to facilitate action-based learning and team
projects, and community space is needed to allow the building to be used for extended
hours. He noted that Stephen M. Ross's gift has enabled the school to move forward
with enacting these plans, which would encompass both new construction and
demolition of existing structures.
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved the Stephen M. Ross School of Business Facilities Enhancement
project as described and authorized commissioning Kohn Pederson Fox Associates for
its design.
East Huron Street at Glen Avenue Parcels for Roadway Improvements
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the transfer of ownership of two parcels of land on the north side
of East Huron Street between Zina Pitcher Place and Glen Avenue, as shown in the
Regents Communication, to the Michigan Department of Transportation to allow the
construction of a right turn lane on East Huron Street at Glen Avenue.
William Monroe Trotter House Infrastructure Upgrades
On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the William Monroe Trotter House Infrastructure Upgrades
Project as described in the Regents Communication and authorized issuing the project for
bids and awarding construction contracts, providing that bids are within the approved
budget.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Krislov, acting as vice president and
secretary of the University, submitted a memoir for one retiring faculty member.
Nallapu N. Reddy, Ph.D., professor of economics in the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 2004.
Professor Reddy received his B.S. degree from Michigan Technological University in
1961, his M.S. degree from the University of Missouri in 1963, his M.A. degree from the
University of Notre Dame in 1964, and his Ph.D. from The Pennsylvania State University in
1967. From 1967-74, he was an assistant professor and associate professor at Clarkson
University. He joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty as an associate professor in
1974 and was promoted to professor in 1979.
Professor Reddy's major research interests include natural resources, energy, and
environmental economics. He has published many articles in these areas and presented
papers at regional, national, and international meetings.  With a strong interest in
international economics, he participated in the Salzburg Seminar in Austria and the
Comparative Economic Delegation to Russia and the Ukraine, and he served as a visiting
fellow at both Oxford University and the London School of Economics. Professor Reddy's
expertise and reputation led to several media invitations, including two thirty-minute
discussion programs on the ABC network.
During his tenure, Professor Reddy served the University with distinction. He was
chair of the economics department from 1981-84 and from 1993-2000, and he participated
on numerous committees including the Budget Priorities Committee, the Chancellor's
Advisory Committee, and the UM-Flint Graduate Board. He was also instrumental in
developing the honors program in economics.
The Regents now salute this distinguished economics educator for his dedicated
service by naming Nallapu N. Reddy professor emeritus of economics.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported this month.
Degrees. President Coleman submitted recommendations that honorary degrees
be awarded to the following individuals: Henry W. Bloch, business leader and

March leeting, 2005


Chemistry Building Area Tunnel and Chamber Replacement
On a motion by Regent Richner, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved the Chemistry Building Area Tunnel and Chamber Replacement
Project, as described in the Regents Communication and authorized issuing the project for
bids and awarding construction contracts, providing that bids are within the approved
budget.
James B. Angell Hall Computing Center Heating, Ventilation, and Air
Conditioning Upgrades
On a motion by Regent Richner, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
approved the James B. Angell Hall Computing Center Heating, Ventilation, and Air
Conditioning Upgrades Project as described and authorized issuing the project for bids
and awarding construction contracts, providing that bids are within the approved budget.
Walgreen Drama Center Project
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that the Walgreen Drama Center project had
been approved at the June 2004 meeting and Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg
Architects (KPMB) had been appointed for its design. Subsequently, in February 2005,
the North Campus Auditorium project had been approved and the same architect
appointed. At that time, it was also determined that the most suitable location for the
auditorium would be to have it directly connected to the Walgreen Drama Center.
Approval is now being requested for a schematic design that would combine both
projects, which will from this point forward be considered as a single project known as
the Walgreen Drama Center Project. The combined project budget estimate is $42.8
million.
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that construction of this facility will
require the elimination of approximately 250 visitor and staff parking spaces. He
introduced Mr. Tom Payne, founding principle of KPMB, and Associate Vice President
Henry Baier.
Mr. Baier displayed a map illustrating existing parking spaces on the site. He
noted that a parking plan had been presented in 2003, and including spaces that have
been added since that time, 300 vacancies have been created in the parking lots on
North Campus. Once the three buildings currently under construction for the College of
Engineering are completed, and at the completion of construction for the Walgreen
Drama Center, 84 additional faculty and staff spaces will have been added to the North
Campus area. Parallel parking spaces are being added on Bonisteel Boulevard that will
be "blue" (faculty and staff) during the day, and "visitor" spaces after 5:00. Combined
with additional spaces that are being added by expanding the lot adjacent to the
Walgreen Drama Center, there will be about 330 vacant parking spaces when
construction is completed. He said that additional visitor parking spaces will be
distributed among the lots with vacancies to make up for any net losses at the Walgreen
Drama Center site. Special events parking would be accommodated in nearby parking
lots, and for large events, would be provided by shuttles or valet parking.
A discussion followed regarding the feasibility of adding more spaces closer to the
Walgreen Drama Center. Associate Vice President Baier stated that the parking master


293




March Mleeting, 2005


plan includes construction of a parking deck on North Campus, so continuing to expand
surface parking is not desirable from a land use planning perspective.  Regent
Newman pointed out that the number of spaces allotted would be insufficient to
accommodate an audience for a 250-seat performance. She said that taking shuttles to
and from remote lots is inconvenient and people tend to resist this approach.
Regents Newman and McGowan questioned why the proposed parking deck is
part of the long term plan and suggested that instead this be considered concurrent with
the present projects. Mr. Baier responded that the cash flow is currently insufficient to
fund a structure. However, he and Executive Vice President Slottow said that they
would examine the feasibility of constructing the parking structure sooner rather than
later.
Mr. Tom Payne, founding principal of KPMB, presented the schematic design for
the Walgreen Drama Center. He commented that he believes the site is the best
possible one for this project. He displayed a site map and noted that the building was
designed in anticipation of a parking structure and another major building to be located
nearby. He then displayed a drawing of the theatre and schematic designs of each floor
and described what each area what it would look like and how it would function. He
noted that the theatre itself would be a flexible courtyard theatre that could be
configured both in "end stage" (proscenium) format and in "thrust stage" format, with
seating on three sides and flexible seating on the orchestra level. The North Campus
auditorium would anchor the other end of the building. A flexible, simple loft-type
building would connect the two and serve both spaces.
He described how the design of the building shields it from the sun in the summer
but permits ample natural daylight to enter during the winter. He described the interior
and exterior finishes.
Regent McGowan moved approval of the schematic design for the Walgreen
Drama Center Project as presented at the meeting and authorization for issuing bids and
awarding construction contracts for early procurement packages. Regent Newman
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
School of Nursing Building Renovations to First Floor of North Wing
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved the School of Nursing Building Renovations to First Floor of
North Wing Project as described and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding
construction contracts, providing that bids are within the approved budget.
Planned Uses of Income from the Julian A. Wolfson and Marguerite Wolfson
Endowment Funds for the Fiscal Year 2005-2006
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved the planned uses of income from the Julian A. Wolfson and
Marguerite Wolfson Endowment Funds for the Fiscal Year 2005-2006, as described in the
Regents Communication.

by Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved each of the following items:
Lease Agreement with William C. Martin

APRIL MEETING, 2005


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, April 21, 2005
The Regents convened at 2:15 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Vice President Harper,
Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Chancellor
Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, Vice President
Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Vice President May was absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order and called attention to some agenda
items that speak to the future of the University's research and clinical care. The most
noteworthy of these is the recommendation for a replacement facility for the C.S. Mott
Children's and Women's Hospitals. She noted that even though C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital is noted for its exceptional quality of care, the current facility is 35 years old and
is coping with insufficient and outdated space, and she said "it is time for the quality of
facilities to again match the quality of medical care." President Coleman also announced
that the Mott Foundation had announced plans to donate $25 million, its largest grant
ever, to this project, and noted that Regent Brandon and his wife Jan are co-chairing the
fundraising campaign along with Coach Lloyd Carr and Laurie Carr.
President Coleman also commented on the recommendation for establishment of a
research institute focused on nanotechnology to be directed by Dr. James Baker. She
noted that this technology is a focus of future NIH funding and also leverages the
University's major overall investments in the life sciences.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that he
and committee members White and Taylor had met that morning and had considered
several topics. These included an update from the Athletic Department on its 5-year
strategic operating and capital expenditure plans and a Sarbanes-Oxley "gap" analysis as
part of ongoing efforts to make sure that financial accounting practices follow appropriate
"best practices" outlined in the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. The committee had received
written reports on the financial performance of the Hospitals and Health Centers (HHC)
and of M-Care. He noted that for the third quarter, the HHC operating margin is 4.9%,
which is ahead of last year and ahead of budget. He praised the HHC leadership for the
"phenomenal job" they are doing. Regarding M-Care, the report was positive, with
membership numbers and net income both being positive to budget.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee.      Regent Maynard
reported that she, along with committee members Deitch and Richner and Regent
McGowan, had considered two agenda items: the regular, periodic evaluation of the
president and an update on ongoing dean searches.


301




April Meeting, 2005


Benefits Update: 2005 and Future Strategies
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that a faculty-led committee had made a
number of recommendations on health benefits offerings, and Associate Vice President
Laurita Thomas would be presenting an analysis of open enrollment data in the first year
following implementation of the major changes in benefits.
Ms. Thomas described health insurance policy changes that had been made in
calendar year 2004, which included for the first time a co-pay for single-person
coverage and a new category of coverage for employees. The fourth category of
coverage is for one adult and any number of children and has resulted in significant
savings for the more than 4,000 employees who chose this option.
Ms. Thomas described other plan and policy changes that had resulted in
significant cost savings, both for employees and for the University. She reported that
the rate increases imposed in 2005 for medical and prescription drug coverage was far
below that experienced nationally. Benefit strategies for 2006 and beyond will focus on
providing quality, cost-competitive plans for the University and for faculty, staff, and
retirees. She noted that the University is committed to providing a choice of health plan
options, with a long-term goal of reducing the number of plans while still meeting other
benefits strategies.
For 2006, plans are to continue the current, co-premium sharing formula which
resulted in savings for over 6,000 employees; to monitor migration patterns; and to
monitor prescription drug coverage options being offered by the federal government
that may be suitable for retirees. She described other key initiatives in benefits
planning for the coming years, which include offering an additional tax-deferred
retirement vehicle for employees, evaluating options for prescription drug and life
insurance plans, and expanding the use of technology and of on-line benefit
enrollments.
Children's and Women's Hospitals Replacement Project
Executive Vice President Kelch commented that the replacement hospital project is
the result of a great deal of thoughtful, careful planning over a period of several years. He
introduced Larry Warren, executive director of the University of Michigan Hospitals and
Health Centers.
Mr. Warren noted that this project represents a milestone in the life of the medical
center. He acknowledged the work of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive
Board, several steering committees, the community advisory board, and a number of
individuals in advancing this project to its current state of development. He introduced
Ms. Patricia Warner, associate hospital director, to present the proposed project.
Ms. Warner noted that the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital is one of three
comprehensive children's hospitals in the state. It has market dominance and is the
only institution with state-wide draw. She stated that although the pediatric population
is expected to remain flat, officials are confident of the accuracy of the growth
assumptions that are reflected in this project. She noted building a new children's and
women's facility will serve the overall Health System strategic direction by freeing up
the existing Mott facility to allow for clinical expansion of adult facilities. The project


302




April Meeting, 2005


provides for a separate pediatric emergency department which will enable much needed
expansion of the adult emergency department. Diagnostic radiology services will also
be expanded to meet the needs of pediatric and adult services.
Ms. Warner noted that Mott Children's Hospital is one of the finest in the world
and that the University is a designated center of excellence in women's health. New
facilities are needed to continue to enhance the hospitals' family-centered care. She
pointed out that most of the nation's other comprehensive children's hospitals have
either undergone recent renovations or are in the process of doing so. To remain
competitive in retaining and recruiting the finest faculty and staff, she noted, "we need
the facilities that will allow them to do their work." She observed that another project
objective is to achieve the standards set by current codes and said that it is difficult to
maintain up-to-date equipment and technology in outdated facilities.
Ms. Warner commented that the entire hospital will be HEPA-filtered to provide
the cleanest air system possible and that one unit would be capable of handling a mass
infectious disease outbreak for both children and adults.
Ms. Warner said that project planning has been driven by a number of guiding
principles: to support the strategic plan of the entire Health System; to design for
maximum flexibility and expansion; to plan from the patient and family perspective; to
engage diverse, active, participation from many audiences, including faculty and staff,
patients and families, students, and others; to design for efficiency, accessibility,
flexibility, safety, and comfort; and to be family centered.
She reviewed the economic assumptions that will be guiding this project,
including occupancy rates, length of stay, and inpatient and outpatient growth rates.
She pointed out that the projections are conservative and expressed confidence that they
will be met. The return on investment is expected to be 4%.
Ms. Warner displayed diagrams illustrating the concept for both the project and
the site. She noted that plans assume demolition of the current Women's Hospital, with
that site likely to become a transit center for drop-off of faculty and staff. With respect
to parking, she noted that construction will remove 313 parking spaces in 2006, and an
additional 500 staff spaces in the Mott structure will be changed to patient/visitor
parking. But the opening of two other structures currently under construction will
provide 735 spaces. Over the long term, plans call for increased use of remote parking
facilities for staff and faculty.
The facility will be 1 million square feet, with about 775,000 square feet for the
inpatient facility and 225,000 square feet for the outpatient and office portion. The
building will be 10 stories high, with the mechanical penthouse on the 1l1th floor. She
reviewed how the bed allocation will be divided among the total of 266 beds. There
will be 90,000 square feet of planned shell space. All patient rooms will be single
rooms. Ms. Warner also announced that a major feature of the hospital is that it will be
paperless.
The total cost of the project is $498 million. This will be funded from the
UMHHC reserves ($298 million); tax-exempt debt ($150 million); and philanthropy
($50 million). The debt service payments will be derived from the UMHHC operating
margin. Regarding the amount to be derived from philanthropy, she announced that


303




April Meeting, 2005


$35 million has already been pledged, and all involved are committed to exceeding the
$50 million original goal.
Upon approval of the project, schematic design will begin and will proceed
through winter of 2006. Construction is expected to begin in fall 2006, and extend
through winter 2010. Opening is targeted for 2011, after all staff receive extensive
orientation to assure a smooth transition to the new facility.
Ms. Warner announced that HKS Architects, P.C., is being recommended for this
project and noted that the selection of this firm was the result of an extensive review
process.
Executive Vice President Kelch commented that Health System officials have
been looking at the needs for the entire system, which is why this project includes
elements that go beyond the children's hospital alone and will result in benefits for the
entire Health System. He emphasized that this is a self-funded project, funded by
resources that have been generated through the productivity of the Health System work
force and through philanthropists. He observed that the construction of the new
University Hospital in the early 1980s required significant investment from the state,
and this current replacement project, which will be self-funded and the second largest
project ever undertaken at the University, can be viewed as a tremendous return on that
investment.
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that his staff and UMHHS staff,
along with outside consultants, have thoroughly reviewed all financial aspects of this
project, and he is confident that the financial assumptions on which the project is based
are sound.
Regent Maynard noted that the new University Hospital had been built with state
assistance, and at the time, the University had pledged it would not seek any further
assistance in such an endeavor. It has lived up to this pledge, and she said it was an
honorable value.
Regent Deitch raised the question of why the hospital is not slated to open until
2011. It was noted that the design phase would not be finished until winter 2006 and
that the site has limited accessibility, making staging and sequencing of construction
very important. It is also critical that the existing hospital continues to function during
construction, so there are a number of reasons leading to the projected opening of 2011.
Regent Deitch commented that the Regents have supreme confidence in the
leadership of the hospital and in the development of this project, due to their dedication
and competence.
Regent Brandon recalled that 25 years earlier his identical twin sons had been
rushed to Mott Children's Hospital and doctors and nurses had saved their lives. Two
of the doctors and one of the nurses still work at the hospital. "Little did I know," he
commented, "that 25 years later I would be in a position to move this item on behalf of
my wife and my sons and everyone else who believes in this strongly. So it is with a
great deal of pride and commitment that I move approval of the University of Michigan
Hospitals and Health Centers C.S. Mott Children's and Women's Hospitals
Replacement Project as described and authorize commissioning HKS Architects, P.C.
for its design." Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously,


304




April Meeting, 2005


with approval indicated by a show of wrists adorned with Mott Hospital wrist bands. A
round of applause followed.
Regent Deitch left the meeting at this point, at 3:00 p.m.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Krislov, acting as vice president and secretary of the
University, submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting of March 17, 2005.
Appointment of Vice President and Secretary of the University. President
Coleman announced her recommendation of Sally Jo Churchill as vice president and
secretary of the University. Regent McGowan stated that she and President Coleman
"are delighted to commend to members of the board this very happy end to a rigorous
search." She noted that the pool had included a number of highly qualified applicants
from within the University, and that Ms. Churchill's portfolio in her current position as
assistant general counsel coincides well with areas of interest to the Board. She said that
this is a terrific outcome and thanked all who had participated in the process,
particularly President Coleman and Regent Brandon, who had devoted a great deal of
time and effort to the search process.
Regent McGowan moved the appointment of Sally J. Churchill as vice president
and secretary of the University.  The motion was seconded and approved by
acclamation. A round of applause followed.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report, the

April Meeting, 2005


Norman E. Alessi, M.D., professor of psychiatry, associate professor of pediatrics
and communicable diseases, and chief information officer for the Department of
Psychiatry in the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on March 25, 2005.
Dr. Alessi received his B.S. (1972) and M.D. (1976) degrees from Emory
University and completed his internship, residency training, and a research fellowship
at the University of Michigan. He joined the faculty as an assistant professor of
psychiatry in 1983 and was promoted to associate professor in 1989 and professor in
2000. He was appointed associate professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases in
1996 and chief information officer for the Department of Psychiatry in 1994.
A critical and innovative thinker, Dr. Alessi's work contributed to the University's
reputation as a leader and pioneer in the development of educational, clinical, and
research strategies. His early work focused on the identification and treatment of child
and adolescent affective disorders and the use of pharmacological agents. Later, he
broke new ground in the area of psychiatric informatics encompassing telepsychiatry,
virtual reality, and web-based research applications.  Within the department, he
established the first psychiatric informatics fellowship in the nation and was recognized
as Teacher of the Year in 1988. He served as director of the Child and Adolescent
Psychiatric Inpatient Program (1990-94), division director of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry (1995-99), and director of the Psychiatric Informatics Program (1995-2002).
He also served on the President's Commission for the Information Revolution.
Dr. Alessi was the original visionary for the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry's website, and he founded the Psychiatric Society. He is a
fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry and has been recognized in the "Guide to America's Top
Psychiatrists" and "The Best Doctors in America." He is the author of more than 100
journal articles and numerous book chapters.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Norman Alessi professor emeritus of psychiatry and associate
professor emeritus of pediatrics and communicable diseases.
Frank E. Beaver, Ph.D., professor of film and video studies and professor of
communications in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 2004.
Professor Beaver received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of North
Carolina in 1960 and 1966, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of
Michigan in 1970. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in
communications in 1969 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1970, associate
professor in 1974, and professor in 1984. He received an additional appointment as
professor of film and video studies in 1995.
Professor Beaver's contributions greatly enriched the culture of film within the
University, the Ann Arbor community, and beyond. He was the editor of Twayne's
Filmmakers Series, which documented the work of filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese,
David Lynch, Ingmar Bergman, and Sydney Lumet, and he is well-known for writing
On Film: A History of the Motion Picture, Dictionary of Film Terms, and several books
on American filmmaker Oliver Stone. Professor Beaver authored numerous articles and
reviews in professional journals and broadcast more than 700 film reviews and media
critiques on Michigan Radio. He was a contributor to the Detroit Free Press, The Wall


317




April Meeting, 2005


Street Journal, Newsweek, and WJR Radio, and he served on the Michigan Theater's
advisory council and board of trustees.
Professor Beaver was chair of the Department of Communications from 1987-91
and served as chair of the Summer Program in London through the Office of
International Programs in the 1990s.  A  much-loved teacher and mentor for
undergraduate students in the film and video studies program, he also taught film
history and documentary film courses in freshman seminars. Professor Beaver is the
recipient of numerous teaching awards and honors, including an Amoco Outstanding
Teaching Award in 1985 and an Arthur F. Thurnau Professorship from 1989-92.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Frank E. Beaver
professor emeritus of film and video studies and professor emeritus of communications.
E. Philip Howrey, Ph.D., professor of economics, professor of statistics, and
research scientist in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 2004.
Professor Howrey received his A.B. degree from Drake University in 1959 and his
Ph.D. degree from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in 1964. From
1964-73 he served on the faculties of Princeton University and the University of
Pennsylvania.  He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a professor of
economics in 1973 and received additional appointments as professor of statistics in
1977 and research scientist in 1979.
Professor Howrey   has made distinguished  contributions to time series
econometrics, forecasting, and the analysis of aggregate business conditions. His
research meshed contributions to econometric theory with applications to important
issues in economic policy. Professor Howrey's early work focused on how to take into
account randomness in macroeconomic policy analysis. More recently, he has explored
how to use imperfectly measured economic variables for forecasting and policy
analysis. Throughout his career, his research has addressed the problem of prediction of
macroeconomic aggregates.
Since 1980, Professor Howrey has been associated with the Research Seminar in
Quantitative Economics-the forecasting program of the economics department known
by its acronym: RSQE. He served as chair of the Model Comparison Seminar, which is
an international project whose purpose is to compare and improve macroeconomic
forecasting models. He has collaborated with modeling groups at numerous centers of
economic modeling activity throughout the United States. A beloved teacher and
advisor, Professor Howrey caused many students to consider econometrics to be their
favorite subject.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming E. Philip Howrey
professor emeritus of economics, professor emeritus of statistics, and research scientist
emeritus.

the U.S. Medical Army Corps in France and the Supreme Headquarters for the Allied
Powers in Belgium (1965-1968). Upon discharge, he enrolled in the University of

318




April Meeting, 2005


instructor in 1972 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1975 and associate
professor in 1979. During this phase of his career, he was primarily associated with a
joint program between the University and Wayne County General Hospital, where he
was in charge of the Hematology Outpatient and Microbiology Laboratories, vice
president of the medical staff (1980-82), and president of the medical staff (1982-85).
In 1986, after the University's working relationship with Wayne County General
Hospital ended, Dr. Silverman returned to the Medical School as a clinical associate
professor and as associate director of the MLabs Outreach Program; he was promoted to
director in 1991.  The outstanding success of MLabs is directly related to his
administrative and clinical expertise. Dr. Silverman has been instrumental in the
successful recruitment of hospitals, clinics, and physicians who utilize the professional
laboratory services provided by MLabs. Dr. Silverman also has served as director of a
number of community hospital laboratories, and he is a University of Michigan Hospital
and Health Centers representative to the Joint Venture Hospital Laboratories program
administered by the Michigan Health Corporation. This program consists of a network
of hospitals and institutions in the State of Michigan who have negotiated managed care
contracts with insurance carriers to provide laboratory services.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Eugene M.
Silverman clinical associate professor emeritus of pathology.

wholly owns ViDx, LLC. He has waived any personal participation in the sharing of
revenue received by the University.
Reassignment Agreement between the University of Michigan and Steven F.
Bolling, M.D.
The Regents approved a reassignment agreement between the University of
Michigan and Professor Steven F. Bolling for the technology, "Tricuspid Valve Ring for
Molding Ventricular Geometry" (UM OTT File No. 3085). Because Professor Bolling is
both a University of Michigan employee and also a party to the agreement with the
University, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.
The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Steven F. Bolling, M.D.
2.   Reassignment terms include Dr. Bolling being responsible for all patent expenses and
paying to the University 15% of royalties, equity, or other value received through
subsequent marketing and licensing of the invention.
Dr. Bolling will obtain ownership of the licensed technology and, unless appropriate
formal University approvals are obtained, continuing development of the invention
will take place without the use of University funds or facilities or funds administered
by the University.

the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Change in Name of the Frederick and         Barbara  M. Erb    Environmental
Management Institute
Regent Taylor moved to change the name of the Frederick and Barbara M. Erb
Environmental Management Institute to the Frederick A. and Barbara M. Erb Institute for
Global Sustainable Enterprise. Regent Brandon seconded the motion. Provost Courant
commented that this institute is another example of Michigan's leadership in
interdisciplinary studies, as this institute is jointly operated by the Stephen M. Ross
School of Business and the School of Natural Resources and Environment.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.

APRIL MEETING, 2005 - APPENDIX


POLICY AND PROCEDURE ON THE ACCEPTANCE, MANAGEMENT AND
DISPOSITION OF REAL ESTATE
APRIL 11, 2005
The Office of the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (EVPCFO)
issues this Policy and Procedure on the Acceptance, Management and Disposition of
Real Estate under the authority granted to the EVPCFO in the Regents Bylaws and
Regental action of April 18, 2002. This policy replaces all prior policies on the subject
and remains in effect until amended or revoked. This policy supplements SPG 601.23
on real estate transactions (attached) and, like SPG 601.23, should be distributed to all
of your affected staff. In addition, Hank Baier, Associate Vice President for Facilities
and Operations, and Sally Churchill, Assistant General Counsel, will make a brief
presentation on this new policy and SPG to the Academic Program Group, the Budget
Administrators Group, the Facilities Users Network, the Development Office and any
other groups you request. If you have any questions about either the policy or the SPG
please contact me.
I.   Overview
The University's Real Estate Office is located within Plant Extension at 326 E. Hoover
Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1002, 763-2302. The Real Estate Office reports to the
EVPCFO through the Associate Vice President for Facilities and Operations (AVPF&O).
The Real Estate Office, in close consultation with the AVPF&O and EVPCFO, handles
all real estate matters at the University, including those involving the Hospitals and Health
Centers, UM-Flint and UM-Dearbomrn. When a real estate transaction involves a gift, they
also work closely with the Office of the Vice President for Development staff (OVPD)
and unit development staff. The Real Estate Office also works in close collaboration
with the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs (Provost) to
implement this policy.
This Policy and Procedure on the Acceptance, Management and Disposition of Real
Estate describes the policies and procedures by which the University acquires (by gift
or otherwise), manages and disposes of real estate.
II. Procedures for Accepting Gifts of Real Estate
This section describes the process for accepting gifts of real estate. The appropriate
development staff from OVPD or units will be responsible for maintaining contact with
the donor, while the Real Estate Office will handle all other aspects of the real estate
transaction.
A. Due Diligence
The Real Estate Office first evaluates whether to accept a proposed gift
of real estate from an academic perspective, which includes teaching,
research and service. If the offered property is near campus, research or
teaching facilities, or it has potential use by a unit, the Real Estate Office
determines the interest of the appropriate unit. If the property is


329




April Meeting, 2005- Appendix


inappropriate for academic use, the Real Estate Office, in collaboration
with development staff and the Provost's Office, considers whether to
accept the property for the purpose of selling it, taking into account
management responsibilities, risk, valuation and opportunities to dispose
of the property. Factors the Real Estate Office considers are:
Can the property be offered for exchange to a governmental entity for
other real estate that better serves the University's purpose?
What are the management responsibilities and risks, and how do they
compare to potential sale proceeds?
What are the transaction costs of a sale (such as legal fees and broker
commission)?
Is the unit that benefits from the gift willing to pay the transaction costs?
If due diligence is otherwise favorable but valuation is minimal, donor
stewardship and overall donor relationship may be considered.
The Real Estate Office will ask development staff to obtain a completed
gift property questionnaire in consultation with the donor to establish
basic information about the real estate. If based on this information and
evaluation the Real Estate Office decides to further consider the gift, the
potential donor will be asked to submit or permit the following:
1. For gifts of a single-family residence (i.e., single family
homes, duplexes, condominium units, single family homes that
have been made into apartments and vacant lots in a developed
residential area) the Real Estate Office will require:
a. An on-site inspection and transactional screen or comparable
appropriate inquiry prepared for the Real Estate Office by the
University's Occupational Safety and Environmental Health Department
(OSEH) or its consultant, in cooperation with the donor. The University
will cover the costs of this as part of the transaction costs.
i. If this assessment reveals there is or may be environmental
impairment, the Real Estate Office will decline the gift, accept
the gift, or follow the procedure outlined in 2., below.
b. An indemnity through which the donor indemnifies the University for
liabilities arising from pre-existing environmental impairment. If the
environmental assessment reveals there is or may be environmental
impairment and the Real Estate Office accepts the gift, the indemnity
may be limited to undisclosed risks.
c. Appropriate warranties and representations regarding the
environmental condition of the property and compliance with applicable
laws.
d. Other documents that are appropriate based on applicable law.


330




April Meeting, 2005- Appendix


2. For gifts of non-residential property the Real Estate Office
will require:
a. A Phase I environmental assessment or comparable appropriate
inquiry prepared for the Real Estate Office by the University's
consultant in cooperation with the donor. The donor will be expected to
pay this cost.
i. If this environmental assessment reveals that there is or may be
environmental impairment, the Real Estate Office will decline the
gift, accept the gift, or follow the procedure outlined in 3., below.
b. An indemnity through which the donor indemnifies the University for
liabilities arising from pre-existing environmental impairment. If the
environmental assessment reveals there is or may be environmental
impairment and the Real Estate Office accepts the gift, the indemnity
may be limited to undisclosed risks.
c. Appropriate warranties and representations regarding the
environmental condition of the real estate and compliance with
applicable laws.
d. Other documents that are appropriate based on applicable law.
3. For all properties where the Phase I or comparable
appropriate inquiry reveals that there is or may be
environmental impairment, the Real Estate Office may require:
a. A Phase II or comparable appropriate inquiry prepared for the Real
Estate Office by the University's consultant in cooperation with the
donor. The donor will be expected to pay this cost.
b. A baseline environmental assessment authorized by Part 201 of the
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (MCL 324.20101
et seq.) for real estate located in Michigan, or the assessment authorized
by the jurisdiction where the real estate is located, if applicable, in
cooperation with the donor. The University will pay this cost.
c. An indemnity through which the donor indemnifies the University for
liabilities arising from pre-existing contamination. If the additional
environmental assessment reveals there is or may be environmental
impairment and the Real Estate Office accepts the gift, the indemnity
may be limited to undisclosed risks.
d. Appropriate warranties and representations regarding the
environmental condition of the property and compliance with
environmental laws.
e. Other documents that are appropriate based on applicable law.
4. For all gifts of real estate (residential and non-residential),
the Real Estate Office will require (at donor's expense), as
appropriate,


331




April Meeting, 2005 - Appendix


a. a survey if the University concludes it is necessary for use or sale
b. a title commitment of nominal value showing donor's interest in the
property and the condition of title
c. a qualified appraisal or other market analysis such as comparables
5. If the University decides to accept the gift under B., below,
the parties will execute a gift agreement prepared by the
University's Development Legal Office of the Office of the
General Counsel. The following will also be expected of the
donor:
* A draft deed and a signed original warranty deed in
recordable form at closing
*  A title policy at closing
*  A commitment to pay property taxes, assessments and
other expenses on the real estate to the date of the gift
*  A trust agreement acceptable to the University if the real
estate is used to fund a charitable remainder trust
*  For life estate arrangements, a commitment to pay all
expenses, including maintenance costs and property
taxes, until the University assumes full ownership.
B. Acceptance of the Gift
If due diligence is favorable the EVPCFO will accept the gift or ask the
Regents to accept the gift pursuant to Bylaw 3.05, which requires
Regental approval if maintenance of the gift will add to the ordinary
operating budget of the University. If the gift is accepted, the property
will be (a) used for an academic or administrative purpose or (b) added
to the University's inventory of real estate available for sale. If the
property is sold, the department benefiting from the gift will receive the
net sale proceeds after accounting for transaction costs. When the
EVPCFO accepts the gift without Regental approval pursuant Bylaw
3.05, the gift acceptance will be reported to the Regents in the OVPD's
monthly Report on Voluntary Support.
C. Modifications of Procedures for Gifts
The EVPCFO may modify these real estate procedures, except those in
the Bylaws, when the offered property has strategic value because it is
adjacent to University property or will be used for a University purpose,
or when otherwise merited by special circumstances.
III. Acquisition of University Real Estate
This section describes explains how the University acquires real estate other than through
donations.


332




April Meeting, 2005 - Appendix


A. Due Diligence
When the Real Estate Office learns of the potential availability of
strategically located property that office notifies the AVPF&O,
determines valuation, and undertakes due diligence. Valuation is
determined through an appraisal or market analysis such as review of
comparables. Due diligence includes an inspection by the Real Estate
Office and OSEH, a review of title work, a survey if needed, and other
activities appropriate to the circumstances. The Real Estate Office
negotiates an acceptable purchase agreement with the property owner
before undertaking due diligence. This agreement addresses the terms
and conditions of a sale (e.g. price, earnest money, closing date, title
company and the required contingency that the purchase will not occur
without Regental approval).
The Real Estate Office works closely with the Office of the Vice
President and General Counsel throughout the process.
B. Regental Approval of the Acquisition
If an acceptable purchase agreement is negotiated and due diligence
favorable, the EVPCFO will ask the Regents to approve the purchase. If
the transaction is consummated, the property becomes part of the
University's real estate inventory and is then used for its intended
academic or administrative purpose.
IV. Disposition of Real Estate
This section describes how the University disposes of real estate, whether it came to the
University as a gift or in some other manner.
A. Approval Process
Bylaw 3.07 says the Regents must approve the sale of any University
real estate. The only exception is gifted property that is not located near
one of the campuses, which pursuant to Bylaw 3.07 may be sold by the
EVPCFO and reported to the Regents. Such properties must be sold for
the appraised value or more except when the University is not the sole
owner of all property interests, in which instance the University
cooperates with the owners of the remaining property interests to
accomplish the sale.
B. Sales Procedures
Whenever the University considers selling real estate (except gifted
property referenced in A, above), the Real Estate Office first consults the
appropriate University units to determine whether a sale is appropriate.
A sale is generally considered only when the property has no immediate
or foreseeable use and market conditions are considered. If based upon
these inquiries the EVPCFO concludes a sale is appropriate, the Real
Estate Office obtains an appraisal or reviews comparables to establish
price. The University then offers the property for sale using, to the fullest


333




April Meeting, 2005- Appendix


extent possible, competitive practices and one or more of the following
methods:
SUse of a Realtor/Broker: The University may retain a realtor or
broker, whose commission is negotiated based on local market
conditions. The University requires the realtor or broker to use
appropriate strategies to obtain the most favorable terms and conditions
for the University. The Real Estate Office will establish acceptable
terms but the realtor/broker negotiates with potential buyers.. The Bid Process: The Real Estate Office may contact adjacent owners
and advertise in local newspapers, describing the bid process, estimated
value or price, and deadline. In this situation, the Real Estate Office
handles the transaction without a realtor, seeking the most favorable
terms and conditions for the University.
SPosting signs: The Real Estate Office may post "for sale" signs on the
property and advertise in local newspapers. The Real Estate Office also
handles this transaction without a realtor, seeking the most favorable
terms and conditions for the University.
These last two methods are used together when feasible.
The Real Estate Office evaluates all offers, taking into consideration
price, timing, contingencies, proposed use and any other University
priorities. That office selects the best offer and negotiates terms (price,
due diligence, and contingencies), which are incorporated into a
purchase agreement. Unless the real estate is gifted real estate located
away from the three campuses (which can be sold by the EVPCFO), the
purchase agreement will require Regental approval of the sale. There is
a presumption in favor of retaining the mineral interests on properties
sold by the University but the EVPCFO may make an exception under
appropriate circumstances.
If the buyer is satisfied with due diligence, the EVPCFO asks the
Regents to approve the sale. If the sale is consummated, the EVPCFO
decides upon the appropriate distribution of sale proceeds within the
University.
C. Other Disposition
On rare occasions the University disposes of relatively small, incidental
parcels of real estate without invoking the sales procedures described in
B., above. These transfers arise from property management concerns
such as right-of-way or boundary issues, and often involve a unit of
government such as a state agency (Michigan Department of
Transportation or Michigan Department of Natural Resources) or the
local municipality. In such circumstances, the EVPCFO may ask the
Regents to authorize transfer of ownership through a quit claim of
nominal value or based on appraised value rather than follow the
competitive practices described in B., above.


334




ApriI Meeting,2005 -Appendix


V.     Real Estate Management
SPG 601.23 provides details on the University's standard practices for all real estate
transactions. This SPG makes clear that, with the exception of certain authority given to
the Hospitals and Health Centers and the Chancellors at U-M Flint and U-M Dearborn,
the Real Estate Office is responsible for the management of all leases on and off campus
(including build to suit arrangements, contracts for renovation of non-University space,
capital leases and lease-to-buy arrangements), and all other types of real estate
transactions such as purchases and sales, new real estate developments and access to
University property. The EVPCFO will seek Regental approval for all leases (on and off
campus) when (a) the square footage being leased through a single lease exceeds 50,000
square feet; (b) there are existing leases with the University in a particular building or a
related complex of buildings and the square footage being leased through any new or
revised lease would cause the total amount of leased square footage in the building or
related complex of buildings to exceed 50,000 square feet; or (c) the lease duration to
which the University is committed at any given time exceeds ten (10) years. The
EVPCFO will annually report to Regents in an information item all situations where the
total square footage being leased in a particular building or in a related complex of
buildings exceeds 50,000 square feet.
Annually, the EVPCFO will provide the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee of
the Regents a detailed report on the current commercial leasing portfolio.

MAY MEETING, 2005


The University oftMichigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, Miay 19, 2005
The Regents convened at 2:10 p.m. in the Fairlane Center South Building on the
University of Michigan-Dearborn campus. Present were President Coleman and
Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White.
Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Provost Courant, Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor
Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice
President Slottow, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order and said how pleased everyone was to
be meeting on the Dearborn campus. She noted that leaders of the three campuses have
been exploring ways in which the three campuses can leverage and build on each other's
strengths for the benefit of all. This meeting on the Dearborn campus offers another
opportunity to foster this type of dialog.
President Coleman noted that the University had recently announced the
establishment of its new Detroit Center on Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit.
This center will house many of the University's long-standing programs in Detroit from
both the Dearborn and Ann Arbor campuses and will provide an opportunity for
enhanced collaboration. She called attention to agenda items, including an addition to
the Kelsey Museum that will be entirely funded by a generous gift from Edwin and
Mary Meader and by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, and the renovation of Mosher-Jordan Hall as part of the Residential Life
Initiative.
President Coleman also noted with regret the recent passing of James Brinkerhoff,
chief financial officer from 1977-1988, and former athletic director Don Canham.
Presentation: The "Metropolitan Vision" for the University of Michigan-Dearborn
Chancellor Little gave a presentation on the wide-ranging discussions that have been
taking place regarding the role that the Dearborn campus can play both within the
University of Michigan and within the metropolitan Detroit region. The vision that has
emerged would fit the campus's history and strengths, deepen its regional impact, and
complement the University of Michigan as a whole. Concisely stated, the campus would
aim to deliver the academic excellence of the University of Michigan in leadership and
service to metropolitan Detroit.
Chancellor Little explained how the University of Michigan-Dearborn exemplifies
an emerging category of American universities, the "metropolitan university." The
campus envisions becoming a nationally recognized leader as a selective metropolitan
university, focusing on the needs of metropolitan Detroit, and becoming a leader in


337




M'ay Meeting, 2005


creating a successful future for southeast Michigan. To do this, the Dearborn campus
will focus on such issues as the future of manufacturing and global competitiveness;
race and ethnicity issues; environmental issues; pre-K-12 education; and developing a
regional leadership capacity. Chancellor Little noted that there are already a number of
programs in place in these areas. He pointed out that enrollment growth is key to all of
the strategies planned for the campus, and the goal is to achieve an enrollment of 12,000
students by 2014.
President Coleman asked Chancellor Little to comment on student retention issues.
He noted that although the 6-year graduation rate appears to be unacceptably low, many
of the students have transferred to and graduated from other institutions. Nevertheless,
campus leaders are working to achieve an increase in the number of students who
remain and graduate from the University of Michigan-Dearborn.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that he
and committee members White and Taylor had met that morning and had focused
primarily on the internal audit activities provided by the Office of University Audits. The
committee received the regular bimonthly update and six-month report on audit activity
and then shifted to a discussion with Carol Senneff, executive director of University
audits, of risk assessment and the FY 2006 audit plan. Ms. Senneff also reviewed her
strategic vision and her organizational strategy for the Office of University Audits. The
committee also received a regular update on the Life Sciences Institute.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee.      Regent Maynard
reported that she, along with Regents Deitch, Richner, and McGowan, had met and
received a report on staff employment from Laurita Thomas, associate vice president
and chief human resource officer, and an update on dean searches from Provost
Courant. The committee also discussed with Vice President Churchill plans for
conducting the Board's upcoming presidential performance review.
Annual Promotions to the Ranks of Professor and Associate Professor
Provost Courant summarized the promotion review process and noted that this year,
for the first time, many of the reviews were done electronically and next year the entire
process will be conducted in this fashion through a secure server. He called attention to
the following individuals as examples of exemplary promotions on the Ann Arbor
campus:   Barbara L. Fredrickson, recommended for promotion to professor of
psychology, with tenure, in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and professor
of management and organizations, without tenure, in the Stephen M. Ross School of
Business; Sharon C. Glotzer, recommended for promotion to professor of chemical
engineering with tenure, professor of materials science and engineering without tenure,
and professor of macromolecular science and engineering without tenure in the College of
Engineering, and professor of physics without tenure in the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts; Ifeoma C. Nwankwo, recommended for promotion to associate professor of
English language and literature with tenure and associate professor of Afroamerican and
African studies with tenure in the college of Literature, Science, and the Arts; Zhaohui
Xu, recommended for promotion to associate professor of biological chemistry with
tenure in the Medical School, and research associate professor in the Life Sciences
Institute; Mary Hope Simoni, recommended for promotion to professor of music (music


338




M'ay Meeting, 2005


technology) with tenure in the School of Music; and Daniel J. Scheeres, recommended for
the granting of tenure to be held with his title of associate professor of aerospace
engineering in the College of Engineering.
Executive Vice President Kelch called attention to the portfolios of Dr. Kathleen
L. Collins, recommended for promotion to associate professor of internal medicine with
tenure and associate professor of microbiology and immunology without tenure in the
Medical School; Akinlolu O. Ojo, recommended for promotion to associate professsor
of internal medicine, with tenure; Dr. Phillip C. Hanna, recommended for promotion to
associate professor of microbiology and immunology; Dr. Celina G. Kleer,
recommended for promotion to associate professor of pathology with tenure; and Dr.
Elisabeth H. Quint, recommended for promotion to professor of obstetrics and
gynecology on the clinical track.
Chancellor Little described the rigorous tenure review process on the Dearborn
campus and highlighted the portfolio of Suzanne L. Bergeron, recommended for
promotion to associate professor of women's studies and associate professor of social
sciences, with tenure, and Yi Zhang, recommended for promotion to professor of
mechanical engineering, with tenure.
Chancellor Mestas noted that the nine University of Michigan-Flint faculty
members being recommended for promotion have all demonstrated outstanding records
in teaching, research, and service; although on the Flint campus the greatest emphasis is
placed on quality of teaching. He highlighted the cases of Martin M. Kaufman,
recommended for promotion to professor of earth and resource science, with tenure, and
Robert W. Barnett, recommended for promotion to professor of English, with tenure.
The Regents then turned to the remainder of the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of April 21, 2005.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report, the
Plant Extension Report, and the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report. He
noted that, in addition to the previously announced American Institute of Architects
(AIA) award received by the Hill Auditorium Renovation project, the project had also
received an award from the Michigan chapter of AIA and is to receive a construction
and design award from the Engineering Society of Detroit. He also announced that the
Dana Building renovation had been awarded the gold LEED rating from the U.S. Green
Building Council.
Regarding the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report, he noted that the
classification study that will ultimately replace the current classification system is
continuing and phase one implementation "go live" will occur in July.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report. Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of projects
established, April 1-April 30, 2005. He commented that research awards through April


339




M'ay Meeting, 2005


2005 are up $65 million over the same period last year, an increase of 13.7%.
Expenditures from federal sources are up 7.2%.
University of Michigan Health System.      Executive Vice President Kelch
reported that the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers had received an
award from Hospitals for a Healthy Environment, the premier national recognition of
environmental innovation in health care, for the Hospitals' work in reducing waste,
virtually eliminating mercury, and minimizing the use of toxic products.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper called attention to two action
items, the Mosher-Jordan Hall Renovation Project and the request for approval of the
2005-2006 University Housing rates. She noted that Mosher-Jordan Hall was the
campus's first large residential facility and was viewed at the time as a model for
excellence in residence halls. This project represents the first deep renovation of a
heritage building being undertaken as part of the Residential Life Initiative, and it is
critical to ensuring the building's longevity. She described some of the features of the
renovation.
Regent Newman inquired how long the annual incremental rate increases in
student housing fees would be needed to provide funding for the renovations being done
as part of the Residential Life Initiative. Vice President Harper noted that this facility
renewal increase will be needed each year at least until 2010 in order to fund all
planned facilities renovations. The rate increase requested for 2005-2006 includes
1.9% for infrastructure renewal.
University  of Michigan-Dearborn.       Chancellor Little  highlighted  the
recommended appointment of Bruce O. Bublitz as dean of the School of Management.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas reported that the Flint campus
is "healthy, vibrant, and bursting with creative energy."
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Jesse Levine, president of MSA, informed
the Regents of the steps MSA has taken to ensure it is providing proper stewardship of
MSA funds. He noted that the organization is committed to fiscal responsibility and
also to saving students money. He also reported on MSA priorities and event planning
for the coming year.
Regent Newman requested that the board be provided information about the
current budget of MSA if the organization requests a fee increase.
Mr. Levine introduced Ms. Darla Williams, president of the Residence Hall
Association (RHA), who expressed RHA's support for the Mosher-Jordan renovation

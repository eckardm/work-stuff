JULY MEETING, 1963


The Secretary reported the retirement of thirteen members of the
faculty. The following memoirs were adopted:
Iw. w. Blume:      WILLIAM    WIRT BLUME, Professor of Law, attained the statutory retireMemoir   ment age in January and relinquished his active faculty status at the end of the
past academic year.
Professor Blume began his legal career a number of years before completing
his formal legal studies at The University of Michigan, having practiced law in
Texas and taught in the law school of Soochow University in China before he
enrolled in the Law School here in 1926. He earned his Bachelor of Laws degree
in 1927 and a Doctor of Juridical Science degree in 1928. On the strength partly
of research already undertaken in the nascent program supported by the late
William W. Cook, he was then appointed Assistant Professor of Law and of Legal
Research. He continued to hold such a dual appointment for thirteen years, rising
in it to a professorship.
During those years he compiled and edited the Transactions of the Supreme
Court of the Territory of Michigan, 1805-1836, in six volumes. The fruits of
these and other labors were the unique course which he offered in American legal
history and a series of articles, which may yet be extended, on law as it was
practiced on the American frontier. Meanwhile he was assuming increasing responsibility for courses in legal procedure at all levels, which he taught with his
accustomed thoroughness and energy and for which he prepared full and accurate
text materials. Enjoying the warm respect of colleagues and students alike, he was
fittingly chosen to supervise the centennial survey of legal education at Michigan
in 1959. His other extracurricular duties included chairmanship of the Faculty
Advisory Committee of the Michigan Law Review and membership on the Committee on University Lectures and on the Committee on Civil Procedures of the
State Bar.
The Regents of the University now     express their esteem  for Professor
Blume's abilities and his enterprise, and their gratitude for his long devotion.
Conferring on him the title Professor Emeritus of Law, they cordially extend to
him the perquisites of his new rank.
C. E. Burklund:     CARL EDWIN BURKLUND, Professor of English in the College of EngiMemoir   neering, concluded his teaching career on June 8 at the age of sixty-six, having
been associated with the University for nearly forty years.
Reared in western Michigan and schooled in Grand Rapids, Professor Burklund
was graduated from Western State Teachers College in Kalamazoo in 1922 and
taught there for the two years succeeding. His master's and doctor's degrees he
earned at this University in 1925 and 1928 respectively. He was appointed
Instructor in English in the Engineering College upon earning his master's degree,
and was elevated to Assistant Professor in 1929, to Associate Professor in 1935,
and to Professor in 1940.
Professor Burklund has been an authoritative and inspiring teacher and a
dedicated member of his departmental faculty. His poetic gifts, which entered
implicitly into his teaching, were made fully manifest in the poems which he
contributed to such periodicals as Poetry, The Sewanee Review, and The Virginia
Quarterly Review. In addition, he wrote prose criticism and articles on education
for literary and professional journals, edited anthologies of verse and of prose, and
served on the editorial boards of Poetry World and Better Verse. By virtue of his
attainments and qualities, he lent spirit and morale to the whole enterprise of
literary study in his college.
On the occasion of appointing him Professor Emeritus of English in the
College of Engineering, the Regents of the University warmly thank him for his
liberal expense of talent and devotion and cordially extend to him the perquisites
of emeritus rank.
S. D. Dodge:      STANLEY DALTON DODGE, Professor of Geography, retired from teaching
Memoir   at the age of sixty-five, upon the conclusion of the academic year.
Professor Dodge was born in New York City, where his father, the geographer
Richard Elwood Dodge, was serving on the Columbia University faculty. His own
baccalaureate and doctoral degrees he earned at the University of Chicago. He
came to the relatively new Department of Geography at The University of
Michigan as an Instructor in 1925, and was appointed Assistant Professor in
1927, Associate in 1935, and Professor in 1962.
Having a predilection for informal and intimate teaching, Professor Dodge
was peculiarly successful in eliciting from graduate students their ablest and most
earnest effort; a number of the most eminent geographers in the nation completed
their doctoral work under his tutelage. He was further an apt and able tutor in




JULY MEETING, 1963


31


the Honors Program of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. His own
scholarship, including his American population studies and his articles on the New
England frontier, proved seminal, somewhat in the manner of his teaching.
For the mechanistic and bureaucratic elements in modern university life, he
had less predilection. It was perhaps in reaction against these that he undertook
the discipline leading to his ordination as an Episcopal priest in 1955. On the
occasion of his early retirement, the Regents of the University thank him most
warmly and regret the loss of services which no other man, of whatever gifts, can
now supply. Appointing him Professor Emeritus of Geography, they trust that he
will long retain his associations within the University community.
MAURICE BARKLEY EICHELBERGER, Associate Professor of Engineering Graphics, retired from the active faculty of the College of Engineering at the
end of the past academic year, concluding a forty-year span of teaching.
Upon earning his baccalaureate from Michigan Agricultural College in 1916.
Professor Eichelberger worked for six years, chiefly as a draftsman, for industrial
houses and for the United States Army. He then came to the College of
Engineering to teach drawing, though continuing also at intervals to add to his
industrial experience. The University advanced him to Assistant Professor in 1924
and to Associate Professor in 1953. A patient and painstaking teacher, Professor
Eichelberger became well acquainted with his students individually and was
rewarded by their affectionate regard. A devoted and in a manner jealous
guardian of the standards of his department, he was active in departmental affairs.
adjusting the credit of transfer students and co-ordinating the examination program
in engineering drawing. As manager of the blueprinting facilities of the Engineering College, he efficiently performed invaluable services for the entire University.
As he now enters upon his retirement, the Regents of the University thank
him most warmly for his able and faithful fulfillment of his many obligations over
the years, and cordially welcome him among the emeritus faculty with the title
Associate Professor Emeritus of Engineering Graphics.
STANLEY GEORGE FONTANNA, Dean of the School of Natural Resources.
who was granted permission to retire from the active faculty at age sixty-nine.
began his retirement on June 8, 1963.
Dean Fontanna was graduated from the Department of Forestry of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in 1917, earning a Bachelor of Science in
Forestry degree on the second occasion when that degree was conferred. After a
term of military service, he embarked upon an eminent career in private and state
forestry, becoming in 1934 Deputy Director of the Michigan Department of Conservation, and enjoying such honors as the presidency of the Association of State
Foresters and membership on the governing council of the Society of American
Foresters. In 1951 the University accepted his breadth of experience and analytical
bent of mind in lieu of a specifically academic background, and invited him to
assume the deanship which he has just relinquished.
Coming to the School of Natural Resources shortly after its sweeping reorganization, Dean Fontanna devoted himself to securing the foundation upon which
a school as comprehensive as that name implies must build. Specifically, he was
fruitfully concerned with problems of staffing and housing. Under his leadership.
his school occupied respectably commodious quarters for the first time in many
years. Its steady growth in accord with the philosophy underlying the reorganization of 1950 became assured. During his deanship he further continued his active
professional career, serving as chairman or councilman of national forestry associations and of numerous state committees devoted to conservation in Michigan.
His colleagues in natural resources, sensitive to the warmth of his personality
as well as to his administrative gifts, experience a sense of personal loss upon his
retirement. The Regents of the University express their own warm appreciation
of his talents and his services as they confer upon him the titles Dean Emeritus of
the School of Natural Resources and Professor Emeritus of Forestry.
BRUCE DOUGLAS GREENSHIELDS, Lecturer in Transportation Engineering and Assistant Director of the Transportation Institute, formally concluded his
teaching career in the College of Engineering on the thirtieth of June. at the
statutory age of seventy.
Mr. Greenshields was educated at Oklahoma University and The University of

research or supervisory services undertaken for the Wisconsin and Ohio departments of highways, the City of Granville (Ohio), the Yale Bureau of Highway
Traffic, and the national offices of the Chief of Engineers and the Chief of
Transportation of the United States Army. He came to the Transportation Institute here in 1956 to conduct research into the causes of traffic accidents and has
since taught courses in the departments of Civil Engineering and Engineering
Mechanics.
Mr. Greenshields' mathematical studies of traffic flow and his scientific
determinations of the customary behavior of drivers have introduced novel elements of precision and objectivity into traffic research. The University is fortunate
in having enjoyed the services of so capable and creative an engineer. The Regents
of the University, who now appoint him Lecturer Emeritus in Transportation
Engineering and Assistant Director Emeritus of the Transportation Institute, offer
him their warm personal thanks and express their high expectations for the
research which he will continue to pursue under University auspices.
C. I. Hayner:     CHARLOTTE IRENE HAYNER, Associate Professor of Library Science,
Memoir   and nationally known authority on school librarianship and children's books, has
been granted permission to retire from the active faculty at the end of the past
University year.
Miss Hayner was born in Brunswick, New York, in 1896 and earned her
baccalaureate in arts with distinction at Cornell University in 1917. After a brief
but various experience as a high school teacher, she completed a course in library
science at the New York State Library School in 1924 and came straight to Ann
Arbor as librarian of the new University High School. In that post she remained
for twenty-one years, with stints of summer teaching at the New York State
Library School and at Syracuse University. In 1945 she joined the library science
faculty of the University of Minnesota. In 1954 she returned to The University of
Michigan on a visiting appointment and in the following year accepted the associate professorship which she is now relinquishing.
Having a persuasive personality and a comprehensive knowledge of her
specialty, she has been a lively and sensitive teacher and an incisive consultant
to school and public libraries in all parts of Michigan. Gifted also as a speaker
and chairman of deliberative bodies, she further enjoyed a long and profitable
career in professional associations, having served in the year just past as president
of the Michigan Association of School Librarians.
The Regents of the University join Miss Hayner's colleagues in expressing
warm appreciation for her distinguished services to librarianship both within the
University and throughout the state. Appointing her Associate Professor Emeritus
of Library Science, they cordially extend to her the privileges of emeritus rank.
A. Hyma: Memoir       ALBERT HYMA, Professor of History, retired from the active faculty at the
end of the past academic year, after forty-nine years of association with the
University.
Born in Groningen, The Netherlands, Professor Hyma came to Michigan in
1910, and proceeded to enter The University of Michigan in 1914 as a transfer
student from Calvin College. Here he earned his baccalaureate degree in 1915, his
master's degree in the following year, and his doctorate in 1922. After two years
of teaching at the University of North Dakota, he returned to Ann Arbor in 1924
as Instructor in History and rose through the ranks to a professorship in 1936.
In 1927 he won the Henry Russel Award, for research chiefly in early modern
Dutch history. In 1936 he was knighted by Queen Wilhelmina for the same work
as later augmented.
Though he became an American citizen early in his teaching career, Professor
Hyma retained a special feeling for the outpouring of political and religious
genius in his native land during the Renaissance and the Reformation, and intensively studied the intellectual monuments and historical documents pertaining to
that period. His further inquiries into the early Dutch settlements in Michigan
were of great interest to descendants of the settlers as well as to American historians. And he possessed, finally, a lively awareness of the bearing of his historical
studies upon the religion, morality, and knowledge of our own time.
The Regents of the University take this occasion to thank Professor Hyma for
his assiduous and fruitful labors and trust that he will long enjoy the privileges of
the title which they now confer, Professor Emeritus of History.
1>. H. Jeserich:   PAUL HAROLD      JESERICH, Dean of the School of Dentistry, who conMemoir   cluded his retirement furlough at the end of June, first became associated with the
University fifty-three years ago when he entered the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts in the Class of 1914. He did not decide to enter the dental profession,
however, until he had worked for a number of years after college. Returning to

Ann Arbor, he earned his Doctor of Dental Surgery degree in 1924, remained to
teach for three years in the Dental School and, after a term of private practice
joined the dental faculty permanently in 1933. His professorship dates from 1935.
From  1935 to 1946, he directed the Operative Clinic of his School; from  1937
until his retirement, he was in charge of the graduate and postgraduate education
program  sponsored by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. He was appointed Dean
in 1950.
Dr. Jeserich united a devotion to the highest standards of technical proficiency
with a responsible social concern for the general availability of dental care. The
chief testimony to his talents as dental educator is, and will remain, the profes
sional excellence of the University's Dental School graduates, which has long been
acknowledged among practitioners generally, and which was specifically attested
by the Council on Dental Education of the American Dental Association two years
ago. More personal honors were conferred on Dr. Jeserich by the American Dental
Association, which elected him president in 1959, by the Royal College of Surgeons
(London), which elected him to its dental section in the same year, and by other
professional associations near and far. His high sense of civic and social responsibility was illustrated by his many services to local, state, and national agencies
including the Ann Arbor Veterans Hospital and the Joint Council of the Health
Professions to Improve the Health Care of the Aged.
The Regents of the University, who now appoint Dr. Jeserich Dean Emeritus
of the School of Dentistry, Director Emeritus of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation
Institute: Graduate and Postgraduate Dentistry, and Professor Emeritus of Dentistry, express their respectful gratitude to him for his able and dedicated labors.
Warmly extending to him the privileges accorded to the emeritus faculty, they
trust that he will long retain his associations within the University community.
ALBERT LUCONI, Associate Professor of Clarinet, formally relinquished his  A. Luconi:
active faculty status at the last Commencement, after having taught at the Univer-  Memoir
sity for twenty years.
A native Italian, Mr. Luconi earned a master's diploma at the Royal Academy
of Saint Cecilia in Rome in 1919. and performed as first clarinetist with the
Augusteum and the La Scala-Toscanini orchestras before assuming the same office
with the Detroit Symphony in 1923. Thereafter he performed with the Manhattar
Opera Company and radio station WJR, taught briefly at Wayne University, and
supervised the state W.P.A. Music Project in Lansing. He accepted his first
appointment at the University in 1943. Devoting an increasing amount of time to
instruction here, he was elevated to Assistant Professor in 1952 and Associate
Professor in 1960.
In his service at the University. Mr. Luconi went far beyond the call of duty.
selflessly nurturing the individual careers of each one of his students. His own
superior artistry was manifested in his performances with the University Woodwind
Quintet. which he assisted in founding, and in his several appearances with the
Stanley Quartet.
On this occasion of conferring on him the title Associate Professor Emeritus
of Clarinet, the Regents of the University express their warm regard for him as
man and as musician, and their gratification that he will continue to lend his
distinguished talent to the School of Music for the first semester of the next
school year.
JULIUS CLARK PALMER, Professor of Engineering Graphics, completed         J. C. Palmer:
his terminal furlough on June 8 and entered upon his retirement. He taught his  Memoir
first class at the University nearly fifty years ago.
Professor Palmer came here immediately upon his graduation from the
University of Illinois in 1914, and was advanced to Assistant Professor in 1920.
to Associate Professor in 1929, and to Professor in 1945. During the major
portion of his teaching career, he was responsible for course organization and text
materials in the field of descriptive geometry, a subject which, since it translates
abstract mathematical ideas into visible concretion, is emblematic of all engineering studies. Though numbers of other schools used his materials, he claimed no
royalties for them. His students freely attest the value of his precise and thoroug]
instruction. He further ably served the students and his college by advising and
classifying the engineering freshmen over a period of many years. During summer
intervals he lent his talents and his wide experience to the cities of Detroit and
Jackson and to private engineering firms.
The Regents of the University. now appoint him Professor Emeritus of Engineering Graphics, warmly thank him for his long and dedicated service, and trust
that he will for many years enjoy the hospitality extended to the emeritus faculty.

JULY MEETING, 1963


K. Scharenberg:    KONSTANTIN      SCHARENBERG, Professor of Neuropathology, is retiring
Memoir   from the active faculty at the statutory age of seventy. After earning his medical
degree at the University of Hamburg, he served on the faculties of the medical
school there, in Minsk, in Berlin, and at Yale University before coming to Ann
Arbor in 1930 to direct the state neuropathology laboratory. Here he devoted
himself to research in the State Psychopathic Hospital, subsequently the Neuropsychiatric Institute, and here he also enjoyed increasing responsibilities as a
teacher in the departments of Psychiatry and Neurology, rising through the several
ranks to a professorship in 1952. In 1957-58, on the strength partly of having
devised highly creative techniques of staining nerve tissue with silver compounds,
he served as president of the American Association of Neuropathology. He is now
continuing to pursue research in the Mental Health Research Institute.
On behalf of the University and of the people of Michigan, the Regents
express their deep gratitude to Dr. Scharenberg for his distinguished service to the
Medical School and to the Neuropsychiatric Institute. On behalf of all his human
fellows, insofar as is appropriate for them so to speak, the Regents express their
gratitude to him for his advancement of medical knowledge. Appointing him
Professor Emeritus of Neuropathology, they cordially tender him the perquisites
of that title and express their satisfaction that he will pursue his inquiries further
under University auspices.
B. A. Uhlendorf:    BERNHARD ALEXANDER UHLENDORF, Editor of Publications, Office of
Memoir   Research Administration, retired from the active staff of the University on the
first of this month, at the statutory age of seventy.
A native of Germany, he came to the United States in 1911, completed a year
of high school in St. Louis, Missouri, and earned A.B. and M.A. degrees from
Washington University. After a term of military service, he resumed his graduate
studies at the University of Illinois, earning a doctorate in Germanic languages
and literatures in 1920, and proceeded to teach German at Illinois and at the
University of California at Los Angeles. Coming to The University of Michigan
in 1930, he taught briefly and earned a further degree in library science. Having
already undertaken much editorial and bibliographical work, he then served successively as bibliographer for the University Library, director and editor of the
Michigan Manuscripts and Imprints Inventory, and director of publications for
Edwards Brothers. He assumed his editorial offices for the Engineering Research
Institute, later the Office of Research Administration, in 1950.
Having a precise and flexible command of language, a vast store of general
knowledge, and a high degree of proficiency in the techniques of printing and
publishing, Mr. Uhlendorf made a contribution to research such as no one not
conversant with the difficulties besetting technical publication can appreciate or
assess. He went far beyond the call of duty in lending his wise and expert counsel
to individual staff members and graduate students. Avocationally he continued his
notable personal career in history and letters, which has embraced, among other
things, articles on German-American life and poetry and editions of the diaries
and letters of German soldiers in the American Revolution.
Upon the conclusion of his active association with the University, the Regents
extend to Mr. Uhlendorf their warm and respectful gratitude and trust that, as
Editor Emeritus of Publications for the Office of Research Administration, he will
long enjoy the accomplishments and sustain the pursuits of a humane and versatile life.

On the recommendation of the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance, authorization was granted to purchase from Richard L.
Fahrner, Administrator of the estate of Linda Kalmbach, deceased,
the property at 215 Observatory Street, Ann Arbor, at a price of
$23,000. The Regents further authorized negotiations with adjoining
property owners on Observatory Street for purchase of the balance of
this land unit at a reasonable cost to provide for Medical Center
expansion.
On recommendation of the Dean of the Law School and the VicePresident in charge of business and finance, an agreement with Ann
Arbor banks to establish a guaranteed loan fund for law students was
approved. The agreement with the Ann Arbor Bank and the National
Bank and Trust Company of Ann Arbor, patterned after the Michigan
Higher Education Assistance Authority Plan, will be established according to the following procedure, under the direction of the VicePresident in charge of business and finance:
1. The University would deposit with each bank in a blocked savings account
the sum of $5,000.00. This account would draw interest at the standard bank rate
so long as it remained on deposit.
2. The University. acting through the Law School, would make loans to law
students after examination of their needs and take a promissory note for the
amount of the loan.
3. No student would be loaned more than $1,250.00 in any one year or a
total exceeding $2,500.00 under the plan.
4. The banks will purchase these notes up to an amount equal to five times the
amount on deposit in the blocked savings account. Notes would be purchased without recourse except recourse to the deposit account as provided in the agreement.
5. The notes would draw a straight 6 per cent interest and would be payable
in sixty equal installments beginning one year after the student graduated or
otherwise ceased to be a student.
6. If any note is defaulted (i.e., if any installment payment remains unpaid
for a period of sixty days or if a specified event of automatic default occurs), the
bank would be entitled to charge the unpaid balance against the amount on deposit
and reassign the note to the University.
7. The University would to the full extent possible assist in collection efforts
with respect to any loan which becomes delinquent, such efforts to be made both
before and after the time the loan may be charged to the reserve, and any collections made by the University on any note which has been charged against the
reserve shall be redeposited in the reserve account.
8. The University would, at the request of a bank, substitute a new note for
the loan of any student who, after graduation and before repayment, is called for
military service.
The Law School has funds available to make the required deposits, which have
been donated for this specific purpose. The University has obtained a legal opinion
that the proposed use of such funds would not be in violation of Article X,
Section 12, of the Michigan Constitution of 1908, which prohibits the credit of the
State from being granted to, or in aid of. any person, association. or corporation.
public or private.
The Regents, on recommendation of the Vice-President in charge
of business and finance, approved the presentation of an applicatior
for federal or other grant support to relocate the Observatory and to
relocate or to replace the 37X-inch telescope. Such expected support
would be supplemented by University allocations for the project.
On recommendation of the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance, the firm  of Kenneth C. Black and Associates, of Lansing, was
appointed as architects for the Medical Center housing project (R.P..
1960-63, p. 989).

The Vice-President in charge of business and finance filed a progress
report on plant extension. The Oxford Housing Project had been completed, the Vice-President said, and the houses were now being occupied;
the Physical Medicine and Central Services Project in the University
Hospital had been completed.
Construction of the following projects, the Vice-President said, was
proceeding on schedule: School of Music Building, Institute of Science
and Technology, Museums Building Addition, Kresge Medical Research
Building Addition, Buhl Research Center for Human Genetics, and
Heating Plant Expansion.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1963


The Vice-President, continuing his report, said that planning for the
Institute for Social Research Building, for the Ambulatory Care Unit.
the North Campus Center, and for the Central Campus Library was
proceeding on schedule. He said the next project in the renovation of
the Main Hospital Building involved the Central Laboratories, and
would be financed by a state appropriation in the amount of $625,000.
The work for this renovation project will be done by Jeffress-Dyer.
who was low bidder for it. Preliminary sketches and analyses for the
Medical Science Building Unit II and the Dental School Building were
being prepared and would be submitted to the State Controller for the
release of funds on these projects.
In concluding, the Vice-President said that preliminary plans and
designs for the Space Research Building had been approved by the
federal government. The architect was proceeding with the detailed
plans and specifications for this building.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance distributed
copies of "Buildings Under Study, The University of Michigan, 1963.'
This, the second report on this subject, was gratefully accepted and
placed on file.
The Vice-President for Research reported on the University's research programs in oceanography and the earth sciences and upon the
University's research program sponsored by NASA.
The University's fresh water oceanographic program, the VicePresident said, included the Great Lakes Research Division, which is
now a division of the Institute of Science and Technology, the fisheries
program, and the program in water pollution. The National Institutes
of Health sponsor the water pollution laboratory; the work in fisheries
is sponsored by Federal Fisheries Research.
The inland oceanography program was strengthened, the Vice-President said, when the Regents accepted from an anonymous donor a
46-foot metal boat, the "Highland Lassie" (p. 76). This boat, along
with the 50-foot "Mysis," which had just been completed at Sturgeon
Bay, Wisconsin, under a National Science Foundation grant, and the
114-foot "Inland Seas," would bring the total of vessels for the University's research program to four, the other being the 34-foot "Naiad,"
which four years ago was the only vessel operated under University
auspices.
These vessels will be used by the Great Lakes Research Division
of the Institute of Science and Technology in a major study of the
southern half of Lake Michigan, under a four-year U. S. Public Health
Service research grant. The first grant of the four-year study is
$289,000. The research, the Vice-President said, would gather information pertinent to the future management and preservation of the
water quality of Lake Michigan. Extensive sampling of the lake for
chemical and biological analysis of the water and bottom sediment will
be made to determine man's effect on the lake and how fast man's use
of it is changing its water quality.
Continuing, the Vice-President reported on research in the space
sciences at the University. He was pleased to note the appointment of
a committee on the space sciences composed of Samuel D. Estep of
the Law School, H. R. Crane of the Physics Department, Paul M. Fitts

of the Psychology Department, Fred T. Haddock of the Radio Astronomy Observatory and the Electrical Engineering Department, and J.
Lawrence Oncley of the Biophysics Research Division and the Biological Chemistry Department of the Medical School. The Committee, he
said, is chaired by Wilbur C. Nelson, Professor of Aeronautical and
Astronautical Engineering and Chairman of that department. Expenditures for research at the University sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the fiscal year ended June 30,
1963, totaled in excess of $2,250,000, a sizeable increase over last year.
The Vice-President said the new $1,750,000 NASA space sciences
building will be begun next March, following NASA's approval of
plans and the subsequent letting of bids.
With additional funds for NASA-supported graduate education,
the Vice-President was pleased to note that the University has fifteen
new predoctoral students in its NASA domestic traineeship program
this fall, which, added to the ten who began last fall, brings the total
to twenty-five. Each of these students, he said, received $2,400 financial
support plus semester fees, and up to $1,000 for dependents for each
twelve months for the three years of the program. The twenty-five
doctoral students represent eleven different fields.

W. Allen: Memoir


RACKHAM ARTHRITIS RESEARCH UNIT
Mohammad A. Ghalambor, Research Associate, resignation effective June 15, 1963
The Secretary reported the retirement of seven members of the
faculty. The following memoirs were adopted:
WYETH ALLEN, Professor of Industrial Engineering and Chairman of the
Department of Industrial Engineering, concluded the most intimate chapter in a
long association with the University when he retired from the active faculty on
July 28, his seventieth birthday. Coming to the Engineering College as a freshman
in 1911, he soon revealed the abilities and the energy which were to lift him to
professional eminence, serving as an assistant in mechanical engineering and earning membership in Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi. Upon his graduation, he returned
to his native Milwaukee, where he gained industrial experience and established
himself as an independent management consultant. Globe-Union, Inc., coming at
length to pre-empt his services, appointed him executive vice-president in 1948
and president the following year. In 1953, at the centennial of his college, he was
aptly cited for "technical ability combined with sturdiness of character" and
awarded a Doctor of Engineering degree.
During his career in industry, Professor Allen devoted to civic and religious
agencies as much concern and zeal as many men expend upon their gainful occupations. He held, among other such offices, the posts of campaign chairman of the
Community Fund, president of the Milwaukee Council of Boy Scouts, trustee of
the Young Men's and the Young Women's Christian Associations, and ruling elder
of his church. Active also in alumni affairs, he was president of the alumni associations of his city and his district, and president, from 1948 to 1950, of the
national association. He further became a member of the executive committee of
the Phoenix Project and a director of the Development Council. It was altogether
fitting that, when he severed his relationship with Globe-Union, Inc.. he should
accept a professorship at Michigan. The University appointed him Chairman of




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1963


71


the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering in 1955, with the
expectation that he would presently be able to devote himself to industrial
engineering alone.
Uniting practical inventiveness with a secure grasp of modern managerial
techniques, Professor Allen was a vigorous and imaginative director of the still
fluid program  in his specialty. He obtained by his own effort, for example, a
digital computer to extend the range of exact analysis in the study of business
practice. He further bore a heavy burden of committee work within his college
and in the University, and resumed, virtually without interruption, his career of
service to the Community Fund, the Boy Scouts, and the Presbyterian Church.
His academic and professional interests and his spirit of service were all embodied
when he directed an ICA project at Waseda University in Japan, of which the
broad purpose was to enhance co-operation between Japanese universities and
Japanese industry.
The Regents have seldom had occasion to confess so various a debt as they
owe to Professor Allen. As they appoint him Professor Emeritus of Industrial
Engineering, they cordially hope that he will maintain that mutually beneficial
relationship with the University upon which he first entered fifty-two years ago,
and that he will long enjoy the privileges accorded to the emeritus faculty.
ARTHUR     DUNHAM, for twenty-eight years Professor of Community         A. Dunham:
Organization, attained the age of seventy on August 3, and began his retirement  Memoir
according to University statute.
Professor Dunham was graduated in 1914 from Washington University in his
native St. Louis, and went on from there to earn a master's degree at the University of Illinois. In the years immediately following, he gained experience in social
work agencies in St. Louis, Philadelphia, and Newton, Massachusetts. From 1925
to 1935, he served on the staff of the Public Charities Association of Pennsylvania,
a citizens' agency active in research, education, and legislation bearing upon the
public welfare. In those years he also directed studies for welfare and relief
agencies in Pennsylvania and New York, and lectured at Pennsylvania, Columbia.
the University of Chicago, Fordham. Rutgers, and the University of Pittsburgh.
At the end of that time, he accepted a professorship in the Institute of the Health
and Social Sciences, as it was then called, at the Detroit Graduate Study Center
of The University of Michigan. From 1949 to 1951, the two years before the
Institute was translated into the School of Social Work on the Ann Arbor campus.
he served as its Acting Director.
During his tenure at the University, Professor Dunham enhanced his national
stature by conducting institutes for the personnel of community agencies in various
parts of the country, by serving as chairman of the Advisory Committee of the
Social Work Year Book, and by publishing, in 1958, an authoritative text on
community welfare organization. His own humane concern for the well-being of
persons was made evident in his warm friendship with international students and
his active social ministry on behalf of the Religious Society of Friends. Particularly interested in the problems of economically backward parts of the world, he
visited India at length in 1956-57 and thereafter offered a seminar on community
development in newly emerging nations. His colleagues are happy that he continues
fruitfully to pursue this latter interest.
The Regents of the University, who now appoint him Professor Emeritus of
Community Organization, express their gratitude for his past services and their
warm hope that he will retain his local associations as a member of the emeritus
faculty.
LAYLIN KNOX JAMES, Professor of Law at the University for thirty-four    L. K. James:
years, attained the age of seventy on July the second and entered upon his retire-  Memoir
ment in accordance with University statute.
Professor James was graduated from the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts with distinction in 1918, and after a term of military service returned to
Ann Arbor to earn a Juris Doctor degree. From 1923 until 1926, he served with
the New York firm of Cravath, Swaine and Moore. From that date until 1929,
when he returned to this University as Professor of Law. he taught in the University of Pittsburgh Law School. During the Second World War, he was granted a
two years' leave from his teaching to undertake, on behalf of his old law firm,
legal offices for the Studebaker Corporation of South Bend.
Distributing his emphasis deftly between the theoretical potentialities of business association and the prevailing conditions of legal practice in the field, Professor James was a vigorous and efficacious teacher of the important fundamental
courses in corporation law. His own current conversance with such law he maintained by regular contact with the firm of Cravath, Swaine and Moore and by




72


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1963


long service on the Corporation Law Committee of the State Bar, for which he
drafted the Michigan Corporation Code and subsequent amendments to it. On
behalf of his School, he did yeoman service in placement counseling and played
an invaluable role in organizing the law alumni in cities throughout the nation.
The Regents of the University warmly thank Professor James for his able
and single-minded fulfillment of his responsibilities here, and invite him to retain
his University associations as Professor Emeritus of Law, a title which they
now confer.
R. H. Kingery:     RICHARD HENRY KINGERY, Professor of Dentistry, attained the age of
Memoir sixty-five on September the fourth, and has been granted permission to retire from
the active faculty on that date.
A native of Buchanan, Michigan, and a graduate of Michigan State College,
Dr. Kingery earned his dental degree at the University in 1924, and has since
taught here continuously. Beginning as a demonstrator in 1924, he became an
assistant professor in 1928. He has directed instruction in prosthetic dentistry
from that time. In 1937 he was made Professor of Dentistry.
Through single-minded devotion. Dr. Kingery attained to authoritative knowledge and technical skill, setting standards in his specialty and attracting graduate
and postgraduate students from many parts of the nation and of the world. Active
also in professional organizations, he served as president of the American Board
of Prosthodontics and chairman of the Editorial Council of the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry. His public service comprised frequent consultation with branches
of the armed forces and with hospitals of the Veterans' Administration. His service
to his school included a number of terms on its Executive Committee.
Dr. Kingery will be long remembered for his technical proficiency and for the
personal kindliness and wisdom which lent efficacy to his teaching. His students,
now widely scattered in private practice and among the faculties of dental schools,
will continue to exert his influence upon his profession. The Regents of the University join Dr. Kingery's colleagues in thanking him for all that he has done and
been during his thirty-nine years of service. They appoint him Professor Emeritus
of Dentistry, and cordially invite him to enjoy the perquisites of emeritus rank.
H. J. McFarlan:    HAROLD JAMES McFARLAN, Associate Professor of Geodetic Engineering,
Memoir  having completed forty-three years on the University faculty, entered upon his
retirement on July 26 at the statutory age of seventy.
After earning his baccalaureate degree in civil engineering in 1917, Professor
McFarlan worked for the Army Engineers on the construction of locks and gates
at Sault Ste Marie, for a Detroit insurance firm as a safety inspector, and for
himself as a surveyor in his native city of Flint. In 1920 he returned to the
University as Instructor in Geodesy and Surveying. He was appointed Assistant
Professor in 1926 and Associate Professor in 1958.
During his academic career, Professor McFarlan devoted virtually his entire
energy to teaching the basic surveying courses in his College and to counseling
students, formally and informally. A meditative man in a calling which might at
times, perhaps, admit more of the uses of contemplation, he had a profound and
comprehensive philosophy of teaching. Many alumni in civil engineering have
said that it was primarily he who acquainted them with the modes of thought
appropriate to their profession. Some of his philosophy he imparted to colleagues
at meetings of the American Society of Engineering Education. In his private
life, he steadily exhibited the liberal and humane spirit which distinguished his
teaching.
On the occasion of his retirement, the Regents express their warm esteem for
Professor MIcFarlan and their gratitude for his selfless ministry here. They now
appoint him Associate Professor Emeritus of Geodetic Engineering, and cordially
extend to him the perquisites of that rank.
II E. Miller:    HARRY EDGAR MILLER, Resident Lecturer in Public Health Engineering
Memoir   and Sanitation and Director of Continued Education in the School of Public
Health, retired from the active faculty on July 7, his seventieth birthday.
Mr. Miller earned a baccalaureate in civil engineering here in 1916, and
served until 1918 as an engineer for the City of Flint. Upon his return from army
service, he was for twelve years Director of the Bureau of Engineering of the
N"orth Carolina State Board of Health and for five years Special Expert in Rural
Sanitation for the United States Public Health Service. In 1936, when the Public
Health Service supplied the University with money to expand its educational
program in sanitation, he was invited here to lecture in public health engineering
and sanitation. Five years later, his courses were subsumed into the instructional
program of the newly founded School of Public Health. Himself undertaking fur



SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1963


73


ther graduate study, he earned a master's degree in public health in 1944. In 1951
he became Director of Continued Education for his school.
By virtue of his own practical background, Mr. Miller was an apt intermediary between theoretical hygienic science and the uses and potentialities of
sanitation engineering. By virtue of his unique combination of technical and social
gifts, he was a particularly able interpreter of environmental health skills to
public-health workers in other specialties. As a moving spirit in the diverse
continued education program of the School of Public Health, he made a distinguished contribution to it and to all public-health professions.
The Regents of the University take the occasion of his retirement to express
their personal appreciation for his dedicated service. Appointing him Lecturer
Emeritus in Public Health Engineering and Sanitation, they cordially invite him
to partake of the privileges accorded the emeritus faculty.
IVAN HENRY WALTON, Professor of English in the College of Engineering,
concluded his forty-fourth year on the University faculty in June and relinquished
his active status on August 10, his seventieth birthday.
A native of Mount Pleasant, Professor Walton studied for two years at the
College of Education there before coming to Ann Arbor to earn his baccalaureate
in 1917. After a brief career in journalism and a term of military service as a
fighter pilot, he returned to the University to teach in the College of Engineering
and to undertake graduate study. He earned his master's degree in 1921 and
subsequently completed further graduate work here and at the University of
Chicago. In the Engineering College, he rose to a full professorship in 1946.
Professor Walton's field of special interest was regional folklore, in particular
the songs and folkways of Great Lakes sailors. He himself founded the Michigan
Folklore Society, which he served for two terms as president and subsequently as
permanent executive secretary. The liveliness which this interest betokened was
apparent also in his teaching, which commanded the respect of his students and
his colleagues alike. He further devoted himself ably and loyally to committee
work on behalf of his department, his college, and the University, and to timeconsuming community service in the town.
The University is beholden to Professor Walton, and the Regents take this
opportunity to tender him their warm personal thanks. They trust that he will
long avail himself of the privileges due to the rank hereby conferred, Professor
Emeritus of English in the College of Engineering.
The following leaves of absence, extensions of leave of absence, and

Ann Arbor and all legal matters are properly taken care of, the Regents
would authorize the use of mortgage funds up to $75,000, or one-half
of the mortgage, in order to assist in the building of the proposed
rental facility.
The Regents established the Vera Baits Fund under the following
conditions recommended by Mrs. Gaylord H. Todd, President of the
Detroit Association of University of Michigan Women:
"The Detroit Association of University of Michigan Women wish to establish
the Vera Baits Fund at The University of Michigan. Enclosed is a check in the
amount of $560 to cover awards made for the 1963-64 University year.
"This fund will be an expendable fund, and it is the wish of the group to
provide annually one-year tuition scholarships for two Detroit area freshman girls.
From time to time emergency grants to women students from the Detroit area
may also be made.
"A committee to nominate students for these awards will consist of seven
members from the Detroit Alumnae Association. This rotating committee will be
elected by the Board of Directors and will include at least two from the Scholarship Committee. The Scholarship Chairman will automatically be a member.
Applicants interviewed by the Regents-Alumni Scholarship Committee of Detroit
will be considered.
"This fund is established for the period of five years and at the end of that
period the continuance of the fund shall be reconsidered by the Board of Directors;
provided, however, that all monies in said fund shall be used for scholarships for
women students at The University of Michigan, and provided further that no
monies in said fund shall revert to any officer, director, or member of the
Association."
After hearing a report by the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance regarding an alleged violation of the City of Dearborn
zoning ordinance by the University in the proposed construction of its
housing project in Dearborn (R.P., 1960-63, p. 1176), and after hearing the following opinion from the firm of Butzel, Eaman, Long, Gust
and Kennedy:
"Our conclusion and opinion is that the Board of Regents of the University
of Michigan in the erection of buildings for the purposes of the University on its
campus is not subject to zoning or other building regulations of the municipality
in which the campus is located and not being so subject if any issue thereon is
raised by the municipality the Regents may go directly to the Court with the issue
without regard to any administrative procedure which the municipality may have
provided."
the Regents took the following action:
1. That the Vice-President in charge of business and finance (or his designee)
advise the Mayor that the Regents had directed that construction of the project
proceed as planned with or without inspection services furnished by the City of
Dearborn;
2. That the contractor be directed to proceed forthwith with the construction
of the project; and
3. That in the event the City of Dearborn in any manner interferes with the
construction of the project, counsel be retained and the necessary steps taken to
restrain such interference.
On recommendation of the President, the Regents granted the
Chairman of the Committee of Management of the Clements Library
permission to lend to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts the Clements
Library's painting of the "Death of General Wolfe, 1759," by Benjamin
West, for an exhibition from November, 1963, to January, 1964. It was
understood that the Minneapolis Institute of Arts will pay all costs of
packing and shipping and will insure the painting for $35,000 while it
is on loan.

$39,167,157 came from  state appropriations, $36,575,094 from  the
federal government, $13,187,917 from student fees, $15,953,403 from
medical and hospital services, $13,093,936 from residence halls, student
centers, and other activities, and the balance from gifts, grants, departmental and investment income.
Seventy-one per cent of the money expended had been paid for
salaries and wages plus retirement, group insurance, and social security
and other staff benefits. Volume of research had increased from
$31,062,621 to $35,520,940. In 1943 the figure had been $647,227; in
1953, $12,686,795. Property values totaled $258,395,761 for 1962-63

from gifts and grants. He said the University had received an exceptionally large grant of $3,000,000 from the Ford Foundation in 1961-62
(R.P., 1960-63, p. 517').
The President emphasized that the largest increase, $8,707,197. in
income for the past year had come from the federal government.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1963

MUSEUM OF ZOOLOGY
R. Jack Schulz, Research Associate, resignation effective September 30, 1963
The Secretary reported with regret the death of Richard Hall
Jennings, Associate Professor of Art, September 28, 1963, and on the
same day, September 28, 1963, of Philip Munro Northrop, who until
last June had been Professor of Dentistry (R.P., 1960-63, p. 1174).
The following memoirs were adopted:
The sudden death of RICHARD HALL JENNINGS, Associate Professor of
Art, on September the twenty-eighth, has profoundly grieved his friends within
the University and his acquaintances in the larger national community of artists
and designers.
Professor Jennings was born in Detroit in 1917, was schooled in Oakville,
Ontario, and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Stanford University in 1938
and 1939 respectively. After working for two years as a biological consultant to
Fidanque and Sons in Panama and serving for four years as a naval officer, he
returned to Detroit, studied at the Art School of the Society of Arts and Crafts,
and embarked upon a career in design. Among the works which he executed while
in Detroit are murals for the J. L. Hudson Company, and fountains and pools for
the Ford Motor Company and for stores and shopping centers in Cleveland and
Indianapolis. Since joining the University faculty in 1958, he has designed murals
and decorative fountains for shopping centers at Livonia and Arborland, and
fountains for the Dearborn Campus and for the International Trade Fair held in
Cairo in 1961. He further devised novel and ingenious impeller systems, which
developed significant new potentialities for fountain design.
To his formal University duties, Professor Jennings brought his accustomed
enthusiasm, generosity, and freshness of insight. The work of his classes was
uniformly impressive, and he went far beyond the call of duty in his service to
student groups, to his department, and to the University at large. The University
promoted him to Assistant Professor in 1959 and to Associate Professor in 1962.
His fellows in the Department of Art mourn the loss of an accomplished
colleague and a warm friend, and designers everywhere regret the early cutting off
of his versatile. creative career. The Regents of the University now express their
own admiration for his accomplishments and their sorrow for his untimely death.
To MIrs. Jennings and the other members of his family, they tender their deepest
sympathy.
PHILIP MUNRO NORTHROP, Ann Arbor, oral surgeon and former professor in the University's School of Dentistry, died in Grand Rapids on September
the twenty-eighth, at the age of fifty-nine. He had resigned from the faculty
only last June.
Dr. Northrop earned a dental surgeon's degree here in 1928 and a Master of
Science degree in 1931. From 1925 to 1927, he was a member of the University
track team, competing in the pole vault, the broad jump. and the javelin throw
and setting, for the last event, a Big Ten record which stood for ten years. After
completing his graduate study, he practiced dentistry in Grand Rapids for four
years and then returned to Ann Arbor as Assistant Professor of Oral Surgery.
Here he carried a heavy load of graduate and undergraduate teaching, undertook
fruitful research into blood-borne infections involving the teeth, and helped advance
surgical techniques for the treatment of harelip and cleft palate. The University
advanced him to Associate Professor in 1941 and to Professor in 1950. His interest in collegiate sports remaining, he served also for two terms on the Board in
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, including a period as vice-chairman.
Dr. Northrop's former confreres on the dental faculty and his many associates
throughout the University community mourn the loss of a close and sympathetic
friend as well as of a most gifted professional colleague. The Regents of the
University take this occasion to express their own sorrow and to extend deepest
sympathy to 1MIrs. Northrop and to the other members of his family.
The following leaves of absence and an extension of leave of absence
were approved (p. 73):
Wallace S. Bjorke. Music Librarian III. sick leave with salary, August 1, 1963,
through September 13. 1963
Izzudeen M. Essa'id, Catalog Librarian II. sick leave with salary, August 1. 1963,

of the Board of Governors of the Michigan League and of the Michigan Union
Board of Directors which commented on the Report of the Union-League Study
Committee.
The Regents wish to commend the Michigan Union Board of Directors and
the Michigan League Board of (overnors for establishing this Study Committee,
and the Regents wish further to commend the Committee for its analysis and
recommendations with respect to 'those portions of the Report on the Office of
Student Affairs which raised basic questions about the present validity of dividing
University facilities, services, and policies on the basis of men and women."
As a result of the discussions of the Regents, the following statement has been
prepared expressing the opinions of the Regents with respect to this Report.
The Union-League Study (ommittee Report proposed "three essential recommendations" as follows:
1. That the need for a real University Center be recognized and that as the
basis for a future University Center, a single governing board be established to
replace the present Michigan Union and the Michigan League governing boards.
2. That a single coeducational student activities organization be established
within the University Center and be responsible to the Board.
3. That an Implementation Committee be appointed immediately as the first
step in accomplishing the above two goals.
These recommendations will be discussed in the order in which they were
reported in the Study Committee Report.
University Center
The definition of a real University Center is not set forth in detail in the
Study Committee Report, but on page 5 the following sentence occurs: "It cannot
be disputed that there is a need for a real University Center, a coeducational
organization serving the needs of all segments of the University community:
students, faculty, alumni, administration, and their guests alike."
As a result of the discussions which the administrative officers have had with
the Union-League Study Committee and the League Board and Union Board, it is
our understanding that the concept of a University Center implicit in the report
includes facilities in one or more buildings which would be used by students for
student activities; by the faculty for a faculty club providing dining service.
beverage service, rooms, and other services of a faculty center; for a conference
center for housing, dining, and meeting rooms necessary for adult education programs on the campus: and the various dining, housing, meeting-room services
which are in constant use by students, faculty, alumni, and guests throughout
the year.
After considering in detail these varied functions and the operations which
would be necessary for the successful carrying out of these functions, it is our
opinion that an attempt to consolidate and bring together these functions under a
single governing board is inappropriate and would be ineffective in carrying out
these functions. We do not believe it desirable for students to be involved in the
management and operation of a faculty center and of a conference center; furthermore, it is questionable if those who are involved in the effective management of
faculty and conference centers ought to be involved in the necessary attention
which must be given to student activities. In our opinion, these various functions
will be successfully carried out if they have separate and specific operating units
with attention and effort directed to their particular objectives rather than being
organized under a single governing board.
It is desirable therefore to maintain the separation of functions and to provide
specific and appropriate leadership for each particular function with no consolidation of various functions which have different objectives.
Union,-League Student Activities Organization
The recommendation that a single coeducational student activities organization
be established to consolidate the Union and League student programs meets with
the wholehearted approval of the Regents. This Union-League student activities
organization can be established without regard to the first recommendation and
should be responsible for its activities. In this way the Union-League student
activities organization would be given the jurisdiction over student activities now
being conducted by the Michigan League and the Michigan Union and other student activities which may be undertaken by this particular student organization.
The Regents believe that such a student activities organization set up on a
coeducational basis would be very effective and would be responsive to the desires
of the men and women students on the campus who work together in this area
of activity.




130


OCTOBER MIEETING, 1963


To give this Union-League student activities organization the opportunity to
devote its entire attention to student activities, it should be established as a
separate entity apart from the League and Union organizations.
The Regents are prepared to continue to provide funds for these student
activities on the same level as they are now provided, and such a student activities
organization would have the same opportunity as any other part of the University
to represent needs for additional financial support in the future.
The Regents are also prepared to recognize the space needs for the recommended student activities organization and to continue to provide the space now
being used in the Michigan Union and the Michigan League buildings and other
University buildings for these activities so long as such spaces continue to be
effectively used. Additional space requests of this student activities organization
would be given the same careful consideration as additional space requests of any
other University organization.
Im plcmen tation Comm0ittee
The Regents believe that the Implementation Committee which is mentioned
in the third "essential recommendation" should be set up immediately to establish
a joint student activities organization and to define the area of responsibility
which would be undertaken by this coeducational student activities organization.
The Regents urge the Board of Directors of the Michigan Union and the Board
of Governors of the Michigan League to establish this Implementation Committee
as soon as possible in order that the joint student activities organization can be
made effective during the present academic year.
Summary
In summary, then, the Regents are pleased to accept and endorse the recommendation of the Union-League Study Committee for the establishment of a
"single coeducational student activities organization" for the student activities
responsibilities which are now being carried out separately by the Michigan Union
and the Michigan League. Furthermore, the Regents endorse wholeheartedly the
concept of an Implementation Committee being appointed immediately to set forth
the organization of this student activities function, its financial and space needs,
and its relationship to other student activities on the campus.
The Regents believe that it would be unwise at this time to establish the
concept of a University Center and that it will be more effective to maintain a
separateness of function and responsibility between student activities, faculty
center, conference center, and other related functions.
The Regents recognize that the issues which were under consideration by the
Union-League Study Committee are involved and complex. The Regents therefore
recommend that further actions be undertaken with the understanding that the
Regents are willing and ready at all times to continue the discussions which have
been so fruitful to date.
Commenting on the report, the President said if we were beginning
our University today, we obviously would not be building separate
union buildings for men and for women. Today we obviously also
would be faced with quite a different proportion in our total student
body. The very large number of graduate students that are in residence
at this University today was undreamed of when the Michigan Union
and the Michigan League were built. He said the sharp division between
University of Michigan organizations of men and women he particularly marked when he joined the University and was invited to speak
at alumni meetings. These organizations, he found, completely separated the men from the women; that he had been invited to speak first
to an alumni association and later to an alumnae association, both
associations being in the same city but not combined. The President,
in continuing, said there were no legal barriers against a different
alignment than the one that had been in existence. The point was not
alone in avoiding a possible violation of the letter but rather that
there be no violation of the spirit in which the buildings originally
were established. He said the statement adopted by the Regents would
be submitted to those who had made the original report on the proposed merger of the Michigan Union and the Michigan League.

In reporting briefly on the point of view of the Governor and of the
legislature on a revised tax program, the President said until such a
program is adopted, the University could not be making definite plans
for next year. He believed the tax program would not be established
until December or January.
The President also reported on a meeting with the subcommittee of
the Citizens Committee on Higher Education (Blue Ribbon Committee) which he and the Executive Vice-President had attended. This
Subcommittee on Higher Education, he said, seemed very responsive
to the presentation which was made. He was pleased to report further
that he had received some constructive letters from members of the
subcommittee since the meeting. He said, "Certainly wherever these
committees have gone to work, they are convinced that the present
amounts allocated for higher education are insufficient.'
Regent Goebel expressed the hope that the subcommittees would
make strong preliminary reports which would be genuinely helpful.
Vice-President Stirton announced that there would be a meeting of
the Council of Michigan College Presidents at Inglis House on October 28. They would be joined by representatives of the community
colleges. From this meeting he hoped there might come a statement of
the colleges to the Blue Ribbon Committee.
Regent Brablec, referring to the recent Johnson report on campus
planning (p. 36), expressed the hope that certain existing structures
would not be destroyed. He hoped that the structures architecturally
and historically worth keeping would be marked as such and not be
torn away.
Regent Thurber, in commenting on the same point, said, "The one
building you fight to save in one generation is the one that the next
generation is convinced should have been saved."
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance assured the
Regents that careful attention would be paid to marking the structures
that should be retained. He said, "If it is possible to save a building
in perpetuity, certainly the President's house is such a building."
The President was most happy to announce that one of the three
new astronauts named today at Houston, Texas, is Theodore C.
Freeman, age thirty-three, of Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mr.
Freeman received his Master of Science in Engineering degree from
The University of Michigan in 1960.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Regents adjourned to meet on November 15.

DOCTOR OF LAWS
SURENDRA KUMAR DEY, Master of Science in Electrical Engineering
from The University of Michigan in 1931; Minister of Community Development
in the Government of India. For sixteen years he worked for the General Electric
Company in India as a specialist in X ray and electromedical sciences. In 1947,
when India achieved her independence, he gave up his position in the company as
manager for India, Burma, and Ceylon, and devoted himself single-mindedly to
rehabilitating displaced persons. With the genius of his leadership, the township of
Nilokheri. planned as a pilot project in which the inhabitants cleared swamps,
built their own shelters, and learned trades and occupations, proved the solution
to the most vexing problem facing the new nation, the problem of assimilating
vast populations of refugees. Nilokheri has been multiplied half a million times
into townships that are the visible sign of the new India, of her rebirth in freedom,
of her awareness of responsibility, and of the great opportunities that await her.
In persuading himself that "love is rich to the extent it can give, poor to the
extent it wishes to take," S. K. Dey has persuaded his fellowmen that democracy
must have its roots in the people, that they as communities, as families, must
take responsibility, must decide. must act.
Upon Surendra Kumar Dey, who has found himself in showing the people of
his nation the way to help themselves, his University is proud to confer its highest
accolade, the honorary degree Doctor of Laws.

Voted July 26, 1963 (p. 35)                      Conferred October 17, 1963
GERALDINE BLEDSOE, distinguished exponent of democratic ideals and of
interracial understanding.
Mrs. Bledsoe came to Detroit as a young matron shortly after graduating
with high honors from Howard University. In Detroit she has played an influential
role in both of the major social contests of our time: that on behalf of the
economically disinherited and that on behalf of racial minorities. A devoted
political partisan, the first Negro member of the State Central Committee of her
party, she warmly supported social action to restore economic opportunity to the
hapless casualties of the great depression; she herself directed the professional
training of household workers under the old Works Progress Administration. As a
member of the Urban League Board, of governing and planning committees of the
Young Women's Christian Association, and of many other private and voluntary
agencies, she has unceasingly sought to advance the legitimate interests of her own
race in employment, in recreation, in labor-union membership, and in all aspects
of their communal relations. As Minority Group Consultant in the Michigan
Employment Security Commission, she has labored efficaciously to define and put
into effect employment practices equitable to all minorities. From a more intimate
perspective, her profoundest achievement has been the cultivation of her own
spirit, wherein strength is united with sweetness, and idealism with a clear vision
of the practical issues of life.
In respectful acknowledgment of what she has done and what she is, the
Regents of the University now tender Mrs. Bledsoe their Citation of Honor.
DORA BUCHHALTER EHRLICH, graduate of the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts in 1902, distinguished humanitarian in the city of Detroit.
Coming from a heritage rich at once in devotion and learning, Mrs. Ehrlich
has made her own zeal and incisiveness felt in her city for more than a half
century. After a successful term as a teacher, for which she is still admiringly
remembered by her former scholars, she was willingly diverted into marriage by
the late Joseph Ehrlich. and embarked, first with her husband and then independently, on a career of humane ministry which has won her the veneration of the
local Jewish community and the grateful esteem of all sorts and conditions of

Detroit residents. As a loyal daughter of her people, she lent inspiration and
direction to youth organizations, schools, hospitals, and charities founded by her
faith, becoming the first and only woman vice-president of the Jewish Welfare
Federation and the only woman to receive its Butzel Award for distinguished
communal service. As a spirited, wise, and responsible citizen, she has served her
city and state with vigor and discernment as a perennial board member of the
Community Chest and as a member of the Corrections Commission of the State
of Michigan. We would nevertheless celebrate her most warmly not for any
institutional affiliations but for what the poet has called that best portion of a
worthy life, her innumerable private acts of kindness and of love.
The Regents of the University of Michigan find it fitting and most pleasant
to bestow on this revered alumna their Citation of Honor.

V. B. Baits:    The Regents adopted the following resolution on the death of Vera
Memoir   Burridge Baits, Regent Emeritus of The University of Michigan:
In the death of Vera Burridge Baits the University and the State have lost a
leader in the cause of higher education. As a student at the University, as a
teacher in the schools of the state, as a spokeswoman for the alumnae, and as a
regent, she stood for the highest quality of performance at all levels. Mrs. Baits
had a profound understanding of students and appreciated sound teaching as a
practitioner of the art of teaching. In her frequent appearances throughout the
state she reflected the aims and aspirations of the University and won the support
of the people not only for the educational programs of her alma mater but for
those of all the universities and colleges.
The Regents and the executive officers of the University mourn the loss of a
most loyal and able alumna and former regent. They take this occasion to express
their own sorrow and to extend deepest sympathy to Mr. Baits and to the other
members of her family.

Legal Action   The Regents authorized the insurance carrier to interpose the plea
of sovereign immunity as a defense in Court of Claims action instituted
by Carl M. Branum and Joyce Branum against the Board of Regents,
being Case No. 863 (R.P., 1960-63, p. 460). Regent Sorenson voted no
on the motion.
Human Relations    After considering a letter addressed to Vice-President Pierpont by
Board Letter  the Human Relations Board of Student Government Council on the
subject, "The University, Employment, and Non-Discrimination: A
Proposal," the Regents thanked the Human Relations Board for its
concern, reaffirmed their point of view as stated in Bylaws of the
Regents, Section 2.14, expressed satisfaction with the specific procedures now in effect at the University that implement the bylaw, and
asked the Vice-President to reflect their views in a letter replying to the
Human Relations Board.
Fraternities and  In response to a request from  Laurence D. Smith, Grand Rapids
deStoOrganizatioSt  attorney for five sororities, to the Regents for a stay of action on
membership regulations of student organizations, the Regents again
affirmed the action taken at their May, 1963, meeting based on the
Bylaws of the Regents, Section 2.14 (R.P., 1960-63, p. 1177). Regents
Goebel, Matthaei, and Sorenson voted against the motion.
Regent Sorenson said, "I feel fraternities and sororities should not
be considered student organizations and should have the right to choose
whomever they please. If they choose, they should conduct their
affairs secretly."




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1963

Regent Goebel favored abolishing discrimination, but said, "I have
a feeling that eight pages of regulations constitute harassment. A more
simple statement should be sufficient."
Regent Thurber believed the specific regulations guaranteed strict
"due process." He said, "This is an area where A and B, seeing the
same object, 'honestly declare' that the object is not the same thing.
This is a subtle thing. We are right in setting out specific regulations."
The Vice-President for Research made a brief report on the Univer-  Project AMOS:
sity's Project AMOS, the Astrophysical Observatory Infrared Tracking  eport on
Station on the top of Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii, for the purposes of
demonstrating the feasibility of tracking satellites and mid-course
ICBM's by their passive infrared emissions, studying missile and satellite phenomena, and making astrophysical and geophysical observations
in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The VicePresident, who had just returned from visits to the Island and to
Alaska, said the $4,300,000 allocation of federal funds for this project
had been increased to $5,450,000; that bids were being put out on
November 15 to build the project. These bids would be opened on
December 16. The increase in funds included $500,000 for a new
telescope and $650,000 for additional construction costs.
In continuing, he said construction costs were high because the
observatory is located on the top of a 10,000 foot extinct volcano on
Maui Island. The University would be sharing the top of the mountain
with the University of Hawaii station. Haleakala was chosen as the site
for the observing station since it fits the requirement for a location near
the apogee of ICBM trajectories and the better observing conditions
afforded at a high altitude (10,000 feet). Although there were two
higher peaks in the Hawaiian Islands, these were located farther from
the missile trajectory and did not have paved roads or power to the
summit as does Haleakala. The University would share the top of the
mountain with the University of Hawaii and would work in close conjunction with the University of Hawaii's Solar Observatory and Night
Airglow Station. The Smithsonian Tracking Station was also located on
Haleakala and provided a valuable check on tracking accuracy of
Project AMOS. The experimental program for Project AMOS was
quite extensive. It may be divided into three general areas: (1) missile
phenomenology, (2) atmospheric properties as they affect observations,
and (3) infrared astronomy.
The Vice-President said, "This observatory will have a tremendous
military significance. We were asked to do this because of the University's leadership in the infrared field. There will be three infrared
telescopes installed at the observatory, two for tracking missiles and
satellites and one for infrared astronomical observations."
In translating the acronym, AMOS, the Vice-President for Research
said "A" stood for ARPA which in turn is an acronym for "Advanced
Research Projects Agency"; "M" stood for "Mid-course"; "0" for
"Observing"; and "S" for "Station."
The President saw in this latest University observatory an organic
symbol of growth, from President Tappan's move to build the first
telescope to the succeeding ones which were built and developed at the
University in Ann Arbor, at the observatory in Bloemfontein, at the
solar observatory at Lake Angelus, and now on the top of Haleakala

on the Island of Maui. He also referred to the great personal joy and
satisfaction which this latest venture brought to Vice-President Sawyer,
who himself is one of the world's outstanding scholars in infrared
spectroscopy.
Editorial in the  At the suggestion of the President, the Vice-President in charge of
Detroit Free ds business and finance was pleased to refer to an editorial in The Detroit
Free Press for Saturday, November 9, congratulating the Michigan
Aeronautics Commission for recommending that an airport authority
for the six-county metropolitan area be created. This area consists of
Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, Monroe, and St. Clair counties.
The Vice-President termed the recommendation a very hopeful sign
and said the University's involvement would, he hoped, continue to be
for the same purpose it had been from the very beginning: to continue
with its research facility in aeronautics.
J. S. Newberry:  In accepting a rare color lithograph of the University of Michigan
Gift campus in 1881 from   John S. Newberry, of New York, whom the
President referred to as "a non-alumnus but a great friend of the
University," the President noted that University Hall was at that time
known as the largest educational building in the United States. Throughout the years, the President remarked, this University had a fine proportion of undergraduate and graduate curriculums. He said when he
took office in 1951, there were recommendations strongly raised from
various quarters that the University should become strictly a graduate
Comments on the institution. Although the graduate programs had grown tremendously, it
University by the had always been the intention to keep a strong freshman group. This
President tendency and trend the President emphasized by pointing to the freshman enrollment in 1951 of 1,868. In 1963 the freshman enrollment had
grown to 3,434. In the twelve years, percentagewise, the President said,
the freshman group had grown most. He believed it impossible to say at
the present time whether the expansion rate of freshmen was adequate.
The University had encouraged growth of teachers colleges which
had most recently become regional universities. Western Michigan
had grown to an enrollment of 14,000. The University had encouraged the growth of junior colleges; it had encouraged the growth of its
sister universities, Wayne State and Michigan State. Land grant
colleges throughout the United States had used a very large net to
bring in undergraduates.
Enrollment   The Vice-President for Academic Affairs said, in speaking about
the future enrollment at the University, that social needs, including
those for doctors, lawyers, teachers, dentists, and other professionally
trained people, would point toward a possible enrollment of 45,000
students by 1975. The Vice-President referred to meetings he had had
with the deans of the various schools and colleges who had given much
time and study to the desired growth of the University that might be
accomplished with adequate support. All of the schools and colleges
had reported substantial enrollment pressures. There was a general
willingness to accept the need for growth. At the same time there was
a general admission of the difficulty of accepting new programs or new
parts of programs while support was being curtailed. Enrollment prognostications, he said, did not consist of simple extrapolations. Schools
and colleges of the University were becoming more and more interdependent. He cited the increasing relationships being established between




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1963


159


psychiatry and law, between medicine and engineering, between engineering and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Professional schools were becoming more dependent on the graduate programs in undergraduate colleges. The Vice-President emphasized that
although the University might be looking forward to 45,000 students
enrolled in 1975, the proportion of undergraduates to graduates would
remain substantially the same.
The Director of University Relations announced that Federal Judge
Thaddeus Machrowicz had dismissed the suit of Jackie Vaughn III to
prevent Governor Ross Barnett of Mississippi from speaking at the
University on Monday, November 18. The judge made three points:
(1) there is no clear and present danger under the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) the charge that Barnett's appearance indicated University
approval of his viewpoints was "unfounded"; and (3) the Governor
will not be speaking on segregation, but on states' rights.
The President was pleased to announce that Regent Thurber and
Vice-President Heyns would undertake a journey which would take
them to Japan, Formosa, the Philippines, Thailand, and India to review
various University projects and to meet University alumni. The Regent
and the Vice-President would also stop at Cairo and Rome and in
Amsterdam. They would leave December 26 and return on January 19.
The Regents agreed upon the following calendar of meetings for the
months of January, February, and March: January 22-23; February
26-27; March 25-26. It was agreed to meet Wednesday evening at
Inglis House preceding the Thursday meetings in the Regents' Room.
The Regents gave consideration to procedures that would guide
them when they resolve themselves into a committee of the whole.
It was decided to postpone the final wording of such procedures to a
later meeting.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
otherwise specifically stated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for The Regents
of the University of Michigan for the month of September, 1963,
totaled $82.84, and for the month of October, 1963, totaled $793.30.
The Regents adjourned to meet on December 20.

Higher Education
Facilities Act
of 1963


Addition was nearing completion and would be occupied soon after the
first of the year.
After several delays for various reasons, the Dearborn Housing
Project was proceeding with the foundation walls and underground
site work.
In continuing, the Vice-President noted that the Fluids Engineering
Building Unit II, the University Hospital Central Laboratories, the
Kresge Medical Research Building Addition, and the Heating Plant
Expansion were proceeding on schedule. He said planning was continuing for the following projects: Institute for Social Research, North
Campus Center, Ambulatory Care Unit, Central Campus Library,
Medical Science Building Unit II, Dental Building, and the Space
Research Building.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance reported that
on December 10 the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 had been
sent to President Johnson for his signature. The bill authorizes expenditure of 1.195 billion dollars for the first three years of a five-year
program of grants and loans to public and nonprofit private institutions
of higher education for construction of academic facilities.
The act provides for grants for undergraduate academic facilities:
$180,000,000 for 1964 and each of the two succeeding years, for grants
to public and nonprofit private institutions of higher education, including two-year colleges and technical institutes, for construction of
undergraduate academic facilities in the natural or physical sciences,
engineering, mathematics, modern foreign languages, or libraries, provided the construction will (1) result in an urgently needed substantial
expansion of the institution's enrollment capacity or (2) in the case of
a new institution of higher education, result in creating urgently needed
enrollment capacity. The grants will be limited to one-third of the cost
of the construction. The State of Michigan will receive $7,900,000 out
of $180,000,000. A state commission will determine priorities according
to a state plan submitted to the United States Commissioner of
Education.
There will be grants for graduate academic facilities: $25,000,000
in fiscal 1964 and $60,000,000 in each of the two succeeding years, to
improve or assist in the establishment of graduate schools and co-operative graduate centers. Federal funds may not exceed 33 1/3 per cent of
the development cost of the project. No one state may receive more
than 12X2 per cent of the total funds available in any one fiscal year.
The Commissioner of Education will have the authority to approve
applications subject to the advice of an eleven-member advisory committee on graduate education to be established in the Office of Education, at least three of whose members shall be from the field of the
humanities with at least one of the three from a graduate school of
education.
There will be loans for construction of academic facilities in the
amount of $120,000,000 for fiscal 1964 and each of the two succeeding
years. These loans will be to institutions of higher education or to
higher education building agencies for construction of academic facilities. At least 25 per cent of the development cost of the facility will
have to be financed from nonfederal sources. No one state may receive




DECEMBER MEETING, 1963


167


more than 12 2 per cent of the total funds available in any one fiscal
year. Loans will be for a maximum of fifty years with an interest rate
not less than one-fourth of one percentage point above the average
annual interest rate on all interest-bearing obligations of the United
States, forming a part of the public debt. Currently this would set the
interest rate on the loans at 3g per cent.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Bartlett said that the bill also
provides for public community college assistance. This would amount
to $50,600,000 for fiscal 1964 and each of the two succeeding fiscal
years to provide construction grants to public junior colleges and
technical institutions. (This represents a "set-aside" of 22 per cent of
the total grant funds available for undergraduate facilities.) At least
60 per cent of the development cost of the project will have to be
financed from state or local sources; no more than 40 per cent may be
financed from federal sources. The funds will be allotted among the
states on a formula based on the income per person and the number of
high school graduates in the states. State commissions will be responsible for administration of state plans.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance reported also
on the loan program under the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1963. According to this Act, the Vice-President said, the
University has requested $376,500 to aid 450 medical students in
1963-64. In 1964-65 the University would petition for $516,250 to aid
550 medical students. Under the same Act the University would petition
on behalf of the School of Dentistry in 1963-64 for $378,000 to assist
240 students; in 1964-65, for $457,000 to aid 290 students.
The Vice-President said, "We have anticipated a program of federal
aid for construction of libraries, and started planning early for a
Central Campus library."
The Central Campus Library will represent a gross square footage
of 103,000. It is estimated that the cost would be $3,500,000. The
Regents approved the Central Campus Library as presented for application for a federal grant.
Continuing, the Vice-President said that under another federal bill
passed earlier this year and signed by the President, it is expected that
$2,000,000 will be provided toward the construction of a new $9,900,000
School of Dentistry Building. It is also expected that this bill may
provide $2,000,000 toward the construction of the proposed new
$12,000,000 medical science building. The Vice-President said, "Since
state appropriations cover the construction of the School of Dentistry
Building, there will be no problem in getting matching federal funds."
The state, he said, was also providing funds for the Medical Science
Building.
After the passage of the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963,
President Johnson said, "The Senate is to be commended on its passage today of the Conference Report on Higher Education. This
Congress is well on its way to doing more for education than any
since the Land Grant College Act was passed 100 years ago."
President Hatcher, who attended the signing of the bill, presented
for the inspection of the Regents a pen bearing the inscription "The
President-The White House" which had been used in signing the bill.

The following report on the will of H. William Klare, deceased, was      H.W. Klare:
filed for the information of the Regents:
The will of H. William Klare, who attended this University in 1909 and 1910,
has recently been offered for probate in Wayne County.
One-half of the estate is set up as a trust fund, from which Mrs. Klare will
receive the income during her lifetime, and upon her death, two-fifths of the
corpus will be given to The University of Michigan. The pertinent language of the
will is as follows:
"(c) Two (2) shares to the University of Michigan or to the Regents of
the University of Michigan as the corporate body thereof, Ann Arbor, Michigan,
for the establishment of a fund to make payment of scholarships to be known
as the 'H. WILLIAM   KLARE AND ELIZABETH A. KLARE MEMORIAL
SCHOLARSHIPS' to deserving and needy students of the School of Public
Health, as hereinafter provided.
"This fund is established in compliment to the Founder of the School of
Public Health at Ann Arbor, Michigan, Dr. Henry F. Vaughan, and in recognition of his many activities in the whole field of public health in the United
States.
"I direct that the Board of Regents, upon recommendations made by the
Dean and Faculty of the School of Public Health, shall award annually Scholarships of Twenty-five Hundred ($2,500.00) Dollars and of One Thousand
($1,000.00) Dollars each to deserving and needy students of the said School of
Public Health, to assist them severally in the prosecution of their respective
studies, subject to the following stipulation, namely:
"Scholarships of Twenty-five Hundred ($2,500.00) Dollars each shall be
restricted to those graduate students of special merit and talent pursuing a
doctorate degree as distinguished from other students of this said School of
Public Health who shall be eligible severally for One Thousand ($1.000.00)
Dollar scholarships.
"I ask that the funds passing under this provision of my will be conservatively invested for additional income' and extension of the life of this gift but
scholarships shall be paid out annually in reasonable numbers as directed herein
even if the corpus be invaded and ultimately exhausted."
The attorney for the executor estimates that the University will
eventually receive approximately $50,000 from      this trust.
The University Attorney reported that the will of Nellie S. Parks,       N. S. Parks:
deceased, had recently been offered for probate in Cuyahoga County,          will
Ohio.
Mrs. Parks, who obtained a Nursing Certificate from the University in 1915,
has named the University as a residuary legatee under Item II of her will and a
distributee under Article II, 1, of a Trust Agreement created during her lifetime.
The applicable language of both instruments is as follows:
"I give the balance of my estate, including the proceeds of any personal
effects which may be sold by the Executor, as follows:
"1. One-half thereof to the BOARD OF REGENTS of the UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN. It is my wish that the same be set aside as a fund, or be
added to other funds under the control of the BOARD OF REGENTS, to
permit loans to worthy students. It is not my intention, however, to impose
any legal restrictions upon the use thereof."

E'St:,1)1 iIhe'(1


The executor and trustee advise that the total assets in the estate
and the trust amount to $128,000. It is estimated that the University
will receive in excess of $50,000 from this estate.
The University Attorney reported that the bequest of Benjamin B.
Morris, deceased, of $5,000 to establish the Benjamin B. Morris 1901
Law   Class   Memorial Funds, had       been  received   (R.P., 1960-63,
p. 1028).
The Regents accepted a gift of 15 acres of land in Jackson County,
Michigan. from J. Sterling Wickwire.
In concluding his last meeting as Regent, Regent Donald M. D.
Thurber read the following message to the Board:
"Mr. President, My Dear Friends and Colleagues:
"For a reason which will shortly be apparent. I wish to use precise language
at this moment; and therefore I ask your indulgence if I read this brief response.
"Lord Byron was undoubtedly right when he said. 'All farewells should be
sudden.' Since my farewell cannot be sudden, it can at least hope to meet that
other desideratum of farewells: it should attempt to express something of the
same character and quality which marked the relationship itself.
"The essence of our relationship around this table and within the University
was caught many years ago, it seems to me, by Cardinal Newman in words
profoundly true: 'The heart of man,' he said, 'is so constituted that its fullness
comes of spending. When we serve, we rule; when we give, we have; when we
surrender ourselves, we are victors. We are most ourselves when we lose sight of
ourselves.'
"In a most modest way I wish to be associated with that spirit and, in so
doing, to prolong the relationship in the only way it can be prolonged: by borrowing Ulysses' words: 'I am a part of all that I have met.'
"Accordingly, I shall deem it an honor if the Regents will accept for The
University of Michigan a gift of $1,000 to establish the Donald M. D. Thurber
Student Loan Fund. From time to time 1 hope to make additions to the original
gift and to broaden the original purpose, which, for it to be effective, must be at
present somewhat limited. At this time I should like the fund to provide loans to
the children of priests ordained in The Episcopal Church and canonically resident
in Michigan. Recipients are to be students admitted to The University of Michigan
and may be freshmen. Applicants from the Diocese of Michigan are to be given
preference, followed by those from the Diocese of Western Michigan and the
Diocese of Northern Michigan, if no qualified applicants are available from the
first-named diocese. A brief statement of this gift and an annual statement of the
disposition and availability of funds are to be sent to the three bishops. Principal
as well as income is to be loaned. All other regulations are left to the University.
"Six years ago the President, in welcoming me to my first Regents' meeting,
described my college as 'the Michigan of the East.' Perhaps 'the Michigan of the
East' may now, as the six years end, say a parting word to 'the Harvard of the
West,' both of which, one early and one late, I have grown to love. For, whatever
the future may hold of paths meeting or of paths parting, nothing can quench the
pride I shall always feel at having been associated, even for a time, with a
university so notable in the past, so distinguished in the present, and so filled with
the bright promise of the future as that from which I now part.
"From my old school, then, to my new school I give these words of Emerson's,
known to generations of Harvard men, inscribed on one of the college monuments,
and worthy of any great university, east or west, wherever it is set in time or place:
'Though love repine, and reason chafe,
There came a voice without reply,
'Tis man's perdition to be safe
When for the truth he ought to die.'"

the beginning of the common stock purchase program, and the
eighteenth for the investments of the Employees' Retirement Fund.
The University's Investment Officer, R. Gordon Griffith, and representatives of the National Bank of Detroit, Messrs. Williams, Reading,

Center in Egypt,  Regents approved membership in the American Research Center in
Tnc.' Membership
in  Egypt, Inc., at an annual fee of $2,500, payable from          Expendable
Restricted Account No. 30986, Center for Near and Middle Eastern
Studies.
Robert Lee Frost   On recommendation of the Vice-President for Student Affairs, the
House: Men's  men's house in Mary Butler Markley Hall was named '"Robert Lee
House of
Markley Hall  Frost House."
Radrick:     The Vice-President in charge of business and finance made a brief
Recreation Area  report on plans that are being developed for a recreation area at
Radrick.
Federal Aid to   Regent Matthaei raised the question which had been discussed in
Education:  the article "Uncle Sam: Big Man on Campus" in the research section
l  of Business Week magazine for November 2, 1963. He asked whether
too much dependence is not being placed by the universities upon help
from the federal government for the continuing of their research, and
whether a recession might not leave the universities in a comparatively
helpless position.
Regent Brablec did not share Regent Matthaei's fears. He believed
that the agreement for the research was between two willing parties.
He did not believe that the government would suddenly withdraw its
support.
Regent McInally felt the smaller institutions that had a much
smaller stake in federal aid might suffer if the aid were reduced.
Vice-President Sawyer said federal aid received for research was
by no means a gift, that the governmental departments actually buy
research from the University. Because of the competent staff at this
University, he said, it had more federal money than any other univer

sity. He believed that the Atomic Energy Commission would continue
to use the University. He referred to 2,500 students who were engaged
part time in research supported by the federal government in 1963;
that 138 Ph.D.'s had participated. He did not believe the federal government would cut back this kind of support, which is mutually
helpful. He cited the increase in this kind of support; that there had
been $208,000,000 of this kind of support federally throughout the
nation in 1953. By 1961 it had grown to $700,000,000.
The President reported briefly upon his visit to Washington for the
conference with Mr. Francis B. Smith, Chief of the Instrument Research Division of NASA Longley Research Center. The President was
pleased to say that dozens of industries in the area of southeastern
Michigan had responded to the challenge and were supporting the
petition to NASA. He was also delighted to refer to the support which
had come from Ohio, particularly from Toledo.
Regent McInally, who attended the Michigan presentation, said,
"It was a thrill to see this presentation. It was given under our
President's leadership. I feel that this is on the record in Washington,
and that even if we do not get this project, we perhaps may receive a
larger project in the future as the result of this excellent presentation."
Regent McInally also praised the work of Mr. Malcolm Ferguson,
President of Bendix Corporation, who represented Michigan industry
at the NASA hearing.
President Hatcher complimented all those who had attended the
hearing with him, and particularly Dr. Farris, Dr. Sawyer, and
Mr. Radock. He was particularly pleased with the strong support that
industry had mustered.
In response to the request from Laurence D. Smith, Grand Rapids
attorney, and from other attorneys, on behalf of fraternities and sororities, for a stay of action on membership regulations of student organizations and for an appearance before the Regents by the attorneys, the
Regents respectfully declined such requests (p. 156). They indicated
their willingness to meet with the attorneys informally at a mutually
convenient time.
The President said there had been no formal word from   the
Governor concerning the recognition by the state of the importance
of higher education. He believed, however, it was heartening that the
Governor was willing to listen to his Blue Ribbon Committee, which
gave every indication of expecting to enhance the support of higher
education by a considerable margin over past years.
Regent Power, speaking for the Coordinating Council, said he and
Mr. Warren Huff had been in touch with Mr. Bentley and with the
Karn Committee; that 300,000 copies of the Coordinating Council's
report had been printed for distribution to alumni of the universities
in the state. He believed this report would have a salutary effect
throughout the state.
The Regents heard a "Report of Study with Recommendations
Relating to a Capital Gifts Fund-Raising Campaign" by Messrs.
Kersting and McClure, of Kersting, Brown & Co. Incorporated.

OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison and Erich A. Walter
Voted July 26, 1963 (p. 35)                    Presented November 23, 1963
CLARK    E. CENTER, B.S.E.(M.E.), 1927; Vice-President of the Union      C. E. Center:
Carbide Nuclear Company. Joining Union Carbide after a brilliant academic career  Outstanding
at the University, Mr. Center worked for a number of years on the separation of  Achievement
natural gases and the manufacture of compounds deriving from them. In 1943,  Award
when his company was chosen to develop the gaseous diffusion process for separating U235, he became involved in nuclear engineering. Preferring to remain close to
the scientific and technical aspects of that work, he continued for nearly two
decades to direct the production of fissionable uranium, and later the research and
development which Union Carbide carries on for the Atomic Energy Commission
under the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. His loyalty to his University has been
shown by his devoted service on the Board of Governors of the Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project. Expressing their warm admiration for his character and
accomplishments, the Regents of the University gratefully extend to him this
Outstanding Achievement Award.
MANUEL ANGEL del VALLE, B.Ch.E., 1916; Chairman of Fajardo Eastern       M. A. dcl Valle:
Sugar Association and President of the Sugar Service Corporation. This distin-  Outstandiing
guished alumnus has both reflected honor upon the University through his personal  Achievemlent
attainments and directly served it through the Alumni Association. Having gained  Award
a full and versatile knowledge of sugar production as Professor of Sugar Chemistry
at the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in Mayaguez and as supervisor
of industrial operations in field, factory, and laboratory, he assumed posts of
increasing responsibility with Eastern Sugar Associates, being elevated to president
in 1946. In 1958, when that organization was merged with the Fajardo Sugar
Company, he became chairman of the joint enterprise, which produces approximately one-fifth of all Puerto Rican sugar. Two years ago, he was elected lifetime
President-Emeritus of the Association of Sugar Producers of Puerto Rico, which
he had twice served as president. Lending his talents as well to the civic as to the
commercial life of his island, he has taken part in directing charitable and service
organizations. As president of the Federation of Young Men's Christian Associations of Puerto Rico, he has fostered the recent unparalleled growth of youth work
in the territory. A devoted alumnus, son of a graduate of the Dental School and
himself followed to the University by three younger brothers and his own son, he
has presided over the University of Michigan Club of Puerto Rico and is the first
person from beyond the continental limits of the United States to have been elected
a director of the National Alumni Association.
Upon this loyal friend and greatly gifted man, the Regents of the University
are proud to confer their Outstanding Achievement Award.
WALTER OTTO MENGE, A.B., 1925, A.M., 1926, Ph.D., 1931; President        I. ). Menge:
of The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company. After a student career in which  O)utstanding
he earned membership in both Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi, Mr. Menge taught   Achievement
mathematics at the University for a number of years, attaining the rank of   Award
associate professor. Joining then the staff of The Lincoln National Life Insurance
Company, he rose steadily within its hierarchy to assume the presidency in 1954.
He has since served also as Chairman of the Institute of Life Insurance and
President of the Life Insurance Association of America.
As scholar, teacher, and author of books on actuarial mathematics, he has
given full evidence of the incisiveness and clarity of his mind. As a business
executive, he has displayed also distinguished powers of organization and leadership, united with an unswerving devotion to the highest moral and professional
principles. The insurance in force at the Lincoln National has virtually doubled
during the less than ten years of his presidency. As a dedicated churchman and
responsible citizen, finally, he has lent his practical acumen and his ripe wisdom
to the executive councils of the Lutheran Church in America and to public and
philanthropic agencies in his state and city. The University owes him a special
debt for his service as a director of the Development Council and for the scholarships which his company generously offers to students of actuarial science here.
The Regents of the University, expressing their respect for his public and
professional attainments and the high honor in which they hold him as a man,
count it a privilege to confer on him their Outstanding Achievement Award.




182                 DECEMBER MEETING, 1963
J. A. Oliver:   JAMES A. OLIVER, A.B., 1936, A.M., 1937, Ph.D., 1942; herpetologist;
Outstanding  Director of the American Museum  of Natural History. During his increasingly
Achievement  eminent career as scientist and curator, Dr. Oliver has directed natural history
Award  museums to the equal gratification of scientists, students, and the general public.
Shortly after completing his most promising student career at the University, he
became an assistant curator at the Museum over which he now presides, and was
able, during subsequent military service, to collect reptiles and amphibians in
Mediterranean and Pacific islands. He has collected other specimens from Mexico
and the Bahamas, and as a unique achievement has bred king cobras in captivity.
The reptile house which he designed while chief executive officer of the Bronx
Zoo has been acclaimed the most beautiful in the world. Since his appointment to
his present office as Director of the American Museum of Natural History, he
has further appropriately served on a committee of the Commissioner of Education
of New York State, preparing recommendations for the fuller and apter use of
museums as educational institutions-a function which his own museum has fulfilled with high distinction.
On this occasion, the Regents of the University express their warm admiration
for Dr. Oliver's accomplishments in science and in the dissemination of scientific
knowledge, and cordially tender him their Outstanding Achievement Award.
L. R. E. Shami-    LEILA RUTH EDGAR SHAIN, A.B., 1907; lifelong educator. After enjoying
Outstanding  distinguished success as a high school teacher in Michigan, Montana, and CaliAchievement  fornia. Ruth Edgar married the late Charles J. Shain of Birmingham, Michigan,
Award  and has since left on that community the indelible impress of her intelligence and
energies. In 1919 she founded the Birmingham chapter of the American Association of University Women and became its first president. In subsequent years, she
has twice been United States delegate to the International Association of University Women. In 1920, under the aegis of the American Association of University
Women and the League of Women Voters, she founded the weekly class which
came informally to be called the Ruth Shain Class in International Relations.
During the next forty years, she presided over some eight hundred meetings of
that class, missing fewer than ten. Mrs. Shain was further a moving spirit in the
establishment of a new community center for Birmingham, serving as general
chairman of its building fund campaign and eight-time chairman of its annual
appeal for gifts. Among her many other offices have been those of program
chairman of the Detroit Branch of the Foreign Policy Association and international relations chairman and Bulletin editor of the International Education
Council of Detroit. She has been, in sum, a force behind virtually every cultural
activity in Birmingham and a constant influence for breadth of outlook throughout
southeastern Michigan.
In grateful acknowledgment of her services to civic enlightenment and of the
honor which she has brought upon her Alma Mater, the Regents of the University
now present to her their Outstanding Achievement Award.
HONORARY DEGREE

Voted September 20, 1963 (p. 74)               Conferred December 19, 1963
DOCTOR OF LAWS
W. W. Wirtz:     The Honorable W. WILLARD WIRTZ, Secretary of Labor. As a mediator of
Honorary Degree  labor disputes, Mr. Wirtz has possessed the integrity to win the confidence of both
sides, the acumen to distinguish grounds for equitable agreement, and the patience
to bring the disputants together upon those grounds. As a responsible public official,
he has pressed for an honest confronting of the novel technological and economic
conditions underlying industrial strife. As a wise and humane man, he has steadfastly reminded the nation, including those of its citizens who practice economic
computation, of the distress suffered by persons who must change employment
against their will or who can find no employment at all. We are here pleased to
attest, finally, that to his strength of mind, he has added wit, and to his moral
fervor, grace. The University respectfully confers upon this deeply devoted and
most engaging public servant the degree Doctor of Laws.

REGENTS' CITATION OF HONOR
Characterization by Alexander W. Allison and Erich A. Walter
Voted July 26, 1963 (p. 35)                    Conferred December 19, 1963
GEORGE NEIL HIGGINS, businessman, legislator, and counselor of young    G. N. Higgins:
people, has provided for others the educational opportunities which he himself was  Regents' Citation
denied. Eminently successful in a number of fields, he has prospered in the sale of  of Honor
automobiles, in the operation of his trucking firm, and as a banker. He has played
an active and distinguished role in municipal, county, and state government, serving
for six years in the Michigan House of Representatives and for eight years in the
Senate. Six months ago he was appointed chairman of the Michigan Employment
Security Commission. Today we would celebrate chiefly his avocation, that of
helping deserving students.
In 1931, the year of the great depression, when he and his wife were faced
with the problem of educating their own four children, he extended his aid and
counsel to another young aspirant to higher education in the town of Ferndale.
He was shortly adopting, in this fashion, a number of boys and girls each year.
His beneficiaries, now several hundred in all, have completed courses at many
different schools and colleges within the state and elsewhere. And virtually all of
them are enjoying success in their vocations: a living testimony to the judgment
as well as to the kindness of their benefactor. For the orderly administration of
his increasingly extensive program of aid, he established the Higgins Foundation
in 1946. Mindful also of the needs and desires of the generality of boys, he
sponsors, in the garage of his automobile agency, a Teen-Age Mechanics Club to
channel and socialize the interest of Ferndale youth in cars.
To this wise and generous man the Regents now happily present their
Citation of Honor.

V. B. Baits: Will   The University Attorney reported that the will of former Regent
Vera B. Baits, A.B., 1915, had recently been offered for probate in
Wayne County. The Fourth provision of her will provides as follows:
"FOURTH: I give to the REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF M\ICHIGAN, at Ann Arbor, Michigan, all the shares of the common capital stock of
American Motors Corporation registered in my name alone at the date hereof
(as distinguished from any like shares registered in the joint names of Stuart G.
and Vera B. Baits). This is a token of gratitude for opportunity and help afforded
me at the University of Michigan when I was young and in need."
W. Bejcek: Will    The University    Attorney   reported  that the will of Wilhelmina
Bejcek had recently been offered for probate in Cuyahoga County,
Ohio. Mrs. Bejcek was the widow of Charles A. Bejcek, 1891 Law, who
predeceased her in 1959.
After some nominal specific bequests the will provides as follows:
"The rest, residue and remainder of my estate I give, devise and bequeath to
The Regents of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan, for the
Velisha Bejcek high blood pressure research or for any other research beneficial to
mankind."
The attorney for the estate estimates that the University should
receive approximately $200,000 from this estate.
I. Cornwell: Will   The University Attorney filed the following report on the estate of
Irene Cornwell, A.B., 1907, A.M., 1910, whose will had recently been
offered for probate in Ramsey County, Minnesota:
After specific bequests of personal effects, the entire estate is given to The
Regents of the University of Michigan to establish a fund, the income from
which is to be paid '3 to a sister, Mary C. Gilbert, and 23 to a sister, Alice M.
Cornwell, or all of said income to the survivor of them for and during their
natural life, and thereafter the income shall be used as follows:
"2. Upon the death of the survivor of the said Mary C. Gilbert and Alice
M. Cornwell, the income from the said fund shall be used by The Regents of
the University of Michigan to provide for two cash prizes, each to be awarded
once every four years. One, to be known as the 'Wirt and Mary Cornwell
Prize' in pure (basic or fundamental) science, is to be awarded to a student of
The University of Michigan who, during the four previous years, shall have
shown greatest intellectual curiosity, given most promise of original study and
creative work in mathematics, physics or chemistry. The prize in basic science
is not to be awarded for applied science, mechanics, engineering or technology
in any form.
"Two years after the foregoing prize is awarded another prize, to be known
as the 'Wirt and Mary Cornwell Prize' in the humanities, is to be awarded to
the student of The University of Michigan who, during the four previous years,
shall have demonstrated most promise of original work in philosophy, musical
theory or literature. The prize in the humanities is not to be awarded for work
in the social sciences, the behavioral sciences, for works of fiction, nor for
foreign language proficiency.
"The Regents of the University of Michigan shall select the recipient of
each of the foregoing prizes in its usual manner of awarding prizes and scholarships, and such selection shall be final and conclusive and not subject to question
by any prospective recipient. However, it is my desire that the Regents appoint
a committee of scholars at The University of Michigan to make the recommendation of the recipient for each of the foregoing prizes, such committees to be
changed from time to time as circumstances warrant. It is further my desire
that the personal or family need of a prospective recipient should not be allowed
to influence the decision of the committee in making the recommendation for the




JANUARY MEETING, 1964


195


award. A recipient of the award need not have spent the preceding four years
at The University of Michigan. Only one award shall be made from the income
of the fund every two years. If in any year a suitable candidate cannot be
found, then the income for that year may be added to the principal of the fund
or retained as expendable income to increase the amount of the prize in future
years at the discretion of the Regents."
Securities of the value of $80,000 were found in the decedent's safety
deposit box.
The University Attorney reported that the will of Arthur D. Nock had
recently been offered for probate in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.
The Harvard Trust Company, of Cambridge, is one of the co-executors and
also trustee under a living trust. The will and trust agreement have like provisions
for distribution, that is, the income is payable for life to the decedent's sister,
Alice Esther Mary Nock, and after her death, the corpus is to be distributed to a
number of educational institutions.
The distribution provision of both instruments contains the following:
"One-twenty-fourth (1/24) to the UNIVERSITY     OF MICHIGAN, in
Ann Arbor, Michigan, in memory of Campbell Bonner, to be used as the
Chairman of the Department of Classics of said University shall determine for
the purpose of buying books for said Department."
The corpus of the trust, together with the inventory of the estate, totals
approximately one-half million dollars, which will be distributed upon the death
of the sister.
There is a contingent provision which provides that, in the event the sister
shall not need all of the income in any calendar year, the trustee in its discretion
may distribute such excess income to the remaindermen. Pursuant to this contingent provision, the trustee has tendered the University its check in the amount of
$509.88 representing 1/24 of the surplus of accumulated income, to establish the
Campbell Bonner Memorial Fund.
Routine appointments, all within the budget, were approved as

meeting.
Degrees Con-   On recommendation of Dean Floyd A. Bond of the School of
ferred: School of
Business Business Administration, as approved by the Vice-President for AcaAdministration  demic Affairs, the following students were granted the degrees noted:
Alan James Dybvig, Master of Business Administration with High
Distinction; John Brent Ferguson, Master of Business Administration
with High Distinction; Robert Heald Hepple, Master of Business
Administration.
Committee on    The report by the Committee on Honorary Degrees was filed for
H"oora   t Filede the information of the Regents and for their action at their February
meeting.
The Regents requested a report at their February meeting on a
name that had been considered by the Committee on Honorary Degrees
but on which they had postponed action to a future date.
The Regents voted an honorary degree for the speaker at the
Engineering Honors Convocation which will be held April 7, 1964.

Michigan League   The Regents authorized that the fee allocation for the Michigan
Feellthcan fus  League be reduced by one half, to $3.50 a semester per woman student,

fifty cents per woman student for League student activities. The funds
released by this action will be made available for the North Campus
Center (R.P., 1960-63, p. 994). In taking this action the point was
made that the present allocation of student fees to the Michigan
League is not necessary for the financial needs of the League, whereas
the operation of the North Campus Center at least during its first
few years will require additional University funds.
North Campus    Authorization was granted for the development of preliminary site

Changed  Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree in the College of Engineering
were raised from eight credit hours to fourteen.
Laboratory Equip-    On recommendation of the Dean of the Medical School and of the
ment Given to
Smithsonian  Vice-President for Academic Affairs, permission was granted to the

Student Govern-    On recommendation of the Vice-President for Student Affairs, the
Plan  odified  Regents modified the Student Government Council Plan by authorizing
the following amendments (R.P., 1960-63, p. 659): First, by adding to
Section 4, "A Student Government Council board or committee shall
be any committee responsible to Student Government Council. Unless
otherwise stated its members do not represent any particular constituency." Secondly, by adding to the ex officio membership list these
words, "the highest student officer of the International Students'
Association."
D. M. D. Thurber:    The   Regents enthusiastically    adopted    the  following  resolution,
Resolution on
Retirement  offered by Regent Brablec on the retirement of Donald M. D. Thurber
from the Board:
On January 4, 1958, Governor G. Mennen Williams appointed Donald M. D.
Thurber Regent of The University of Michigan to succeed Paul L. Adams, whom
the Governor had appointed Attorney General.
Regent Thurber, in characteristic fashion, familiarized himself with all
aspects of the University's administration, all parts and divisions of the great
complex. He visited and examined from the University Hospital to the Office of
Student Affairs, from the Office of Business and Finance to the Michigan Stadium
and the Athletic Association, from the Biological Station at Pellston, Michigan, to
Camp Davis at Jackson Hole, Wyoming; from Willow Run and the Institute of
Science and Technology to the School of Social Work. Every phase of University
activity and all facets of its life held his interest. Among them all, however, he
found the classes, their teachers and students, most important and meaningful.
He shared his observations and judgments on University problems with his fellow
Regents and with the University's executive officers. In reviewing new proposals,
he tried always to weigh the projected against past achievement, the future
against the historical record. He found great satisfaction in testing the validity of
existing policies and the soundness of those proposed. His humor and his wit gave
impetus to discussion and often provided the balance for reflection. In his six-year
period on the Board, Regent Thurber's contributions matched the University's
broad scope of endeavor.
The Regents of the University of Michigan recognize his highly significant
and meaningful service to the University. They are pleased to appoint him Regent
Emeritus and extend to him best wishes for his good health and happiness.
Peace Corps:     The President reported that a number of suggestions from members
Plaque   oun Mark  of the faculty and from   students had been received with the recomment of mendation that a plaque be placed on the steps of the Michigan Union
where the late President John F. Kennedy first made the public
announcement at 2:00 A.M. on October 14, 1960, of his plans for a
Peace Corps. These plans were revealed by the late President in a
campaign speech. President Hatcher said, "It was a very moving
speech, and we have verified that during it the late President made his
first announcement of the Peace Corps."
In proposing a motion to establish the plaque, Regent Sorenson
said, "It should be made known that contributions for this plaque will
be welcome, with any surplus being used for a scholarship fund in the




JANUARY MEETING, 1964


203


name of the late President and the Peace Corps. This was one of the
most widely accepted and enthusiastically supported programs that
Mr. Kennedy carried through."
After further discussion of the idea, it was decided that the Regents
would authorize the payment for the plaque and its installation; that
any funds received would be used to establish a scholarship which
would be named the John F. Kennedy Peace Corps Scholarship.
Regent Power, in reporting on the last meeting of the Coordinating
Council, said the Council had been much concerned about the appropriations bill. The Council had communicated its concern to the Blue
Ribbon Committee, which in turn issued an excellent report. The
recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Committee influenced the Governor to change his mind in the direction of repeatedly increasing his
recommendations to the legislature for higher education.
The President reported that the Council had also discussed the
lack of uniform accounting procedures among the various universities
in the state. He emphasized that there could be no intelligent discussion of comparisons between institutions until uniform accounting
procedures were established, which then would give comparable figures
for discussion.
Since Regent Emeritus Thurber had been alternate to Regent
Power as a representative of the Regents of the University on the
Coordinating Council, the Regents appointed Regent Brablec as the
alternate, to succeed Regent Emeritus Thurber.
The President reported receipt of a letter from Governor Romney
on appropriations for 1964-65. He was pleased to note that the Governor's recommendation was $5,860,884 above the current operating
budget. He said, "This is a considerable improvement, although it falls
short of the University's request of $9,350,396. However, this is a new
level of support which we have badly needed." The President said that
if the budget increases are approved by the legislature, they will be
used to support salary adjustments for faculty and staff and to improve
library facilities and other facilities closely connected with teaching.
Continuing, the President said part of the increase will be used to
take the next steps in going forward with a full-year, three-semester
program.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance reported that
the Governor's capital outlay recommendations for the fiscal year
1964-65 totaled $5,755,000, an increase of $933,000 over the state
appropriation for building this year. He said the Governor's recommendations included $1,500,000 to begin construction of a new
$9,982,000 Dental School Building; $1,200,000 to begin a $12,000,000
Medical Science Building; $1,870,000 to continue construction of a
$2,565,000 Fluids Engineering Building; $385,000 to complete the
$4,208,000 School of Music Building; $500,000 to continue renovation
of the University Hospital; and $300,000 to begin the remodeling of
the East Medical Building for use of the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts.
In commenting on the Governor's proposals, the President said.
"This represents a very significant step forward, a major breakthrough."
Last year the Governor had recommended a hold-the-line budget. In

the meantime, he had appointed a Blue Ribbon Committee to review
the needs of higher education.
The President offered a sincere tribute to the Bentley subcommittee
of the Blue Ribbon Committee, who had a clear picture of the needs
for higher education and who insisted upon communicating their report
to the legislature. The report, he said, was of such epoch-making
character that the Coordinating Council had it printed, and 290,000
copies were distributed throughout the state (p. 179).
In continuing, the President said the Blue Ribbon Committee felt a
minimum of $25,000,000 increment for higher education was necessary.
Although the Governor's recommendation was somewhat short of the
Blue Ribbon Committee's, the University will do the very best it
knows how with the funds that are granted. It was most gratifying
that this could be established as a new level of support which the state
very badly needed.
In answer to a question from Regent Cudlip about the difference
between what the University asked for and what the Governor recommended, the President said the University had asked for $9,000,000;
the Governor had recommended $5,800,000.
Regent Sorenson said, "I am happy to hear of the priority to move
to the three-semester operation."
The President added that no word had yet been received about the
time schedules for legislative hearings on the budget.
Employee Rela-  The Vice-President in charge of business and finance reported on
tions: pect of certain aspects of employee relations with particular reference to a
letter the Regents received from Mr. Milton Murray, Building Service
Employees' International Union, AFL-CIO. The Regents referred the
matters raised by Mr. Murray to the Vice-President in charge of
business and finance for further consideration and discussion with the
Union involved.
Vice-President  The Regents were pleased to welcome Vice-President Heyns after
Heyns: Reprt his trip around the world. The Vice-President expressed his appreciation for the opportunity of making the inspection trip. He said the
Peace Corps was making unique contributions abroad; the University
had a special interest in the growth of the Corps; the University
alumni were most loyal to the University and occupied very important
positions in government and in business throughout the world. He had
found The University of Michigan a partner with the federal government in executing national policy overseas; the University was working
with AID on planned projects.
The Vice-President believed there was much to be gained if many
parts of the University are involved in the same country. He referred
to India as an important example, where the Institute for Social
Research, colleges of Engineering and Literature, Science, and the
Arts, and the School of Business Administration accumulate real capability. He said there might be a great advantage to the "chosen
instrument" concept.
Vice-President Heyns said, "Our University has an enormous goal
at stake in the teaching of English and increasing the use of the
English language throughout the world. The process is much too slow;
too little money is being spent on it. A massive effort is needed. The




JANUARY MEETING, 1964


205


University of Michigan has great competence in this area. The program
needs to be raised in the national priority system. This University is
ready to assume the leadership role."
Reviewing the training of foreign students, the Vice-President said,
"We need to be hard-headed in the process of selecting and training
foreign students. We need to improve the situation. We need to work
with the government and to re-examine our own procedures and
improve them."
To a question from Regent Sorenson about a "slippage" in the use
of University of Michigan trained foreign students, Vice-President
Heyns answered there often may be a resentment toward United States
trained students who return to their homeland. He added, "We should
condition our foreign students for their role upon their return."
In being asked his opinion by the President on the "consortium"
approach to the aid of foreign countries versus the "task force" from a
single institution, the Vice-President for Academic Affairs said the
consortium had done a good job but presented a problem in the
variability of the staff. "The consortium has weaknesses of loose
partnership, but increases the range of things one can do in a country,"
he added. The Vice-President believed there was much promise in
building training capability in a foreign country itself rather than
bringing students from that country to the United States. He referred
to the danger of creating a pool of "educated unemployed."
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for The Regents
of the University of Michigan for the month of December, 1963,
totaled $995.80.
The Regents adjourned to meet on Thursday, February 27.

The Vice-President for Academic Affairs made the following state-         Resignations:
ment concerning resignations: Although the University in recent years         Statement on
had lost some very excellent men who accepted positions in other
universities, it should be noted that the number leaving the University
was comparatively lower than at other universities. The administration,
he said, regarded the faculty as belonging in one of three groups-the
top leadership group, the middle group, and the junior group. The
smallest number of losses obviously occurred in the top leadership
group. Key figures in general remained at the University.
The middle group, he said, was composed of those faculty members
who were on the way to distinction. It was from this group that future
leaders were drawn. Members from this group became candidates for




252


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1964


departmental chairmen, for deanships, and for other administrative
posts. The University had assumed its historic responsibility for providing from this group leadership in institutions throughout the land.
The third group, the junior group, the Vice-President said, constituted a resource pool on which the University depended for its own
future growth. There was great urgency to keep the good men in spite
of the intense competition which tended to attract them away from the
University.
"We must recognize that the middle group will have increased
mobility," the Vice-President said. "We must continue to make a
heavy investment in the junior group."
The Vice-President was pleased to cite examples of how the University trains outstanding students who then leave and assume positions
of leadership elsewhere, and eventually return to the University to
assume top positions. He referred particularly to Dr. J. Robert Willson,
an alumnus of the Medical School, who after assuming a key position
in the Department of Obstetrics at Temple University returned to the
University to become Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology after the retirement of Dr. Miller (p. 24). This succession
has also occurred in the Department of Surgery where Dr. William S.
Smith has taken the place of his former teacher, Dr. Carl E. Badgley
(p. 24). Dr. William J. Fry has just recently assumed the place
vacated by the resignation of Dr. Marion S. De Weese.
N. E. Hartweg:     The Secretary    reported   the death   on  February    16 of Norman
Memeor Edward Hartweg, Assistant Director and Curator of Reptiles and
Amphibians in the Museum of Zoology and Professor of Zoology.
The following memoir was adopted:
The death, on February 16, of NORMIAN EDWARD HARTWEG, distinguished herpetologist in the Museum of Zoology, is deeply mourned by his
immediate colleagues, by his many friends throughout the University, and by
herpetologists the world over. He was in his sixtieth year.
Dr. Hartweg became an assistant in the Museum while still an undergraduate
here, and was appointed an assistant curator upon earning his doctorate in 1934.
By that time his notable contributions to Mexican herpetology were already
beginning to appear. He was made Curator of Reptiles and Amphibians in 1946
and Assistant Director of the Museum in 1961. Within the Department of Zoology,
he rose through the several ranks to a professorship in 1956.
Through his offices in teaching, administration, and the direction of research,
Dr. Hartweg made The University of Michigan a principal center for graduate
training in his field. His former students are even now diffusing his national and
international influence further. He served also for many years on the governing
board of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists and as
co-editor of its journal, Copeia. A moving spirit in the study of tropical biology,
he was further instrumental in the recent founding of the inter-university Organization for Tropical Studies, of which he was president and board chairman at the
time of his death. A loyal member of the comprehensive community of scientists
and scholars, he freely lent his tact, persuasiveness, and sound judgment to committees, not only of the Museum and the Department of Zoology but of the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and the University Senate.
Sensible of a profound loss to the University, the Regents wish to express, as
well, their personal sorrow for Dr. Hartweg's death and their grateful esteem for
his memory. To Mrs. Hartweg and the other surviving members of his family,
they tender their deepest sympathy.
Off-Campus      The following staff members have been assigned to duty off campus

The Regents accepted the following report of the planning commit-        Athletic Building:
tee for the athletic building:                                               Report on
ATHLETIC BUILDING
The Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics recommends that the Board
of Regents authorize the planning, design, and construction of a new spectator
building to be financed by athletic receipts, with payments on borrowed funds
secured by pledging the student athletic fee.
The athletic plant expansion committee of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics has developed a long-term athletic building program, of which
the highest priority need, unanimously endorsed by the entire Board, is a spectator
building seating 12,000 to 15,000 compactly around a basketball court. Such.
building would have widespread use for basketball, gymnastics, wrestling, and
other indoor spectator sports exclusive of track and hockey. It would be provided
with a portable stage for use in Commencement, major addresses, and entertainments.
The cost is estimated at about 3'2 million dollars although precise estimates
have not been made. The current cash reserves and revenues are adequate to
finance the building.
The building site will be in the southwest portion of the campus. Under current
consideration for recommendation to the Regents are:




256


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1964


1. Along Stadium Boulevard immediately east of the Stadium
2. Along Hoover west of the Intramural Sports Building
3. Along State Street south of the Field House
4. Wines Field
5. The present Coliseum area
The planning committee for the athletic building (consisting of H. O. Crisler,
James Brinkerhoff, Lynn Fry, and Stephen H. Spurr, Chairman) recommend that
Kenneth Black and Associates, of Lansing, and Dan Dworsky, of Los Angeles, be
approved as associate architects for the building.
The President said the proposed building, which would be a selfliquidating project, would be a multipurpose building, including a
basketball court. It would also provide adequate space for convocations
and other large public meetings. He said it would not become the vast
multipurpose building originally presented to the Regents some years
ago (R.P., 1960-63, p. 434).
Regents Power and Sorenson stressed the need of sports in which
many students could participate. They hoped the need for more playing
fields, squash courts, handball courts, and similar facilities would not
be overlooked.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance said that application would be made to the legislature for recognition and approval of
the project as a self-liquidating one, and that Professor William J.
Johnson would be invited to work on the project.
Regent Cudlip spoke of the favorable comments heard by national
commentators who had broadcast from the Illinois and The Ohio State
University multipurpose buildings. The President said the St. John
Arena at Ohio State University was designed for convocations. The
President believed that The University of Michigan would do well
to work both with Ohio State University and with the University of
Kentucky in designing and constructing its building.
Bylaw Amended       On the recommendation of Regent McInally, the following resolution
was adopted (p. 159):
Be It Resolved, That Section 1.12 of the Byla7ws of the Board of Regents
be, and the same hereby are, amended to read as follows:
C.nmmittees of   Sec. 1.12. Committees of the Board. There shall be one standing committee
the Board  of the Board known as the "Committee on Administrative Personnel." Such
Committee shall be appointed by the President and shall consist of four members,
one to be drawn from each biennial class of Regents. The President shall be an
ex officio member of the Committee. The duties and functions of the Committee
shall be to keep itself continually informed on the functions, performance, and
compensation of the principal administrative officers; to seek comparative data on
both duties and compensation of similar officers in other institutions; and to report
regularly to the Regents. When the Committee considers matters pertaining to the
office of the President, it shall meet without him and shall have as its presiding
officer the Regent on the Committee whose term of office is due next to expire.
All other standing committees of the Board as provided for in the present Bylaws
shall be, and the same hereby are, abolished. (NOTE.-The official Directory of
officers, faculty, and staff of the University shall be used as the authority in
identifying Regents, by name, expiration dates of terms of office, and biennial
classes.)
When the Board of Regents shall resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole,
the President, unless an election is ordered by a majority vote of the Regents who
are present, shall designate a Regent who shall be Chairman of said Committee.
The election of a Chairman shall be by written ballot cast by the Regents who
are present.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1964


257


Regent Murphy's membership on the Michigan League Board of
Governors was continued for the year 1964, to end in December, 1964
(R.P., 1957-60, p. 310).
Regent Power's membership on the Board of Directors of the
University of Michigan Union was continued through December, 1964,
unless upon ratification of the proposed revised constitution of the
Union the membership of the Regent should be eliminated (R.P.,
1960-63, p. 609).
The Regents approved an alternate three-term calendar for 1964-65
(R.P., 1960-63, p. 1178). These latter dates were set for purposes of
defining the beginning and end of University-year appointments at nine
months for the full academic appointment or four and one-half months
for one-half academic appointments.
The Vice-President for Academic Affairs said, "If sufficient funds
are available, it will be possible to go on to a full three-term, yearround calendar, as indicated in column two of the calendars submitted."
The Vice-President said the University community had very frankly
confronted the proposed changes in the calendar; that although some
internal changes might be necessary, the calendar as outlined would
become effective; that although the athletic program extends beyond
the end of the winter term, he believed the Western Conference would
accept the necessary adjustments; that these and other problems could
be faced and solved.
Regent Brablec congratulated those who had built the authorized
and the alternate calendars. He believed the right time had been
chosen to establish the time periods as "Fall Term," "Winter Term,"
and "Spring-Summer Term." He believed this was sensible terminology.
Regent Power hoped that reading periods might be included in the
terms.
In answer to a question by Regent Goebel, the Vice-President for
Academic Affairs said other universities in the Big Ten had not adopted
the Michigan plan. The Vice-President emphasized the fact that The
University of Michigan, on the recommendation of the Calendar Commission and by approval of the Regents, had embraced a twelve-month
operation.
The President emphasized that no change whatsoever had occurred
in the total time required of the faculty.
The calendars approved by the Regents are as follows:


Regent Murphy:
On Michigan
League Board
of Governors
Regent Power: On
Michigan Union
Board of Directors

The Vice-President in charge of business and finance filed a progress
report on plant extension. The contract for the North Campus Center,




MARCH MEETING, 1964


271


he said, was let to A. Z. Shmina and Sons Company, who will soon
begin work on the project.
Continuing his report, the Vice-President said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had been notified that construction
bids had been received, and the laboratory project budget had been
approved by the Regents at the February 27, 1964, meeting (p. 254);
and following the note, the bid of Spence Brothers, Saginaw, had been
accepted as the low bid on the construction contract. The resolution
approving the contract, he said, would be submitted to the Regents
under the finance and property section of these minutes (p. 284).
Construction on the following projects, he said, was proceeding on
schedule: Fluids Engineering Building Unit II, University Hospital
Central Laboratories, Kresge Medical Research Building Addition, and
Dearborn Housing; and planning was continuing for the following
projects: Dental Building, Medical Science Building Unit II, and
Central Campus Library.
The plans and specifications for the Institute for Social Research
Building, the Vice-President said, would be submitted for construction
bids in March, and bids would be due by the middle of April.
The Vice-President said preliminary planning was proceeding with
the North Campus housing project. He presented for review by the
Regents the site analysis, preliminary planning, and a model of the
project. The site of the buildings, he said, would be just west of the
new School of Music.
Regent Brablec made the point that in view of the tremendous
demand for higher education by admissible students, he could see the
need of housing which would be somewhere between the Markley plan
and the one proposed for the North Campus.
Regent Sorenson said he believed the residences with higher density
of population should be occupied by freshmen; those of lower density,
by upperclassmen.
The President reported gifts from the following sources. These were Gifts
accepted in accord with their terms and conditions and with appropriate
thanks in each case (p. 243):

Fund   receive the corpus of a trust established under the will of Charles Hunt
Garrison, of Detroit, who died in 1946 (R.P., 1945-48, p. 305). The
assets of the trust consist principally of securities having a total recent
market value of about $835,000. The terms of the bequest are as
follows:
"... to the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, to be used by
said Board as a student loan fund and to be known as the Charles Hunt Garrison
Student Loan Fund. I make no restrictions on the use of the fund by the Board of
Regents of the University of Michigan for the reason that I have full confidence
that it will be used by them in cases found to be worthy."
Student Aid     The Vice-President in charge of business and finance said gifts of
Discussed  this kind, loan funds of this type which are not restricted in their use,
would be used to pay the University's share toward receiving federal
grants, such as were made available through the Health Professions
Educational Assistance Act of 1963 (p. 167).
Regent Power wondered what the University can do to aid freshmen with scholarships or loans.
Vice-President Lewis said that aside from the Regents' scholarships,
there were no scholarship funds for first-semester freshmen. He
referred to the new program for Negro students as the one exception.
Vice-President Heyns said a sizable grant, in addition to tuition,
would be available for students in the special programs for Negroes.
Once these students had found themselves, they would need less and
less financial assistance, and could take on some outside work.

Regent Power suggested that a pamphlet be published on this
program which could be distributed to interested alumni.
Vice-President Lewis was pleased to report that, currently, 11,104
students had borrowed more than $4,000,000 through the University
loan funds. Two million of this total, he said, came from the NDEA
program; $500,000 more would come to the University from this program next year. Freshmen, he said, may apply for loans under the
National Defense Education Act.
Routine appointments, all within the budget, were approved as Appointments:

C.B. Slawson:     The Secretary reported the death on March 12 of Chester Baker
Slawson, Professor of Mineralogy. The following memoir was adopted:
The death of Professor CHESTER BAKER SLAWSON on the twelfth of
March, 1964, brought to a somber close an able career in crystallography and a
lifetime of devoted service to the University. He was sixty-five years of age.
After graduating from the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts with
distinction in 1919, he embarked upon graduate work here and earned his doctorate in 1925, at which time he was appointed Instructor in Mineralogy. He rose
through the several ranks to a professorship in 1946.
Possessing an authoritative knowledge of the factors of crystal hardness, he
became an adviser in the uses of diamonds to the United States Bureau of Mines,
the National Academy of Sciences, and other national agencies, as well as to the
South African diamond industry. Through these offices he attracted to his department important research contracts, the work upon which he himself skillfully
directed.
Eminent in his own branch of science, Professor Slawson possessed also a
versatility which made it easy for him to teach mathematics and chemistry courses
during the war. To his classes at large, he brought an unfailing vivacity and
enthusiasm; to his individual students, a sympathetic concern for their personal
welfare.
As an academic counselor, he shared this concern with hundreds of students in
his College and throughout the University. His ability to find scholarship funds
from foundations and other sources for worthy and deserving students assured
them of educational opportunities that otherwise would have been denied them.
Many friendships that developed between him and the students he advised continued and deepened through the years.
His colleagues benefited from his loyalty and wise counsel, especially during
the period of the recent merger of the Mineralogy and Geology departments.
To committees of the Literary College and the University Senate, he lent his
customary acumen and sound critical judgment.
The Regents of the University now mourn his untimely death and express
their grateful esteem for his memory. To Mrs. Slawson and to the other members
of his surviving family, they extend their deepest sympathy.

Recommendation


A more detailed explanation of the purpose of the gift is contained in
a letter addressed to the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance by Alexander H. Smith, Director of the University Herbarium
and Curator of Fungi, and Professor of Botany, and a member of the
Michigan Botanical Club, a copy of which is included in Exhibit C-3
of the minutes of this meeting. Profits from the publication of a bulletin on the mushrooms of Michigan's parks and recreation areas, written
by Professor and Mrs. Smith, were given by them      to the Michigan
Botanical Club and have gone far to make possible the gift of the land
by the Club to the University.
Purchase of the property at 119 Park Terrace, Ann Arbor, from
Alpha Epsilon Iota Fraternity, Inc., at a price of $30,000 with payment to be made with $25,000 cash and transfer of title to a parcel of
land on Fuller Street, Ann Arbor, as identified and described in AtwellHicks, Inc., land description dated February 18, 1964, was approved.
Purchase of the property at 532 Thompson Street, Ann Arbor, from
Lucille E. Johnson was approved.
Purchase of the property at 1426 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor,
from Martha D. Greiner and Frederick H. Greiner, Jr., was approved.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance, referring to
his progress report on plant extension (p. 271), said the low bid on the
Space Research Laboratory construction was the bid of Spence Brothers, Saginaw, in the amount of $1,240,990, including the seventeen
alternates and the deduction for the substitution of limestone for
Mankato stone. With the approval of the Director of Grants and
Research Contracts of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the contract accordingly was awarded to Spence Brothers in accord
with the authorization granted to the Vice-President in charge of business and finance at the February meeting of the Regents (p. 254).
The Regents adopted the following resolution:
WIEREAS, It has been determined that the low bid for construction of the
Space Research Building, University of Michigan Project 225, was that bid submitted by Spence Brothers in the net amount of $1,240,990, and
WHEREAS, The contract for the construction of the said building was awarded
to the low bidder by the Vice-President in charge of business and finance in
accordance with the authorization of the Board of Regents granted at its February 27 meeting,
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, That the action of the Vice-President in
charge of business and finance in awarding the contract for construction of the
Space Research Laboratory, University of Michigan Project 225, to Spence Brothers,
for the net amount of $1,240,990, is hereby ratified and affirmed.
Pursuant to the action taken at their February 27, 1964, meeting
for the construction of a multipurpose building, including a basketball
court and a space for convocations and other large public meetings
(p. 256), the Regents accepted the following site recommendation by
Stephen H. Spurr, Chairman of the University Events Building
Planning Committee:
Approval of the Regents is requested for locating the University Events
Building on a site immediately east of the Michigan Stadium and north of Stadium
Boulevard.
This site has been selected after a comprehensive survey of eight alternative
locations, including Wines Field, the area immediately south of Yost Field House,
and the area immediately north of the Stadium. Four of these locations were ruled

out because of the large numbers of small land parcels that would have to be
assembled at considerable cost ($800,000 to $1,200,000) over a period of years.
Three others, including the Wines Field location, require extensive relocation of
existing athletic facilities and, in addition, present serious engineering problems
due to the great depth to a firm subsoil suitable for holding up a massive building
approximately 300 to 400 feet in dimension.
The recommended site provides ample space for a building of this size. Parking off street for approximately 1,680 cars will be available within 1,000 feet and
for an additional 550 cars within 2,000 feet on University land. In addition, an
additional 1,050 cars can be parked on streets within 2,000 feet of the building
entrance. Finally, the entrance to the Ann Arbor High School parking lots is less
than 2,000 feet away. The proposed site is almost exactly one mile by road from
the Michigan Union, and will be less than this distance when walks across Ferry
Field and the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks are developed as a part of this project.
It is thus closer to campus than many comparable structures at other Big Ten
universities. University buses will provide transportation to the building from the
North Campus and Observatory areas, and a special entrance way for buses will
be planned.
It is anticipated that the University Events Building will be provided with a
stage for use in general University convocations as well as for basketball and other
athletic events. The building will be planned in conjunction with paved off-street
parking facilities to its north and east and with access provided by a walkway
across the Ann Arbor Railroad and Ferry Field to Hoover Street and to State
Street at the south end of Yost Field House.
In accepting the report, Regent Goebel and Regent Brablec expressed the hope that seating capacity of the University Events Building would be made as large as possible; that in planning the building,
the possibility of enlarging it still further at a future time would be
given serious consideration; and that all efforts be made to complete
the structure by December 1, 1965.
In commenting on the University Events Building, the Vice-President in charge of business and finance said there were at least eight
points around which final decisions were made in choosing the location:
(1) a land area large enough to accommodate a building 300 by 400
feet in outside dimensions; (2) the nature of the subsoil; (3) approach
to the site for traffic, including foot traffic, traffic by private cars, and
by bus; (4) the possibility of parking immediately adjacent to the
structure; (5) the cost of site land; (6) the availability of utilities;
(7) the problem of esthetics-the relation of the new structure to other
buildings; (8) the impact of the new structure on the surrounding
community.
The Vice-President said final choice was directed toward three
sites-the first, Wines Field; the second, the site south of Yost Field
House; and the third, the site just east of the Stadium. The site just
east of the Stadium was chosen because of the soil conditions, because
of the approach to it down Division Street and State Street for foot
traffic, because of the approach for automobile traffic via Stadium
Boulevard, because of the availability of parking facilities for 2,000 or
more cars, and because of the sufficient areas to park large numbers of
buses, including quick access and egress for these public conveyances.
The President was pleased to note that the site chosen means that
our University Events Building will be nearer to the Central Campus
than such comparable buildings are at Ohio State University, at Indiana
University, or at the University of Illinois. The President stressed the
need of having a walkway from the Central Campus to the new facility
which would be direct and without intervening structures or walls.

MARCH MEETING, 1964


Literary College:
Establishment of
New Unit,
Approved


Such walls as the Ferry Field wall can become not only physical but
psychological barriers which should be removed.
Regent Brablec emphasized the possibility of enlarging the structure
in the future, possibly within twenty years.
On the recommendation of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs,
the Regents approved the principle of growth in liberal arts offerings
through the establishment of a new literary college unit. In granting
this approval it was understood that a planning committee for the new
unit would be appointed by the Vice-President for Academic Affairs to
include representatives not only of the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, but also of other schools and colleges and other interested
segments of the University community.
The Vice-President in presenting the idea of a residential college
gave the following background information:
The College of Literature, Science, and the Arts currently has enrolled 8,779
undergraduates in the College itself and 3,127 graduate students in the Horace H.
Rackham   School of Graduate Studies, making a total of 11,906 liberal arts
students or 44 per cent of the total University resident enrollment of 27,388. It
teaches nearly 55 per cent of the total number of credit hours of instruction in the
University. Any growth in the University will be reflected in the demand for
liberal arts instruction. Present demand from qualified students and present admissions policies indicate the need to accommodate nearly 12,000 undergraduate L.,
S., and A. students by 1967-68, an increase by one-third over the present size of
the College.
Over the past several years, the possibility of establishing a new literary
college structure as a partial response to this enrollment pressure has been developed by the faculty of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Variously called the new
college, College A, the small college plan, and the residential college, the underlying theme has remained the concept that the growth in liberal arts instruction at
The University of Michigan can best be accomplished at least in part by the
establishment of a new literary college structure related to the present College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts.
At its February meeting, the faculty of Literature, Science, and the Arts
approved the principle of growth in liberal arts instruction at the undergraduate
level through the establishment of a new literary college unit. This faculty,
through a committee whose report has been approved by the faculty as a whole,
has made recommendations relating to the new college dealing with location, size,
selection of students, teaching staff, administrative staff, curriculum, facilities, and
residential requirements. These advisory recommendations will provide the base for
the planning to be done by a University-wide committee.
The Vice-President said the comparatively small group of 1,500 to
2,500 students in the residential college would permit more deliberate
experimenting. The relationship of the new college to the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts would involve developing the autonomy of a small college staff. The relationship between the large and
the small, the old and the new, was most promising. A small college
far from a large university and from a large college such as the College
of Literature, Science, and the Arts would obviously not be able to
work out certain aspects of the educational experiment because of its
remoteness.
The Vice-President referred to the experiment which had been
going on at Greene House in East Quadrangle under the leadership of
Professor Lane and Professor Newcomb. Some of the desirable aspects
of the proposed new college had been developed to a certain degree in
the Greene House experiment, particularly such aspects as having the
students in the unit together in activities and in classes.




MARCH MEETING, 1964


287


In answer to Regent Brablec's question, the Vice-President said
students had been consulted repeatedly; that he himself had discussed
all aspects of the proposed new college with a number of student groups.
Regent Murphy said, "I now feel more secure about the North
Campus."
The President referred to Professor Angell's work with a group of
students on the concept of the proposed new college. The stress had
been, the President said, on the interaction of the classroom and
student life. In the new college it was hoped to bring into close social
relationship the engineer and the humanist. Rigidity would be avoided;
flexibility would be cultivated. The entire concept, he believed, had
very great possibilities.
On recommendation of the Dean of the College of Engineering and
the Vice-President for Academic Affairs, the degree Bachelor of Science
in Engineering (Meteorology) was changed to Bachelor of Science
(Meteorology and Oceanography), B.S.(Meteor. & Ocean.), effective
for all students enrolling for the first time for the fall term of the
University year 1964-65 and for those students currently enrolled who
by choice and on approval of the department meet the necessary
requirements. The department has adjusted its curriculum to include
courses in the oceanic sciences previously offered in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts. While the total number of credit
hours remains unchanged, the revised program reduces the requirements
that are normally associated with the engineering degree, with corresponding increase in science-oriented courses.
On the recommendation of the Dean of the College of Engineering
and the Vice-President for Academic Affairs, the degree Bachelor of
Science in Engineering (Aeronautical Engineering) was changed to
Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Aeronautical and Astronautical
Engineering), B.S.E.(Ae. & Astrn.E.) effective with the degrees granted
at Commencement, May 23, 1964. Since the addition of the word
"astronautical" to the department name and to the designation for the
master's degree (R.P., 1957-60, p. 731), the engineering principles
associated with astronautical engineering have been added to the course
work for the bachelor's degree. The change will give proper acknowledgment in the degree designation.
On recommendation of the Dean of the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts and of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs,
the Regents authorized the change voted by the faculty of the College
of Literature, Science, and the Arts reducing the graduation requirement in freshman English from six hours to three hours.
The Secretary reported that Mr. Robert Granville, who had
accepted the Regents' invitation to receive their Outstanding Achievement Award on May 8, 1964, had died on Friday, March 20. The
Regents agreed that copies of the citation be sent to Mrs. Granville
and to their son; that the citation be noted in the program for Honors
Convocation on May 8; and that the illuminated copy of the citation,
when prepared by the artist, be sent to Mrs. Granville (p. 335).

Mortgage on   The Regents accepted and placed on file a letter from Daryl J. Bem,
epregarty  Corresponding Secretary of AAAFHA-CORE. The letter referred to a
mortgage held by The University of Michigan on Lot No. 1 of Arbordale Subdivision.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance said that The
Regents of the University of Michigan would not knowingly buy a
mortgage on a piece of property which is racially segregated as to its
sale. This policy, he said, was in effect at the time the University
acquired the mortgage referred to in the letter from CORE.
World's Fair:  The Director of University Relations invited the Regents to attend
Michigan Day  ichigan Day at the World's Fair. He said there would be a University
of Michigan breakfast at the heliport restaurant; an official welcome by
the World's Fair Committee; a reception by the Economic Club of
Detroit followed by an Economic Club luncheon which would be
addressed by Governor George Romney; a ladies' reception and luncheon which would be addressed by Lenore La Fount Romney at
Antoine's restaurant; and an assembly in the Court of States, at which
Governor Romney would make some remarks and at which there would
be a parade by the University of Michigan Marching Band and by the
Michigan State University Marching Band.
The President was pleased to report that the Tecumseh Products
Laboratory was being added to the laboratories already built at Ann
Arbor's Research Park.
Referring to the resolution of the arrangements to build the NASA
facility (p. 284), the President was highly pleased with the University's
expeditious handling of all phases of the request. He reported NASA
highly pleased with and complimentary toward the University.
P. Salinger:  The Secretary reported that Pierre Salinger, Press Secretary to
Honors Convocation Speaker President Kennedy, would address the Honors Convocation, May 8 at
10:30 A.M., in Hill Auditorium. In the afternoon at 1:45 Mr. Salinger
would dedicate the memorial plaque to President Kennedy and to the
conception of the Peace Corps. Mr. Salinger had appeared with John F.
Kennedy on the Union steps when the idea of the Corps had first been
mentioned.
The Secretary said the inscription would read:
"Here at 2:00 A.M. on October 14, 1960, John Fitzgerald Kennedy first defined
the Peace Corps. He stood at the place marked by the medallion and was cheered
by a large and enthusiastic student audience for the hope and promise his idea
gave the world."
The inscription on the medallion would read: "Conception of Peace
Corps first mentioned on this spot October 14, 1960."
Mrs. Kennedy, the Secretary was pleased to say, had been invited
to the dedicatory ceremonies.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.

R. S. Campbell:   The University Attorney reported that the estate of Roy S. Campbell, deceased, is in process of probate in Bath County, Virginia.
Mr. Campbell, who received a Bachelor of Marine Engineering degree
from this University in 1912 and an honorary Doctor of Engineering
degree in 1949, died a resident of Newport News, Virginia, on October 24, 1962. Article Four, (1), (e), of his will contains the following
provision:
"I give, devise and bequeath the remaining two thirds (I5) of the said
residue of my estate to be paid to the University of M\Iichigan Alumni Fund,
Ann Arbor, Michigan in fee simple and absolutely to be used by the said Fund
for any purpose it deems proper."
The First and Merchants National Bank, of Newport News, Virginia, one of
the co-executors of the will, advises that all of the specific bequests have been paid
and that it will distribute the residue as soon as it receives a final clearance from
the Internal Revenue Service. It estimates that the University will receive $169,000
from this estate.


E. L. Knott: Will
S. A. Stewart: Will


Mr. Campbell came originally from Detroit and was at one time
President of the New York Shipbuilding Corporation.
The University Attorney reported that the will of Emma Louise
Knott had recently been offered for probate in King County, Washington. The will provides a gift of $5,000 to the University in the following
language:
"To the UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, now located principally in Ann
Arbor, Michigan, the sum of FIVE TIOUSAND DOLLARS ($5.000.00), for
use in connection with the operation of its Chemistry Department, in memory
of my brother, Albert Jacobson."
Mrs. Knott never attended the University. Her brother, Albert
Jacobson. who was for many years the Chief Chemist of the City of
Seattle, obtained an A.B. degree from this University in 1903.
The University Attorney reported that the will of Sarah A. Stewart
had recently been offered for probate in Butler County, Ohio. Item V
of the will contains the following provision:
"For the purpose of a memorial in honor of my late son, Harry H. Despond,
I give, devise and bequeath all the rest and residue of my estate to the Medical
Department of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, the same to
be used exclusively to conduct research in diseases of the heart and circulatory
system. The receipt of the Secretary or Treasurer of said Department of Medicine
or of the Board of Regents of the University, shall be sufficient to discharge my
executor as to this residuary legacy."
The executor advises that Mrs. Stewart, who was ninety-three years
of age at the time of her death, never attended the University, but her

only son, in whose name the bequest is made, did attend the University
and received an A.B. in 1917 and a LL.B. in 1921. He further estimates
that the University should receive approximately $25,000 from       this
estate.
The President was greatly pleased to present to the Regents for their
action the following resolution as the culmination of many discussions
between University representatives and officials of the Charles Stewart
Mott Foundation of Flint:
WHEREAS, The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation has offered to make a grant
of an amount not in excess of $6,000,000 to cover the cost of construction of the
C. S. Mott Children's Hospital of The University of Michigan subject to certain
conditions stated in a letter dated April 4, 1964, addressed to W. N. Hubbard, Jr.,
M.D., Dean of the Medical School of The University of Michigan, and
WHEREAS, This Board has long recognized the need for a children's hospital
at The University Medical Center and has sought a source of funds for construction of such facility,
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, That the offer of Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation to grant funds up to $6,000,000 to The University of Michigan for
construction and equipment of the C. S. Mott Children's Hospital of The University of Michigan be and it hereby is accepted with sincere thanks, and
Be It Further Resolved, That the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance is authorized and directed to deliver a certified copy of this resolution to
the donor and to execute in the name of The Regents of the University of Michigan any and all documents necessary to make the grant available for construction

Be It Further Resolved, That plans, construction, and the purchase of equipment proceed forthwith at The University of Michigan for a children's hospital to
be known as the C. S. Mott Children's Hospital of The University of Michigan.
The President read to the Regents the following letter from the
Senior Board 1964, presenting the gift of the Class of 1964 to the
University:
April 15, 1964
DEAR PRESIDENT HATCHER,
It is with great pleasure that we the members of Senior Board 1964 acting on
behalf of the members of the Class of 1964, offer this project and gift of $2,000
to the University of Michigan.
This gift is to be used for the construction and installation of an information
center. The final design of the center will be selected in whole or in part from the
designs submitted in Prof. Lahti's design class, by the University's Architects and
Campus Planners.
We recommend that the information center be located in the diagonal area
with final placement left up to the previously stated university officials.
The final design and location of the information center shall meet the approval
of Senior Board 1964. We are hopeful this project will be finished by the end of
the coming summer.
Sincerely,
LAUREN L. BOWLER, President
AL PELHAM, Vice-President
RICHARD MUNT, Treasurer

of the members of his Executive Committee and of the scientific community on
the campus.
B. D. Thuma:      On the recommendation of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs,
Director of the
Residential College the Regents appointed Burton D. Thuma, Ph.D., Director of the
Residential College (p. 286) and Associate Dean of the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts. In making the recommendation the
Vice-President said that this recommendation had the approval of the
Dean and Executive Committee of the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, and had strong support from the faculty.
Dean Thuma has a long history of dedicated service to the University beginning with his appointment as Instructor in Psychology in 1928. During a very
successful career as a teacher, he was a member of the group which organized the
Tutorial Program in the College prior to the war. After a period of military service
he became increasingly involved in administration and has served as Associate
Dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts since 1951.
As Associate Dean, Mr. Thuma was involved in all aspects of college administration: appointments, promotions, budget, building plans, space allocations, counseling, and curriculum. Twice he served the College as Acting Dean in an excellent
fashion.
From the beginning of the discussions, Dean Thuma has been interested in the
residential college and has been one of its most eloquent spokesmen. He has the
administrative experience, the thorough knowledge of the College and the University, and the confidence of the department chairmen that are required if the
College is to succeed. He also has the ability to work effectively with the faculty
members who are excited about the opportunity of experimentation that the
College affords. It is important that plans for the College be formulated carefully
and quickly. We are pleased to have Dean Thuma to turn to for wise and expeditious leadership, so soon after the Regents' decision to proceed.

1964
TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, Ann Arbor, Michigan
THE AFB-MARY B. PATTON AWARD (second prize)
FOR THEIR HALF HOUR RADIO DOCUMENTARY
"THE MANY LIVES OF JOHN TEACHOUT"
This documentary radio program is a thorough, interesting and provocative analysis of the fine positive attributes of a student, blind John Teachout. It shows him
as a musician and lover of jazz, a piano tuner, a recording technician, a good
politician working for his community, a human being and family man. The interview was conducted in a warm professional informal manner that holds attention.
It contains an interesting conclusion. John Teachout the blind politician encourages
sighted people to bring their problems to him; he does not bring problems to them.
The show has a fine sense of humor, and a light and happy tone.
The American Foundation for the Blind is grateful to The University of Michigan
for making this useful tool available for national distribution.
The Regents congratulated Radio Station WUOM on producing the
documentary, which, as it is shown throughout the country should have
an important and positive influence.

Flint Board of   The Regents received a letter from      Claude E. Stout, President of
Education
Proposal  the Flint Board of Education, and discussed in detail the following
resolution of the Flint Board of Education inviting the University to
enrich its program at the Flint College:
3.11 PROPOSAL FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE IN FLINT
Historically, the Board of Education of the School District of the City of
Flint, acting on behalf of the citizens of Flint, has sought to provide wide educational opportunities at all levels.
Compatible with this point of view, the Board of Education, established a
junior college in 1923 to provide post-high school offerings, including the first
two years of a basic collegiate program.
Immediately following the conclusion of World War II, the Board of Education, working with representatives of various groups, carried forward studies
related to the question of whether or not there should be established a four-year
college program in the City of Flint.
The University of Michigan was invited to participate in the above exploratory studies with the result that, with the assistance of the Board of Education
and the Mott Foundation, there was established a two-year upper division college
program on the College and Cultural Center campus.
Since 1956, there have been sporadic discussions of the feasibility and importance of the establishment of a four-year college, with the ultimate goal of a
four-year college working with the existing two-year college to provide a broad
scope of educational opportunity beyond high school not only for the citizens of
the School District of the City of Flint, but also, for the natural Flint metropolitan area.
On December 27, 1962, George V. Gundry, then president of the Flint Board
of Education, appointed a committee to study the needs for higher education in
the Flint area.
During a period of approximately 12 months, the committee carried on
statistical studies, discussions, and explorations; and on February 12, 1964,
released its report and submitted it to the Flint Board of Education.
Since February 12, 1964, further discussions have been held with representative groups within the community, with the result that it is believed the Flint
Board of Education should take the following action.
The following resolution is recommended by Member Bates, chairman of the
Committee to Study the Needs for Higher Education in the Flint Area.
Be It Resolved, That
The Flint Board of Education
a) Receives and approves the report of the Committee to Study Needs for
Higher Education.
b) Transmits the report to the Board of Regents and appropriate administrative officers of The University of Michigan for their study, consideration, and
acceptance.
c) As representatives of the citizens of the City of Flint, warmly invites the
Board of Regents of The University of Michigan to establish a four-year
college in the City of Flint within the structure of the recommendations
transmitted.
d) Continues the Committee on Higher Education to serve as the coordinating
liaison unit in the development of a program, and authorizes the chairman of
the committee to appoint additional members if and when required.
e) Directs the General Superintendent of Community Education to take
appropriate steps to implement plans and programs as they are developed in
cooperation with appropriate representatives of The University of Michigan, and
to determine a date when a plan for a four-year college may become operational.
f) Recognizes the important role of Flint Community Junior College in higher
education; and that appropriate representatives of Flint Community Junior
College will be involved in all planning with respect to the evolution of pro



APRIL MEETING, 1964

grams in higher education; and that the role of Flint Community Junior
College will be an inherent part of any programs which will be developed.
The Regents were pleased to adopt the following statement:                 Flint College:
Resolution on
1. After several years of study and planning jointly by the Flint Board of  Expansion of
Education, the Mott Foundation, and The University of Michigan, the Flint
College of The University of Michigan was launched in 1956 in co-operation with
the Flint Community Junior College.
The success of this operation has been gratifying. It has also suggested other
promising possibilities for a richer development and interchange in this kind of
community setting.
The continued rapid growth in number of Michigan boys and girls requires our
most dedicated and persistent efforts to offer them the best education possible. The
University of Michigan wants to, and feels it must, do all within its capacity and
resources to meet this opportunity and need. It expects to grow. It will increase its
freshman class from its present 3,400. It has been weighing the alternatives of
concentrating growth in Ann Arbor, or growing on the Flint campus as well.
The results of studies so far indicate that, in co-operation with the Flint
Board of Education, the Community College, and others, the University should
enrich its program at the Flint College.
2. The Regents receive the Resolution of the Flint Board, as transmitted under
date of April 9 by Mr. Stout, with great appreciation. They feel encouraged by
this recognition of the work already accomplished, and the invitation to expand
this educational association. They believe that this kind of approach will greatly
strengthen higher education in the state, and, at the same time, orient itself to the
needs of a dynamic community.
3. The Regents, therefore, accept the principle of the proposed co-operative
program and express their concurrence with the views of the Flint Board of
Education that the educational needs of the Flint area as well as those of the
state would be well served by extending the present program of the Flint College
of The University of Michigan to include curricular offerings in the first and
second years. They also agree with the Flint Board of Education in its emphasis
upon the important role of the Flint Community Junior College in the present and
future development of higher education in the Flint area and the wholehearted
interchange and co-operation that can result. They welcome the participation of
representatives of the community college in planning for future development of
higher education in the Flint area.
4. Expansion of the present Flint College of The University of Michigan in a
manner to serve the needs of the state and the area is an appropriate extension of
an existing University program.
The Regents are aware that the Citizens Committee on Higher Education and
the Governor and the Legislature are concerned with the subject of over-all planning and co-ordination of higher education in the state and that it has been
suggested that expansion of the Flint College program might have a bearing upon
these concerns, as do the programs already announced or under consideration by
other universities on their campuses. The Regents wish to assist and co-operate
fully with the Citizens Committee and state authorities and request the University's
executive officers to review with these groups plans which may be developed for
expansion of the Flint College.
5. The Regents express the hope that the proposal made by the Flint Board
can be implemented in time to assist with the large enrollment increase coming in
the fall of 1965 and the immediately succeeding years. To this end, they direct the
University executive officers to proceed as expeditiously as possible, in co-operation
with the Flint Board of Education, to draw up detailed plans for implementing
the proposal made by the Flint Board, and to report back to the Regents as soon
as definite plans are completed.
Each of the Regents reacted favorably and enthusiastically to the
statement and particularly to Point 3.
The President was delighted to give some of the details preceding         President Johnson:
the announcement on April 14 that President Lyndon B. Johnson had             To Speak at
accepted his invitation to be the speaker at the University's 120th           Commencement
Commencement on May 22. Dr. Hatcher explained that President
Johnson had accepted the invitation after an agreement was reached




306


APRIL MEETING, 1964


to advance the date of Commencement from Saturday, May 23, to
Friday, May 22. President Johnson had been unable to accept the
invitation for the 23rd because he had promised to fulfill a commitment made for that date by the late President Kennedy.
Dr. Hatcher said that President Johnson would be the first President
of the United States ever to speak at a University of Michigan
Commencement.
"Operation Michi-    A  report by the Director of University Relations on "Operation
Michigan" was accepted and placed on file.
Sir Eric Ashby:    At the close of the meeting the President was pleased to introduce
Introduced  Sir Eric and Lady Ashby of Cambridge University, where Sir Eric is
Master of Clare College. The President's guests enjoyed their brief
visit with the Regents, who in turn were delighted to welcome them to
the University.
In thanking the President and the Regents for their hospitality,
Sir Eric made the point that it seemed strange to him, coming from a
private university, to report that that university now received 70
per cent of its income from public funds, whereas The University of
Michigan, a public institution from its inception, receives a greater
share of its support from private rather than from public funds.
He believed it very important that his university should mobilize public
opinion behind it and in this sense emulate the American universities
and particularly The University of Michigan in its efforts for public
support as evidenced by the report which the Director of University
Relations had just made.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for The Regents
of the University of Michigan for the month of March, 1964, totaled
$465.81.
The Regents adjourned to meet on Thursday, May 21.

DOCTOR OF ENGINEERING
ERNST WEBER, electrical engineer, President of the Polytechnic Institute of  E. Weber:
Brooklyn, first president of the international Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Honorary Degree
Engineers. Possessing a thorough mastery of contemporary electrical science when
he first came to the United States in 1931, Dr. Weber has since remained in the
forefront of scientific and professional inquiry in that field, himself introducing
highly creative new resources for microwave measurement. The Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, which he has served as research professor, director of research,
and president, has grown with his growth and strengthened with his strength,
extending and diversifying its graduate programs and making important industrial
applications of the discoveries which he has fostered. Through the breadth of his
interests, the generosity of his spirit, and the force of his character, Dr. Weber
became also an influence for unity within his profession and a principal agent in
the merger of competing societies into the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers. Expressing its high esteem for his intellectual, professional, and moral
accomplishments, The University of Michigan respectfully tenders to Ernst Weber
the degree Doctor of Engineering.

L. M. Ainger:    The University Attorney reported that the will of Lucy M. Ainger
will had recently been offered for probate in Wayne County, Michigan. The
Fifth Paragraph of the will provides as follows:
"I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my
property and estate, of which I may die seized or possessed, or to which I may be
entitled at the time of my death, of whatsoever kind or nature, real, personal or
mixed, and wheresoever situate, including all property over which I may have the
power to appoint or dispose of by my Last Will and Testament, to THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, the corporate name of the
University which has principal offices in the county of Washtenaw, State of Michigan, to be held, administered and used by said Regents for the uses and purposes
herein stated, that is to say:
"1. The fund herein created shall be known as THE FRANK B. AND LUCY
M. AINGER FUND.
"2. The said fund shall continue to exist for forty (40) years after it has
been received by the Regents.
"3. The Regents shall use the net income from said fund, together with portions of the principal thereof as hereinafter made available, annually, to provide
scholarships for deserving undergraduate students of the Medical School of The
University of Michigan, the amounts and the recipients of said scholarships to be
recommended by the Dean of said Medical School, such recommendations to be
based upon character, pecuniary need and aptitude to pursue the study of medicine.
"Notwithstanding that the primary purpose of the said fund shall be to provide scholarships as set forth above, in the event the need for such scholarships
ceases to exist in the joint judgment of the Regents and the Dean of the Medical
School, the Regents, acting upon the recommendations of said Dean, may use
said net income and portions of principal as hereinafter made available, to
provide fellowships, or for such other purposes as shall be deemed to contribute
to the advancement of scientific research in the field of medical arts and sciences,
provided that such purposes shall also serve to provide individuals engaged in such
research, opportunities for growth and development as creative scientists, the
amounts and the recipients of said fellowships or other grants to be recommended
by the Dean of the Medical School.
"4. As and when the fund has been administered for twenty (20) years, por'tions of the principal of the fund, as well as the income from the fund shall be
used by the Regents for the purposes hereinbefore stated; said principal to be used
for said purposes at the rate of one-twentieth (1/20th) of said principal during the
twenty-first (21st) year of the administering of said fund, one-nineteenth (1/19th)
of the then remaining principal during the twenty-second (22nd) year of said
administering, one-eighteenth (1/18th) of the then remaining principal during the
twenty-third (23rd) year of said administering, and this pattern (reducing the
denominator of the determining fraction by one (1) each succeeding year) to
be followed during each succeeding year thereafter through the fortieth (40th)
year of said administering, during which fortieth (40th) year, following said
pattern, all of the then remaining principal of said fund shall be used for the
purposes hereinbefore stated."
The attorney for the estate estimates that the University should
receive approximately $200,000 from this estate.
Mrs. Ainger, the widow of Frank B. Ainger, was the former Lucy
M. Alber, who attended the School of Music from 1918 to 1920.
B. W. Kenyon:     The University Attorney reported that the will of Bessie White Kenyon, widow of Associate Professor Emeritus Herbert A. Kenyon, had

Paragraph of the will provides as follows:




MAY MEETING, 1964

"SECOND: I give, devise and bequeath to The Regents of the University of
Michigan the following items of property for the purposes stated:
"1. The Lucy S. C. Stevens Trust Fund in the Rhode Island Hospital Trust
Company of Providence, Rhode Island, I give and bequeath for the establishment
of the 'Herbert A. Kenyon and Bessie W. Kenyon Trust Fund,' the income from
which shall be used for the purchase of books relating to the Theatre, Stage and
Drama, such books to be appropriately marked with a bookplate naming them as
a part of the 'The Herbert A. and Bessie W. Kenyon Dramatic Library.'
"2. The sum of Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars in cash to be designated
and known as the Clinton F. Stevens Fund, created in memory of my father, Clinton F. Stevens, the income from this fund to be used to provide summer camp
opportunities for boys unable to meet the expenses necessary to attendance at the
University of Michigan Fresh Air Camp, or its successors, hereby granting to The
Regents of the University broad discretionary powers in the use of the income so
as to enable said constitutional corporation to carry out the spirit as well as the
provisions of this bequest.
"3. I give and bequeath to The Regents of the University of Michigan my
library for the following uses:
a) All books in my library which may be of use to the Department of
Romance Language shall be transferred to that department.
b) All other books in my library shall go to the General Library of the
University of Michigan.
"4. I give and bequeath my Blue Candelabra to The Regents of the University
of Michigan with the request that they be placed in the Museum of the University."
The attorney for the estate is unable at this time to estimate how
much the University might receive from the Lucy S. C. Stevens Trust
Fund under which Mrs. Kenyon had a power of appointment.
The University Attorney reported that the will of James R. Offield,
LL.B., 1904, had recently been offered for probate in Cook County,
Illinois.
The executor named in the will advises that Mr. Offield died on
April 3, 1964, and that his will contains a bequest for The University
of Michigan in the amount of $5,000.
The University Attorney reported that the will of Gladys K. Olsen
had recently been offered for probate in the County of New London,
Connecticut. Mrs. Olsen was the widow of Laverne Olsen, who received
a degree Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Michigan in 1918. Mrs. Olsen's will gives 10 per cent of the
residue of the estate to The University of Michigan to establish an
endowment fund from which the income may be used for such purposes
as the University deems best for its corporate purposes.
The attorney for the estate estimates that the University will receive approximately $10,000 from this bequest.
The Regents established the Chester B. Slawson Memorial fund as
outlined in a letter dated May 11, 1964, from Howard R. Cottrell,
Chief Accountant, to the Secretary, as follows (p. 278):
DEAR MR. WALTER:
Friends and former students of Professor Chester B. Slawson have contributed
approximately $1,400.00 to establish the Chester B. Slawson Memorial Fund. It
is anticipated that there will be additional gifts and it is the intent of the committee that it will be a continuing fund. The Chester B. Slawson Memorial Fund is
for academic and personal assistance to students in the tradition of Professor
Slawson. The fund is to be administered jointly by Professor E. William Heinrich
and Professor Reynolds M. Denning. It is the further wish of the memorial committee that the amount spent in any fiscal year shall not exceed one-half of the
previous June 1 balance in the account.
Will you please present this proposal at the next meeting of the Board of
Regents and notify Mr. Alfred A. Levinson, Gulf Research and Development

APPENDIX A


REGENTS' CITATION OF HONOR
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison and Erich A. Walter
Voted July 26, 1963 (p. 35)                          Conferred May 8, 1964
PAUL TORY RANKIN, A.M., 1921, Ph.D., 1926; First Assistant Superintendent of Detroit Public Schools. Dr. Rankin embarked on his career in public
education at the ripe age of eighteen, immediately upon graduating from college
in our neighborhood city of Ypsilanti. After gaining experience as a teacher and
school principal in a number of Michigan communities, he joined the Detroit
public school system in 1921 as Assistant Supervisor of Research. He has served
that system in posts of increasing responsibility ever since. From 1938 to 1945 he
was also Professor of Education and Associate Director of the Graduate School of
Wayne University. The scope of his interests and of his service to professional,
civic, and religious agencies is suggested by three titles which he has held: President of the American Educational Research Association, Chairman of the Michigan
School Mental Health Project Committee of the Michigan Society for Mental
'Health, and President of the Detroit Council of Churches. The University esteems
him for the wisdom and tact, and no less for the sheer time and toil, which he
has devoted to the State's largest school system.
Expressing their admiration for his generous personal qualities and their
gratitude for his distinguished ministry to the youth of our State, the Regents
of the University now happily confer on Dr. Rankin their Citation of Honor.
GERRIT VAN ZYL, M.S., 1920, Ph.D., 1924; Chairman of the Department
of Chemistry of Hope College. Since completing his doctoral work here and returning to his undergraduate Alma Mater to teach, Professor Van Zyl has attained
distinction in his own right as a scientist and, vicariously, through the young men
whose careers he has fostered. His research in physical and organic chemistry
has won wide respect, attracting a succession of Frederick Gardner Cottrell grants.
And there is not, perhaps, a college teacher of chemistry in the nation who has
seen more of his students embrace that science as a life's work and contribute
significantly to it. Among the honors accorded him as a mentor of young
chemists has been the Scientific Apparatus Makers' Award in Chemical Education. The University of Michigan, which has received many of his students
into its Graduate School, bases its admiration for him on the most eloquent
testimonies, and is in his peculiar debt.
The Regents of the University take pride and pleasure in offering to
Professor Van Zyl their Citation of Honor.
OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AWARD
Characterization by Erich A. Walter
Voted July 26, 1963 (p. 35)      Awarded posthumously May 8, 1964 (p. 287)
ROBERT GRANVILLE, A.B., 1910, A.M., 1914. After being principal of
the high school at Wayland, Michigan, and teacher of history at Allegan High
School, he returned to the University in 1913 to complete the requirements for
the A.M. degree. In 1914 he joined the faculty of the Ann Arbor High School as
teacher of English and began a career of teaching and administration in that
school which, although it officially ended in 1962, continues to date, but at a
somewhat reduced tempo. The only interruption in his fifty years of teaching came
from 1918 to 1920 when he served in Archangel, Russia, in the U.S. Army with
'the Polar Bears as sergeant in the hospital unit of the 85th Division.
His efforts have all been motivated by his thinking as a teacher. Superb in
the classroom as a scholar of language and of literature, he also developed a full
understanding of his students and of his fellow teachers. His success as adviser
to the school's yearbook, its newspaper, and its literary magazine brought him
into the same relative position to the Michigan Interscholastic Press Association.
He began the Advanced Placement Program for Ann Arbor schools which led to
a summer workshop in advanced placement which attracted teachers throughout
the state. He was a member of the Advisory Board of the Metropolitan Detroit
Bureau of School Services. In 1934 he became a founder in Detroit of the
Michigan Credit Union League. Later he founded the Ann Arbor Teacher Credit
Union.

MAY MEETING, 1964


He has been the recipient of many honors and gifts in tribute to his achievements. The establishment in 1962 of the Robert Granville Award for Excellence in
Composition gave him great pleasure. The gift of an Old Town canoe from his
fellow teachers gave him a special happiness.
Rigorously self-disciplined, he enjoys swimming, canoeing, and walking, and
attributes his phenomenally robust health to his walking the several miles to and
from his work every day. On close questioning, however, he happily discloses that
his spirit has been kept strong and resilient by receiving from the young some of
their boundless energy and hope.
In presenting to Robert Granville their Outstanding Achievement Award, the
Regents of The University of Michigan honor a great teacher who blessed with
fine talents has freely and cheerfully shared them for fifty years with his community.

said, was proceeding on schedule: Fluids Engineering Building Unit II,
University Hospital Central Laboratories, Institute for Social Research
Building, Kresge Medical Research Building Addition, Dearborn Campus Housing, Space Research Building, and North Campus Center.
Short delays had been caused by the construction trades strikes which
fortunately were of short duration.

Housing (Cedar Bend Houses), Northwood Housing Group IV, University Theater Building, Residential College Facilities, East Medical
Center Parking Structure, and Radrick Farms.
Radrick Farms    In reporting on Radrick Farms, the Vice-President said the development of a golf course by The University of Michigan at that site will
be started in the summer. Construction of the course was being made
possible by gifts to the University from an anonymous donor. It was
expected, the Vice-President said, that the 18-hole golf course would
be ready for use by the University faculty and staff in 1967, the year
in which the University will be celebrating its sesquicentennial. The
gifts that are making the golf course possible are a major contribution

The Vice-President for Academic Affairs made special mention of
the reappointment of Professor James C. O'Neill as Chairman of the
Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, and of Professor
James N. Spuhler as Chairman of the Department of Anthropology.
The Vice-President characterized these posts of departmental chairman
as very important posts, particularly when the incumbents are unanimously nominated by the members of their staffs for continuation of
their duties (p. 350).
The Vice-President spoke enthusiastically on behalf of William L.
Hays, who was appointed Associate Dean of the College of Literature,
Science. and the Arts (p. 350). He said, 'This brilliant teacher will
continue as Professor of Psychology in addition to assuming his duties
as Associate Dean."
Reginald F. Malcolmson, M.S.Arch., was appointed Professor of
Architecture and Dean of the College of Architecture and Design,
beginning September 1, 1964, vice Philip N. Youtz, on retirement
furlough.
The Vice-President for Academic Affairs paid high praise to the
special committee of the College of Architecture and Design which had
assisted the administration in nominating Professor Malcolmson for the
deanship. The Vice-President said, "Two issues faced the college and
the University in considering the appointment. The first is the considerable ferment in architectural education today. The second is the problem
of internal organization of the College itself. These include the relationship of the departments to the College and those of the departments
to each other. Both issues involve educational policy and call for
intellectual leadership of a high order. In addition to the careful review
made of possible candidates by the committee from the College, viewpoints and recommendations were sought from the architectural world.
As a result of the recommendation of the committee and of the authorities in the field, Professor Malcolmson, who has been associated with
the Department of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology
since 1949 and who on several occasions has been Director of that
department, was chosen for the deanship. He is himself an excellent
teacher and has the reputation of working most effectively with others."
The Regents, on recommendation of the President, appointed
Michael Radock Vice-President for University Relations, the appointment to become effective July 1, 1964 (R.P., 1960-63, p. 336).

Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
       President Coleman called the meeting to order. She called attention to the mock
race recently completed by the UM solar car, "Quantum," in preparation for the
upcoming World Solar Challenge. She also highlighted the proposal for a new master's
degree in entrepreneurship to be offered jointly by the Ross School of Business and the
College of Engineering. She noted that she and several other University officials had
attended the recent funeral of Betty Ford, wife of former president Gerald R. Ford.
Presentation: University of Michigan Depression Center
       President Coleman introduced Dr. John Greden, founder and executive director
of the University of Michigan Depression Center. Dr. Greden described the history of
the Depression Center, noting that at the time of its founding in 2001, it was the first
comprehensive center in the country. He noted that depression, cardiovascular disease,
and cancer constitute the three most prevalent and financially burdensome disorders in
the world. The goals of this comprehensive center were early detection, developing
better treatments, developing strategies to maintain wellness once achieved, to
overcome stigma, and to catalyze a national network of depression centers. He
described how these goals have largely been achieved, with a large interdisciplinary
cadre of faculty currently associated with the center and a number of early detection
screening programs in place as well as programs aimed at special populations. The
center has also developed successful philanthropy programs and has accomplished its
goal of founding a network of leading depression centers.
       The regents expressed strong support for the work of the Depression Center and
requested that Dr. Greden continue to update the regents as a development campaign is
initiated.

       Regent Ilitch announced the committee membership for 2011-12. The Health
Affairs Committee will consist of Regents Darlow, Deitch, and Newman, with Regent
Darlow serving as chair. The Finance, Audit and Investment Committee will consist of

Committee Reports
       Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Ilitch reported on behalf
of Regent White, chair of the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. She noted
that the committee, consisting of Regents White, Regent Maynard, and Richner had met
that morning with Executive Vice President Slottow, and that President Coleman also
was in attendance. The Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee (Regents
Ilitch and Taylor) attended the portion of the meeting that involved the human capital
report and the annual review of the president's travel and hosting expenses. The 2011
Human Capital Report, which provided updates of a number of key metrics involving
faculty and staff, such as staffing trends, recruitment and retention, and retirement and
financial profiles. Provost Hanlon, Associate Vice President Laurita Thomas, and
University Human Resources Senior Business Analyst Tom Palmer participated in this
discussion. The committee next conducted its annual review of the president's travel
and hosting expenses, with Associate Vice President Rowan Miranda and Executive
Director of University Audits Carol Senneff in attendance. The FAI Committee then
met separately Ms. Senneff to receive the bi-monthly internal update.
       Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor, chair
of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that following its
joint meeting with the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee involving the human
capital report and the president's travel and hosting expenses, the committee discussed
board and committee meeting schedules.
       Health Affairs Committee. Regent Darlow, chair of the Health Affairs
Committee, commented that this committee had completed its first year of operation,
and thanked Regent Deitch for his leadership and hard work as a driving force during
this time. She noted that due to the importance and large scope of the committee's
work, it planned to work closely with the entire board. She noted that the Health
System workforce comprises more than half of the University's faculty and staff, and
its revenues account for nearly 45% of the University's operating revenues, and the
committee allows the Health System to share details behind strategic decisions,
operating budgets, facility plans, and other areas integral to the system's overall
success. She noted that the Health System's direction must continue to make sense
both strategically and financially. "Together," she noted, "the Health System, the
Health Affairs Committee, and the whole board will assess current market conditions
and forecast health care trends as the Health System develops the next stages of its
strategic plans." Regent Darlow reported that today's meeting focused on the
committee's work for the coming year and on various communications and regulatory
matters, noting that the committee expects to bring information to the full board for
review over time as appropriate. She commended Health System management, staff,
and volunteers for the system's "terrific achievement" in maintaining its position as the
14th-ranked health system in the nation in the U.S. News and World Report rankings,
first in the state and in the Detroit area, with most specialty areas being in the top 30 or
higher.
       President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.

       Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for 3
retiring faculty members.
       Steven A. Goldstein, Ph.D., Henry Ruppenthal Family Professor of
Orthopaedic Surgery and Bioengineering and professor of orthopaedic surgery in the
Medical School, professor of biomedical engineering and professor of mechanical
engineering in the College of Engineering, and research professor in the Institute of
Gerontology, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2011.
       Professor Goldstein received his B.S. degree from Tufts University in 1976, and
his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1977 and 1981,
respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1981 as a research
investigator in the Department of Surgery, and was promoted to assistant professor in
1983, associate professor in 1988, and professor in 1992. He was appointed professor
of mechanical engineering and research scientist in 1993 and professor of biomedical
engineering and senior research scientist (research professor) in 1997. He held the
Henry Ruppenthal Family Professorship in Orthopaedic Surgery and Bioengineering
from 1998-2003 and again from 2009-2011.
       Professor Goldstein's research interests ranged from fracture repair and
reconstructive surgery to investigating the mechanisms associated with inherited or
degenerative connective tissue fragility and developing strategies for tissue
regeneration. His findings led to the development of a variety of implants and
instruments, gene-based therapeutics for wound repair, and novel diagnostic
technologies for tissue degradation. Within the Medical School, he served as assistant
dean for research and graduate studies (1993-98) and associate dean for research (1999-
2004). He also headed the Bioengineering Interdisciplinary Program, and played a key
role in its becoming a department in the College of Engineering. In 1989, Professor
Goldstein received the Kappa Delta Award for Excellence in Orthopaedic Research
the highest award given to orthopaedic investigators. In 2005, he received the H.R.
Lissner Medal for career achievement in biomedical engineering from the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, and was elected to the National Academy of
Engineering.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Steven A. Goldstein professor emeritus of orthopaedic surgery,
professor emeritus of biomedical engineering, professor emeritus of mechanical
engineering, and research professor emeritus.

faculty as an assistant librarian in 1979, and was promoted to associate librarian in
1982, and librarian in 1987. She was appointed associate university librarian for public
services in 2008.
       A tireless advocate for the learning, teaching, and research needs of students
and faculty, Ms. MacAdam achieved national recognition for the University Library
through the application of new information service models and the integration of
cutting edge technology. With her unflappable leadership style, she guided the
University Library through multiple waves of transformative new technologies and
changing roles. As head of the Shapiro Undergraduate Library (1987-99) and head of
reference and instruction at the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library (1999-2008), Ms.
MacAdam oversaw a major expansion of the undergraduate library and renovation of
the graduate library, the launch of the University's first institutional web portal in 1994,
and major infrastructure updates to Mirlyn, the library's online catalog, from the
NOTIS to Ex Libris platform, in 2004.
       Ms. MacAdam was an adjunct faculty member in the School of Information and
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, where she taught a variety of
undergraduate and graduate courses. She has dozens of publications and presentations
to her credit, spanning a wide variety of issues. Ms. MacAdam served on the Senate
Assembly and the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA), and on
the Advisory Board on Intercollegiate Athletics, the Board for Student Publications,
and numerous University-wide advisory and search committees. Her awards include
the Association of College and Research Library's Miriam Dudley Instructional
Librarian Award (1996), the University's Librarian Achievement Award (2004), and

active faculty status on June 30, 2011.
       Professor Rees received his B.S. and M.D. degrees from the University of Utah
in 1970 and 1973, respectively. He completed a general surgery internship at the
University of Utah (1973-74), a general surgery residency at Louisiana State University
(1974-77), and a plastic surgery residency and fellowship at Vanderbilt University from
1978-81. After serving on the faculty of Vanderbilt University from 1980-88, he joined
the University of Michigan faculty as an associate professor of surgery in 1988 and was
promoted to professor in 1994. Dr. Rees served as chief of the plastic surgery section
at the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration Medical Center from 1988-2011 and director
of wound care at the University of Michigan Health System from 1997-2008.
       Dr. Rees is recognized nationally as a leader in the fields of plastic surgery,
wound healing, and surgical oncology. His early research in the area of wound
treatment and healing led to six patents for products and techniques to facilitate wound
closure. He has published more than 96 articles, 18 book chapters, and two books. Dr.
Rees encompasses all of the best that is required of an academic surgeon. He provided
a unique clinical expertise within the Section of Plastic Surgery for the treatment and
reconstruction of head and neck cancer problems, melanoma cancer problems, and skin
and soft tissue cancer problems. His research has been recognized by extramural

10 items:
Purchase of Services from Monkey Shavers Productions
        The regents approved purchase of video production services from Monkey
Shavers Productions by the School of Natural Resources. Because Josh Guillot, the
owner of Monkey Shavers Productions, is the spouse of Shelie Miller, a University of

information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
        1. Parties involved in the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
           the University of Michigan Department of Internal Medicine-Gastroenterology and

Purchase of CDs from Melisa Schuster
        The regents approved purchase by the Department of Psychiatry of CDs from

        The regents authorized the Zell Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies at the
Ross School of Business ("ZLI") to subsidize a Marcel Gani Internship ("MGI") at
Sakti3, Inc. ("Sakti3"). Because Marie Sastry, a University of Michigan employee, is
also CEO and stockholder of Sakti3, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
        1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan, ZLI, and
           Sakti3.

        Sec. 1.06. Officers of the Board (revised June-2004 July 2011)
        A.     President and Secretary of the Board
                The president of the university will preside at meetings of the board, without the right
                to vote. The vice president and secretary of the university will act as secretary of the
                board.
        B.     Chair and Vice Chair of the Board
                 1. Selection:

                         a) There will be a chair and vice chair of the board, each of whom will serve
                             a one-year term commencing on July 1 of each year and ending on June
                             30 of the succeeding year. This process will commence on July 1, 2004.
                             The positions of chair and vice chair will be based on seniority and will
                             rotate through the board based on seniority.
                         b) The chair will be the board member with most seniority on the board, and
                             the vice chair will be the board member with second most seniority on the
                             board. Board members must have served for at least one year to be
                             eligible to become chair or vice chair. The vice chair will automatically
                             become chair after serving one term as vice chair. If two or more board
                             members have equal seniority, the chair or vice chair, as applicable, will
                             be chosen through a random selection process. At a meeting before July 1
                             of each year the board will take a public vote confirming the officers for
                             the subsequent year.
                         c) A board member who has served as chair or vice chair is ineligible to
                             serve again in that capacity until all other eligible members of the board
                             have served or forfeited the opportunity to serve. If the vice chair elects
                             not to serve as chair, or the board member next eligible to serve as vice
                             chair elects not to serve as vice chair, then he or she forfeits the
                             opportunity to serve as chair of vice chair until all other members of the
                             board have served in such capacity or forfeited the opportunity to serve.
                         d) The chair and/or vice chair may be removed by vote of at least six
                             members of the board. If the chair is removed as chair by vote of the
                             board, resigns, or otherwise is unavailable or unwilling to serve as chair
                             for the remainder of the term, the vice chair will automatically assume
                             that position for the remainder of the term and the board member with the
                             next most seniority will automatically become vice chair for the remainder
                             of the term. If a vice chair is removed as vice chair by vote of the board,
                             resigns, or otherwise is unavailable to or unwilling to serve as vice chair
                             for the remainder of the term, the board member with the next most
                             seniority will automatically serve as vice chair for the remainder of the
                             term. If two or more board members have equal seniority to fill a vacancy,
                             the chair or vice chair, as applicable, will be chosen through a random

Comments from Regent Taylor

        Regent Taylor noted that he is on the board of directors, the executive
committee, and finance committee of Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Michigan. This raises

Presentation: "Snapshots of UM Sustainability"
       President Coleman introduced Andrew Berki, manager of the Office of Campus
Sustainability. He introduced three students, Samantha Schiebold, Matthew Friedrichs,

Graham Environmental Sustainability Scholar, described a project he undertook in the

case study of neighborhoods in southwest Detroit. Ph.D. student Jose Alfaro described
"Sustainability Without Borders," a project he co-founded that works in Liberia, in
western Africa, to implement "circular economies," and that is expanding to develop a
community of practitioners who will "live" sustainability and train others in these
practices.
       Mr. Berki observed that a structure of strong administrative support has
developed on campus that encourages collaboration among students, faculty, staff, and
the administration to develop a strong and continuing focus on sustainability.

Brehm Tower, a clinical and research facility, among other gifts. A conversation with
the Brehms then ensued, in which they explained how they became motivated to pursue
their various philanthropic endeavors at the University of Michigan.
       Regents Newman and Ilitch expressed the sentiments of the board by thanking
the Brehms for sharing their personal stories and connections to the University and for
bringing the experience of donors so "close to home." President Coleman noted that
the programs sponsored by the Brehms through the Brehm Center for Diabetes
Research have set a singular example of what individuals can do to change a paradigm
in the area of scientific research.

President's Salary
       Regent Taylor reviewed some of President Coleman's accomplishments in
2010-2011, noting that she has redoubled the University's economic development
efforts and has expanded the University's reach across the state, the nation, and the
world. Under her direction, major capital building projects have been completed on
budget and on time, and a campus-wide sustainability effort has been undertaken. He
said that she has continued to push the envelope of academic excellence by creating
new interdisciplinary clusters of faculty and hiring additional faculty members to
maintain appropriate class size. Regent Taylor pointed also to President Coleman's
efforts at maintaining the physical plant through numerous building renovations that
have occurred across campus in recent years. Nationally, President Coleman continues
to be a leader in higher education, including her upcoming service as chair of the
executive committee of the Association of American Universities.
       Regent Taylor commented that all of these activities "put us in the place where
we like to be-the leaders and the best." Therefore, he moved the President Coleman's
salary be increased by 2.75%, or $15,678, effective August 1, 2011. Regent White
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
       President Coleman stated that she is "deeply grateful, but that none of this
happens without the tremendous team that I've got." Noting that she and her husband

        Rosemary R. Berardi, Pharm.D., professor of pharmacy, College of

1963, completed a residency at Albany Medical Center in 1967, and received her
Pharm.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1968. She joined the University
of Michigan as an instructor in the College of Pharmacy in 1969. She was promoted to
assistant professor in 1970, associate professor in 1975, and professor in 1994.
Throughout her career, Professor Berardi also served as a clinical pharmacist at the

        Professor Berardi has an outstanding reputation in the area of gastrointestinal
and liver diseases. Her teaching, practice, and clinical research have focused on the


65






September Meeting, 2011


treatment of acid-related diseases, and she has presented her work through numerous
publications and presentations. An extremely dedicated educator, she was chosen as
the first recipient of the College of Pharmacy's Outstanding Teacher of the Year Award
in 1999, and received the American College of Clinical Pharmacy's Education Award
in 2005. Professor Berardi was the founding chair of the American College of Clinical

She is a recipient of The Ohio State University College of Pharmacy Distinguished
Alumni Award.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished pharmacy educator by naming Rosemary

       David J. Hart, A.M.L.S., senior associate librarian, Frances Willson Thompson
Library, University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on April 29,
2011.
       Mr. Hart received his A.B. degree from the University of Michigan-Flint in 1971
and his A.M.L.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1975. He joined the
University of Michigan-Flint faculty as an assistant librarian in 1977, and was promoted
to associate librarian in 1982 and senior associate librarian in 2001.
       Mr. Hart played a key role in the transformation of the University of Michigan-
Flint library services from paper-oriented to digital, including the automation of catalog
processing and transitioning from paper to digital records for new books. As head of
technical services since 1992, Mr. Hart led a multi-year project to convert the
bibliographic records of several hundred thousand older books from print to digital
formats. These efforts enabled the Thompson Library to include its entire holdings in
the University Library's Mirlyn catalog in March 1994. Mr. Hart then continued his
leadership in automation by overseeing the introduction of online order-pay-receipt for
new books through collaboration with the University Library's acquisitions systems.
       While Mr. Hart's work was quiet and behind-the-scenes, it was central to the
academic mission of the University. His leadership in helping build the Mirlyn
research catalog supported not only current faculty and students, but future generations
of researchers. Mr. Hart served for a number of years on the University Library's
Metadata Records Committee, the Aleph Service Pack Group, and the Resource
Description and Access Task Force. He was a member of the American Library
Association and the Michigan Library Association.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming David J. Hart
senior associate librarian emeritus.

development of an extensive law review for pharmacy students, which is vital to their
success on the pharmacy board certification examinations. In recognition of his
commitment to teaching, he received the College of Pharmacy Student Appreciation

pharmacy student and faculty exchange program has grown significantly. He has
served as a mentor for numerous pharmacy students and residents, and his sustained

learning environments in which students find solutions to important intellectual
questions, explore phenomena, collaborate with each other, and use learning tools.
Professor Krajcik examines the depth of student understanding that develops in these
environments, and explores and finds solutions to challenges that teachers face in
carrying out such complex instruction. In collaboration with colleagues from
Northwestern University, Michigan State University, Columbia University, and others,
Professor Krajcik, is a principle investigator in a materials development project,
IQWST, funded by the National Science Foundation, that aims to design, develop, and

       Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted two memorials for active
faculty members.
       The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Daniel H. Hill, Ph.D., research associate professor at the Institute for
Social Research. Professor Hill died on July 10, 2011 at the age of 63.
       Following his service with the U.S. Army in Vietnam, Professor Hill received
his B.A. degree from the University of North Carolina in 1971, and his M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from the University of Michigan in 1975 and 1977, respectively. Professor Hill
joined the faculty of the Institute for Social Research (ISR) in 1977 as an assistant
research scientist in the Survey Research Center (SRC), and was promoted to associate
research scientist in 1988. In 1989 he took a leave to serve as director of the Survey
Research Institute at the University of Toledo. He returned to ISR in 1994 as a
program manager on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and associate research
professor in the SRC.
       Professor Hill possessed a great and deep appreciation for economics and
sampling; he strove to model the world as it was, not conforming to a rational model.
His research activities revolved around data quality analysis and the analysis of panel
attrition problems. He collaborated on research involving modeling subjective
probabilities, uncertainty and cognition, and was involved with programming and
evaluating the econometric models. He also served as a faculty member of the annual
Summer Institute in Survey Research Techniques. Later in his career, he focused on
overseeing the processing and dissemination of the HRS core and supplemental data.
Professor Hill was awarded an American Statistical Association/NSF Census
Fellowship and was a member Phi Beta Kappa and Delta Omicron Epsilon. He served
as chair of the Survey Methods Division Committee on the Survey of Income and
Program Participation of the American Statistical Association in 1996.
       Professor Hill will be remembered for his hearty chuckle, his kindness and
curiosity, and his courage in the face of his disease. As we mourn his loss, our
condolences go to his wife, Professor Paula Malone, his stepchildren, Matthew Bracy
and Meagan Hansen, and his grandson, William.

       The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of MaryFran R. Sowers, Ph.D., John G. Searle Professor of Public Health
and professor of epidemiology in the School of Public Health, professor of internal
medicine and professor of obstetrics and gynecology in the Medical School, and
research professor in the Reproductive Sciences Program. Professor Sowers died on
July 17, 2011 at the age of 64.
       Professor Sowers received her B.S. degree from Emporia State University in 1968,
her M.S. degree from Oklahoma State University in 1973, and her Ph.D. degree from the
University of Iowa in 1984. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
professor in 1987, and was promoted to associate professor in 1992 and professor in 1996.
She was appointed associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology in 1995 and was
promoted to professor in 2000, and became a research professor in 1996 and professor of
internal medicine in 1999. She was appointed John G. Searle Professor of Public Health in
2005.

September Meeting, 2011


       Professor Sowers was an internationally renowned epidemiologist whose
research in two interrelated areas, the clinical presentation of diseases and women's
health, placed her at the forefront of her field. Her groundbreaking studies in the areas
of bone health, osteoarthritis, reproductive aging, and physical functioning contributed
substantially to the development of women's health into a major discipline. Her
research was characterized by originality, precision, and integrity, and reflected her
view that disease prevention efforts can be more appropriately focused through a
comprehensive understanding of normal physiological processes and divergences from
those processes. She was renowned for her unique insights into the ways that different
diseases can arise from variations of the same underlying process. Professor Sowers
founded and for many years directed the Michigan Initiative for Women's Health, an
interdisciplinary organization of U-M faculty, staff, and students with interests in
women's health. Together with her path-breaking research, Professor Sowers's work
with the initiative was instrumental in placing Michigan at the forefront of a worldwide
revolution in women's health care, research, and training. A gifted teacher, Professor
Sowers mentored and served as principal advisor to more than 50 master's and 25
Ph.D. students.
       As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our sincere
condolences to her husband, Ray Sowers, and her son, Paul.

Statute.    The   following   information   is provided   in  compliance    with   statutory
requirements:
        1. The parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and

            performance for the project is approximately one (1) year. The amount of funding
            support is anticipated to be $13,136. The agreement includes a provision for
            extensions of the time period and scope of work. University procedures for approval
            of these changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest review will be
            done as appropriate.
        3. The pecuniary interests of Jerome Lynch arise from his status as partial owner of

Master Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and Arbor Research
Collaborative for Health

        The regents approved a master research agreement with Arbor Research
Collaborative for Health ("ARBOR") which will allow the University to support
research projects and use facilities of the University for projects that will be described
from time to time related to its mission. The roles of the University employees in each
project will be described in a project statement and approved conflict of interest
management plans. Because Dr. Robert Merion and Dr. Robert Wolfe, University of
Michigan employees, are also president and member of the board of directors of
ARBOR (Merion) and vice president of biostatistics at ARBOR (Wolfe), this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
        1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Arbor
            Research Collaborative for Health.
        2. The University will enter a Master Agreement with the Company that will cover
            standard procedures for performance of projects as well as provisions implementing
            University and federal policies related to intellectual property and publication. The
            Master Agreement will cover an initial five-year period with a total authorization not
            to exceed $15,000,000. The University will use standard sponsored project
            accounting procedures to determine the cost of each project. Budgets will be
            reviewed and approved by authorized representatives of each department and
            school/college where projects are to be performed. The Master Agreement will allow
            the University and the Company to specify projects that the University will conduct
            under terms of the master agreement. Since sponsored projects are often amended,
            the Master Agreement includes provisions for changes in time, amount, and scope of
            each supported project. University procedures for approval of each project will be
            followed and additional conflict of interest review will be done as appropriate on a
            project-by-project basis.
        3. Dr. Merion and Dr. Wolfe have no pecuniary interest in this master agreement.

("Company") to allow the Company to subcontract a portion of the work of a STTR
Phase I project to the University under the direction of Professor Anastasios John Hart,
a University of Michigan employee. Because Professor Hart is also a partial owner of
the Company, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
        1. The parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
            Absolute Nano, Inc.


79






September Meeting, 2011

            performance for the project is approximately one (1) year. The amount of funding
            support is anticipated to be $40,000. Since research projects are often amended, the
            agreement includes a provision for changes in time, amount, and scope of supported
            projects. University procedures for approval of these changes will be followed and
            additional conflict of interest review will be done as appropriate.
        3. The pecuniary interest of Professor Hart arise from his status as partial owner of
            Absolute Nano, Inc.

Amendment to Master Agreement between the University of Michigan and Michigan
Critical Care Consultants, Inc.

        The regents approved an amendment to a master agreement with Michigan
Critical Care Consultants, Inc. ("Company") to enable the University to participate in
additional research efforts beyond the funding level approved in November 2007.
Because Dr. Bartlett, a University of Michigan employee, is also part-owner and

            exceed $2,000,000. The University will use standard sponsored project accounting
            procedures to determine the cost of each project. Budgets will be reviewed and
            approved by authorized representatives of each department and school/college where
            projects are to be performed. The amendment will allow the University and the
            Company to continue to specify projects that the University will conduct under the
            terms of the Master Agreement. Since research projects are often amended, the
            Master Agreement includes provisions for changes in time, amount, and scope of
            each supported project. University procedures for approval of each project will be
            followed and additional conflict of interest review will be done as appropriate.
        3. The pecuniary interests of Dr. Bartlett arise from his status as part-owner and
            member of the scientific advisory board of the Company.

up from $6.6 billion in FY 2010. She pointed out that over the past five years, the

        Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for 5
retiring faculty members.
        Kathryn M. Anderson-Levitt, Ph.D., professor of anthropology and former
dean of the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters, University of Michigan-Dearborn,
retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2011.
       Professor Anderson-Levitt received her B.A degree from the University of
Southern California in 1974, and her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University
in 1977 and 1982, respectively. She joined the University of Michigan-Dearborn
faculty as an assistant professor in 1984, and was promoted to associate professor in
1990, and professor in 1996. She served as associate dean (2001-03), interim dean
(2003-04), and dean (2004-10) of the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters (CASL).
       Professor Anderson-Levitt's scholarship has earned national and international
recognition. Her research interests include educational reform in a global context,
schoolteachers' cultures for teaching, gender, and schooling in West Africa, and
cultural models of mental retardation. She published widely in these areas, and from
1994-2000, she was editor of the Anthropology and Education Quarterly, the journal of
the Council on Anthropology and Education. During her tenure as associate dean,
Professor Anderson-Levitt led the development of new undergraduate programs,
managed college-wide programs, and led college-wide assessment efforts. As dean,
she developed the First-Year Seminar Program and expanded gender-related initiatives,
including the CASL Student Outreach and Academic Resources (SOAR) and Women
in Leadership and Learning (WILL) programs. Her leadership was pivotal in re-
structuring the humanities department and in reorganizing the CASL budgeting process.
She was a strong advocate for diversity on campus.
        The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar, educator, and administrator for
her dedicated service by naming Kathryn M. Anderson-Levitt professor emerita of
anthropology.

            assignment of University employees, is obligated or contemplated under the
            agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees and indemnification apply, and the
            contract may be amended by consent of the parties, such as adding related
            technology. University procedures for approval of these changes will be followed
            and additional conflict of interest review will be done as appropriate.
        3. The pecuniary interests of Eugene Daneshvar arise from his ownership interest in the
            Patent Rights.

noting the death in October 2011 of Regent Emeritus Deane Baker.
Statement by Regent Ilitch
       Regent Ilitch made the following statement on behalf of the Board of Regents:
"The regents wholeheartedly support President Coleman's recent statement regarding
Penn State. Over the coming months, we intend to use this tragic situation as a catalyst
for a thoughtful reexamination of our institutional values, our culture, and our
priorities."
Presentation: "Expect Respect" Public Service Announcements
       Vice President Harper introduced four students: Josh Buoy, Chris Duncan,
Stephanie Hamel, and Rodney Hyduk, whose company, Filmic Productions, had been

theme. The students discussed the process of producing the films and screened each
one.

University Unions internal audit follow up, was discussed with Vice President Harper,
Associate Vice President Miranda, Associate Vice Presidents Ruhlman and Anturkar,
and Brent Haase, internal controls compliance manager. The second topic, internal

       Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor, chair
of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that he and
Regent Ilitch had received an update from Provost Hanlon on a number of various
faculty-related issues. The committee also met with Martin Philbert, dean of the School
of Public Health. Regent Taylor reported that this school is a national leader on a
number of measures of quality, and the committee would like to have Dean Philbert
report on the school at a formal board meeting. The final agenda item was a discussion
with Kate Barald, chair of SACUA, about that body's annual report.
       Health Affairs Committee. Regent Darlow, chair of the Health Affairs
Committee, reported that Regents Deitch and Newman had joined her at the meeting,

       President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
       Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of October 13, 2011.
       Reports. The Investment Report, Plant Extension Report, and University
Human Resources Reports were submitted on behalf of Executive Vice President

       Litigation Report. Vice President Scarnecchia submitted the Litigation Report.
       Research Report. Vice President Forrest submitted the Report of Awards
Established, July 1, 2011 - October 31, 2011.
       University of Michigan Health System. There was no additional report
regarding the University of Michigan Health System.
       Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper noted that two residence
hall renewal projects were on today's agenda: Vera B. Baits Houses II, and East
Quadrangle. She reported that the closure of these two halls would not create an
overall shortage of beds in 2012-2013, and all first-year students who desire to live in
on-campus housing would be accommodated. She noted that East Quad houses 850
students, the Residential College, and the Michigan Community Scholars Program, and
the schematic design for its renovation was being presented that day.

November Meeting, 2011


       Vice President Harper observed that officials have been working hard to
enhance the vibrancy and appeal of North Campus. The proposed renewal of Vera B.
Baits II will improve and enhance the infrastructure and the community living spaces.
She noted that the Baits II renewal is even more important in light of the decision to
discontinue the use of Baits I as a housing facility. The East Quad and Baits II projects
are both included in the Residential Life Initiative.
       Regent Newman commented that she would like to see a longer-term strategic
plan for the entire housing system, including all current residence halls and quality of
life components such as recreation centers. She said she does not think the University
is devoting enough "attention to or solutions for student life, whether it's a freshman or
a married couple, with or without children." She pointed out that it is important to our
competitive position to address these issues.
       Vice President Harper said she agreed with Regent Newman's concerns, and
that there are plans to bring forward a proposed housing plan that will address these
issues, including residential life, recreational sports, and other issues related to student
life. Regent Newman noted that because there are no specific funding streams directed
to residential life areas, it does not receive enough attention. Thus, as a board member,
she believes it is important to call attention to these areas.
       In response to a question from Regent Richner about how next year's housing
needs would be addressed, Vice President Harper noted that Northwood III would be
upgraded and the first year living/learning experience that is already a part of
Northwood I and II would be expanded to Northwood III. In addition, Alice Lloyd
would be coming back on line. Officials are working with the Residence Hall
Association to determine how to accommodate the remaining 300 students for whom
spaces have not yet been identified.
       Regent Deitch noted that while the University does the best it can with the
existing residence hall stock, it really needs to focus on building more facilities that are
of a caliber equal to that of North Quad. He urged consideration of public/private
partnerships to accomplish this.
       A discussion then followed about the perception of North Campus as an
undesirable location in which to live. Vice President Harper pointed out that the main
challenge for students living on North Campus is being able to go back and forth to
Central Campus in a reasonable amount of time. The pros and cons of housing students
on North Campus whose classes are mostly held there was discussed. It was noted that
many classes taken by students in schools housed on North Campus are LS&A classes
held on main campus, and that consideration should be given to moving more LS&A
classes to North Campus. Regent White pointed out that many students enrolled in
colleges housed on North Campus, such as those in the College of Engineering, might
not find it desirable to stay on North Campus for most of their classes.
       Vice President Harper and President Coleman thanked the board for expressing
their concerns about improving the student residential and social experience. It was
agreed that these issues, including housing, transportation, meal service, and other areas
important to student life, would be brought back for discussion.

        University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little commented on how
pleased he was that the Dearborn campus is part of the Michigan Corporate Relations

winning Yemeni human rights activist, who spoke to a large audience of campus and
community members, and reported about the "E-Cities" conference held on campus.

        Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for two
retiring faculty members.

        Terry J. Brown, M.L.A., professor of landscape architecture in the School of
Natural Resources and Environment, retired from active faculty status on October 31,
2011.
        Professor Brown received his B.S.L.A. degree from the University of Wisconsin
in 1969 and his M.L.A. degree from        Harvard University in 1972.      He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1972. He was appointed instructor in
1973, and was promoted to assistant professor in 1974, associate professor in 1977, and
professor in 1998.
        Professor Brown's research interests have focused most recently on suburban
ecosystem management, including how people perceive and value the urban forest,
introducing technology into the classroom, universal design, geographic information
systems, the Americans with Disabilities Act, land use planning, and public

November Meeting, 2011


participation in the design process. In his academic and scholarly work, he is a
committed advocate for upholding and enhancing the rights of people with disabilities
to participate in their communities. He incorporates universal design principles in his
landscape architecture and site planning courses and in professional activities that focus
on accessibility issues.
       Professor Brown's demeanor, always upbeat and receptive to the concerns of
others, has been ideal for his chosen profession of teaching and sharing his knowledge
with others. His genuine interest in his students' welfare enables him to understand
their needs and suggest sound and appropriate advice, making him an influential mentor
to many former students. His attitude, achievements and ability to adapt to adverse
conditions is an inspiration to all, and his philosophy of life has inspired many of his
graduate students and colleagues to perform well beyond their initial expectations.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated service by
naming Terry J. Brown professor emeritus of landscape architecture.

       Michael F. Foran, Ph.D., professor of accounting, College of Business, the
University of Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active faculty status on August 31,
2011.
       Professor Foran received his B.S. degree from the University of Arizona in
1967, his M.A.S. degree from the University of Illinois in 1968, and his Ph.D. degree
from the University of Washington in 1972. Between 1972 and 2001, he served on the
faculties of the University of Montana, the University of Texas at Arlington, Southern
Methodist University, Oklahoma State University, and Wichita State University. He
joined the University of Michigan-Dearborn faculty as an associate professor in 2001,
and was promoted to professor in 2005.
       Professor Foran was a dedicated teacher with high standards who demanded
superior performance and promoted a culture of cooperative learning in the Department
of Accounting and Finance. His administrative assignments included service as acting
chair (2002-03) and chair (2003-06) of the Department of Accounting and Finance, and
associate dean of external relations and undergraduate programs (2005-06). He was a
member of the Michigan Association of Certified Public Accountants (MACPA) Task
Force, and served on the editorial review boards for Issues in Accounting Education,
the American Accounting Association National Meeting, and the American Accounting
Association Midwest Region. He received the MACPA's Distinguished Accounting
Educator Award in 2006.
       The Regents now salute this dedicated scholar, educator, and administrator for
his dedicated service to the university by naming Michael F. Foran professor emeritus
of accounting.

       Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted memorials for two faculty
members.
       The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Charles A. Reynolds, M.S., senior associate librarian, Music Library,
University Library, and adjunct lecturer in the School of Music, Theatre, & Dance. Mr.
Reynolds died on October 2, 2011, at age 49.


130






November Meeting, 2011


       Mr. Reynolds earned a Bachelor of Music degree in organ performance from
Oberlin College Conservatory of Music in 1984, a Master of Music degree from Yale
University School of Music in 1987, and a Master of Science degree in library science
from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1991. He joined the University
of Michigan faculty as an assistant librarian in 1993, and was promoted to associate
librarian in 1995 and senior associate librarian in 2000. He was appointed interim head
of the Music Library in 2001, and had served as head of the Music Library since 2002.
He was also an adjunct lecturer in the Department of Musicology in the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance, where he taught a class on the bibliography of music.
       Mr. Reynolds was a valued colleague and friend who had a distinguished career
in the University Library and the School of Music, Theatre & Dance. He was also an
accomplished musician who served the community as a professional organist, choir
director, and jazz musician. Mr. Reynolds contributed generously to both the
advancement of the Music Library and more broadly to the library and information
profession through his longtime involvement in the Music Library Association and
numerous other professional activities.
       As we mourn the loss of this distinguished colleague, our heartfelt condolences
go to his wife, Rebecca Price, a librarian in the University Library, and members of his
family.

       The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Galen B. Toews, M.D., professor of internal medicine and chief of the
Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Medical School. Professor Toews
passed peacefully from his battle with prostate cancer on October 12, 2011.
       Professor Toews received his B.A. degree from Tabor College in 1967 and his
M.D. degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1971. Following completion of his
medical internship and internal medicine residency at the Parkland Memorial Hospital
in Dallas, Texas (1971-74), he served as a medical officer at the United States Army
Hospital in Fort Polk, Louisiana from 1974-76. He completed fellowships in
pulmonary medicine and immunology at the University of Texas Health Science Center
from 1976-79, and served on the faculty of that institution from 1979-87. Professor
Toews joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1987 as associate professor and
chief of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, and was promoted to
professor in 1991. He served as associate dean for research in the Medical School from
2006-08.
       During his 24 years at the helm of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care
Medicine, Professor Toews expanded the division from 10 faculty members to 47, and
the division became one of the top-ranked pulmonary divisions in the US News and
World Report rankings. He mentored multiple junior faculty, some of who now lead
pulmonary divisions elsewhere. With his expertise in lung diseases, he was a sought-
after clinician and an internationally recognized researcher, who published 47 book
chapters and over 216 peer-reviewed manuscripts on the pulmonary fibroproliferative
response to injury. Professor Toews was a highly regarded speaker, who lectured
internationally and testified before the U.S. Congress on pulmonary issues. His
research was funded continuously by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for 30
years. Professor Toews was awarded the Michigan Thoracic Society's Bruce H.

Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Development, Ann Arbor Campus
        Provost Hanlon submitted the response of the Ann Arbor campus to a request
from the State Budget Office regarding the 2013 budget development process. He
noted that the request emphasizes the University's unwavering effort to cut costs, and
the campus's continuing efforts to generate entrepreneurial activity on campus and
stimulate growth of the regional economy, and responds to the state's request for input
on how to structure formula funding for universities, which is a change that the state is
considering.
        A discussion followed about proposed changes in the state's funding
mechanism for higher education, through which higher education would be funded
from the "school aid" fund that also provides funding for K- 12 education and
community colleges. Regent Taylor also expressed concern about the proposal to
establish a performance funding formula for allocating funding for higher education.
Vice President Wilbanks reviewed the recent history and current status of higher
education funding and noted that the University has expressed concern to the legislature
about these issues. Provost Hanlon agreed that because of the varying missions of the
state's public higher education institutions, formula funding "becomes very difficult to
imagine, and we bring up some of these points in our request."


136






November Meeting, 2011


       Vice President Wilbanks observed that one of the challenges of formula funding
is that consistency and predictability that institutions rely on in planning their budgets
become very problematic in the formula funding approach to the appropriations
process. Regent Richner also expressed concern about the University's maintaining its
AAA bond rating if the funding process were to become inconsistent and unreliable.
President Coleman pointed out that University officials have gone to great lengths to
express their concerns about this issue to legislators, budget officials, and the governor,
especially in light of the fact that funding has decreased by 30% in real terms during the
past ten years.
       Regent Taylor pointed out that the response to the state budget office does not
express the University's concerns about the possible change to a formula funding
mechanism. He urged the provost, president, and chancellors to consider adding
language that would add such language to the request.
       Regent Ilitch moved approval of the Fiscal Year 2013 Ann Arbor campus
budget development letter to the state budget director. Regent White seconded the
motion, with the caveat that language be added to the letter expressing the concerns
about formula funding that have been expressed during this discussion. The vote was
then taken, and the motion as restated by Regent White was approved.
Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Development, Dearborn Campus
       Chancellor Little commented that the Dearborn campus's letter expresses
specific concerns about formula funding proposals and offers alternative methodology.
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Ilitch, the regents unanimously
approved the proposed Fiscal Year 2013 budget development letter for the Dearborn
campus, with language to be added expressing the concerns about a formula funding
that have been expressed during the meeting discussion.
Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Development, Flint Campus
       Chancellor Person observed that formula funding would also put the Flint
campus at a disadvantage. On a motion by Regent Darlow, seconded by Regent
Newman, the regents unanimously approved the proposed Fiscal Year 2013 budget
development letter for the Flint campus, with language to be added expressing the
concerns about a formula funding that have been expressed during the meeting
discussion.
Public Comments
       The regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Douglas Smith, alumnus, on sexual harassment by student athletes; Stephen
Raiman, student and founder of Students Against GSRA Unionization, on GSRA
unionization; and Courney Mercier, student and founder of Michigan Student-Athletes
for Sustainability, on sustainability in the Athletic Department.

       Provost Hanlon next noted that University of Michigan faculty receive many

new constitution in 2010, three distinct branches of government-legislative, judicial,
and  executive-were      created.   The  Central Student Government represents every
student at the University of Michigan, making it the "central" voice for students. This
final stage of transition to the new constitutional structure is the name change, which

        Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for ten
retiring faculty members.

        Ronald F. Fleming, Ph.D., professor of nuclear engineering and radiological
sciences in the College of Engineering, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 2011.
        Professor Fleming received his B.S. degree from the University of Washington
in 1959, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1961 and
1975, respectively. Between 19'78 and 1989, he was employed by the National Bureau
of Standards, as a staff physicist in the Center for Analytical Chemistry (1978-89) and a
group leader in the Nuclear Methods Group (1984-1989). He joined the University of


157






December Meeting, 2011


Michigan faculty in 1989 as professor and director of the Michigan Memorial Phoenix
Project in 1989.
       While still a graduate student at Michigan, Professor Fleming became aware of
the excitement around a new technique being developed called neutron depth profiling
(NDP). Realizing that both the Bureau's reactor and its charge to support American
industry were ideally matched to the unique capability of NDP, Professor Fleming
proposed that a state-of-the-art NDP facility be built at the National Bureau of
Standards [now the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]. The
facility came online in 1982. For this work, Professor Fleming and R. Gregory
Downing were awarded the Bureau's Applied Research Award in 1986. As director of
the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project (MM-PP) from 1989-2000, Professor Fleming
was responsible for both the scientific research supported by the MM-PP and the safe
operation of the Ford Nuclear Reactor. After stepping down as the MM-PP director,
Professor Fleming spent a sabbatical term at the 2 MW research reactor at the
Technical University of Delft, the Netherlands, working in the nuclear analysis group.
This has contributed to the ongoing NIST-Delft-Ann Arbor collaboration in neutron
science.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Ronald F.
Fleming professor emeritus of nuclear engineering and radiological sciences.

       John E. Fornaoss, Ph.D., professor of mathematics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status December 31, 2011.
       Professor Fornoss received his Cand.Mag. and Cand.Real. degrees from the
University of Oslo in 1968 and 1970, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Washington in 1974. After serving on the faculty at Princeton University
from 1974-90, he joined the University of Michigan faculty as a professor of
mathematics in 1990. From 1996-2011, he held the additional title of Frederick W.
Gehring Collegiate Professor of Mathematics.
       Professor Fornoss studies multivariate complex analysis. His early work did
much to clarify the central notion of pseudoconvexity, and he developed many deep
and useful new tools, and stunning counterexamples, that forced a re-examination of
expectations in the subject. More recently, he has been a major force in extending the
study of complex-analytic dynamical systems to the multivariate setting. Many
important tools from the one-dimensional setting do not carry over well to higher
dimension, so Professor Fornoss' deep understanding of plurisubharmonic functions
stemming from his earlier work has often provided vital leverage in his work on
dynamics.
       During his career at the University of Michigan, Professor Fornoss supervised
22 successful Ph.D. students, served on the committees of several others, and
energetically mentored many postdocs. He was the Analysis area leader for the
department for six years, served as associate chair for graduate studies (2007-09), and
was coordinator for the large Calculus 215 and 216 courses. Professor Forno~ss
oversaw a special two-year period in the department, which involved hosting numerous
distinguished visitors and presenting large conferences in several complex variables.
He has authored or co-authored over 150 research papers and has written four books.
Professor Forno~ss served on the editorial boards of a number of mathematical journals,
including 15 years as a member of the editorial board of the Michigan Mathematical


158






December Meeting, 2011


Journal. He is the recipient of a Sloan Fellowship (1977-79) and the Bergman Prize
(1994), among other awards, and has held visiting appointments at institutions
worldwide.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
John E. Fornoss professor emeritus of mathematics.

       Theresa M. Lee, Ph.D., professor of psychology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, and research professor in the Reproductive Sciences Program,
will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2011.
       Professor Lee received her B.S. degree from Indiana University in 1975 and her
Ph.D. degree from the University of Chicago in 1982. Following a postdoctoral
fellowship and appointment as assistant research professor at the University of
California, Berkeley from 1982-88, she joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
assistant professor in 1988, and was promoted to associate professor in 1994 and
professor in 1999. She received an additional appointment as associate research
scientist in 1996, and was promoted to research scientist (now research professor) in
1999.
       Professor Lee's research focuses on the areas of chronobiology and behavioral
endocrinology. Her research reflects her unusually broad understanding of behavioral
neuroscience, which was informed by both developmental and ecologically relevant
models of brain and behavior. Professor Lee developed unique animal models that
were used to study seasonal changes in maternal-offspring interactions, hibernation,
circadian physiology, and behavior. Her unusual experimental skills have allowed her
to develop novel ways of conceptualizing important biopsychological observations.
Recognized as one of the most eminent researchers in biopsychology today, she was
named a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science in 2009.
       Professor Lee has provided noteworthy service to the University, most recently
as chair of the Department of Psychology, a top-ranked department and one of the most
academically diverse psychology departments in the world, from 2007-11. A dedicated
teacher who    has mentored  many   successful students, she received  LSA's
Undergraduate Mentoring and Advising Award in 2003 and Rackham's Distinguished
Graduate Mentor Award in 2009.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
Theresa M. Lee professor emerita of psychology and research professor emerita.

       Daniel H. Levine, Ph.D., professor of political science in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on December 31,
2011.
       Professor Levine received his A.B. degree from Dartmouth College in 1964, his
M.Sc. degree from the London School of Economics in 1965, and his M.Phil. and Ph.D.
degrees from Yale University in 1967 and 1970, respectively. He joined the University
of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1969, and was promoted to assistant professor in
1970, associate professor in 1976, and professor in 1982. He was appointed the James
Orin Murfin Professor of Political Science from 2004-10.
       Professor Levine is an exemplar of what political scientists strive to be, a
scholar with a deep knowledge and understanding of a region and its cultures, as well
as a keen analyst and conceptualizer. This has made his work helpful not only to those


159






December Meeting, 2011


who study Latin America, but to anyone interested in the relationship between religion
and politics, a subject long neglected but now of interest not only to scholars but to
attentive publics and policy makers.
       Within the Department of Political Science, Professor Levine was a leader of
the comparative politics sub-field. His tenure as department chairman (1999-2004) saw
qualitative and quantitative growth, and a vigorous defense of departmental interests.
Widely appreciated as a teacher, Professor Levine has inspired generations of graduate
and undergraduate students with his commitment to intellectual honesty, empirical
research embedded in important issues, and devotion to the intellectual and personal
growth of those who have had the good fortune to study with him. His colleagues have
benefitted not only from his collegiality, interest in their work, and good humor, but
from the extraordinary service he has rendered the department.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
Daniel H. Levine professor emeritus of political science.

       Mary H. Simoni, Ph.D., professor of music (performing arts technology), in
the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, retired from active faculty status on May 31,
2011.
       Professor Simoni received her B.Mus., M.Mus., and Ph.D. degrees from
Michigan State University in 1977, 1981, and 1983, respectively. She joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1994, and was promoted to

December Meeting, 2011


       Professor Smith received his B.A. degree from Princeton University in 1966, his
M.A. degree from Harvard University in 1968, and his Ph.D. degree from Princeton
University in 1975. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
professor in 1975, and was promoted to associate professor in 1979.
       Professor Smith was a medievalist and a poet, with a longstanding interest in
historical and contemporary verse forms. His first book was a study of the late Latin
poet Prudentius: Prudentius' Psychomachia: A Reexamination (1976). He also
published articles on Geoffrey Chaucer and William Langland. His historically
informed knowledge of verse forms and his keen interest in contemporary poetry led
him more recently into an ambitious work-in-progress: assembling an on-line corpus of
hip-hop poetry and performing analytical work on the forms employed in the hip-hop
line. Professor Smith was co-author, with Professor Eric Rabkin, of Teaching Writing
That Works: A Group Approach to Practical English (1990). He published Transplant,
a distinguished and powerful volume of poetry, with Shaman Drum Books in 2003.
       Professor Smith was a beloved teacher and advisor. His service to the English
department has included positions as associate chair, director of undergraduate studies,
and a number of terms on the departmental executive committee. He served as
secretary of the faculty for the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (1995-96).
His longstanding passion for ornithology (he has been for many years the world-record
holder for number of species of North American birds seen) was reflected in a great
deal of his poetry and in essays and reviews published in ornithological journals.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Macklin Smith
associate professor emeritus of English language and literature.

       Berit Stensones, Ph.D., professor of mathematics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status December 31, 2011.
       Professor Stensones received her Cand.Mag. and Cand.Real. degrees from the
University of Oslo in 1978 and 1981, respectively, and her Ph.D. degree from Princeton
University in 1985. After serving on the faculties of Rutgers University (1985-89) and
Princeton University (1989-90), she joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
associate professor in 1990, and was promoted to professor in 1996.
       Professor Stensones studies analytic and geometric questions in the area of
several complex variables (that is, problems related to regions parameterized by
coordinates lying in the complex number system). One of her specialties is the
ingenious hands-on iterative construction of objects that in some cases had been
previously assumed not to exist and in other cases were expected but had been very
resistant to construction by other methods. Her results have had a significant influence
on the subject by reopening consideration of a number of fundamental topics that had
recently been dormant. Her recent work includes results relating to the "finite type"
non-degeneracy condition as well as questions in complex dynamics in several
variables. She has published over 20 research papers with several collaborators.
       Within the Department of Mathematics, Professor Stensones has supervised five
successful Ph.D. students, served on the committees of or hosted several others, and
energetically mentored many postdocs. She has taught many of the department's honors
and advanced calculus courses, and numerous graduate courses. She served as
associate chair for graduate studies (1999-200 1) and was active on many departmental


161

committees. In 1995 Professor Stensones received the Excellence in Research Award
from the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming

conceptualize and articulate important reforms. In addition to having written a
remarkable number of lectures, case books, and articles, Professor Waggoner has
played an extremely active role in law reform. He has served as reporter for the
Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers, as well as

        The regents approved a subcontract agreement with ISSYS, Inc. ("Company"),
which will allow the Company to engage Dr. Martin Bocks in the Department of
Pediatric Cardiology to provide various research services. Because Khalil Najafi, a
University of Michigan employee, is also owner of the Company, this agreement falls
under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:

DECEMBER MEETING, 2011 - APPENDIX


          RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
                              AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF
                     GENERAL REVENUE BONDS AND PROVIDING FOR
                           OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO

        WHEREAS, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer") is a constitutional body
corporate established pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as
amended, with general supervision of The University of Michigan (the "University") and the control and
direction of all expenditures from the University's funds; and
        WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously issued and has outstanding certain series of General
Revenue Bonds (the "Outstanding General Revenue Bonds"), and certain other obligations secured by a
lien on General Revenues (as defined in Trust Agreements pursuant to which the Outstanding General
Revenue Bonds were issued), and has reserved the right to issue additional series of General Revenue
Bonds, secured on a parity basis as to the General Revenues with the Outstanding General Revenue
Bonds and other obligations secured by a lien on General Revenues; and
        WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously issued and has outstanding bonds, notes or other
obligations payable from and secured by liens on certain revenue streams of the University, including
housing revenues and Medical Service Plan Revenues (sometimes known as Patient Care Revenues)
(collectively, the "Senior Lien Indebtedness"); and
        WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties and in order to properly serve the needs
of students attending the University, the Issuer has authorized the acquisition, construction, installation
and equipping of the capital improvements listed in Category I of Exhibit A attached hereto, and will
consider authorizing at a future date the acquisition, construction, installation and equipping of the capital
improvements listed in Category II of Exhibit A (all of such capital improvements listed in Exhibit A
being collectively referred to herein as the "Project"); and
        WHEREAS, the Issuer has issued and has outstanding Commercial Paper Notes, Series I (the
"Series I Notes") and Commercial Paper Notes, Series E (Taxable) (the "Series E Notes," and together
with the Series I Notes, the "Notes"), which are payable from and secured by General Revenues, and it
may be appropriate and economic to refund all or a part of the outstanding principal of the Notes; and
        WHEREAS, the financing of all or a portion of the Project and the refunding of all or a portion
of the Notes through the issuance of General Revenue Bonds will serve proper and appropriate public
purposes; and
        WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties, and in order to control and direct
prudently expenditures from the University's funds, the Issuer determines it is necessary and desirable to
authorize the issuance of General Revenue Bonds (the "Bonds") in order to provide funds which, together
with other available funds, will be used to pay all or part of the costs of the Project, the costs of refunding
all or a portion of the Notes, and costs incidental to the issuance of the Bonds and the refunding; and
        WHEREAS, one or more trust indentures (collectively, the "Trust Indenture") must be entered
into by and between the Issuer and one or more trustees (collectively, the "Trustee") to be designated by
an Authorized Officer (hereinafter defined), pursuant to which the Bonds will be issued and secured; and
        WHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Authorized Officers to negotiate the sale of the
Bonds with one or more underwriters or groups of underwriters to be selected by an Authorized Officer
(collectively, the "Underwriter") and to enter into one or more bond purchase agreements (collectively,
the "Bond Purchase Agreement") setting forth the terms and conditions upon which the Underwriter or
any other party will agree to purchase the Bonds and the interest rates thereof and the purchase price
therefor, or, in the alternative, to select the Underwriter for all or any portion of any series of Bonds and
to establish the terms for such Bonds through a competitive sale or bidding process pursuant to a Notice
of Sale; and


171






December Meeting, 2011-Appendix


         WHEREAS, in order to be able to market the Bonds at the most opportune time, it is necessary
for the Issuer to authorize the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Associate Vice
President for Finance and the Treasurer (each an "Authorized Officer") or any one of them individually,
to negotiate, execute and deliver on behalf of the Issuer, the Trust Indenture, the Bond Purchase
Agreement, one or more Remarketing Agreements with the Underwriter or other parties (collectively, the
"Remarketing Agreement"), and other related documents, to publish any Notice of Sale required for the
sale of any portion of the Bonds, to establish the specific terms of the Bonds and to accept the offer of the
Underwriter to purchase the Bonds, all within the limitations set forth herein; and
         WHEREAS, the Issuer has full power under its constitutional authority for supervision of the
University, and control and direction of expenditures from the University funds, to acquire, construct,
furnish and equip the Project and to pay all or a portion of the costs of the Project and the costs of
refunding all or a portion of the Notes by issuance of the Bonds, and to pledge General Revenues for
payment of the Bonds.
        NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to determine the specific amount of the cost of each component
of the Project to be financed from the proceeds of the Bonds; provided, however, that no proceeds of the
Bonds will be used to finance a component of the Project listed in Category II of Exhibit A attached
hereto until final approval of such Project component is given by the Issuer. Any Authorized Officer is
further authorized to determine the portion, if any, of the Notes to be refunded using the proceeds of the
Bonds. Subject to the Issuer's policies regarding approvals of capital projects, any Authorized Officer
may subsequently approve additional components of the Project and specify that such additional
components shall be financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of the Bonds, upon which occurrence
such components shall thereupon become components of the Project hereunder.
2. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Bonds in one or more series
to be designated GENERAL REVENUE BONDS, with appropriate series designations, if any, in the
aggregate original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but not to exceed the
principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS
($280,000,000). The Bonds shall be dated as of the date or dates established by an Authorized Officer,
and shall be issued for the purpose of providing funds which, together with other available funds, will be
used to pay all or a portion of the costs of the Project, all or a portion of the costs of refunding all or a
portion of the Notes and the costs related to the issuance of the Bonds and the refunding, including
capitalized interest, if any, for such period as an Authorized Officer may determine appropriate, and bond
insurance premiums, if appropriate. The Bonds shall be serial bonds or term bonds, which may be subject
to redemption requirements, or both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first
maturity shall be no earlier than April 1, 2012 and the last maturity shall be no later than December 31,
2044. The Bonds may bear no interest or may bear interest at stated fixed rates for the respective
maturities thereof as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the weighted average yield
(computed using the stated coupons and the stated original offering price) for the Bonds shall not exceed
7.0% per annum for tax-exempt Bonds or 11.0% per annum for taxable Bonds, and the Bonds may be
issued in whole or in part as capital appreciation bonds, which for their term or any part thereof bear no
interest but appreciate in principal amount over time at compounded rates (not in excess of 7.0% per
annum for tax-exempt Bonds or 11.0% per annum for taxable Bonds) to be determined by an Authorized
Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds may bear interest at a variable rate of interest for all or a
portion of their term, and the variable rate of interest shall not exceed the lesser of the maximum rate
permitted by law or the maximum rate, if any, to be specified in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds may be
subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the times and prices and in the manner as
shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but no redemption premium shall exceed 3% of the
principal amount being redeemed unless the redemption price is based on a "make whole" formula, in
which case no redemption premium shall exceed 40% of the principal amount being redeemed. Interest
on the Bonds shall be payable at such times as shall be specified by an Authorized Officer. The Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered form in denominations, shall be payable as to principal and interest in
the manner, shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be executed and authenticated, all as shall
be provided in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds shall be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond


172






December Meeting, 2011-Appendix


Purchase Agreement or through a competitive sale or bidding process pursuant to a Notice of Sale for a
price to be established by an Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of original
issue discount, shall not exceed 1.5% of the principal amount thereof) plus accrued interest, if any, from
the dated date of the Bonds to the date of delivery thereof.
In relation to the debt service on all or any portion of the Bonds, or in relation to debt service on all or
any portion of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds or the Senior Lien Indebtedness, any of the
Authorized Officers may, at any time, on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into or terminate or
modify an interest rate swap, cap, forward starting swap, option, swaption, rate lock or similar agreement
or agreements (collectively, the "Swap Agreement") with a counter-party or counter-parties selected or to
be selected by the Authorized Officer. Such Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the
Issuer and the counter-party related to interest on all or a portion of the Bonds, the Outstanding General
Revenue Bonds or the Senior Lien Indebtedness, at indexed or market established rates. If the Swap
Agreement is entered into at approximately the same time as the issuance of the Bonds, the expected
effective interest rates on the Bonds, taking into account the effect of the Swap Agreement, shall be
within the limitations set forth herein. Any Swap Agreement in the form of an option, swaption or
forward starting swap may, if the Bonds to which such agreement relates are not ultimately issued, be
required to be terminated, with a possibility of a resulting termination payment due by the University.
Any or all of the Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the option of the holder thereof or
to mandatory tender for purchase. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any Bonds subject to tender
for purchase may be made payable from General Revenues, from available cash reserves of the
University, subject to such limitations as may be specified in the Trust Indenture, or from, directly or as
support for the cash reserves, a letter of credit, line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other
liquidity device, or one or more of the same, or any combination thereof (collectively, the "Liquidity
Device"), all as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer. The Liquidity Device, or any part thereof,
may also be used to provide liquidity for any other indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer, including the
Notes, the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, any variable rate Senior Lien Indebtedness and any
variable rate indebtedness secured by a pledge of Hospital Gross Revenues. Any reimbursement
obligation for draws under the Liquidity Device shall be a limited and not a general obligation of the
Issuer, payable from, and may be secured by a pledge of, General Revenues. Any portion of the
Liquidity Device which provides liquidity for any Senior Lien Indebtedness or indebtedness secured by a
pledge of Hospital Gross Revenues may, but shall not be required to, be additionally or alternatively
payable from, and may be secured by a lien on, any revenue stream securing the obligations for which the
liquidity is provided. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of
the Issuer, any agreements or instruments necessary to obtain, maintain, renew or replace, and provide for
repayments under, any Liquidity Device deemed by such officer to be required for the purposes of this
Resolution.
Any Bonds authorized and issued hereunder may, at any time, upon direction of an Authorized Officer,
be subsequently converted to another mode or structure authorized hereby, either through procedures
established in the Trust Indenture pertaining thereto, or through the issuance hereunder of refunding
bonds to refund and replace the outstanding Bonds to be converted. Any such refunding bonds issued
hereunder shall be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Resolution. Any
Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any documents or
instruments, including but not limited to, any amendments to the Trust Indenture, necessary or convenient
for the purpose of accomplishing the conversion as described in this paragraph.
3. The Bonds, and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement, if any, and the Liquidity
Device, if any (except as specifically provided otherwise in Section 2 hereof or below in this Section 3),
shall be limited and not general obligations of the Issuer payable from and secured by a lien on the
General Revenues (as shall be defined in the Trust Indenture in a manner generally consistent with the
definition thereof contained in the Trust Agreements pursuant to which the Outstanding General Revenue
Bonds were issued), subject only to the senior liens on portions of General Revenues securing the
respective series of Senior Lien Indebtedness (until each respective series of such Senior Lien
Indebtedness is paid or defeased in accordance with its terms). The lien on General Revenues securing
the Bonds shall be on a parity basis with the lien securing the Notes and the Outstanding General
Revenue Bonds. The Bonds and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement, if any, and the


173






December Meeting, 2011-Appendix


Liquidity Device, if any, may also be payable from and secured by a lien on moneys, securities or other
investments from time to time on deposit in certain funds created pursuant to the Trust Indenture or
agreements entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount of or interest or premium on the Bonds,
or for the payment of any amounts owing under the Swap Agreement, if any, or the Liquidity Device, if
any, or any claim based thereon against the State of Michigan, or any officer or agent thereof or of the
Issuer or the University, as individuals, either directly or indirectly, nor, except as specifically provided in
the Trust Indenture or the instruments entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or the
Liquidity Device, if any, against the Issuer, nor shall the Bonds and interest with respect thereto, or any
obligations of the Issuer in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or Liquidity Device, if any
(except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 2 hereof), become a lien on or be secured by any
property, real, personal or mixed of the State of Michigan or the Issuer, other than the General Revenues
and the moneys from time to time on deposit in all or part of the funds established by the Trust Indenture
or the agreements entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or Liquidity Device, if
any.
Any pledge of General Revenues, and funds specified in the Trust Indenture or agreements entered into in
connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or Liquidity Device, if any, shall be valid and binding from
the date of the issuance and delivery of the Bonds or such agreements, and all moneys or properties
subject thereto which are thereafter received shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without
physical delivery or further act. The lien of said pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties
(other than the holders of any outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations secured by a senior or parity
lien on any portion General Revenues) having a claim in tort, contract or otherwise against the Issuer,
irrespective of whether such parties have notice of the lien.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any obligations of the Issuer under the Swap
Agreement or any agreement with respect to the Liquidity Device may, if determined appropriate by an
Authorized Officer, be payable and secured on a subordinated basis to the Bonds and other General
Revenue obligations of the Issuer, or may be unsecured.
4. The right is reserved to issue additional bonds, notes or other obligations payable from and secured on
a parity basis with the Bonds from the General Revenues, upon compliance with the terms and
conditions, if any, as shall be set forth in the Trust Indenture.
5. Any Authorized Officer is hereby authorized and directed, in the name and on behalf of the Issuer, and
as its corporate act and deed, to select the Trustee, and to negotiate, execute and deliver the Trust
Indenture. The Trust Indenture may contain such covenants on behalf of the Issuer and terms as such
officers deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, covenants with respect to the establishment of
General Revenues at levels expressed as a percentage of debt service on the Bonds or all General
Revenue Bonds, with respect to the issuance of additional bonds, notes or other obligations payable from
and secured by General Revenues, and with respect to limitations on or prohibitions against the issuance
of additional Senior Lien Indebtedness. In addition, any Authorized Officer is hereby authorized,
empowered and directed to negotiate, if necessary and expedient for the issuance of the Bonds, for the
acquisition of bond insurance and to execute and deliver an insurance commitment or other documents or
instruments required in connection with such insurance.
6. Any Authorized Officer is hereby authorized and directed, in the name and on behalf of the Issuer and
as its corporate act and deed, to select the Underwriter and to negotiate, execute and deliver the
Remarketing Agreement, if any, and the Bond Purchase Agreement with the Underwriter setting forth the
terms of the Bonds and the sale thereof, all within the limitations set forth herein. In the alternative, if
determined by an Authorized Officer, selection of the Underwriter and the setting of the terms for all or
any portion of any series of the Bonds may be made through a competitive sale or bidding process. Any
Authorized Officer is authorized to accept the winning bid or offer of the Underwriter for the purchase of
such Bonds.
7. The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, or in the event of his unavailability, the
President, is hereby authorized, empowered and directed, in the name and on behalf of the Issuer, and as
its corporate act and deed, to execute the Bonds by placing his or her facsimile or manual signature


174

thereon, and to deliver or cause to be delivered the Bonds to the Underwriter in exchange for the purchase
price therefor.
8. Any Authorized Officer is hereby authorized to solicit ratings on the Bonds from any national rating
service which the Authorized Officer deems appropriate and to cause the preparation of one or more
Preliminary Official Statements, if necessary, and one or more Official Statements with respect to the
Bonds, and to execute and deliver the Official Statements. Any Authorized Officer or the Underwriter is
authorized to circulate and use, in accordance with applicable law, the Notice of Sale, if any, the
Preliminary Official Statements, if any, and the Official Statements in connection with the offering,
marketing and sale of the Bonds.
9. The President, the Authorized Officers, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary, the Vice President and
General Counsel and any associate general counsel, and any other appropriate officer of the Issuer or the
University are hereby authorized to perform all acts and deeds and to execute and deliver for and on
behalf of the Issuer all instruments and documents required by this resolution, the Trust Indenture, the

JANUARY MEETING, 2012


                                                        The University of Michigan
                                                                        Ann Arbor

       The regents met at 3:00 p.m. in the Stephen M. Ross School of Business.
Present were President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman,
Richner, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Forrest, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Harper, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President
Rudgers, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent Taylor and Regent Deitch were absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
       President Coleman thanked Dean Alison Davis-Blake and the Ross School of
Business for hosting this month's meeting. She commented on the experience of
attending the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, noting that it was "a magnificent display of
the spirit and community of intercollegiate athletics."
       President Coleman commented on the selection by Baylor University of
Professor Brian Coppola to receive the Robert Foster Cherry Award for Great
Teaching. President Coleman also reported on plans announced by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to open a satellite office in Detroit, due to the city's proximity to the
state's three major research universities.
Presentation by Alison Davis-Blake, Dean, Stephen M. Ross School of Business
       President Coleman introduced Alison Davis-Blake, Edward J. Frey Dean,
Stephen M. Ross School of Business. Dean Davis-Blake described the Ross School's
action-based learning approach and its focus on organizational sustainability, which
means doing more with fewer human, financial, temporal, and environmental resources,
while creating positive outcomes for organizations and people. Using the examples of
the Advanced Model Factory, Positive Organizational Scholarship, and masters theses
on environmental sustainability that are published for practitioners, she described how
this approach is carried out by taking advantage of the University of Michigan's
signature multi-disciplinary, multi-constituent, collaboratory orientation.
Annual Report on Research and Scholarship
       Vice President Forrest noted that this would be the 90th annual report on
research presented at the University. He reported that the federal government provides
the largest proportion of the $1.2 billion in research spending at the University, with the
University supplying about 25% of the funding and a small portion coming from
industry. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides the largest source of
funding overall, with most of the remainder coming from other federal agencies.
However, continued growth in federal spending is not likely, as expectations are that
there will be significant budget cuts across all agencies as the federal government
works to reduce its deficit.


177






January Meeting, 2012


       To help maintain the amount of federal research funding, the University will
pursue three tactics. It will focus on its areas of particular strength that are also
priorities for the federal government and industries; it will build on the University's
unique culture and environment, including its reputation for excellence and strengths
across disciplines; and it will work to improve proposal competitiveness, improve
research administration, and reduce barriers to working with industry.
       Regent Newman asked whether the University's research enterprise loses
money. Vice President Forrest responded that 25% of research funding is provided by
University funds, and that while the research enterprise "returns a great value to us, it
does cost us money to do." Regent Newman noted that this indicates that a portion of
the University's budget provided by tuition and other sources is devoted toward
subsidizing research.
Committee Reports
       No committee meetings were held this month.
       President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
       Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of December 15, 2011.
       Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report,
Plant Extension Report, University Human Resources Report, and the Regents Report
on Non-Competitive Purchases over $5,000 from Single Sources, September 16, 2011
through December 31, 2011. He noted that since 2003, the University's annual
recurring expense for employee health benefits has been reduced by about $94 million,

January Meeting, 2012


       Regent Newman asked Provost Hanlon to respond to allegations that had been
made at a recent press conference by a former graduate student that she had been
treated unfairly by her professor at the College of Engineering. Provost Hanlon noted
that he had personally reviewed the academic record of the former student who had
made the allegation, and he was convinced that the academic decisions that had been
made by the faculty member were justified and appropriate, and had followed a
thorough and fair process.
       Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for three
retiring faculty members.
       Vincent J. Abreu, Ph.D., research professor, Space Physics Research
Laboratory, and lecturer, Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences,
College of Engineering, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2011.
       Professor Abreu received his B.S. degree from Stetson University in 1967, his
M.S. degree from North Texas State University in 1971, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Texas, Dallas, in 1974. Following completion of a postdoctoral
fellowship at the University of Michigan (1975-76), he joined the faculty as an assistant
research scientist in 1977, and was promoted to associate research scientist in 1983 and
research scientist in 1987. In 1993, Professor Abreu left the University of Michigan to
serve first as director of the Information-Cooperation Program (1993-95) and then as
director of international activities (1996-98) at the Consortium for International Earth
Science Information Network (CIESIN). He returned to the University in 1999 as a
research scientist (now research professor), and received an additional appointment as
lecturer in 2002.
       Professor Abreu was co-investigator and project scientist for the High
Resolution Doppler Imager, which successfully measured the horizontal wind vector in
the upper atmosphere from the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). He
played an important role in the process of establishing information systems for
sustainable development in Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe. He was a
consultant for the World Bank, Global Environmental Facility, the United Nations
Environmental     Program     (UNEP),     the   United    Nations    Development
Program/Sustainable Development Network Program, the Organization of American
States, the Central American Commission for the Environment and Development
(CCAD), and the National Research Council. Professor Abreu was a key figure in the
conceptualization and development of the National Environmental Information System
in Central America (SIAM). He has been a member or chair of nine NASA
committees. Within the University, Professor Abreu taught classes in atmospheric,
oceanic and space sciences and in aerospace engineering, and he chaired the
committees for seven Ph.D. candidates.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Vincent J. Abreu research professor emeritus.

       Bernadine E. Cimprich, Ph.D., associate professor of nursing in the School of
Nursing, will retire from active faculty status on January 31, 2012.

Michigan in 1990. From 1990-93, she was a faculty member at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
professor in 1993, and was promoted to associate professor in 2000.
       Professor Cimprich's research focused on cognitive problems in women treated
with chemotherapy for breast cancer and on interventions to improve quality of
survivorship. She has a national and international reputation for scholarly leadership.
Professor Cimprich's work has been disseminated in over 40 often-cited articles in
peer-reviewed journals, 7 book chapters, and 49 refereed abstracts. Within the School
of Nursing, she taught students at all levels and participated in a multitude of funded
research projects.   She was also associated with the University of Michigan
Comprehensive Cancer Center, where she directed several initiatives, including the
cancer nursing research program (1993-2004) and the Quality of Life Research Program
(1997-2004). She supervised numerous master's student research projects and doctoral
dissertations, conducted interdisciplinary research projects, served on many committees
within the University, and was active in professional organizations.
         In 2001, in recognition of her expertise and commitment to the nursing
profession, Professor Cimprich was inducted as a fellow of the American Academy of
Nursing, one of the most prestigious honors given in the field of nursing. In 1999 and
2004, she received the Best Original Research Award by the journal Cancer Nursing.
         The Regents now salute this distinguished nursing educator for her dedicated
service by naming Bernadine E. Cimprich associate professor emerita of nursing.

       Margaret Scisney-Matlock, Ph.D., professor of nursing in the School of
Nursing, will retire from active faculty status on January 31, 2012.
       Professor Scisney-Matlock received her B.S.N. degree from Murray State
University in 1971, her M.S.N. degree from Indiana University in 1973, and her M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Notre Dame in 1983 and 1985, respectively.
She held a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan School of Nursing
from 1990-92. Professor Scisney-Matlock joined the University of Michigan faculty as
an assistant professor in 1993, and was promoted to associate professor in 2000, and
professor in 2008.
       Professor Scisney-Matlock has made considerable contributions to the School of
Nursing's teaching and research missions. She was deeply committed to the education
and mentorship of undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students. Her scholarship
focused on the nursing care of adults with the clinical diagnosis of essential
hypertension; her work laid the groundwork for the translation of her research findings
to clinical practice with the potential for commercialization. She also studied the
measurement of cognitive representations of health behaviors as a basis for a
theoretically derived cognitive-behavioral intervention for improving blood pressure in
women from diverse populations. Her scholarly publications in such highly regarded
journals as Hypertension and Applied Nursing Research are widely recognized as
critical contributions to the understanding of these issues. Professor Scisney-Matlock' s
administrative contributions to the School of Nursing include serving as director of the
Division of Acute, Critical, and Long-Term Care Programs from 2002-06.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished nursing educator for her dedicated
service by naming Margaret Scisney-Matlock professor emerita of nursing.

January Meeting, 2012


       Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted a memorial statement for
George F. Estabrook, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and research
professor.
       The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of George F. Estabrook, M.S., professor of ecology and evolutionary
biology and research professor in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
Professor Estabrook died on November 24, 2011, after a courageous battle with cancer.
He was 69.
       Professor Estabrook received his A.B. degree from Dartmouth College in 1964
and his M.S. degree from the University of Colorado in 1968. He joined the University
of Michigan faculty as a visiting assistant professor in 1970, and was promoted to
assistant professor in 1973, associate professor in 1976, and professor in 1983. He was
appointed research scientist (now research professor) in 1974.
       Professor Estabrook's research focused on the application of quantitative
methods to testing biological hypotheses. He was a leader in the application of
mathematics to the discovery of phylogenetic relationships among groups of plants and
animals, and published over 120 papers on a wide-range of topics. Recently, he and his
colleagues made advances in the application of DNA sequence data to the elucidation
of relationships among the major groups of plants and to the role of metabolic rate on
the molecular evolution of fishes. He also contributed to the history, ecology, and
ethnobotany of traditional agriculture in Portugal. He was an active graduate student
mentor, guiding 16 doctoral students to completion of their dissertations. Professor
Estabrook taught courses in human nutrition, computational hypothesis testing, and
economic botany; his human nutrition course enjoyed enrollments of as many as 240
students. He received an award for outstanding teaching in 1986.
       Throughout his life, Professor Estabrook was a musician, a singer, and an
athlete. He played the trumpet, the banjo, and sang with a number of groups. He
played, coached, and refereed soccer, ran marathons, and until age 65, was a nationally-
ranked triathlete.
       As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we extend our heartfelt
condolences to his wife, Virginia Hutton Estabrook, his children, and other members of
his family.

           contemplated under the Agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees and
           indemnification apply, and the Agreement may be amended by consent of the parties,
           such as adding related technology. University procedures for approval of these
           changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest review will be done as
           appropriate.

University of Michigan Energy Institute
        The regents were informed that the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy
Institute (MMPEI) will change its name to the "University of Michigan Energy
Institute," effective February 1, 2012. Vice President Forrest pointed out that while the
new name will better reflect the broader scope of the institute, it will also ensure the
enduring legacy of the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project by reinvigorating it and
highlighting its on-going activities as a distinct entity within the institute.
Public Comments
        The regents heard comments from Stephen Raiman, student, and Finn Larsen,
Victor DiRita, and Cagliyan, faculty members, on the issue of the potential unionization
of graduate student research assistants; and Nancy Shiffler, citizen representing the
Huron Valley Group of the Sierra Club, on sustainability.
Adjournment
        There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 4:30 p.m. The
next meeting will take place February 16, 2012.

FEBRUARY 8, 2012 SPECIAL MEETING


                                                        The University of Michigan
                                                                        Ann Arbor
                                                                  February 8, 2012

       The regents met at 10:00 a.m. in the Regents' Room via teleconference. Present
were President Coleman and Regents Deitch, Ilitch, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Rudgers, Vice President Scarnecchia, and Executive Vice President Slottow. Regents
Darlow and Maynard were unable to participate.
Call to Order
       President Coleman called the meeting to order and announced that the purpose
of the meeting was to request that the regents grant a special one-time use of Michigan
Stadium as the location for the National Hockey League's "Winter Classic" game in
January 2013. Due to the unusual and highly visible nature of this event, it was deemed
prudent to present the proposal for consideration by the board.
Statement by Regent Ilitch
       Regent Ilitch announced that she would be recusing herself from the vote on this
issue. "While I have no direct interest in the National Hockey League," she said, "it is
well known that my family has an interest in the Detroit Red Wings Hockey Club and
Comerica Park. It is important to me to avoid any appearance of conflict in this
matter."
Discussion
       Regent Newman noted that the event would have a considerable economic
impact on Ann Arbor and the surrounding community during a time of year that is
otherwise quiet. Regent Ilitch pointed out that the estimated economic impact would be
$14 million.
       Regent Richner said that this is a "fantastic" idea, and Regent Taylor also
expressed his enthusiastic support. Regent Taylor also noted that because an outside
third party is leasing the facility and hosting the event, the fact that alcoholic beverages
will be served is not an issue. He expressed the hope that similar events will be
considered in the future.
       Regent Deitch expressed agreement with Regent Taylor, and asked counsel to
review indemnification and risk management issues that have been addressed in light of
the fact that the event involves the sale of alcohol. Regent Taylor pointed out that the
University's policy of not serving alcohol in the stadium at University-sponsored public
events does not apply when the facility is being operated by a third party.
       Athletics Director Brandon observed that, while this is a non-University event,
the University and city will be providing some of the basic game-day services,
including employment of the regular game-day operations staff, city and University
police, security, and traffic control services normally provided during stadium events.


215






February 8, 2012 Special Meeting


He said that the University intends to be in complete compliance with the various
regulations that relate to sale of alcohol at public events.
       Associate General Counsel Tom Blessing addressed the indemnification issues,
noting that they have been thoroughly reviewed by the general counsel's office and the
risk management office, and that all parties are satisfied with all arrangements in place
to date. Additional due diligence will be conducted with concessionaires closer to date
of the event. He confirmed that at this point, all risk management issues have been
satisfied.
       Vice President Scarnecchia pointed out that contract negotiations are still
ongoing, and the information being provided is based on what has been discussed to
date. However, she is not aware of any resistance on the part of the National Hockey
League to any of the risk management or indemnification issues that have been raised.
Indemnification has also been requested for people attending the game, providing an
additional level of protection for the University.
       Mr. Blessing stated that the University's insurance would cover all claims
against the University, and to the extent that the damages are attributable to someone
else's acts, the University would have the right to recover from the other party when
they are at fault. Under the current contractual language, if the NHL and its affiliates
were at fault, they would cover that portion of the injury or damage.
       Regent Newman recognized the huge amount of effort that has been expended
by individuals from across the University in making this agreement possible, noting
that it is "a great win for everybody." Mr. Brandon also thanked everyone across the
University who has been involved in the negotiation process, including the legal,
facilities, security, and athletics operations teams, and added that the NHL
representatives have been terrific partners throughout the process. He noted that he was
recently informed that in addition to the fees the University will receive for this event,
the NHL' s charitable foundation will announce later in the week its plans to make a
significant donation to the University for scholarships. Regent Taylor pointed out that
the regents are very pleased by the significant amount of new revenue that will be
generated for the University by this event, and thanked Mr. Brandon and everyone
involved for that.
       Regent White moved that the University of Michigan license use of Michigan
Stadium for holding the NHL's 2013 Winter Classic, as described in the regents
communication. Regent Taylor seconded the motion, and it was approved, with
Regents Deitch, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White in favor and Regent Ilitch
abstaining.

FEBRUARY MEETING, 2012


                                                        The University of Michigan
                                                                        Ann Arbor
                                                                February 16, 2012

       The regents met at 3:15 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Deitch, Ilitch, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White. Also
present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Provost
Hanlon, Vice President Harper, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor
Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President Rudgers, Vice President
Scarnecchia, and Executive Vice President Slottow. Regent Maynard was absent;
Regent Darlow participated by phone. Vice President Wilbanks arrived at about 4:00.
Call to Order
       President Coleman called the meeting to order and began with an update on the
University's handling of allegations that a medical resident possessed child
pornography. She commented, "University leadership and the Board of Regents now
have had the chance to review and discuss the internal audit in detail. It has been a
frank, difficult and necessary assessment of the incident itself as well as the larger
context of safety and security in our Health System and on our campus." She then
called on Regent Taylor, who made the following motion.
Motion by Regent Taylor
       Regent Taylor stated, "This motion arises out of the case involving allegations
against Dr. Jenson, who was formerly of the Health System. It's a terrible situation.
It's one that is unacceptable to the regents and that we, the regents, feel we must do
everything within our power to insure that it is not repeated." He then made the
following motion:
       1. The regents will assume control and responsibility for the corrective
           remedial actions that must be taken arising out of this case.
       2. An externally-driven investigation must be conducted to determine,
           among other things, individual accountability and whether further
           action must be taken.
       3. Management experts or consultants must be retained to examine the
           current organizational setup for law enforcement and investigation, and
           to give us options with regard to same.
       4. Finally, 9-1-1 must be fixed ASAP. When people call, it should be
           clear who they are talking to, and under what authority.
       To accomplish these items, the regents instruct our chair, Denise Ilitch, and our
president, Mary Sue Coleman, and others they may deem appropriate and helpful to
them, to develop candidates from outside organizations for regents to choose from to
carry out these matters.
       The motion was seconded by Regent Newman, and it was approved
unanimously.
       President Coleman responded that she shares the regents' concerns, and
appreciates the board's commitment to leaving no stone unturned in this matter. She


219






February Meeting, 2012


said, "I will work closely with Regent Ilitch and the entire board to quickly launch the
actions outlined in the resolution. As I said last week, this situation and the underlying
issues it revealed is unacceptable. We will take any additional steps necessary based on
what we learn in the weeks to come." She thanked the board for taking this action.
President's Remarks
       President Coleman announced that two faculty members had recently been
awarded prestigious Alfred P. Sloan Foundation fellowships. She announced further
that the first stem cell line derived at the University of Michigan had been placed on the
NIH's registry of human embryonic stem cell lines.
       President Coleman then introduced Martin Philbert, dean of the School of
Public Health.
Presentation by Martin Philbert, Dean, School of Public Health
       Dean Philbert reported that the School of Public Health aims to be the premier
academic institution in public health, and his presentation described the school's efforts
at achieving this goal. He noted that the school is ranked 4th nationally among Master
of Public Health programs and is within the top four in its doctoral level programs. He
outlined multiple other measures that demonstrate the national and international
prominence of the school.
Presentation on Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research
       President Coleman introduced James Douglas Engel, G. Carl Huber Professor
of Developmental Biology and chair, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology.
Professor Engel noted that the scientific goal of the Michigan stem cell research
program, when it was established ten years ago was to build a world-class center of
excellence in stem cell biology. He described the three types of stem cells: human
adult stem cells, human embryonic stem cells, and human induced pluripotent stem
cells and explained how these cells can be developed in the laboratory to treat human
diseases. He noted that passage of Proposition 2 in 2008 was critical in advancing stem
cell research at the University. Michigan's stem cell program's unique contribution to
this area of research is to focus on generating human embryonic stem cell lines from
patients who have specific genetic diseases. The long-term goal is to be able to treat
patients with cell-based therapies using induced pluripotent stem cells.
Committee Reports
       Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that the committee, consisting of
herself, Regent Richner, and Regent Maynard (via phone) had met that morning with
Executive Vice President Slottow. For the first session, on the UMHS 10-year
strategic financial plan, the committee was joined by the Health Affairs Committee,
consisting of Regents Deitch, Newman, and Darlow (via phone). Also present were
Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Dean Woolliscroft, and Health System CFO Paul
Castillo. The second agenda item was an overview of the FY 2013 General Fund
Budget. Participants included Provost Hanlon and Associate Provost Pollack. The
committee also received an audit update from Carol Senneff, executive director of
University Audits.

the death of Glenda Dickerson, M.A., professor of theatre and drama in the School of

the Lorraine Hansberry Theatre in San Francisco; and the Arena Stage, Ford's Theatre,
and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Professor Dickerson conceived and
adapted numerous vehicles for the stage from various dramatic and non-dramatic
sources. For the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, she produced and directed Style and

addition to her numerous teaching contributions, she served as head of the African
American theatre studies minor (2001-12), associate dean of the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies (1997-99), and director of the Center for World
Performance Studies (2001-09). In recognition of her dedication to promoting the

commitment to diversity, in November 2011 Professor Dickerson received the

Compensation and Governance Committee, and they were posted in The University
Record, with no comments having been received.

motivation for removing from Bylaw 5.19 the requirement that the president and
executive officers terminate their service at the age of 70. He stated, "It is not about
any individual whatsoever. Our motivation, complete and total, is that the lawyers
advise that the existing bylaw is in violation of the Elliot-Larson Civil Rights Act, and
that is why it is being changed."

February Meeting, 2012


       Sec. 11.45. The University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers: The Direete-and
       Chief Executive Officer (revised November 2009)
       The directeor-and chief executive officer of the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health
       Centers will be appointed by the Board of Regents upon recommendation by the president. The
       direte4F-and chief executive officer will be responsible to the executive vice president for
       medical affairs, and will have immediate responsibility for the operation, maintenance and
       administrative affairs of the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers. The direc-t*
       and chief executive officer will serve as a member and as secretary of the executive board of the
       University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers. The direc-te-and chief executive officer
       will, ex officio, be a member of the Medical School Executive Committee.
Naming of the Player Development Center in Honor of William Davidson
       President Coleman commented that Bill Davidson was "a giant of a man" and a
very generous supporter of the University, and she regrets that he isn't alive to see how
well the basketball team is currently doing. Vice President May commented that Mr.
Davidson was one of the icons of the sports world, and a great and smart alumnus.
Regent Ilitch noted that from a sports owner perspective, Bill Davidson and his family
have been incredibly generous to the University and they are very sorely missed. "I
would like to thank his family very, very much for this, and for their continued support
of our great university."
       On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Ilitch, the regents
unanimously approved formally designating the Player Development Center for
Intercollegiate Basketball as the William Davidson Player Development Center.
Public Comments
       The regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Dr. Gulala Abraham, regarding "violation of FERPA and other serious
issues;" Douglas Smith, alumnus, on reporting sex crimes; Victoria A. Powell, citizen,
on the child pornography investigation; C.W. Kauffman, citizen, on "it is time!;"
Melissa Sanders, student and chair of the GEO parents' caucus, on increased access to
the childcare subsidy; Daniel Alejandro Morales, student and member of the Coalition
for Tuition Equality, on college affordability for all deserving students; and Melinda
Day, Anna Belak, and Michael Slootsky, students, regarding whether graduate student
research assistants should be classified as students.
       At the conclusion of the public comments session, Regent Ilitch stated, "The
personal verbal attacks made today about President Coleman are very unfair, and I
don't agree with them at all. She works tirelessly to protect young people, day in and
day out, and she and the regents are extremely disturbed and unhappy about the alleged
behavior of Dr. Jenson. I think that the disdain and anger should be directed at him,
and not at President Coleman. So I want to affirm the remarks made by Regent Taylor
today."

FEBRUARY 21, 2012 SPECIAL MEETING


                                                               The University of Michigan
                                                                                Ann Arbor
                                                                        February 21, 2012

        The regents met at 8:00 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present by phone were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Present in the Regents' Room were Executive Vice President
Pescovitz, Vice President Rudgers, Vice President Scarnecchia, and Executive Vice
President Slottow. Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Provost Hanlon, Vice
President May, Chancellor Person, and Vice President Wilbanks were present by
phone. Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, and Chancellor Little were
unable to participate.

Call to Order

        President Coleman called the special meeting to order. A discussion followed
concerning the Regents' Bylaw Section 1.01 and the rules governing special meetings.
President Coleman turned the floor over to Regent Deitch.

        Regent Deitch made the following statement:
                On April 21, 2011, the Graduate Employees Organization filed a Petition for
        Representation Proceedings seeking an election to become certified as the exclusive
        representatives of the University's graduate student research assistants (GSRAs) under the
        Public Employment Relations Act (PERA).
                On May 29, 2011, the Regents of the University of Michigan adopted the following
        resolution: "Resolved, that consistent with the University of Michigan's proud history of
        strong, positive, and mutually productive labor relations, the Board of Regents supports the
        rights of University Graduate Student Research Assistants, whom we recognize as employees, to
        determine for themselves whether they choose to organize."
                In 1981, the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC) had ruled that
        GSRAs were not employees.
                The Regents' resolution was predicated on its judgment that the facts had changed
        materially since 1981 and that those facts (including the administration's conduct) established
        to the board's satisfaction that the GSRAs are employees.
                Currently, MERC is holding a fact-finding hearing, which is being conducted by its
        most senior administrative law judge, the widely respected Julia Stern.
                It is unknown whether MERC will rule that the GSRAs are employees under PERA or
        not.
                If the ruling is no, it would appear to be highly unlikely that there will be an election.
                If the ruling is yes, no one knows whether the union will win a majority or not. The
        regents have not taken a position on whether the union should win an election or not. And, we
        do not do so today. The regents' decision is predicated on our support for freedom of choice for
        these valuable members of the University community.
                Others at the University, led by the president, have expressed their opposition to the
        unionization. Such opposition has not been inhibited by the regents nor anyone else.


261






February 21, 2012 Special Meeting


        Despite the fact that the process is ongoing and the result is unknown, Senator Randy
Richardville introduced SB 971 on February 15 and scheduled it for hearing today, February
21 at 11 a.m. before the Senate Committee on Government Operations.
        The bill provides: An individual serving as a graduate student research assistant or in
an equivalent position and any individual whose position does not have sufficient indicia of an
employment relationship is not a public employee entitled to representation or collective
bargaining rights under this Act.
        Rationale for opposition to SB 971:
        1) The outcome and the process of MERC's review of the facts are unknown.
        2) There is no factual basis of wrongdoing or incompetence, etc., which could
            possibly justify taking away jurisdiction from MERC, a statutorily constituted state
            agency.
        3) This legislation is an improper incursion into the internal decision-making
            processes of the University.
        4) Adoption of this law would be tantamount to changing the rules of a game in the
            middle of that game. To do so would be a violation of due process which is
            inconsistent with the core values of the University.

For those reasons and others, I offer the following motion:

        The University of Michigan hereby states its opposition to the
adoption of SB 971. Cynthia Wilbanks, vice president for government
relations, is to take all available action in opposition to the adoption of
SB 971 into law and is to articulate the University of Michigan's
opposition to SB 971 before the legislature, and if necessary, before the
Office of the Governor. The term "all available action"' is to include,
but is not limited to, testimony, development of position papers and
retention of lobbyists. The vice president for government relations is to
report on a regular and continuing basis to the board through the chair
of the board or her designee on the progress of the opposition to SB 971.

Regent Taylor seconded the motion.

Regent Newman made the following statement:
        For the record I question the emergency action of this meeting. In 17 years on the
board we have never used this process to call a board meeting and we have never called a
board meeting without at least 18 hours of notice as required under the opens meeting act. I
would like to know what the emergency is that caused five of my colleagues to call this meeting?
        To take this action without any discussion, without any public comment and without
any notice seems to me to fly in the face of openness and inclusion. Even the meeting notice
doesn't say what the meeting is about. I for one refused to make up the quorum to call this
meeting.
        There is no question that this is not an autonomy issue - it is settled law that the
University is subject to PERA, otherwise we wouldn 't have any collective bargaining on this
campus, and we wouldn 't pay minimum wage.
        Arguing that the process should run its course is merely taking a side. The process and
the course are not controlled and constrained by this board, but rather a matter of concern for
all the citizens of the state, whether we like it or not.


'Note: per comment of Regent Darlow, understood to mean all available appropriate action.


262






February 21, 2012 Special Meeting


                The idea that a MERC process precludes legislative action reflects a basic
        misunderstanding of the roles of the different branches of government.
                MERC is an administrative agency. In general, the legislature sets broad policy goals
        in the form of statutes, and then agencies (executive and independent) create more detailed
        regulations to carry out those policy mandates where needed. This general principle is
        certainly applicable to the MERC, which is charged with administering 3 specific statutes,
        including  PERA.     See  http://www.michigan.gov/lara/0,4601,7-154-10576_17485-42437--
        00.html.
                Without the legislative policy and goals as the framework, the MERC has no business
        acting at all. So it can't be the case that the legislative process in setting those broad policy
        goals is not appropriate - it is central to the MERC's mission. To say that there is a "process"
        underway in the MERC so the legislature should stay out of it is misunderstanding our basic
        structure of government and the roles each branch plays.
                At the end of all the process (and by that I mean legislative process informing
        administrative process), the courts can and will decide whether either branch has overstepped
        the constitutional constraints they are expected to abide. But the legislature certainly has a role
        to play in the process, and it is now, or yesterday, not tomorrow or next week.
                For the U of M to argue a position which so misunderstands the basic operation of a
        separation of powers system would be a bit embarrassing in my view.
                I also want to note that 6 regents of the University have taken the position that
        graduate students are employees and I respect their opinion. However, 2 regents and the
        president, the deans, SACUA, and 800 faculty and students disagree the University has opposed
        all requests to let them participate in the MERC process. As Mary Sue Coleman said in May in
        response to the regental resolution which passed 6-2, this move could fundamentally alter the
        relationship between faculty and graduate students. Research assistants are not employees of
        the University, but students, she said. They learn from the researchers with whom they work
        and go on to even greater discoveries as they take ownership of their shared scholarly study and
        then build on it." Perhaps the legislative process now underway will reflect the views of the
        larger university community and the state and therefore better inform the administrative process
        as well. A process that allows for competing views and operates in the open shouldn't be so
        scary to us, it should be what we aim for.

Discussion

        Regent Richner expressed agreement with Regent Newman's comments. He
found the notice for this meeting to be inadequate and would have preferred to table
this motion to allow for more public input and to have a more thoughtful and broader
discussion. He noted the bill under consideration codifies the current MERC rulings
which pronounce GSRAs are students and is consistent with the laws in other states.
The proposed amendment to PERA is consistent with the views of numerous students,
faculty, deans, and the president who have encouraged the University to undertake
action to protect the existing relationship between GSRAs and their faculty advisors,
which has been described as that between mentee and mentor. He said that MERC's
1981 ruling concluded, "the assistantship is a form of support like the athletic
scholarship which provides financial support for the student to attend school. The
essential nature of the relationship is educational." He concluded that he opposed the
motion and believed the board should support the legislation, rather than oppose it.

        Regent White supported the motion, but expressed concerns that there should be
adequate notice to hold meetings. Regent White noted it was her understanding
President Coleman had called the meeting.


263






February 21, 2012 Special Meeting


       Regent Ilitch expressed support for the motion and noted that she firmly
believes in "the freedom of choice and it is a value that I believe codifies the University
of Michigan."
       Regent Maynard found Regent Deitch' s motion to be very articulate and
possibly more detailed than required. However, she firmly believes the University
should advocate against the adoption of SB 971 and she supported the motion.
       Regent Newman requested clarification as to whether the vice president for
government relations would continue to report to the entire board because the motion
states the vice president for government relations would report to the chair. Regent
Deitch noted he would accept an amendment to clarify that the vice president for
government relations would report to the entire board through the chair. Regent Taylor
noted that voting on an amendment was unnecessary if this was the intent of the
motion, and Regent Deitch agreed that it was the intent.
       Regent Darlow commented that the context of the SB 971 legislative hearing
today requires expeditious action on this motion. She noted that PERA is general
legislation that is appropriate and not in conflict with the University's constitutional
autonomy. However, she expressed concerns with legislation, such as SB 971, that
specifically targets universities may infringe upon the University's autonomy.
Regarding Regent Deitch' s motion, the phrase "all available action" should be
interpreted as action deemed to be appropriate and most effective by the chair and the
vice president for government relations within the context of a "changing and unique
legislative environment." Regent Deitch agreed that "appropriate" should be added to
the motion. She expressed support for the motion.
       Regent Taylor noted that there have been plenty of comments on this issue and
his position is "crystal clear."
       The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved, with Regents Darlow,
Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Taylor, and White in favor, and Regents Newman and Richner
opposed.
Adjournment
       There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 8:40 a.m.

MARCH MEETING, 2012


                                                        The University of Michigan
                                                                        Ann Arbor
                                                                   March 15, 2012

       The regents met at 3:15 p.m. in the Pendleton Room, Michigan Union. Present
were President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman,
Richner, and Taylor. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Forrest, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Harper, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President
Rudgers, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent White participated by phone.
Call to Order
       President Coleman called the meeting to order and asked Vice President
Churchill to comment on the meeting venue. Vice President Churchill noted that the
Regents' Room in the Fleming Administration Building, which has been used as the
site of the regular regents' meetings for many decades, may no longer be an adequate
venue for regents' meetings. She also noted that from time to time, regents do meet in
different venues. The location, format, and other aspects of the monthly meetings will
be evolving in the coming months as the details are ironed out about different options
and venues.
President's Remarks
       President Coleman commented on a number of honors the University had
received in the past month, including the 2012 Senator Paul Simon Award for
Comprehensive Internationalization, being ranked 12th among private and public
institutions world-wide in the 2012 Times Higher Education World Reputation
Rankings, and being the recipient of a $10 million gift from the Dow Chemical
Company to support 300 students in a new fellowship program aimed at helping solve
the world's most pressing sustainability challenges.
       President Coleman reported on progress regarding the internal audit of the case
involving the pediatrics resident, and on the board's directive to engage an external
team to examine this matter. She announced that retired University senior auditor Fred
White has been hired to implement the recommendations stemming from the internal
audit, and to serve as liaison for the external review.
       President Coleman also reported that during her recent testimony to the House
Higher Education Appropriations Subcommittee, she had shared her goal of the state
resuming its position as among the top ten in state funding for higher education.
       President Coleman then introduced Ronald Zernicke, dean of the School of
Kinesiology.
School of Kinesiology: Innovation and Impact
       Dean Zernicke outlined the history of the school, noting that it is ranked 5th
nationally by the National Academy of Kinesiology, up from 18t five years ago. The


265






March Meeting, 2012


school has the 4th largest undergraduate enrollment on campus, and graduate enrollment
has increased by 11% in the past year. About half of kinesiology undergraduates go on
to graduate school. Dean Zernicke outlined some of the areas in which the school is
having an impact on society, including interdisciplinary programs focusing on physical
activity and pediatric obesity, rehabilitation robotics, economic and urban development
with sport, upper limb training and assessment, and sport, health and athletic
performance.
       Dean Zernicke described innovation that is differentiating the UM kinesiology
program from others and the strategic collaborations that are occurring among
kinesiology faculty and faculty of other schools and colleges on campus.
Committee Reports
       Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that the committee, consisting of
herself, Regent Richner, and Regent Maynard had met that morning with Executive
Vice President Slottow. The first item was a review with the University's external
auditors of the FY2011 A-133 audit and a follow up on prior years' comments and
observations. Importantly, the University qualified as a low-risk subject for the A-133
audit. No questioned costs or material weaknesses, or significant deficiencies in
internal controls, financial reporting, or major federal programs were identified. The
committee  also  discussed  the  FY2012  audit plan. In   addition  to  the
PricewatershouseCoopers auditor team, other participants in this session included
Associate Vice President Rowan Miranda, Executive Director of University Audits
Carol Senneff, University Controller Cheryl Soper, and Health System CFO Paul
Castillo. Committee members then met privately with the auditors, and were satisfied
with the interaction between the auditors and University officials. The second agenda
item was a discussion with Mr. Miranda, Ms. Senneff, Ms. Soper, and Mr. Castillo
about plans for the FY2013 external audit. The committee also discussed the search for
a new executive director of internal audits with Ms. Soper, chair of the search
committee. The final agenda item involved a discussion of the Ross School executive
residence and revenue diversification with Dean Davis-Blake, Provost Hanlon, and
Sean O'Neal, chief financial officer of the Ross School.
       Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor, chair
of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that he and
Regent Ilitch had held a brief meeting, also attended by Provost Hanlon and President
Coleman. Provost Hanlon had provided an update on various searches and related
personnel matters. Following this short session, the committee joined the Health
Affairs Committee.
       Health Affairs Committee. Regent Darlow reported that the committee,
consisting of herself, Regent Newman, and Regent Deitch, met with Executive Vice
President Pescovitz and Dean Woolliscroft. For the first agenda item, the
Cardiovascular Center (CVC) strategic plan, they were joined by Linda Lami, chief
administrative officer of the CVC, and Drs. Pinsky, Prager, and Stanley. The
discussion included a report on Project Healthy Schools, a program sponsored by the
CVC whose goal is to reduce childhood obesity and improve long-term health


266






March Meeting, 2012


outcomes for middle school children. Drs. Pescovitz and Woolliscroft then updated the
committee on the recent Medical School LCME accreditation visit. President Coleman,
Secretary Churchill, and Regents Taylor and Ilitch then joined the meeting for a
discussion with Dr. Karin Muraszko, chair of the Department of Neurosurgery, and Mr.
Tony Denton, UMHHC chief operating officer, for a discussion of the possible

tributaries including research in Lake Michigan on yellow perch larvae, lake trout
reproduction on offshore reefs, and exotic species such as round and tubenose gobies
and zebra and quagga mussels. In the Muskegon River, Dr. Jude's research focused on
toxic substances, burbot, deep-water sculpin, and larval fish distributions. Dr. Jude's
work has greatly expanded our understanding of fish population dynamics and provided
vital clues to understanding entire life cycles. He is a well-known scientist to fishery
ecologists nationally and internationally.
       Dr. Jude has taught courses on Great Lakes aquatic field methods and Great
Lakes aquatic ecosystems. Dr. Jude's outgoing personality and wonderful sense of
humor have engaged many students who have passed through his lab and have gone on
to have successful careers in fisheries biology.

APRIL 2, 2012 SPECIAL MEETING


                                                           The University of Michigan
                                                                           Ann Arbor
                                                                         April 2, 2012

       The regents convened at 3:30 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were Regent
Darlow, President Coleman, Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Provost Hanlon,
Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice
President Slottow, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regents Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard,
Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White participated by phone. David Fink and Darryl
Bressack, outside counsel from the firm of Fink + Associates Law, also participated by
phone.
Call to Order
       President Coleman called the meeting to order and called on Vice President
Scarnecchia. Vice President Scarnecchia announced that the original purpose of the
special meeting was to determine whether the University would take an official position
in the challenge to the immediate effect of the GSRA bill that passed recently in the
state legislature. In the meantime, she noted, the Ingham County Circuit Court has
made a decision on this issue, and she read the following statement:
        "The Ingham County trial court ruled from the bench this afternoon in favor of the plaintiffs, the
Democratic representatives. The judge stayed or halted the immediate effect of the GSRA bill, but not
the substance of the bill. We will still meet today, and the question, I believe, and we can discuss this,
would be whether or not to file an amicus brief with the trial court-and today the judge said that he
would allow such a filing-and then also whether we would file an amicus brief if the matter is appealed
by the Republicans to the Michigan Court of Appeals."
       Vice President Scarnecchia noted that outside counselors David Fink and Darryl
Bressack were on the line, and that Mr. Bressack had attended the hearing that day.
Mr. Fink observed that the defendants are expected to appeal this judgment, and that it
was relevant to the pending matter in that the judge had stayed the immediate effect
with respect to Public Act 45. As a result, the University would again be asking the
Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC) to move forward with the
pending representation petition.
       Mr. Fink also noted that the judge indicated that the legislature is not precluded
from voting on the immediate effect. Thus, the legislature could conceivably take up
the matter again to attempt a two-thirds vote.
       Regent Taylor said that he had been prepared to make a motion directing
counsel to file a friend of the court brief prior to the judge issuing his decision.
However, given the fact that the judge stated he would still accept amicus briefs, he was
making a motion to direct counsel to file an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs in
the Ingham County case, and in any other courts throughout the course of this litigation
through any appeals. Regent Ilitch seconded the motion.
       Regent Maynard stated that after careful consideration, she had decided it would
not be useful to file an amicus brief, so she would not support the motion.


293






April 2, 2012 Special Meeting


       Regent Richner asked about the administration's view of the motion. President
Coleman responded that she had made her comments last year. She noted that while
the administration had not considered the issue, it is within the board's purview to
decide. Regent Richner inquired whether there had been other cases in which the board
had directed the administration to file an amicus brief. Vice President Scarnecchia
replied that this had not happened during the time she had served as general counsel.
President Coleman observed that it would be a rare occurrence but that it is certainly
within the board's prerogative.
       Regent Deitch observed that the board had fully supported the administration in
taking the appeal of the affirmative action case to the United States Supreme Court.
Regent Newman responded that this was not equivalent to the current situation.
       Regent Newman commented that she does not believe it is appropriate to file a
brief, since "the University's interest is tangential, at best, and we should not be
involved in legislative procedural issues." She noted that "she finds the circumstances
of this meeting to be troubling." She believes that the topic of the special meeting
should be included in the notice of the meeting, and that "there is nothing to be gained
from not having public comment on the issue, and that we should have had public
comment." She said she would not be supporting the motion.
       Regent Richner commented that it is not appropriate for the regents to be taking
a position on either side of a political spat between the Democratic and Republican
parties, noting, "I think it is unprecedented, and will have long term implications that
we may regret." He pointed out that in the past, the University has taken positions in
favor of "immediate effect" of certain legislation, and that this case goes well beyond
the issue of whether graduate student research assistants are public employees.
       Regent Ilitch stated that she "deeply disagrees" with the observations on
noticing of special meetings. "We have conducted ourselves as we have always
conducted ourselves with respect to notice." She said she is in support of Regent
Taylor's motion, and that due process is in order in this case. She stated that criticism
of the board for taking political positions on legislative matters should also include the
propriety of regents testifying on behalf of the legislation.
       Regent Deitch commented that "the University is an institution that is about
speech and protecting the right of the minority to be heard." He observed that the rules
of due process were not followed with respect to the request for a roll call vote in the
legislature. He said that "What transpired was inconsistent with our institutional
values, in my judgment."
       Regent Newman stated her belief that the issue is not about due process or about
the University's principles or free and open speech. Rather, it is about House
procedural issues, used by both Democrats and Republicans. She expressed her hope
that in accordance with the principles of free speech, when special meetings are
convened in the future, the topic of the meeting will be mentioned in the meeting
announcement so that people will have an opportunity to comment on the topic.
       The vote was then taken, and the motion passed, with Regents Darlow, Deitch,
Ilitch, Taylor, and White in favor, and Regents Maynard, Newman, and Richner
opposed.

were President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Harper, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,
Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President Rudgers, Vice
President Scarnecchia, and Executive Vice President Slottow. Vice President Wilbanks
arrived at about 4:55 p.m. Regents Deitch and Taylor were absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
        President Coleman called the meeting to order. She noted that Dr. Sanjay
Gupta would be speaking at Spring Commencement the following weekend. She
observed that during the past month, two Michigan students had been selected as
Truman Scholars and two as Goldwater Scholars, five faculty had been elected to the
Academy of Arts and Sciences and three had been selected as Guggenheim Scholars.
President Coleman commented on the passing of journalist Mike Wallace, a devoted
alumnus, noting that he had founded the Knight-Wallace Fellows Program, provided
the building that houses the program, and was a founding judge of the Livingston
Awards, which operates out of Wallace House. A video presentation followed, narrated
by Professor Charles Eisendrath, director of the Knight-Wallace Fellows Program.
       President Coleman asked Vice President Churchill to comment on the meeting
venue. She noted that as part of the on-going evaluation of meeting venues, today's
meeting space, the Rogel Ballroom, is able to accommodate three times as many people
as the Regents' Room.
The Application of High-Throughput Sequencing for the Personalization of
Cancer Therapy
       President Coleman then introduced Arul Chinnaiyan, Director, Michigan Center
for Translational Pathology, and S.P. Hicks Endowed Professor of Pathology and
Urology. Dr. Chinnaiyan described a new protocol established at the Center for
Translational Pathology in the Cancer Center to define the molecular basis of an
individual cancer and match cancer therapies in a more personalized fashion. The
genome of an individual cancer patient's tumor can be defined and compared to their
normal genome so that therapies can be matched in a personalized fashion. He noted
that the University of Michigan is one of the leading institutions in bringing this
technology to patient care, and the effort is being led by several multidisciplinary
teams.
       President Coleman pointed out that in addition to the work he described in the
presentation, Dr. Chinnaiyan has also developed new tests for prostate cancer that are
far more accurate than those previously available.


297






April Meeting, 2012


       Regent Richner commented that "this is absolutely phenomenal," and asked Dr.
Chinnaiyan how the regents could help in supporting this work. Dr. Chinnaiyan noted
that the University has been very supportive in providing resources necessary to
establish the infrastructure that has allowed the center to attract significant extramural
funding.

April 30, 2012.
        Professor Perlove received her B.A. degree from New York University in 1968,

April Meeting, 2012


Idealization of Death (1990), and co-author, with Larry Silver, of Rembrandt's Faith:
Church and Temple in the Dutch Golden Age (2009). The latter received the Roland H.
Bainton Book Prize from the Sixteenth Century Society in 2010. From 2011-12, she
was a member of the scientific team and a special consultant for the Rembrandt and the
Face of Jesus exhibition organized by the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Musde du
Louvre, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Professor Perlove taught a wide variety
of undergraduate courses in art history. She was instrumental in the development of the
museum studies track in the art history major, teaching four museum practice seminars,
and working with her students to develop five different museum exhibitions and four
exhibition catalogues.
       In addition to serving on numerous University committees, Professor Perlove
was a board member and president of the Midwest Art History Society, an elected
board member of Historians of Netherlandish Art, and a committee chair for the
College Art Association. She received the State Association of Governing Boards'

service by naming Shelley K. Perlove professor emerita of art history.

       Roger Tourangeau, Ph.D., research professor in the Survey Research Center,
Institute for Social Research, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2011.
       Professor Tourangeau received his B.A. degree from Cornell University in 1973

1997, he joined The Gallup Organization. Professor Tourangeau joined the University
of Michigan faculty as a senior research scientist (now research professor) in 2000.
       Professor Tourangeau is well known for his methodological research on the
impact of different modes of data collection and on the cognitive processes underlying
survey responses. He is the lead author of The Psychology of Survey Response (2000),
a classic reference book that examines the processes through which survey respondents
answer questions. His research interests involve the cognitive bases for answers to
survey questions, applied sampling, the impact of the mode of data collection on the
accuracy of the information collected, web surveys, and methods for improving survey
questionnaires.
       Professor Tourangeau has been acting director (2006) and associate director
(2007-08) of the Michigan Program in Survey Methodology, and also served as director
of the Joint Program in Survey Methodology, sponsored by the University of Maryland
and the University of Michigan (2001-08, 2009-11). He was elected a Fellow of the
American Statistical Association in 1999. In 2002, he received the Helen Dinerman
Award for his work on the cognitive aspects of survey methodology, the highest honor
given by the World Association for Public Opinion Research. In 2005, he received the
American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Innovators Award. He
was chair of the Survey Research Methods Section of the American Statistical
Association in 2006, and has served on the AAPOR executive council three times.

May Meeting, 2012


              As the University's top legal official, Vice President Scarnecchia
       has guided the institution through a number of complex and challenging
       issues, including the NCAA investigation into the football program,
       acquisition of the North Campus Research Complex, and reform of the
       Department of Public Safety's trespass policy. She also developed the
       University's first comprehensive compliance program and website,
       which has dramatically enhanced awareness of compliance issues,
       activities, and obligations across the University community. Within the
       Office of the General Counsel, Vice President Scarnecchia is admired
       and respected as a strong, compassionate, supportive leader who "walks
       the walk," exemplifying her commitment to upholding the highest ideals
       of the profession. Her colleagues in the Fleming Administration
       Building will miss her ready smile, warm manner, and uncommon grace.

       and General Counsel Suellyn Scarnecchia, and send all best wishes as she
       returns to the faculty of the University of Michigan Law School.

                 office in each case for three years, but in no event will any member of the senate serve
                 more than two consecutive terms, except that if a member be appointed to fill an
                 unexpired term of less than half of a full term, this will not make that member ineligible
                 for two full terms. The terms of senate members will be staggered so that two terms
                 will expire each year. The panel from which the appointments are made will be

                 appointive senate membership will occur from causes other than the completion of the
                 appointive term, the president is authorized to make an interim appointment from the
                 most recent panel of names submitted by the Senate Advisory Committee on University

                 members will serve three year terms, which terms will be staggered so that they are not
                 concurrent. The panel from which the appointments are made will contain twice the
                 number of appointees. If a vacancy in the appointive alumni/ae membership will occur
                 from causes other than the completion of the appointive term, the president is
                 authorized to make an interim appointment from the most recent panel of names
                 submitted by the board of directors of the University of Michigan Alumni Association;

                 least twice the number of appointees. If a vacancy in the appointive student athlete

                 the president is authorized to make an interim appointment from the most recent panel
                 of names submitted by Michigan StdentAssembly Central Student Government; or, if

                                                                    June 21, 2012

       The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Rogel Ballroom, Michigan Union.
Present were President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard,
Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary
Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Harper, Chancellor
Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz,
Vice President Rudgers, Interim Vice President Kowich, Executive Vice President
Slottow, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order
       President Coleman called the meeting to order and announced that the
June meeting marks the nomination and election of the new chair and vice chair of the
board. She commented on the critical importance of the leadership and counsel
provided by the board chair, and noted how much she valued and appreciated Regent
Ilitch's wisdom and advice during the past year. She thanked Regent Ilitch for her
leadership as chair, and Regent Deitch for his contributions as vice chair, during the
past year. She then called on Regent Ilitch.
Comments from Regent Ilitch
       Regent Ilitch said it had been a privilege to work with President Coleman
on a closer basis and thanked her for her tireless efforts and commitment to the
University. She thanked each regent in turn for their work on the committees on which
they serve and their devotion to other aspects of their duties as board members. She
presented Regent Deitch with a gavel in anticipation of his upcoming service as chair.
       Regent Ilitch announced that at her request, Michigan Creative, part of the
Office of the Vice President for Global Communications and Strategic Initiatives, had
prepared a video recognizing events at the University and accomplishments of the
regents during the past year. She acknowledged the producers of the video, who
are members of Filmic Productions, an award-winning group of student filmmakers
who are serving as summer interns at Michigan Creative. The video was then presented.
Election of Board Officers for 2011-2012
        Regent Deitch thanked Regent Ilitch for her extraordinary leadership and
service. He noted that she is a person who "does not typically buy into the conventional
wisdom when it doesn't make sense to her," and commented on her good judgment.
       Regent Ilitch noted that the Regents' Bylaws state that the positions of chair
and vice chair of the board rotate based on seniority until all members of the board
have had the opportunity to serve in these positions. She therefore moved the
nomination of Regent Laurence Deitch as chair of the Board of Regents and Regent
Andrea Newman as vice chair, effective July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2013. Regent
White seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

June Meeting, 2012


Introductory Comments Regarding Proposed 2012-2013 Revenue and
Expenditure Operating Budgets
       President Coleman commented that the agenda includes the review and
approval of the University's 2012-13 budgets. She noted that the overall objective in
developing the budgets is the continued excellence of the University, and the proposed
budget demonstrates the shared commitment of the University's leadership to
maintaining the institution's strengths in teaching, research, and patient care, while
making its academic environment available to all students regardless of financial
need. She thanked Provost Hanlon for his work on the budget, which continues to
maintain the highest standards while working within very tight economic constraints.
She reported that with the board's approval, resident students with financial need
will pay less to attend the University than was the case eight years ago, and that the
financial aid budget will cover the full impact of the tuition increase for the neediest
students. Furthermore, the aid will be in the form of grants, not loans, reducing student
debt burden. She then called on Executive Vice President Tim Slottow.
2012-2013 Operating Budgets - All Campuses
       Executive Vice President Slottow gave a presentation focusing on the
University's balance sheet, which is one indicator of the overall strength of the
University. He noted that adhering to sound financial principles and policies is critical
to protecting the overall health of the balance sheet, and as a foremost principle, it is
crucial that recurring budget gaps be filled with recurring revenues and recurring cost
reductions, as opposed to being funded with one-time fund balances or ignored.
Maintaining strong internal controls is also crucial for protecting the balance sheet,
and he reported that the University has completed its seventh year of annual
certification by 42 senior executives of academic and administrative units. Each year,
additional areas are identified that require certification.
       Turning to the balance sheet, Executive Vice President Slottow pointed out that
the relationship between total assets and total liabilities is strong, with total net
assets of $11.1 billion compared to total liabilities of $4.8 billion. However, he pointed
out that the majority of financial assets are long-term assets with restricted uses, which
limits flexibility. Another weakness of the balance sheet is the approximately $600
million in deferred maintenance. This year, it is likely that this year the University will
receive about $75 million in capital outlay from the state, for the first time in a
number of years. Other threats to the balance sheet are more difficult to project and
to develop strong strategies against. With the direction and advice of the regents,
however, actions have been taken to protect the university from such threats as rising
health care costs, post-retirement health benefits, adjustments to the endowment
spending rule, and issuing bonds.
       Executive Vice President Slottow noted that the Long Term Portfolio consists of
approximately 7,000 unique endowments. At the behest of the regents, a strategic effort
to grow endowment to support the General Fund began '7 years ago. This effort has
so far raised $233 million in new endowment, providing $12 million in new annual
revenue for the General Fund in FY2012 and on-going General Fund support of


354






June Meeting, 2012


approximately $217 million in FY2012, primarily for scholarships, professorships, and
academic programs. Overall, about 10.5% of the General Fund is supported by
endowment distribution. Other revenue strategies to supplement the General Fund
include identifying additional recurring and one-time external revenue sources and
internal reallocations. In FY2012, $69 million in annual revenues and $40 million in
one- time revenues were used to supplement the General Fund in FY2012.
       Executive Vice President Slottow noted that the University owns a vast number
of physical assets that need to be maintained, and described how commitment to
renewal of the physical plant of about $500 million annually pays off by both
mitigating the need for building replacement and reducing the annual operating costs
of buildings. He also pointed out how the University's commitment to sustainability
efforts has yielded decreased use of total energy, emissions, and water usage when
normalized per person from FY2004-FY2011. The Planet Blue initiative has
resulted in an 8% reduction in energy costs. Other initiatives, such as purchase of
hybrid buses, adoption of new construction standards, new lighting systems, and a bike
rental program, have also been adopted to further the University's sustainability goals.
       Executive Vice President Slottow then turned to human capital, noting that
more than 65% of operating budgets are expended on salaries and benefits.
Administrators are cognizant of the fact that 40% of faculty and staff are eligible for
retirement in the next five years, so leadership training and succession planning will
be a key focus. He reported that the ongoing MHealthy initiative has resulted in
statistically-significant movement of participants from high- risk to low-risk categories
for health and well-being.
       Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the University's highest possible
credit ratings were recently reaffirmed by Standard & Poor's and Moody's. The debt
plan calls for assuming up to $2.2 billion in debt over the next eight years, and the
current cost of debt is about 2.3% on the current portfolio of $1.8 billion. This prudent
debt management policy has helped provide relief for the operating budget, while
restructuring of post-retirement health benefits over the past several years has resulted
in a significant reduction of this liability.
       Executive Vice President Slottow concluded that the proposed budgets are
completely consistent with maintaining the financial health of the University. He
acknowledged all of the individuals from across the University who had contributed to
the development of various segments of the overall budgets.
2012-2013 Operating Budgets-All Campuses
       Provost Hanlon reported that total recommended operating revenues will
increase from $6 billion to $6.3 billion in FY 2012-2013, an increase of 5.4%. General
Fund revenues are projected to increase by 4.1%, the Designated Fund by a negligible
amount, the Auxiliary Fund by 9%, and the Expendable Restricted Fund is projected to
decline by 1.2%. Total budgeted expenditures do not equal total revenues, due to the
fact that auxiliary funds operate with a small negative margin.

June Meeting, 2012


Proposed Ann Arbor General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and
Fee Rates for FY 2012-2013
       Provost Hanlon commended the budget teams from the provost's office and
CFO's office who work with academic administrators to develop the budget, noting that
"this is the finest such pair of teams in all of higher education." He reported that the
Ann Arbor campus general fund budget follows an integrated academic strategy and
financial plan. Budget priorities include innovation in teaching and research,
maintaining academic excellence, and ensuring access and affordability. The budget
continues the practice of strong fiscal discipline, aggressive cost containment, and
building on the continuing success of generating philanthropic resources.
       Provost Hanlon noted that the leadership skills today's graduates will need
include not only the traditional skills of college graduates, but also include having the
ability to re-invent themselves, to have command of new information technologies, to
have the confidence to innovate and take risks, the ability to lead in small groups and
flat organizations, and to work effectively with people from diverse backgrounds and
cultures and in new settings. He described two Michigan programs that impart these
skills: an experiential learning and research project for undergraduate and graduate
students in Kenya in conjunction with the University of Nairobi, and the College of
Engineering design immersion project for new freshmen students.
       Provost Hanlon noted that the proposed 2012-2013 General Fund budget
provides key investments in academic excellence (recruiting and retaining faculty,
enhancing students' academic experience, planning for the renewal of key facilities,
and maintaining the distinction of the library collection) and financial aid (an increase
in centrally awarded financial aid, including 10.1% increase in centrally-awarded
undergraduate financial aid). Funding for the renewal of aging buildings will be
financed from reductions in spending. Provost Hanlon pointed out that with the
additional financial aid, typical resident students with financial need will see no
increase in the cost of attendance. Furthermore, financial aid for the lowest income
students is completely covered with grants and scholarships, as opposed to loans.
Overall, the loan burden incorporated into financial aid packages has declined in
recent years. Provost Hanlon reported that the University's efforts to maintain access
and affordability have proven effective, as shown by the fact that its net price increase
is lower than 567 of 650 public institutions surveyed in a recent U.S. Department of
Education report on college affordability and transparency.
       Provost Hanlon reported that the budget assumes a state appropriation of $273.1
million, an increase of $4.3 million (1.6%) over FY2012. While the University
appreciates the state's recent efforts to invest in higher education, taken in context, the
FY2013 state appropriation is comparable to that of 1992 in nominal dollars, 1964 in
inflation-adjusted dollars, and per student, has declined by more than 50% over the
past decade. In 1960, almost 80% of the general fund came from state appropriation,
and 20% in tuition and fees. Currently, however, state appropriation makes up only
about 17% of the general fund and tuition and fees about '70%. Provost Hanlon noted
that ongoing cost containment efforts have saved $235 million in recurring General


356






June Meeting, 2012


Fund costs since FY2004, and this year's recommendation incorporates an
additional cost reduction of 1.9%, or over $30 million.
       The recommended tuition increase for resident undergraduate students is 2.8%,
and for non-resident undergraduate students is 3.5%. Resident and non-resident
graduate student tuition will increase by 3.0%. The recommended FY 2013 General
Fund budget for the Ann Arbor campus is $1,649,140, an increase of 3.9% over FY
2012. The expenditure budget focuses on the core mission of academics; the largest
categories of increase are 5.1% for schools and colleges, 82.9% for the capital
renewal fund for academic buildings (being developed over a three-year period), and
7.8% for financial aid. The lowest increases are in administrative areas.
       Provost Hanlon concluded that the proposed budget will maintain academic
excellence and affordability, even during a period of historic reductions in public
support. This has been made possible because of the board's continuing insistence on
cost containment, efficiency of operations, and multi-year planning.
Proposed Dearborn Campus FY 2012-2013 General Fund Operating Budget
       Chancellor Little reported that the primary goals in developing the Dearborn
campus budget were to continue to maintain the high quality of its academic programs,
to maintain and attempt to expand affordability and access, and to maintain a fair and
equitable work environment for faculty and staff. The campus is committed to financial
stability and sustainability, and for this it must rely on recurring revenues and recurring
cost reductions.
       The proposed tuition increase of 3.7% for undergraduate and graduate students
is made possible by a larger than expected state appropriation increase of 4.2%. The
budget includes a 2% salary program and 1% for contingency funds. The financial
aid budget will increase by 15%, and funding is being proposed to address enrollment
growth costs.
Proposed Flint Campus FY 2012-2013 General Fund Operating Budget
       Chancellor Person reported that the University of Michigan-Flint budget
incorporates a three-year strategy, through 2015, focusing on identifying new revenue
streams and cost savings. The campus is planning for an enrollment increase of
between 2-4% in three years, to be accomplished partly by developing new programs,
increasing the number international students and veterans, and other initiatives. She
noted that investments are being made to improve energy efficiency that will save
money in the long run. The proposed budget assumes an enrollment increase of
0.7% for undergraduates and 7.9% for graduate students. Proposed tuition and fees
for 2012-2013 will increase by 3.6% for undergraduate students and 2.8% for graduate
students, and a 5.8% increase in financial aid. The budget also incorporates a 2%
salary program for faculty and staff. Chancellor Person noted that tuition on the Flint
campus has consistently been in the bottom third state-wide.

June Meeting, 2012


2012-2013 University Housing Residence Hall and Northwood Community
Apartments Rates
       Vice President Harper noted that ongoing capital needs and operating support
for the residential communities requires that University Housing maintain a proper
balance between adequate revenues and affordable room and board rates and apartment
rental fees. The division continually strives to recommend minimal rate increases
without sacrificing key services and programs. For FY2013, University Housing has
identified cost savings of about $1.7 million, enabling it to recommend an average
room and board rate increase of 1.0% for operations and 2.0% for renovations
included in the Residential Life Initiative, an increase of about $284 per year.
Northwood Community Apartments rates will increase by 1.0%, or about $10.00
per month.
Proposed 2012-2013 University of Michigan-Flint Residence Hall Rates
       Chancellor Person submitted a recommendation for an average room and board
rate increase on the Flint campus of 3.0%.
2012-2013 Fee Assessments for Central Student Government (CSG), Student
Legal Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
       Vice President Harper recommended no change in student fee assessments, and
requested reauthorization of the current rates of $7.19 per student per term for CSG,
$8.50 per student per term for SLS, and $1.50 per student per term for school and
college governments.
2012-2013 University Health Service Fee
       Vice President Harper submitted a recommendation for a 1.4% increase
($2.50) in the University Health Service fee, bringing the total fee to $174.90 per
student per term.
Proposed FY 2013 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers
(UMHHC) Operating Budget
       Mr. Doug Strong, chief executive officer of the UMHHC, presented the
proposed FY 2013 UMHHC operating budget. Mr. Strong noted that during FY2012,
the UMHHC opened the new children's and women's hospital and a renovated and
enlarged emergency department, and had undertaken a multi-year electronic health
record data ("MiChart") project. Patient care quality and safety and patient satisfaction
scores had improved. He noted that the financial and operating plan embedded within
the Health System strategic plan, along with the proposed budget, will enable the
achievement of the Health System's long term vision and will position it for future
success.
       Mr. Strong described UMHHC 3-year initiatives in support of the strategic and
financial plan. He noted that the FY2012 operating margin results are anticipated to be
substantially better than the original budget, resulting in a forecasted -0.5% margin for
FY12 and an improvement in the FY20 13 plan yielding a positive operating margin of
0.5%, for an improvement of about 1%. He pointed out that low operating margins have


358






June Meeting, 2012


historically been associated with the opening of major new facilities. The expectation is
that in the future, the operating margin will stabilize at about 4%.
       Mr. Strong noted that the University of Michigan is the only health system in
the state that sees patients from every county in the state. The UMHHC has had a
10-year trend of growth in the number of adjusted cases over time, with a
compound growth rate of over 4%.
       Revenue per adjusted case has also increased, although it is anticipated to drop
in FY2013 due to constraints imposed by payers. While total expense per adjusted
case increased during the past year due to the opening of the children's and
women's facility, this metric is expected to decrease to a more favorable level
during FY2013. He reviewed recent activity growth trends, forecasts for FY2012, and
plans in each category for FY2013.
       Mr. Strong reviewed plans for capacity creation in FY2013. Challenges facing
the health system include reimbursement uncertainties, the ability to sustain patient
activity growth, continued implantation of electronic health records, and execution of
productivity improvements. He also reviewed a three-year plan for operating
improvements for FY2013-FY2016, which include initiatives to create clinical
capacity and foster revenue growth. Mr. Strong concluded that the UMHHC is a
financially health organization that is well-positioned to respond to the challenging
environment so that its success will be assured for years to come.
FY 2013 University of Michigan Department of Athletics Operating Budget
       Mr. David Brandon, Donald R. Shepherd Director of Athletics, reported that the
department's sustained operating margins have allowed it to significantly invest in
facilities. The department is in a sound financial position and has sufficient funds to be
able to continue investing in its physical plant. For FY2012, the department
experienced a 6.2% increase in revenue growth and a projected surplus of more than
$15 million. In FY2013, facilities revenues will be increasing, but revenues from
spectator admissions will decrease due to fewer home football games. Thus, for
FY2013 the budgeted revenue surplus will decrease to about $5.8 million. He pointed
out that the Athletic Department is assuming responsibility for the Radrick Farms golf
course, which will increase both revenues and costs. The expense budget for FY2013 is
about $124.5 million.
       Mr. Brandon pointed out that it will be important going forward for the
department to continue to manage its considerable debt load, while at the same time,
continuing to invest in facilities. He noted that recent major facility projects have
significantly increased depreciation expenses, but the department is nevertheless
continuing to grow its investments in plant and equipment. He concluded by describing
future projects that are in the planning stages, including the renovation of Schembechler
Hall, renovation and expansion of the field hockey facility, painting Michigan Stadium,
an addition to the softball stadium, and development of a facility for men's and
women's lacrosse, among other projects.

June Meeting, 2012


Comments on Proposed 2012-2013 Budgets
       Regent Ilitch. Regent Ilitch noted that tuition "continues to skyrocket, and the
burden on our students continues to be brutal." She observed that students at the
University of Michigan and across the state have to "pay a constant premium to receive
a Michigan education," which fewer can afford to do, as indicated by the fact that 60%
of Michigan college graduates have loan debt upon graduation. Noting that higher
education in general is becoming a luxury that is out of reach to more and more
individuals, Regent Ilitch commended President Coleman and Provost Hanlon for the
progress they have made in "acting in a more economically astute fashion." However,
she said it is important "to find new ways to add revenue, to continue to act in a more
efficient fashion, and to change the paradigm to approach this challenging problem."
       She noted that it is no longer possible for students to work their way through
public universities without assuming an unreasonable debt burden, and said, "I won't
ask students to pay more if I think we can do more." The state's constant trend of not
investing in higher education "is inexcusable and appalling," she said. "We must
invest in education on all fronts, and lift our young people so we have a highly
educated generation to complete globally and flourish in the years to come.'
       Regent Darlow. Regent Darlow commented that she shares with Regent
Ilitch and the other regents the concern about affordability and access for middle and
lower income students. However, she noted that the focus on the "sticker price" of
tuition ignores progress that has been made in affordability for middle-income resident
students (those with incomes of $100,000 or less). She pointed out that because of
increases in financial aid in recent years, middle income students are actually paying
less than they would have paid in 2004, despite any increases in the "sticker price." She
urged that the difference between the sticker price and net price be communicated to
potential students state-wide.
       Regent Darlow said she supports this budget because it "addresses and serves
the needs of our middle income students" by either maintaining the status quo or
improving their financial aid status over previous years, and praised the efforts of all
who have worked on it.
Proposed Ann Arbor Campus 2012-2013 General Fund Operating Budget
       Regent White moved approval of the proposed Ann Arbor Campus 2012-2013

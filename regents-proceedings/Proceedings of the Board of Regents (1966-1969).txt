The Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer filed a progress
report on plant extension. He said the skilled trades, including the
reinforcing steel workers, had reached settlements and were back at
work on the University's construction projects. However, shortages of
man power among the carpenters, brickmasons and plasterers, and the
mechanical and electrical trades still required overtime work.
Continuing, the Vice-President said Unit I of the Vera Baits Houses
(p. 37), formerly known as Cedar Bend Houses, would be ready for
occupancy on or before the beginning of the fall term.
The Vice-President said construction on the following projects was
progressing: Administrative Office Building, Alumni Hall Remodeling,
Bursley Hall, C. S. Mott Children's Hospital, Vera Baits Houses Unit II,
Dental Building, East Medical Center Parking Structure, Fletcher Street
Parking Structure, Medical Science Building Unit II, University Events
Building, and University Hospital Surgical Wing.
The Vice-President said planning was continuing for

of fifty articles and monographs, not including published articles written by students
under his direction. He made significant contributions, many of them of a pioneer
character, to the knowledge of both the prehistoric and the historic cultures of the
Great Lakes area, his discovery of the importance of the fossil beaches in the Great
Lakes area having proved particularly seminal. Within the inner circle of anthropologists at the University, he was warmly beloved also as a personality, being a
paradigm of the keen-minded, and at times the absent-minded, professor.
The Regents of the University, who now formally appoint him Curator
Emeritus of the Division of Great Lakes in the Museum    of Anthropology and
Professor Emeritus of Anthropology, tender him their own profound thanks for
his contributions to anthropological knowledge in the University and in the State,
and cordially invite him to partake of the courtesies belonging to the emeritus ranks.

Professor Hammett revealed a nicely balanced feeling for the changing aspects
of architectural practice and for the permanent. He taught and wrote on the history
of architecture and concerned himself with the preservation of past architectural
monuments, while retaining a lively interest in the modern scene and sharing with
his students his practical contemporary expertness. The Luthern Church in America,
of which he is a devoted member, fittingly appointed him to its Commission on
Church Architecture. In purely professional societies, also, he became an honored
leader. Committeeman, international delegate, and regional chairman of the
American Institute of Architects, he was recently awarded a gold medal by the
Detroit Chapter of that Institute for "outstanding contributions as a teacher,
historian, and practitioner" of his profession. In 1957 the Michigan Society of
Architects, of which he was long a director and officer, named him Architect of the
Year. Despite the pressure of such external obligations and interests, Professor
Hammett fulfilled his every faculty duty with unfailing efficiency and gave his time
most generously to students seeking his individual counsel.
The Regents of the University would now take respectful and grateful cognizance of his eminent abilities and devoted service. As they appoint him Professor
Emeritus of Architecture, they wi

Professor GERALD MARCELLUS RIDENOUR of the School of Public
Health has been granted permission formally to retire from the active faculty at the
age of sixty-five, after twenty-five years of association with the University.
Professor Ridenour, though a native of Lima, Ohio, went to Rutgers University
for his collegiate and graduate education, earning three degrees there in sanitary
engineering with specialties in soil microbiology, geology, and the chemistry of
water and sewage systems. Before coming to Ann Arbor, he was for eleven years
Senior Engineer for the New Jersey State Board of Health and served concurrently
on the Rutgers faculty. Coming here as a Lecturer in 1941, he became a permanent
member of the faculty and was elevated through the several ranks to a professorship in 1957.
Though hampered by a recurrent illness, Professor Ridenour distinguished
himself both by his teaching and by his investigation. Responsible for courses in
sanitary chemistry and biology, he assisted also in training advanced students in
techniques of chemical analysis and was a principal investigator in a number of
research programs. Among the more comprehensive of the latter programs was a
prolonged inquiry into stream sanitation. As Radiological Safety Officer for the
entire University, he further ably assisted in ushering this institution into the age
of extended and dive

educational and commercial television. Contributing to the daily work of her
School with selfless devotion, she enhanced its fame through her vitality and flair.
Professor Beeuwkes is deeply mourned by her colleagues, who are sensible of a
loss at once professional and personal. The Regents of the University too mourn the

would be timely. The Regents requested that the President, after
consultation with the Hospital Board and the executive officers of the
Medical School, report to the Regents at the September, 1966, meeting,
or as soon thereafter as possible, the desirability of securing a complete
study and review of the structural organization of the University
Hospital and the University Medical School and all facilities directly
related thereto, and, if found to be desirable, the procedures which might
be followed in making such study.

The Regents accepted the reports entitled "Financial Report on the
$55 Million Program as Prepared for the $55 Million Program Steering
Committee," "Report on Labor Relations," and "Student Fees," submitted to the Regents by Vice-President Pierpont.

the period July 1, 1965, to June 30, 1966, by the Internal Audit
Department, was accepted (R.P., 1963-66, p. 1019).

The Secretary reported the retirement of Professor Ralph Carr
Fletcher and Professor Richard Emory Townsend. The following
memoirs were adopted:
Professor RALPH CARR FLETCHER of the School of Social Work retired
from the active faculty on his sixty-fifth birthday, which fell on the eleventh of this
past August. He had taught here for twenty-five years.
Professor Fletcher was graduated with distinction from Washington University
in St. Louis, and he earned also his master's degree there following periods of study
at the Brookings Graduate School and The University of Wisconsin. Remaining at
his Alma Mater for eight additional years as a teacher of economics and statistics,
he moved to Pittsburgh in 1935 to direct the Bureau of Social Research and to
undertake offices of communication and consultation among the social agencies of
that city. After 1939 he further held an appointment as Associate Professor of
Social Research at the University of Pittsburgh. After a brief period of teaching at
the University of California, he came to Michigan as Associate Professor of Social

VII. Deaths
W. E. Blake:     The Secretary, with regret, reported the death of Professor Warren
emo Everett Blake, Professor of Greek Language and Literature, on September 11, 1966. The following memoir was adopted:
Professor Warren Everett Blake, the eminent Hellenist, died in Ann Arbor on
September the eleventh at the age of sixty-six. He had taught here continuously for
forty-one years.
A native Bostonian, Professor Blake was graduated from Harvard College and
remained in Cambridge to earn his master's degree and his doctorate. Following one
year of teaching at the University of Vermont, he came to Ann Arbor as an Instructor in Greek. Here he rose through the several ranks to a professorship in 1941.
In the period before the Greek Department was subsumed into the present single
Department of Classical Studies, he served also as department chairman.
Thoroughly at home in the classical literatures and composing both Latin and
Greek easily, Professor Blake was an ornament to that international fraternity
which continues to enrich our legacy from classical antiquity. On campus he sustained the highest quality of graduate and undergraduate instruction. Abroad, where
his competence in modern Greek served him in good stead, he was a respected
emissary of American scholarship. His textual criticism was admired throughout the
scholarly world. His authoritativ

Upon recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont, the Regents
approved the resolution authorizing the borrowing of $2,700,000 and
authorizing certain officers to sign the Parking Revenue Financing and

Note and Parking Revenue Financing and Security Agreement between
the Regents and the National Bank of Detroit as to form and substance,
and to be incorporated in the minutes of this meeting. They appear in
Appendix B to the minutes of this meeting (p. 136).
On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont the Regents authorized the University to participate with the City of Ann Arbor in the
preparation of a program and plan which would establish appropriate
guidelines for use of University and city land along the Huron River in
Ann Arbor, including plans for open space assignments adjoining the
Residential College site, such program and plan to be submitted to the
Regents for review and approval.
The Regents also authorized the University to join with the city and
other concerned governmental units of the area such as Washtenaw

the efforts of the three universities in the broad area of information processing and
exchange by computer and other electronic media. Considerable progress has been
made in defining problems, developing information, and determining procedures
which will assure collaborative development. The Committee's goal is to make the
three universities mutually available for attack on the problems of multi-media
communications systems.
It has now been agreed by the committee members that it would be advisable
to create a separate nonprofit corporate entity, with the directors composed of
institutional representatives, in order to permit joint action in connection with the
development of the program. One immediate purpose will be to prepare an application for federal funds to permit experimentation with inter-institutional computer
communication. We anticipate other opportunities for corporate action in support of
institutional developments.
Concerning recent student activities on the campus, and the submission of names to the House Un-American Activities Committee, President Hatcher said he would like to share with the Regents some thoughts
which he had discussed with the faculty in his "State of the University"
address. He said:
There are a few basic facts which we must keep in mind. They might begin
with the question "Why did the Congressional Committee even bot

The third point is: How can we best meet both these requirements of protecting
freedom of inquiry and obeying the law. I think this is being analyzed and worked
on by appropriate groups within the University community itself. They are reexamining the procedures and operations in matters of this kind, and I expect that
recommendations will be forthcoming on what modifications are now indicated.
I hope they will be considered with all good will, with the purpose of pursuing
the right as best we can see the right.
President Hatcher concluded by observing that "I am sure that many
of my distinguished colleagues share this view, and I hope they will
accept the responsibility of helping to sort out the issues and to aid in
their solutions." He said that he was pleased with the concern shown by
the Student Government Council regarding the issue of recognition of
student groups on campus, and that he welcomed the SACUA ad hoc
committee which was further investigating issues related to student
organizations. As recommendations for any indicated changes in our
procedures are developed, certainly these individual recommendations,
he said, would come before the Board of Regents.
The Regents accepted President Hatcher's report and

Act 379 or the Hutchinson Act or the manner in which employee relations are
conducted.
The University has attempted to speed the decision through the courts. We
continue to seek early clarification.
Meanwhile, as the suit has been pending in the courts, the University has
co-operated in hearings before the State Labor Mediation Board. There have been
no developments since the last report to you on the five petitions for five different
appropriate units for collective bargaining purposes. Nor has the Labor Mediation
Board set a preliminary conference date for the unit claimed at the Dearborn
Campus. The uncertainties created by these circumstances make it difficult for the
University to proceed in good faith into further arrangements with its employees.
The Regents voted to receive this report, and it was placed on file.
Regent Brablec stated that he wondered whether now was the time
to move in good faith toward bargaining, and to not wait for a judicial
decision. In support of this opinion, Regent Brablec offered the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Regents should at this time proceed under Act 379 to enter
into bargaining.
Regents Murphy and Sorenson added their support to this particular
motion.
Regent Brablec went on to say that bargaining in public institutio

regularly supported its efforts. At this critical stage in the initiation of the Residential College, it is extremely important that this post be filled by a man of his
dedication to the College, to its students, and by a man of his wide experience in
the University. He has a long association with chairmen of our departments, with
members of the faculty, and with all those officials in the University administration
with whom he must work. In our opinion, Associate Dean Robertson would set the
tone for a college where fine teachers and scholars would be happy to work. He
values good instruction and scholarship; he sees both as first requisites of any
academic enterprise. A colleague writes me that, "His judgment is seasoned, his
instincts right, his experience considerable. He would see his first business as one of
creating a firmament in which other stars could shine." He would share in and
champion the democratic determination of policies and values for the College as a
whole. Dean Robertson's deep interest in students, together with his sympathy with
their education and their problems, is an attitude which represents the most basic
principle upon which the Residential College is based.
President Hatcher also stated that he was pleased that Dean
Robertson could be persuaded to accept the appointment as Director
of the Residential College. He further

in these discussions at various times had been some members of the
faculties of the School of Dentistry and the Medical School, the deans
and executive committees of the two schools, and several vice-presidents. In addition, Vice-President Smith said two letters had been sent
to the National Institute of Dental Research expressing the intention of
the University to seek the assistance necessary to establish and operate
an institute as soon as funds for such purpose became available. VicePresident Smith said he would like to summarize for the Regents what
this approval they had given entailed: (1) the organization of a Dental
Research Institute; (2) establishment of a Policy Committee including
the Vice-President for Academic Affairs and the Vice-President for
Research; the Dean of the School of Dentistry, the Dean of the Medical
School, and the Dean of the School of Public Health, and the Director

The Regents then approved (1) the joint submission of the appropriation request; (2) the creation of the Joint Executive Committee
for the Computer Network Program with the composition, powers, and
functions described in the October 6, 1966, joint request for appropriation statement; and (3) withdrawal of that portion of The University
of Michigan's institutional budget request which related to this program, on condition that the Board of Governors of Wayne State University and the Trustees of Michigan State University approve the joint
request for a computer network.
The Vice-President for Student Affairs, Mr. Cutler, presented to       Student Advisory
the Regents a plan for the establishment of student advisory boards to    Boards
the administrative officers. Before presenting his report Mr. Cutler
indicated that he would like to specifically thank Mr. Robinson, Mr.
DeLamater, Mr. Hollenshead, and Mr. Freedman, for their assistance
in the preparation of this report.
Basically, he continued, it is in the interest of the University community and supportive of the general educational goals of the University
to provide for an exchange of information between students and the
executive officers of the University. Formal channels for such communication between the faculty and the executive officers already exists
in the several SACUA subcommittees adviso

OCTOBER MEETING, 1966


This review has now been completed. The existing situation is one in which
substantial confusion exists. Diverse and often conflicting sources of authority
exist, and effectively prevent the establishment and functioning of a system for the
regulation of nonacademic conduct.
In order that the responsibility and authority for the regulation of nonacademic conduct may be clearly identified, It Is Recommended:
1. That the Regents specifically affirm the legitimacy of the President's
delegation of power in matters of nonacademic misconduct to the Vice-President
for Student Affairs;
2. That the Regents recognize the Vice-President for Student Affairs as the
ultimate authority in establishing and enforcing standards of nonacademic conduct
for individual students and student groups, subject to the superior authority of the
President, and to appeal to the Regents;
3. That the Regents, in taking these actions, specifically state that these
policies supravene other existing delegations of authority for the establishment and
enforcement of standards for the conduct of individual students and student groups;
4. That the Regents permit the Vice-President for Student Affairs to delegate
his authority in these areas to such academic authorities, student groups, and
members of his staff as seem appropriate to the establishment and maintenance of
an effective regulat

Regent Bentley was nominated and elected to represent The University
of Michigan.
In a report to the Regents the Vice-President for Research, Mr.  Research:
Norman, said that during the year 1965-66, $52,000,000 had been    epor on
expended in research, or, a million dollars a week. The main source of
this money was from the federal government, which gave the University
$41,000,000 of the $52,000,000, or 78 per cent of the expenditures, the
largest coming from the U. S. Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare. The University of Michigan volume of research by major
fields of study last year indicated that engineering had $16,400,000, or
32 per cent; life, $14,000,000, or 27 per cent; and physical, $12,000,000,
or 23 per cent.
Vice-President Norman went on to say that the grants and contracts
were of all sizes and that as of June 30 there were 2,400 different
projects in operation, with 60 per cent of the monies avai

Vice-President Norman was also pleased to bring to the Regents'
attention the appointment of Professor Ernest M. Gould as Visiting

Vice-President Norman said that in Professor John Robert Keith
Robson, Associate Professor of Nutrition, the University had gained a
most experienced man in the area of nutrition. Since 1962 Dr. Robson
had served as nutrition adviser to the World Health Organization. This
post had carried with it important assignments in both the Middle East
and the Far East. In his work with this organization he had directed the
development and implementation of nutrition projects and programs
in the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Fiji, West
Samoa, Lebanon, and Jordan.

with full salary, sabbatical, to complete a text on sports officiating
Gerald W. Hedstrom, Assistant Professor of Mathematics, extension of leave, without salary (R.P., 1963-66, p. 1427), to include the 1967 winter term, to meet

Edmund Wooding, Professor of Journalism, sick leave with full salary, October 17,
1966, to December 20, 1966
Vice-President Norman brought to the attention of the Regents the
fact that the University had a long tradition of sabbatical leaves, which
served as an enrichment opportunity for further research and study.
He wished, however, to point out to the Regents that the By

was the bid of the Government of par plus accrued interest at the rate of 3% per
annum for the entire issue.
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, by the Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan, That the University of Michigan Dormitory Bonds of 1966 in the amount
of $2,500,000, maturing serially in varying amounts from 1969 through 2006, be
sold to the United States of America pursuant to its bid and to the provisions of the
Loan Agreement, Contract No. H(402)-2687.
Vice-President Pierpont reported that occasionally it would be necessary to arrange for short-term borrowings during the construction period
to cover the cash requirements of certain, if not all, of the building
projects financed through the $55 Million Program gifts. The first
example of this requirement, he continued, was the schedule of cash
requirements for the Chrysler Center for Continuing Engineering Education (p. 37 and R.P., 1963-66, p. 894).
The Gift of the Chrysler Fund was in the amount of $1,250,000, payable at the
rate of $250,000 per year for five years, beginning with the year 1965 (R.P.,
1963-66, p. 1001). The expenditure of funds for this building, he continued,
would be essentially completed by the summer of 1967 at which time the first three
annual payments will have been received from the Chrysler Fund amounting to
$750,000.
Sometime in the early spring or summer o

Regent Cudlip stated that he realized that student fees would be
pledged to pay off the $2,000,000 loan from the government. How much,
or what per cent of student fees can be used for capital purposes? he
asked. Should we set limits on expenditures such as these.
Retirement Plan:    The Vice-President for Business Affairs, Mr. Lee, presented a report
Revision of
evon o on the revision of retirement plan contribution and eligibility requests.
By way of summary of the entire suggested program, Vice-President Lee
submitted the following:
Social Security should be considered the base for all retirement programs:
I. TIAA-CREF-Faculty
1. Eligibility
a) Eligible immediately upon appointment.
b) Optional until age thirty-five.
c) Mandatory after age thirty-five.
d) Optional after age sixty for new staff members.
2. Contribution Rate
a) TIAA contributions at regular 10 per cent-5 per cent rate if employee
elects to contribute his 5 per cent of all salary.
b) Optional election would allow employee to make no contribution on
salary below Social Security base; the University would contribute
5 per cent on salary to this base. Above Social Security base the contribution would be at regular 10 per cent-5 per cent rate.
II. TIAA-CREF-Nonfaculty
1. Eligibility
a) Nonfaculty on regular appointment with salary of $15,000 or more
annually would be eligible immediatel
NOVEMBER MEETING, 1966


263


3. Contribution Rate
a) ERP contributions at regular 10 per cent-5 per cent rate if employee
elects to contribute his 5 per cent on all salary.
6) Optional election would allow employee to make no contribution on
salary below Social Security base; the University would contribute
5 per cent on salary up to this base. Above Social Security base the
contribution would be at regular 10 per cent-5 per cent rate.
The Regents then approved the proposed changes in the retirement
plan, to be effective January 1, 1967, with the understanding that there
may be minor variations in the implementation of the program.
Xl. Other Items
President Hatcher stated that he would like to bring to the attention
of the Regents something that they perhaps already knew-that The
University of Michigan, which recognized the preservation of culture
as one of the reasons for being of a university, was exceedingly distressed at the catastrophe which had overtaken Florence and other cities
of'northern Italy. He said this area had suffered what may well have
been the greatest cultural disaster of modern times. Libraries and
collections of art among the most famous and valuable in the world,
and all irreplaceable, had been severely damaged by the floods of recent
days. He further stated that The University of Michigan had a considerable history of interest and concern with Italian hi

After a discussion of this matter and an explanation of how the University complied with this Act, Vice-President Cutler was asked to draft a
letter of reply which indicated the current practice of the University in
meeting the requirements of this Act.
Vice-President Cutler presented a report concerning the regulation
of nonacademic conduct, and his responsibilities thereunder, as approved
at the October, 1966, meeting (p. 231). He stated that since the meeting
in October he had received a favorable response from the deans of the
University, that he was striving for continuity in establishing a student
judiciary system, and that as yet there were no new regulations which
had been promulgated. He reaffirmed his intent to report to the Regents
all new regulations.
The Regents voted approval of these actions taken thus far by
Vice-President Cutler.
The Regents voted approval of the Highway Safety Research Institute of the Institute of Science and Technology as an organizational
supporting member of the Highway Research Board of the National
Academy of Sciences-National Research Council, at an annual fee of
$200, in order to obtain the information, publications, and benefits

would still obtain research money, he said, but the rate of increase
would not be as steep as previously.
President Hatcher observed that when he came to the University,
the government was asking itself whether it should create research
centers or use those centers which had already been established. By and
large, he said, the road taken by the government was the latter, and a
process of selection began whereby certain institutions did receive a
great deal of research money because they were qualified and capable.
On recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Alumni Association, Professor Emeritus John W. Bradshaw was named recipient of
the Williams Professorship, to receive the interest from the fund as
long as he lives, or until the accumulated and current income is exhausted
(R.P., 1948-51, p. 959).
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
otherwise expressly stated.
The Regents adjourned to meet Thursday and Friday, December 15
and 16.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1966


The Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Pierpont, filed a
report on plant extension. He indicated that progress was being made on
all projects.
The Vice-President for Business Affairs, Mr. Lee, filed a report on
labor relations, and said that there had been no further developments in
Circuit Court, that transcripts should be received from the Labor
Mediation Board hearings, and that the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees Union withdrew its charge of unfair
labor practices against Eastern Michigan University and its petition for
recognition, and agreed to an election to choose a collective bargaining
representative under Eastern's own labor relations policy.
The Vice-President for University Relations, Mr. Radock, filed a
report on University relations; he hoped to provide the Regents with a
series of regular monthly reports.
Board in Control   The Regents were pleased to receive a report from        the Board in
catiodns Reupbort  Control of Student Publications wherein the Board took a current view
of student campus publications.
La Maison      The Vice-President for Student Affairs, Mr. Cutler, presented the
Francaire:
Report on  following report on La Maison Francaise:
A French House has been established in co-operation with the Department of
Romance Languages and Literatures as one of the co-operative units

House, we meet members of the faculty informally, whose willingness to help us
with programs and whose knowledge of France provide inspiration."
The Oxford co-op approach to group living in combination with the Language
Living Program in French is proving a successful experiment. The success is due in
large measure to the special interests of the Resident Director and members of the
Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. Also very important is the
attitude of the residents: "We wish to make the Maison Frangaise an individual
supplement to classroom work-a place where people will want to come to perfect
their French and learn about France."
Mr. Cutler concluded by acknowledging the contributions of John
Feldkamp and Professor O'Neill, and indicated that a "German House"
would be proposed in the future.
The President stated that the Regents had been fully informed on  Nonacademic
issues of recent days, specifically on the question of the draft and the  Conduc
larger question of student participation. He did feel that there had been
a "freeing up" of the channels of communication which seemingly had
been clogged in the past. He continued by noting that the administration
was moving constructively in all these areas, and that hopefully in the
future the problems would be resolved. The Regents would be informed
as time went by. In short, said t

life. This timely support, building on a foundation which Professor Stockard had
lovingly laid over the years, has gone to create a uniquely excellent facility which
shall be his enduring monument.
On this sad occasion the Regents of the University mingle their sorrow with
their deepest gratitude for the life and works of this single-minded man. And to
Mirs. Stockard and the other surviving members of his family, they tender at once
their deepest sympathy.

Regents Cudlip and Bentley asked if the legislature were aware of
current financing plans at the University. The Executive Vice-President,
Mr. Niehuss, responded that the legislature was aware of what the
University was doing. They were aware of plans for buildings under
study; they were also aware of the proposed sources of funds.
Regent Bentley was concerned with the order of priority between
the Residential College and the theater. President Hatcher said no
decision had been made as to priority. The Regents had considered the
theater as a highly desirable facility and had authorized building plans,
but as yet no decision had been made as to financing.
A concluding comment was offered by Regent Cudlip. He felt the
University should be careful in assigning priorities to buildings. All
items before the Regents were of concern and interest, and it was not a
simple decision to make.
On recommendation of Vice-President Lee, the Regents approved
purchase of the properties at 702 and 706 East University Avenue,
Ann Arbor, from Helen S. and L. Norris Post.

Regent Murphy:
Memoir


He expressed the beloved association which the members of the Board
of Regents and the executive officers had had with the two outgoing
Regents, and he knew that resolutions expressing this concern were now
to be offered.
Regent Briggs said:
Mrs. IRENE ELLIS MURPHY earned a Master of Arts degree in sociology
at the University in 1928 and entered then upon a long career of family and child
welfare work in Detroit. After the Second World War, she employed her philanthropic interests and her notable gifts for organization in the Philippine Islands,
administering timely relief in that war-ravaged land and advising its government on
welfare policies. As hostess to the then Governor General, furthermore, she was an
esteemed and admired personage. The Philippine Republic recalled her in 1959 to
bestow on her a Presidential Merit Award for community service. Having become
involved in advancing cottage industries while in the Orient, finally, she herself
established in 1954 a firm for merchandising the products of Asian village crafts in
the United States.
As a Regent of the University for a term beginning in 1957, she warmly
supported the liberal and humane quality of education here and appreciatively
savored the intellectual and cultural life of the community. On their own behalf
and on behalf of the University at large, her fellows

DOCTOR OF LAWS
Voted October 21, 1966 (p. 226)                 Conferred December 17, 1966
CHARLES LEROY ANSPACH, educator; President Emeritus of Central
Michigan University; Master of Arts in the Class of 1923, Doctor of Philosophy in
the Class of 1930; devoted alumnus.
The People of Michigan have traditionally sent a large proportion of their sons
and daughters to public institutions of higher learning, and the later history of the
state colleges and universities describes a process of burgeoning in response to this
demand. The institution chiefly serving the central region of the state is fortunate
in that its growth was nurtured and tended by the man whom we now honor.
During the twenty years of his presidency, Central Michigan University increased
its student body threefold and its physical plant more than comparably. To its
curricula in teacher education, furthermore, which it yet enlarged and strengthened,
it added thirty liberal arts and preprofessional curricula and a number of graduate
programs.
Charles Anspach supplied the administrative skills needed for this massive yet
orderly development. More significantly, while enhancing the formal academic

freedom of movement which that grand development has brought to our nation
and the world.
It is sentimentally pleasing to honor a loyal son of the University. It is morally
and aesthetically pleasing to exalt a modest and benevolent man who has never
urgently exalted himself. These causes here concurring, it is a peculiar delight to
confess the industrial genius of John Yeasting by conferring on him the degree
Doctor of Business Administration.
REGENTS' CITATION OF HONOR
Voted June 23, 1966 (R.P., 1963-66, p. 1521)        Conferred August 7, 1966
CHARLES WILLIAM CARPENTER, retired pastor of Second Baptist Church,
Ann Arbor.
This warm and sympathetic human being, loved by clergy and laity alike, has
devoted over half a century to serving his church and his fellow men. As a student
he studied under the late George Washington Carver and worked intimately with
the founder of Tuskegee, the late Booker T. Washington. In great measure the
people of Ann Arbor were the recipients of his association with these great men,
through a distinguished ministry which saw his present church built, its mortgage
retired, other properties bought, and church membership doubled.
He supported these material accomplishments with deeds of love to the community. Especially responsive to his teachings were young people, who made his
ideals guides for their future, mindful that

added to the legal staffs of large corporations.
He has fashioned a successful public and private legal career in Detroit; became
the first Negro member in history of the Detroit City Council; advised the federal
government on problems of poverty and juvenile delinquency; and assumed his
present responsible post with Michigan Bell.
Honoring him as exemplar of the classic American virtue of self-reliance, which
has at once lifted individual men to deserved eminence, the University proudly
bestows on Mr. Patrick its Outstanding Achievement Award.

JANUARY MEETING, 1967


The Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Pierpont, filed
a report on plant extension. He indicated that progress was being made
on all projects. He said that a major drawback to completing the projects
on time was the lack of skilled labor in the Ann Arbor area.
Vice-President Pierpont filed his monthly report on labor relations,
wherein he discussed the fact that there had been no developments in
Circuit Court and no new developments in the Labor Mediation Board
hearings. He also reported on the status of labor relations at Michigan
Technological University, Eastern Michigan University, and Michigan
State University.
The Vice-President for University Relations, Mr. Radock, filed a
report on University relations.
Citizens Advisory  Regent Bentley made a report to the Board concerning a meeting he

Committee for the State Plan for Higher Education (p. 233). He went
on to say that a master plan for the state was going to be developed
without specific reference to the individual educational institutions in
the state. This was to be the first step.
The second step, he continued, was to view the needs for the future
as each institution saw it for themselves. All plans would then be compared with the master plan. Furthermore, in an attempt to arrive

$55 Million Program
A surge of year-end giving has brought our $55 Million Program to a total of
$53,317,758, placing us within sight of the goal.
Recent gifts include the $600,000 received from the Kresge Foundation to
establish the Sebastian S. Kresge endowed professorship in marketing. Our pleasure
in this gift is heightened by our awareness of this University's long association with
Mr. Kresge and with the Foundation he established. The endowed chair brings to
more than $6 million the sum of Kresge Foundation gifts to The University of
Michigan. The Kresge Medical Research Building, Medical Library, and Hearing
Research Building are all monuments to Mr. Kresge's interest in education and
research.
Another recent gift was that of $600,000 from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation,
designated for the work of the Center for Research on the Utilization of Scientific
Knowledge. The Kellogg Foundation is another of the great friends and benefactors
of this University. Last summer, we announced two other gifts from the Kellogg
Foundation under the $55 Million Program. They were grants of $1,100,000 toward
the construction of the new Dentistry Building and of $2,.000,000 toward construction of an addition to the School of Public Health.
These two great philanthropic foundations, Kresge and Kellogg, both based in
Michigan, have performed enormous public service t

A native Minnesotan, Professor Velz was graduated with a baccalaureate in
civil engineering from the University of Minnesota in 1924, and earned additional
degrees in sanitary engineering and in public health from Minnesota and Columbia,
respectively. He established himself as a sanitation engineer chiefly in the metropolitan area of New York, serving with private engineering firms and with municipal, state, and federal agencies. From 1938 to 1949, he was chairman of the
Department of Civil Engineering at Manhattan College. In the latter year he
accepted an appointment as professor in the School of Public Health here, becoming
chairman of the newly founded Department of Public Health Statistics. For the
past decade he has presided over the Department of Environmental Health.
Professor Velz distinguished himself at once as a teacher and director of
research and entered fully into the corporate life of his School. Instituting new
programs in air pollution and radiological health, he further steadily enhanced his
authority as an expert on water resources. It was in good part through his offices
that the Regional Water Pollution Control Laboratory was brought to Ann Arbor.
As the country at large became increasingly conscious of the need to husband fresh
water, Professor Velz's knowledge, energy, and practical wisdom in this field commanded an ever highe

University of California School of Fine Arts and subsequently in Paris and at the
American Academy in Rome. The Chaloner and Guggenheim foundations have
supported him. His first one-man exhibition was held in Paris when he was only
eighteen. Fifteen other exhibitions followed, in the United States, Europe, and
Australia, and his work was added to holdings of the Museum of Modern Art, the
Danish National Gallery, and other major collections.
Professor Vidar was an official army combat artist in World War II and an
artist-correspondent for Life and Fortune until 1953. He further taught successively
at the New York School of Interior Decoration, the Newark School of Fine and
Industrial Art, The University of Wisconsin, and Washington University in
St. Louis. Appointed an Assistant Professor of Art at The University of Michigan
in 1953, he was advanced within the next decade to Associate Professor and
Professor. His meticulous draftsmanship and superior command of abstract technique gave his teaching immediate professional relevance, and his lively sense of the
past gave it also cultural breadth. He enjoyed a particular rapport with advanced
students of painting, whose individual styles he unfailingly respected.
His colleagues and students miss him sorely. The Regents of the University
join them in mourning his death, paying tribute to his signal gifts a

the prescribed course of study as of December 17, 1966, and December 20, 1966. The names appear in Appendix A to the minutes of this
meeting (p. 327).

part of said fund as so remains may, in the year next following, be used for scholarship purposes in said Medical Department by said Regents; and I further provide
and direct that, as loans to said promising and needy students are repaid, with such
interest as may be charged by said Regents, said loans, with the accumulated interest, shall go into said Loan and Scholarship Fund, from which withdrawals are to
be made by said Regents solely for the financial aid of needy and promising students
in said Medical Department, and in such manner and by such means as to said
Regents may seem fitting and proper. Said Regents shall not be required in any
event or under any circumstances to account to any court or tribunal for the control
of said trust estate."
The University Attorney, Mr. Cummiskey, reported that Helen M.
Link, the Trustee, had transferred securities of the value of $956,500 to
the University. Upon the final judicial termination of the trust and the
payment of the closing costs, there will be a further payment of a few
thousand dollars from the trustee.
The Regents approved receiving the securities to be used to establish
an endowment fund to be known as the "Ralph L. Morse Medical Loan
and Scholarship Fund" and that the income therefrom be used for the
purposes stated in the trust.

Vice-President Pierpont distributed to the Regents a report entitled  Buildings Under
Buildings Under Study-1967, and indicated that reports had been issued
in 1962, 1963, and 1965 (R.P., 1963-66, pp. 877, 470, and 55). The
primary sources for the data included in the report, he said, were the
schools and colleges, the institutes, the University housing office, the
University Hospital, and other University units which have expressed a
need for expansion and improvement of facilities to meet their program
objectives. He went on to say that the list of buildings under study was
subject to continuing study and revision to respond effectively to
changing needs and changing circumstances. In addition to the specific
reviews through the schools and colleges and other administrative units
of the University, the report was given consideration and study by the
Senate Advisory Committee on Campus Planning and Development,
and was generally available for review as a University planning study
report. He concluded by saying that the refined recommendations which
were developed from this comprehensive and long-range study report
will become the official capital outlay proposals for University development.

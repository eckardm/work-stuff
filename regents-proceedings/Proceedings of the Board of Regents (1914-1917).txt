University of Michigan.
Gentlemen:Your Executive Committee at a meeting held October
7, I914, took action as follows:I. On account of the increased attendance in the.College of Dental Surgery, it became necessary to provide at
once additional laboratory space for first year students.
Your Committee therefore authorized the fitting up, as a
laboratory, of the west basement room of the Dental
Building at an expense of approximately $30.00, Superintendent Marks 'having advised that the expense would be
approximately that amount. Your Committee also authorized the purchase for this laboratory room of two electric,motors at an expense not exceeding $Ioo.oo.

being sixty over the attendance of last year, your Committee authorized an addition to the zoological budget of
$200.00 for a technical assistant and of $200.00 for a teaching assistant, it being understood that the $200.00 allowed
for a technical assistant should be added to the $300.00
already allowed for that purpose, it having been found impossible to secure any one for the place at a salary less than
$500.00.
3. Your Committee appointed Mr. Richard O. Ficken,




IO


OCTOBER MEETING, 1914


A.M., as Instructor in German in the Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts, at a salary of $9oo.oo per

Mr. John J. Cox, Instructor in Civil Engineering, to attend
as a delegate representing the University of Michigan, at
the expense of the University, the Fourth American Road
Congress, to be held in Atlanta, Georgia, the week of November 9, I914. This action was taken upon the urgent
request of Dean Cooley of the Department of Engineering,
the meeting being regarded by him as one of great importance and it being in his judgment very desirable that
the University should be represented by,Mr. Cox.
5. On the representation of the Director of the Chemical Laboratory that an increased number of students in
laboratory work made absolutely necessary the appointment
of an additional teaching assistant in General Chemistry,
your Committee authorized such additional assistant at a
salary of $400.0o.
6. On the recommendation of Dr. Vaughan,,Dr. J. G.
Cumming, head of the Pasteur Institute, who by doing work
in the Summer Session has earned a year's leave of absence,
iwas granted such leave in order that he might spend a year
in the Harvard Medical School for special study. It was
found that Dr. Cumming, by his service in the Summer
Session, is entitled to this leave on full salary, he having
accumulated his salary during the requisite number of
Summer Sessions.   Your Committee authorized that Dr.
Cumming's work should be carried by Mr. Judd Brittain
Kelly, A.B., M.S., at a salary of $750.00 a year and by Dr.
Quinter Olin Gilbert at a salary of $250.00 a year. Mr.
Kelly's present salary is $500.00 a year. The change authorized will result in an addition to the budget of $500.00 and
the difference between the amount accumulated by Dr. Cumming by service in the Summer Sessions ($8Io.oo) and his
full yearly salary ($I,400.00), this amount being $590.00.

leave of absence.
Mr. George W'right, Instructor in English for the first
semester to take tile place of Mr. Arthur D. DeFoe, at the
rate of $9oo per year.
8. Because of the fact that some of our non-resident
students have been unable, on account of conditions resulting from the war, to get remittances in season to pay fees
when entering the University, your Committee authorized
the Auditing Board to exercise its discretion in such cases
in postponing payment of fees for a reasonable time.
9. Your Committee authorized an additional assistant
in the beginner's English History course at a salary of
$400.00 per year. It was represented to your Committee by
the historical department that this was absolutely necessary
on account of the largely increased attendance in the beginner's History course.
Io. Your Committee authorized temporary additional
assistants in the department of Physics, but ordered that
the communication of Dean Guthe upon that subject be
sent to' the full Board, the Committee feeling that the
emergency was not such as to justify it in directing the
expenditure of the amount asked without the authority of
the full Board. The communication will be found under
the head of new business.
ii. The communication from Professor Beman of the
department of Mathematics asking for four assistants in
Mathematics for the current year at the salary of $300.00
each, was referred by your Committee to the full Board and

budget of the department of Botany of $35.00 for the purchase of nose pieces to be used upon microscopes transferred from the Economics department to the department

be necessary for their use by botanical students.
13. Your Committee authorized a committee of five
from the Department of Engineering to visit Albion Col



12


OCTOBER lMEETING, 1914


lege with a view of determining upon a combined literary
and engineering course, the expense of the trip to be borne
by the University, the amount, however, not to exceed
$25.o0. The Committee was of the opinion that combination
courses with the state colleges are desirable and should be
encouraged.
14. The Committee felt justified in granting the request
of Dean Hinsdale for the appointment of an additional
assistant in the Homoeopathic Medical College at the salary
of $200.00, the salary to be paid out of the saving arising
from the resignation of Dr. Burrett and the appointment of
Dr. Naylor.
Your Committee begs to add that in its judgment all
of the cases acted upon by it and covered by this report
were emergency cases that demanded immediate attention.

at about II o'clock and left there Monday evening, August
Ioth, at 7 o'clock. The engineers had kindly placed at my
disposal one of the new tin covered houses which had just
been completed and proved to be very comfortable and well
ventilated in spite of the -hot weather during the first two
days of the visit. Saturday afternoon and practically the
whole Sunday were spent at the Biological Station; Monday I stayed at Camp Davis and studied the conditions
there. Some of the meals were taken at the engineers'
mess tent, some at that of the Station. I was received at
both places with great hospitality and found the visit most
enjoyable and instructive.
Both the Engineering Camp and the Biological Station
were in charge of efficient men. It was easy to see that
Professor Johnston and Dr. Gleason were highly respected
and well liked by the students. The discipline in either




OCTOBER      MEETING, 1914                   I7
place was excellent and the behavior of the students made
the 'best impression.  The rules governing the camp life
were closely obeyed and no criticism of them by any member of the camps was heard. A group of Chinese students
aroused my interest. They had their first experience of
camp life, but seemed to have become perfectly accustomed
to their work and to enjoy it greatly.
The Engineering Camip has been established for many
years so that the work there is fully organized and is carried out with admirable precision under the direction of
efficient teachers. The meals at the mess, conducted by the
students, were substantial and wholesome, and therefore the
health of the students was excellent. There exists, however,
a source of danger in the presence of open closets, located
at various points on the hill behind the tents, but not more
than 25 or 30 feet from the nearest tent. Moreover flies
have become abundant and disease would easily be spread
by them unless some preventive action is taken. This condition can be remedied without great cost by the addition of
a tank, pipe system for flushing the closets and an antiseptic
reservoir. The large pumping engine, located in one of the
concrete buildings, supplies the drinking water to the mess
tent on top of the hill and throughout the camp, but is
used only part of the time. The tank of the flushing system could be placed half way up the hill and the water be
taken directly from the lake. Most of the work of installation would be done by the students. The addition of such a
system seems to me the only immediately needed improvement in this camp.
The work of the Biological Station deserves high
recommendation. Though a number of undergraduate courses were given the main work of the station was of graduate nature.  Not only were one-half of the number of
students enrolled in the Graduate Department, but there
were also three teachers from other institutions who had
been allowed to carry on research at the station though
they were not connected in any way with the, University.
I asked everyone of the advanced students as well as the
members of the teaching staff to explain to me the nature of
their investigations and was pleased to observe the enthusiasm which they brought to their work and to find that
the problems on which they were engaged were of importance.
However, I noticed with surprise that the station is not




OCTOBER MEETING, 1914 


a representative Mic'higan institution. With the exception
of Dr. Gleason and his assistant, Miss F. J. Dunbar, all
members of the teaching staff were drawn from    other
institutions; of the 13 undergraduates only 3 were regular
students in the University of Michigan and of the I4
graduate students only 4 were graduates of IMlichigan. I
believe that a lack of interest on the past of our own
biological departments is responsible for this lamentable
condition, and that some of our own professors should be
urged to teach and carry on research at the station during
the summer. An increase of students from the University
of Michigan would naturally follow. The station, according to a statement of Professor C. C. Nutting of the State
University of Iowa is the best located fresh water biological
station in the country and offers abundant material for important investigations.
The mess tent is in charge of a private person. The price
of the board is $4.25 a week and seemed to me not nearly as
good as that given to the engineering students. Inquiry developed the fact that some of the teachers and students were
discontented. During the last week of the summer session
there were a number of cases of intestinal troubles, directly
attributable to the food and since my return I have received letters stating that some of the teachers and students
would not come back to the station unless a change in the
arrangements for the meals.would be made. I recommend
that, if possible, some competent students take charge of the
mess tent as is done in the engineering camp.
The presence of Dr. Stouffer undoubtedly prevented
more serious trouble. In this connection let me point out
that a number of the members of the teaching staff bring
with them their wives, and in one case, children. All these
"attachments" to the station expect to make use of the services of the University physician when in need of them.
Would it not be well, in order to avoid all misunderstanding,
to have the Board of Regents state definitely whether or
not the physician is expected to attend such cases without
charging a fee?    As mentioned above there are also
"guests" at the station, namely, professors and instructors
from other institutions who, in case of sickness, must be
cared for by the University physician.  At present these
people pay for the camp facilities and their board, but nothing for the use of the laboratory. I understand that Dr.
Gleason will propose that in future they pay a small fee for

the privileges which they enjoy. They should certainly be
required to do so.
I have no criticism to make as to the behavior of the
students at the station. I neither saw nor heard anything
objectionable or unseemly.
Respectfully submitted,
KARL E. GUTHE.

NOVEMBER MEETING
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
ANN ARBOR, November 24, I914.
The Board met in the Regents' Room at Io o'clock A. M.
Present, the President, Regent Leland, Regent Beal, Regent
Hubbard, Regent Clements, Regent Bulkley, Regent Gore,
and Superintendent Keeler. Absent, Regent Sawyer, who
later took his seat, and Regent Hanchett.
The minutes of the meeting of October 15 and 16 were
approved with certain corrections, as submitted to the members of the Board in proof.
The Secretary was called on for a report with respect
to control of bicycle riding on the Campus. On his recommendation, the Board directed the printing and posting of
the following notice on University bulletin boards and in
other proper places.
PUBLIC NOTICE
For many years bicyclists have been allowed the use of
the walks on the Campus of the University of Michigan, though forbidden the use of walks anywhere else
in the City of Ann Arbor. Owing to the increasing number
of pedestrians and owing to reckless selfishness on the part
of some wheelmen, the use of the Campus walks will necessarily be prohibited to wheelmen unless all cyclists cease 'to
disregard the fact that pedestrians have at all times a first
claim to the use of walks. This warning is issued with
a view to giving wheelmen a further, final chance to use
the walks without disregard of the rights of others. No
wheelman desirous of the privilege should himself disregard the rights of pedestrians or permit another wheelman
to do so unrebuked. The rights of pedestrians imply the
following cautions on the part of wheelmen: (i) No wheelman should at any time, even when walks are seemingly
clear, ride on a Campus walk faster than eight miles
per hour. (2) Wheelmen should not ride faster than a slow
walking gait at any "blind" corner or at the Engineering




30


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1914


arch, or should dismount at such points. (3) Wheelmen
should never attempt to ride on the walks at any time
or at any place where an unusual number of people are passing, as, for example, on main walks between class hours.
(4) Riding on the walks after dark calls for special caution.
(5) Care should always be taken not to startle pedestrians
by passing them too suddenly or closely. (6) Wheelmen
should ride on the walks, and not on the grass beside the
walks or at corners. (7) In case of a collision, the presumption will always be that the pedestrian is right, the
wheelman wrong.
Disregard by wheelmen of this warning will result in
the prohibition of the use of all the Campus walks.
By Authority of the Regents
On motion of Regent Bulkley, a communication from
the Acting Director of the Observatory with regard to better
fire protection for the Observatory was referred to Superintendent Marks for investigation and report.
The Secretary reported that, in accordance with authority given at the meeting of July 24 (see page 1028), a 'ontract for the University printing for the years I915, I916,
and 1917 had been made with the Ann Arbor Press.
On motion of Regent Leland, an expenditure of not to
exceed $Io5 was authorized for the purchase of a fireproof
booth for moving picture machines for use in Hill Auditorium, and other Campus buildings should it prove feasible to
transport the booth.
The Secretary presented correspondence between Cavanaugh & Burke, as attorneys for the Board, and the attorneys for Mary Bancroft (see page 4), which correspondence expressed the opinion of the attorneys for the Regents
that Mary Bancroft had no claim against the University.
Regent Gore reported informally in the matter of furniture for the Homoeopathic Hospital, referred to the
Homoeopathic Hospital Committee at the meeting of October I6 (see page I3). Regent Gore stated that the Committee was not yet ready to make formal recommendation.
On motion of Regent Clements, the sum of $1,500 was
set aside for improvements in the boys' toilet room in the
Palmer Ward, in accordance with the estimate made by the
Superintendent of Grounds.
Regent Sawyer took his seat.




NOVEMBER MEETING, I914

Regent Leland reported in the matter of exchange of
safes, authority having been given him at the meeting of
October I6 (see page 26), that he would authorize the exchange of the present safe in the Treasurer's office for
another, the exchange to be without additional expenditure
by the University.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, the Bates Professorship
fund was reimbursed, in the sum of $I,ooo, to cover amount
added to Dr. Peterson's salary during I913-I914, in view of
his services as Medical Director of the University Hospital.
Regent Leland reported for the Budget Committee that
in accordance with assurances given to the Faculty when
the budget was made up last spring, the Budget Committee
had gone over the budget once more, in view of the addition
to the University's resources through action, in August,
by the State Board of Equalization. On motion of Regent
Leland, the recommendations of the Budget Committee were

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1914


The following communication was received from       the
Director of the Museum of Zoology:PRESIDENT H. B. HUTCHINS,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
DE.AR SIR:
Owing to illness I was not able to announce to you before the last meeting of the Board of Regents that Dr.
Bryant Walker has informed me that he wishes again this
year to bear the expense of the publication of the "Occasional Papers of the Museum of Zoology." He has asked
me to continue the publication at his expense and has not
stipulated that the cost be kept below any definite sum. It
is thus only necessary for the Regents to accept or reject
his offer to assist the Museum in this way.
Permit me to add that four scientific papers have appeared in the series, one is in press and another is ready for
the printer. The publication has been well received by scientists, and every attempt will be made to maintain the high
standard set by the first papers to be published.
Yours respectfully,
ALEXANDER C. RUTHVEN,
Director.
November 23, I914.

AFTERNOON SESSION
The Board reassembled at 2:30 P. M.        Present, the
President, Regent Beal, Regent Hubbard, Regent Clements
Regent Bulkley, Regent Hanchett, Regent Gore, and Regenl
Leland.   Absent, Superintendent Keeler, who later took
his seat, and Regent Sawyer.
Regent Bulkley presented the following letter:PRESIDENT HARRY B. HUTCHINS,
Office of the President.
DEAR SIR:I wish to bring the following matter to your attention.
In 1913 the Association of American Geographers raised a Committee on Research and instructed it to determine
what explorations the association should undertake to support. This committee canvassed the membership for recommendations and tentative outlines of proposed explorations, and as a member I submitted three plans for zoogeographical explorations, which I hoped would influence the
committee in its choice.
I have now been informed by the chairman that my suggestions have not only been approved by the committee but
that each member has selected them from the many proposed as his first choice. I am now urged by the committee to prepare detailed outlines and estimates of any one
of my three plans so that the committee may adopt it.
I am;about to propose a five-year biological survey of
an area in South America under my direction, the work to.
be done during the summer months. I anticipate that there
can be no objection to this on the part of the University
authorities but I wish to bring it to your attention because
I desire to bring the Museum into the work. The committee will agree to the condition that the University receive
all of the specimens obtained in as much as I will undertake
the explorations entirely without salary.
I would like to have your approval or disapproval of
this plan. It will in my opinion, be an excellent thing, not
only because a large amount of valuable material will be
secured, but also because the temporary connection between
the Museum and the Association will show to the country
at large that the work which is being done here has the approval of such an eminent organization as the Association
of American Geographers.
Permit me to add that I have not as yet submitted the




76


DECEMIBER MEETIANG, 1914


detailed plans, and that I mlay not be able to do so, since
my present salary scarcely justifies me in contracting to
spend the next four or five years in work for which I will
receive no remuneration. For this reason and because the
committee wishes it I would rather that the matter be kept
from the public until it is finally settled. I will not proceed farther until the plan has your formal approval.
Yours respectfully,
November I9, 1914.       ALEXANDER G. RUTHVEN.

JANUARY MEETING
UNIVERSITY OV MICHIGAN, 
ANN ARBOR, January 2I, I9I5.
The Board met in the Regents' Room at Io o'clock A. M.,
the date having been changed by common consent from
January 22, the date fixed at the previous meeting, to January 2I. Present, the President, Regent Leland, Regent
Beal, Regent Clements, Regent Hubbard, Regent Bulkley,
and Superintendent Keeler. Absent, Regent Sawyer, who
later took his seat, Regent Hanchett, and Regent Gore.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the minutes of the meeting of December 22 were approved as submitted to the members in proof.
The Committee on Nomenclature (see June, 1914, p.
IOI4) made the following report, which with such changes
as were suggested by Regent Hubbard and are incorporated
in the report as printed below, was adopted, with the understanding that all previous pertinent regulations are to be
interpreted. consistently with the report, and that the required changes made in the diploma plates should date from
January I, I916.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University
of Michigan:Your committee; appointed to prepare and submit a
standard nomenclature of University buildings, departments,
etc.. with a standard of capitalization, for the guidance of
the editors of the University publications, begs leave to submit the following report: —
I. Your committee recommends that the name of the
large annual publication be changed from "The Calendar
of the University of Michigan for (1915-I916)" to "The Catalogue of the University of Michigan for (I915-I9I6)."
This publication is indeed for the most part a catalogue of
the faculty and students and of the courses offered, while it




94


JANUARY MEETING, 1915


contains in three pages a calendar of the year. Moreover,
the latter fact introduces an awkward confusion in referring to the calendar in the Calendar. The corresponding
publication at most universities is called a catalogue and it
was so called at this University from the beginning until
1871, when its name was changed. We therefore now recommend a return to the original usage. We would further
recommend that the larger annual publication of each Department be called the Announcement of that Department
and that other publications describing special facilities and
programs (as in Business, Administration, Forestry, etc.) be
called Bulletins.
2. In an extended and very pertinent article in the
last annual report of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, President Pritchett criticizes the
catalogue of the University of Michigan in but one important particular, viz., the double and inconsistent use of
the term department both for a grand division of the University and for a division within the former devoted to instruction in a single branch. There has been much confusion in this regard throughout the country, and this University is one of the chief offenders. Thus we have one
school, two colleges, and five departments (including the
only Graduate Department in the United States) and we try
to distinguish the word department used in this sense from
the same word used to designate the smaller divisions by
spelling it with a capital "D" in the former case and a
small "d" in the latter. Even this mode of distinction fails
in speech or when printed in publications other than our
own. This problem of nomenclature was carefully considered by the Association of American Universities and the
set of definitions of certain terms quoted below was adopted by that Association in 9o09 and I9Io, later adopted by
the National Association of State Universities, and subsequently approved by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
The University of Michigan is a member of each of
these bodies. Moreover the terminology advised is conservative, feasible, and well-chosen, and has been approved and
for the most part adopted by most of the prominent institutions. Dean Henry M. Pates, Counsel to the Board, to
whom the question has been referred, expresses the opinion,
after careful investigation, that the Board of Regents has




JANUARY MEETING, 1951


95


the power to make such changes in names of the various
parts of the University as it may deem wise. His opinion
is appended hereto.
In the belief that thereby we can eliminate the ugly and
troublesome inconsistency and confusion in which we are
now involved, your committee recommends the adoption of
-the nomenclature as contained in the definitions quoted below and in particular the nomenclature cited in connection
with these definitions.
A. "That the term   department be restricted to the
various subjects taught in the university; as, for instance,
the department of Latin, department of mathematics, department of physics, etc."
B. "That the term course be restricted to the subdivisions of a subject, as, for instance, Course I in English."
C. "That the term college be restricted to a part of
the university the standard of admission to which is the
equivalent of that required by the Carnegie Foundation for
the Advancement of Teaching, and which offers instruction
of not less than two years' duration leading to a first degree in arts, letters, or sciences."  Thus, in particular, we
recommend the nomenclature: the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts; the Colleges of Engineering and
Architecture; the College of Pharmacy; the College of
Dental Surgery.
D. "That the term school be restricted to a part of
the university the standard of admission to which is not less
than the equivalent of two years' work in the college and
which offers instruction of not less than two years' duration leading to a technical or professional degree." In particular, we recommend the nomenclature: the Medical
School; the  Law   School; the   Homoeopathic  Medical
School; the Graduate School.
E. "That the term group be restricted to a combination of related subjects," as, for instance, the foreign language group, the civil engineering group.
F. "That the term curriculum be restricted to a combination of courses leading to a degree." Thus, in particular, we recommend the nomenclature: the Combined Curriculum in Letters and Law, etc., etc.; the Curricula in Business Administration, in Civil Engineering, in Forestry, etc.,
etc.




96


JANUARY MEETING, 1915


G. "That the term  division be used to indicate any
organic portion of the university which is larger or more
independent than a department." This term does not apply
to any present condition.
H. We recommend the use of the expression the University Extension Service.
The Homceopathic Medical School should, in our opinion, be so called because in September I9I6 it will require
two years of college work for admission. When one of the
schools or colleges is referred to separately it should be
called, for example, "The Medical School of the University
of Michigan."
3. Your committee recommends the change in titles
from Junior Professor and Clinical Professor to Associate
Professor. The latter is the term used universally throughout the country and was in use here until 1889. We therefore recommend a return to the original usage.
4. Your committee also recommends the adoption of
the terminology: the department of Economics, with the
sub-departments of Political Economy, Business, Administration, and Sociology. Thus the term Political Economy
would have its original significance, the other subjects having been added more recently.
5. We recommend the adoption of the following names
for the University Buildings: University Hall, Engineering Building, Medical Building, Law Building, Natural Science Building, Chemistry and Pharmacy Building, Library,
Museum, Tappan Hall, Alumni Memorial Hall, Physics
Building, Old Engineering Building, Engineering Shops,
Economics Building, Physiology and Pharmacology Building, Surveying Building, Waterman Gymnasium, Barbour
Gymnasium, Hill Auditorium, Dental Building, Homceopathic Building, University Homceopathic Hospital, University Hospital (including various Wards, etc.), Observatory,
West Hall, President's Residence, Old Power House, Power Sub-station, Campus Fire Station, University Health
Service Offices, Homoeopathic Nurses' Home, Storehouse,
Heating and Power Plant, Nurses' Home (several), Sewage Disposal Plant, Gauging Station, University Greenhouses, Forestry Nursery, Helen H. Newberry Residence
Hall, Martha Cook Building.




JA4NUARY MEETING, 191-5


97


6. Your committee recommends that in capitalizing,
punctuating and alphabeting, the official University publications conform to the rules contained in the Manual of Style
issued by the University of Chicago Press. This will insure
as much uniformity as is possible when these publications
are edited by so many different persons.
7. We recommend that these regulations go into effect
in the publications appearing after February I, I915.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
ARTHUR G. HALL
ISAA C N. DEI MMON
I concur in the foregoing recommendations.
S. W. SMIITH
The Senate Council at its meeting January 5, 1915, voted unanimously to concur in the foregoing recommendations. The Senate Council is composed of the President,
the Deans of all the Departments, and Professors Lloyd,
Markley, Alien, Novy, Lane, Bigelow, Myers, and \Ward.
The Secretary reported that the Attorney General of
the State had given no opinion with regard to the liability
of the University under the federal deficiency tax law, but
that the Collector of Internal Revenue at Detroit had advised
in every case submitted to him that the University was not
liable under this law.
Dean Bates and Judge Lane appeared as representatives
respectively of the Michigan Union and the Students'
Christian Association relative to matters the subject of discussion between these organizations.    The informal understanding was reached that Professor Bates and Professor
Lane should consider the matter further and endeavor to
report a joint recommendation at the next meeting of the
Regents. In the meantime the University Y. M. C. A. is
to confine its solicitation of funds among the alumni of the
University to subscriptions for current expenses only.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, the salary of Dr. HI. H.
Cummings, Executive     Head of the University      Health
Service, was placed at the rate of $3,500 per year, beginning with February I, provided this change could be made
within the income of the Health Service.




98


JANUARY MEETING, 1915


An informal report was made in the matter of improved
facilities in the Waterman Gymnasium. On motion of Regent Clements, this question was referred back to the Buildings and Grounds Committee for further consideration.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, Dr. James G. Van
Zwaluwenburg was requested to devote his entire time to
his duties as Clinical Professor of Roentgenology, and on
condition that compliance with this request should be agreeable to Dr. Van Zwaluwenburg, his salary was fixed at the
rate of $3,000 per year from the beginning of the second
semester of the present year.
The Executive Committee filed the following report,
which was, on motion of Regent Hubbard, adopted and approved:To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan.
GENTLEMEN:At a meeting of your Executive Committee, held January 14, I915, the matter of an additional instructor in Civil
Engineering, that was referred with power to the Committee at the last meeting of the Board, was up for consideration, and your Committee concluded that such an instructor
was necessary and appointed to that position Mr. James
Harlan Cissel, B.S. in Civil Engineering, at a salary of
$1,200.00 per year, his term of service to begin with the second semester.
Respectfully submitted.

Two requests were received from     Mrs. Margaret E.
Hunt, the surviving donor to the University of certain lands
in Humboldt and Mendocino counties, Californa. These
requests were (I) for the re-imbursement to Mrs. Hunt
of taxes which she had paid, and (2) for the agreement by
the Regents to convey a strip through one of the tracts for
purposes of the highway now being constructed by the State
of California. Accompanying these requests was an opinion
by Dean Bates to the effect that the actions requested by
Mrs. Hunt were in accordance with the provisions of the
deeds of trust under which the lands were conveyed to the
University. On motion of Regent Sawyer, the sum         of
$918.21, the amount of the taxes in question, was authorized
to be paid to Mrs. Hunt and the signing of the agreement
with respect to the highway was also authorized.
The Secretary presented the following report, addressed
to Regent Bulkley, in the matter of the Octavia W. Bates
estate:HONORABLE H. C. BULKLEY,
Detroit, Michigan.
DEAR SIR: —
In reply to your request for the report of the present
status of the Octavia W. Bates estate, I beg to advise you
as follows:
At your request I visited Baltimore, January 8, and
having checked up the various matters in accordance with
your directions and having verified my checking with the
consultation and help of the firm of lawyers in Baltimore
to whom you referred me, I delivered to Mr. E. J. W.
Revell, the executor of the will, the release signed by the
President under authority from the Regents.
The University has received under this will the following:LAW LIBRARY BEQUEST
Cash from the Executor..............$14,000.00
Interest as part of the University Trust
funds............................  477.85
Total in the Octavia W. Bates Law Library Fund $14,477.85

Interest earned on funds in hands of
Treasurer up to January I.........  328.60
Amount in hand January 20, I915.....         $29,805.35
Total amount received under Miss Bates's will
up to the time of the delivery of the release $44,283.20
The Brice Street houses, though subject to ground
rent of $48 per year each, will, I think, net 7% or 8% to the
University. The ground rents will net 6%, less a 5%0 fee on
collections, that is, they will net 5.70%.
I asked Mr. Revell to continue looking after these properties until otherwise advised by the Board of Regents. I
think it would be wise to leave them in h!s hands.
Yours respectfully,
SHIRLEY W. SMITH,
January 20, 1915                      Secretary.
On motion of Regent Bulkley, this report was accepted
and approved, including approval of the delivery of the
release.

income from its operation, after operating expenses and the
expense of upkeep are paid, shall be paid to the Students
Christian Association of the University of Michigan to be
used by it in the maintenance of its work for the women of
the University.
As to its operation it is understood that experience may
show that it is desirable to modify or change any plans
which may be now adopted or which may be in force at any
particular time in the future.
The following suggestions are made, however, as conforming, in the main at least, to plans it is understood the
Regents of the University have under consideration for the
management of other residence halls at the University.
The control, government and operation of the Residence
Hall shall until it shall be changed or modified by agreement
of the Regents of the University and the Students Christian
Association of the University of Michigan, be in a Board of
Governors to consist of five women, one of whom shall be
the Dean of Women of the University and at least two of
the remaining four shall be graduates or former students of
the University of Michigan.
This Board of Governors shall be appointed by the
Regents of the University from persons nominated by the
Board of Trustees of the Students Christian Association, with
their terms so arranged as that the term of office of one
shall expire each year, save that of the Dean of Women,
whose term shall be indeterminate.
Members of this Board shall be subject to removal for
cause at any time, by the Regents of the University, in which
event the vacancy so created shall be filled in the manner
above provided.
This Board of Governors shall, subject to such general
regulations as the Regents of the University may make applicable to students generally, and with a view to the improving of their housing and boarding conditions, manage,
control and operate the Hall as a residence for women students of the University, with the aim of furnishing, at reasonable prices, comfortable rooms, and wholesome board
under social conditions which, while democratic, shall tend
to the best development.
All moneys received by this Board of Governors shall be
paid to the Treasurer of the University and shall be kept in
a special fund and paid out only upon vouchers signed by
the person or persons designated by the Board of Governors.




I38


MARCH MEETING; 1915


Such Board of Governors shall have no authority to
bind the Regents of the University except through vouchers
against this fund and only to the extent of moneys actually
in it, unless specially authorized by the Regents of the University so to do.
It will be expected that a special sinking fund shall be
accumulated for the meeting of extraordinary expenses and
it is suggested that 30% of the net income, and not exceeding $I,ooo per year, be set aside until such fund equals $5,ooo
which shall be its maximum limit and such fund, as expenditures shall be made from it, shall then be maintained at that
maximum by setting aside sufficient from the net income in
the manner above provided and limited.
Respectfully,
V. H. LAN,,
Chairman of the Board of Trustees,,
Students Christian Association.
March 15, I915.

Control the interest received therefrom.
That in the event the funds in the hands of the said
Board in Control shall at any time be insufficient to pay the
debts or obligations of the said Board in Control incurred in
the conduct of the business of the publications under its.

to use them as collateral for a temporary loan, as the Board
of Regents may deem advisable, and to pay over the money
obtained by either of these methods to the Treasurer of the
Board in Control for the purpose of paying the debts of

That if the said fund at any time shall be no longer
needed as an emergency reserve fund to pay the debts of the
said Board in Control, the whole fund, or if the said sum.
shall grow by additions to an amount larger than is necessary to be kept for said purpose, the excess, may be expended in the purchase, direction, or equipment of a building to be used to house a University Press, where the
publications under the control of the said Board in Control shall be printed, or for any other purpose which the
Board of Regents and the Board in Control shall agree
upon and designate, and which shall contribute directly to

Scholarships Fund (see page I32).




APRIL MEETING, 1915


15I


To the Honorable Board of Regents:Under date of March 29 Secretary Smith has asked that
I give an opinion as to the legality of certain changes in the
administration of the Phillips Scholarships proposed by a
joint committee of the Greek and Latin Departments of the
University. These recommendations are made in a communication addressed to the President under date of March
25th, I915, and signed by Professors Henry A. Sanders and
Campbell Bonner.
The proposed changes in the method of administering
the trust under the Phillips will are made desirable, if not
indeed necessary, by reason of changes in the conditions relating to admission to the University which have come about
since the Phillips will became effective. I have been unable to learn when the will was executed or when Mr. Phillips died, but the general understanding seems to be that the
will became effective at least twenty years ago, and at a time
when many students were offering Latin and Greek for admission to the University, and when consequently examinations were given in these subjects to many entering students.
As pointed out in the communication of Professors Sanders
and Bonner, there has been almost a complete change in this
respect. So few students now present Greek that it would
be possible to give examinations to only a very few
entering students. As one of the purposes of the creation
of the trust fund was to encourage excellence in Greek during the high school period, it is manifest that the plan can
no longer be carried out precisely as it was made by the
testator.
The pertinent provisions of the Phillips will are set
forth on pages I04 and Io5 of the proceedings of the Regents for 1915. The changes proposed in the Sanders-Bonner communication will affect only the first two clauses of
the trust provision. As to the first clause, the proposed
change in substance is that examinations at entrance shall
be required only in Latin, but that the student may at his
option also take examination in Greek. This unquestionably involves a slight departure from the plan made by Mr.
Phillips. It is possible that an over-technical court might
hold the change a violation of the trust. But I am strongly
of the opinion that this would not be the correct legal view
to take of the situation. 'The fundamental purpose of the trust
in question is to encourage the study of the so-called classical'
languages. Since the will became effective conditions have




I52


APRIL MEETING, I915


so changed that the precise method pointed out for doing
this cannot be followed. To undertake to carry out the provision literally would actually tend to defeat the object of
the testator. The slight change proposed by the committee,
namely, making examinations in Greek optional, would, on
the other hand, enlarge the number of persons eligible to
the scholarship, and would thus increase the number of those
who, by reason of the scholarships, would be aided and stimulated to continue classical subjects. Undoubtedly some of
those who receive the scholarships upon examination in
Latin only would begin the study of Greek in the University.
I am of the opinion, therefore, that the proposed changes
would not constitute a violation of the spirit and fundamental intent of the trust. The gift is within the scope of
what are known as charitable gifts in this state, and hence
the Cy pres doctrine is applicable, if indeed the proposed
change is not within the scope of the trustees' discretion as
defined in the cases on this subject in this country. I may
cite as pertinent cases
Cook v. Univ. Convention, 138 Mich. 157
Mills v. Newberry, 112 Ill. 123
Barnard v. Adams, 58 Fed. R. 313
Beekman v. Bonsor, 23 N. Y. 298
In re Brown L. R. I8 Chancery Division 6I
Story's Equity Jurisprudence, section 291
Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence, section 1026-28
The same reasons apply to the less important and very
minor deviation proposed with reference to the second
clause. As the testator provides that one-fourth of the
student's time shall be devoted to the study of Greek and
Latin, and the committee provides that he shall take at least
four hours in Latin during the tenure of the scholarship, it
may fairly be said that substantial compliance with the requirement of the will is provided for in recommendation of
*the Sanders-Bonner communication.
HENRY M. BATES,
Counsel for the Regents
Dated April 15, 1915.
Following the presentation of Dean Bates's opinion, the
recommendations of Professor Bonner and Professor Sanders, with respect to the administration of this fund, were
concurred in.
At this point the Board adjourned for lunch.

MAY MEETING
UNIVERSITY OE MICHIGAN, |
ANN ARBOR, May 21, 1915. 
The Board met in the Regents' Room at IO o'clock A. M.
Present, the President, Regent Beal, Regent Sawyer, Regent
Hubbard, Regent Clements, Regent Bulkley, Regent Hanchett, and Superintendent Keeler. Absent, Regent Leland
and Regent Gore.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the minutes were approved after corrections on pages I49, 150, 154, 159, and I60.
The President asked for a report from   the Committee
appointed at an earlier mceting (see page I20) to consider
military 'training in the University. Regent Hubbard made
an informal report for this Committee, following which, in
view of the fact that the question of military training was to
be discussed by the University Senate at an early meeting, it
was thought wise by the Regents to leave the matter in abeyance for the time being.
The President filed the following letter from a representative of the State Board of Examiners in Optometry:DR. H. B. HUTCHINS,
Ann Arbor, Mich.
DEIAR SIR:
A careful survey and campaign has been made throughout the State to get definite data on the probable number
of students who would 'take up Optometry if such a course
were to be established.
I regret that we cannot promise sufficient number to
justify the opening of the course this coming fall even -if
the Regents did take favorable action. Personally I believe
the matter had better be delayed for at least another year
when the outlook for a class in Optometry might be more
favorable.
Thanking you for your suggestions and considerations,
I remain
Yours truly,,
EMIT H. ARNOLD
Ann Arbor, May 20, I915




I62


MAY MEETING, 1915


On mot.on of Regent Bulkley, the communication from
Dean Bates presented at the April meeting (see page I6o)
was considered by the Board and the suggestions made by
the Law Faculty in this communication were approved and
adopted. The communication, not printed in the April minutes, is as follows:7'o the Honorable Board of Regents:Your attention is invited to the following, for consideration if possible at your meeting called for April 22, 1915.
The enormously expanding volume of law during the
last quarter century, the almost totally new fields, especially in public law, and the more intensive and thorough methods of legal instruction required under modern conditions
have made a problem in the framing of law curricula which
law faculties have found it difficult to solve. This may best
be indicated briefly by the statement that the Law School
of this University is now  offering strictly professional
work, which taken at the normal rate would require a student to remain in the Law School about five years, and including such collateral subjects as Roman Law, Jurisprudence and History of Law would keep a student here quite
six years. It is not important that every student take all
of these subjects, but it is important that all students take
more of these subjects than can be obtained in a three years'
curriculum. The elective system has only partially met the
difficulty.
This problem ihas been discussed at different times during several years by this faculty, and some months ago a
committee of five was appointed for the purpose of considering and reporting with reference to the matter.  The
report of that committee was presented to the faculty at a
meeting held April 9, 1915, and after careful discussion
was adopted. In substance the faculty action based upon
this report is as follows:'First. The faculty recommends that in view of the
rapid raising of entrance requirements and of standards of
work during the last few years we should not make a
four years' course obligatory at once.
Second. The faculty does recommend that from the
courses already offered we construct a graded and logically arranged four-year course, and that said course should
include, besides the work already prescribed in the threeyear course, the following required subjects: Roman Law




MAY MEETING, 1915


I63


and Comparative Law, three hours; Jurisprudence, three
hours; History of English Law, three or four hours.
Tihird. The faculty recommends that students on the
four years' course be required to earn at least ninety-six
(96) hours of credit in order to obtain a degree.
Fourth. That students on the four yea-rs' course who
maintain an exceptionally high standard of work in threefourths of their subjects, computed on the hour basis, shall
be granted the degree of Juris Doctor (J..D.), and that those
students who complete this course -with satisfactory
scholarship, but not of the exceptionally high standard required of those who receive the degree of J.D. shall be
given the degree of Master of Laws (LL.M.).
It will be noted that the recommendation is that those
students taking two years in college and four years in the
Law School be put on the same basis, so far as degrees are
concerned, as those who take three. years in college and
three years in the Law School. Of course those who take
but two years in college 'will not under this arrangement
receive any college degree.
I may add that I have given a great deal of thought
to this subject and am firmly convinced that the proposed
move is in the right direction and that it will mark the next
big step in advance taken in legal education. I have. reason
to know that at least three other schools are seriously considering making such a course as is above outlined.
The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching has been making a comprehensive study of legal
education and admission to the bar during the last two
years. As a part of this study, Professor Redlich, of Vienna, Austria, was invited to this country to consider the
subject of instruction in law schools. Professor Redlich's
report was made public April 5, and I note that it includes
among its three recommendations the adoption of a fouryear course for all law students.
The organization of this optional four-year course will
not involve any additional expense. We are now offering
all of the work we shall need for such a course, and the
slight additional amount of teaching time and the additional
class room space can be provided for from our present
equipment.
I respectfully request, therefore, on behalf of the
faculty of law that the proposed optional four-year course
in law be approved and authorized, and that the granting of




I64               MIA Y MIEE$TING, 19f5
the degrees LL.M. and J.D. to those who complete this
course also be authorized by your Board.
The reasons for offering such course I have set out at
greater length than wvould be proper for an official communication of this kind in the April number of The Alumnus, copies of which will be mailed to the members of your
Board before its next meeting.
HENRY M. BATES,
Dean of the Law School,April I4, 1915
On motion of Regent Sawyer, the Board voted that the
question of enlarging the Waterman Gymnasium should be
deferred for the present.
Regent Sawyer reported that the cost of appraising properties securing mortgages tendered to the University by
Baird and Baird, of Kansas City, would be, should the appraisals be made by representatives of the Commerce Trust
Company, of Kansas City, approximately $I. ()On motion.
the Board directed that the appraisal should be made. The
Board also further directed that investments in the mortgages originally tendered by Baird and Baird should be made
under a definite understanding with Baird and Baird that
they would replace any loans which the investigation should
cause the Regents to regard as unsatisfactory.
The Secretary filed the following report:At the meetings of the Regents held March 25 and
April 22 the Board authorized the purchase of property for
coal storage adjacent to the Heating. Power and Lighting
Plant at the cost of $1250 (see pages I28 and I50). I have
to report that under this authority the following property
has been acquired by warranty deed, at the sum named:The east fifty-four feet of Lot Number Ten, block
number Four, in R. S. Smith's Third Addition to the City
of Ann Arbor. according to the recorded plat thereof. And
also granting and reserving a right of way over a strip of
land ten feet in width next adjoining said above described
land on the west to be used as a private driveway by the
parties to this instrument, their heirs, successors and assigns
forever,, to pass and repass on foot or with vehicles but not
to obstruct the same: and the said parties of the second
part for themselves, their successors and assigns hereby
covenant a(nd agree with said first parts his heirs and




MAfY M EEETING, 1915


I65


assigns that they will at their own cost and expense maintain and keep in ordinary good repair and passable condition the above described driveway.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board directed that
passenger elevator insurance on the six elevators in the two
hospitals of the University should be placed with the Union
Casualty Insurance Company, of Philadelphia, for one year,
and set aside the sum of $I68 to cover the premium.
The following report was filed and, on motion of Regent
Bulklev, was approved and adopted, including allowance of
the required appropriation:At the meeting of April 22 the Secretary recommended
an appropriation of not to exceed $16I1.54 for the purchase
and care of equipment for serving the Commencement
luncheon. There was objection to the expenditure of so
large a sum for this purpose and the matter was referred
to the President and Secretary with authority to make such
expenditure as was needed, but by rental or such other
means as might be found possible to reduce the expenditure.
Your Committee begs to report that it has been found
feasible to rent china and glassware of Mr. Hoag in Ann
Arbor, who will guarantee to have this material in hand.
The rental price will be Io% of the value, plus breakage or
loss.
The purchase of the kitchen equipment seems necessary and also the purchase of forks and spoons, and of tablecloths and napkins. By buying a cheaper grade of "silver"
and of "linen," the original estimates of cost have been
considerably reduced, and it is felt that the quality will be
good enough considering the infrequent use and therefore
the slight wear and tear, and considering the possibility of
loss. It is believed that an appropriation of $I,ooo will meet
the requirements under these arrangements. Acting under
the authority of the Regents, your Committee beg to report
that they have authorized this expense and we respectfully
request your approval.
H. B. HUTcHINS, President
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary
The Secretary filed the following report which, on motion
of Regent Bulkley, was approved and adopted, including
allowance of the required appropriation:



I66


MAY MEETING, 1915


I beg to report that under authority given at the meeting of April 22 (see page 154) I have made a contract with
Henry & Co., of Ann Ar'bor, under which Henry & Co.
will provide academic dress for authorized members of the
Faculty, on the occasions of Commencement Week and of
Convocation.  The cost per person so provided for the
two occasions is $2 per annum.   An allowance in the
budget of $300 will therefore be necessary on the assumed
'basis of 50o persons.
This contract protects the University under this arrangement for five years but may be terminated by the
University at its own option during any year after the
first year.
Respectfully submitted,
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board adopted the
following resolution:Resolved, That Professor I. N. Demmon be and hereby is appointed curator of rare books and rare manuscripts

Committee of the Board with power.

A communication was received from Mr. Ray E. Hall, a
research worker in wireless telegraphy, asking permission
to use the wireless laboratory in the Engineering Building

Regent Hubbard, this request was referred, with authority,
to the President, Dean Cooley, and Professor George;W.
Patterson.
The Secretary read the following report for the Executive Committee which, on motion of Regent Hubbard, was
approved and ordered placed on record.
To the Honorable Board of Regents,
University of Michigan.
GNTLEMEN:Your Executive Committee, to whom was referred the
matter of the salary of and an assistant to Dr. Elsie S. Pratt
(see p. 179), beg leave to report that after having considered the situation carefully, they recommend that Dr.




JUNE MEETING, 1915


207


Pratt's salary be fixed at $350o.oo and that she be allowed
an assistant to receive, for the time such assistant serves,
a salary equal in amount to that paid to the assistant to Dr.
Cummings, it being understood, however, that such assistant
will not probably be employed for more than half time and
in any event that the amount of time employed shall not be
such as to make the entire salary exceed $I,ooo.oo per
annum. This recommendation is made, however, upon
condition that the funds of the Health Service warrant the
additional expenditure.
In regard to a special course for scout masters, referred to your Committee (see p. I69), we report that in
our judgment it is not expedient at the present time to
authorize such a course. The members of the Committee
feel, however, that considerable work is given that would
be useful for a person having in view the calling of a scout
master and that the Deans of the Departments, in which
such work is given, be advised to arrange individual courses
for such persons as may apply.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

educational lines peculiarly pertaining to the work of oar
profession.  It was the unanimous opinion of those in

it would be highly desirable if such institutes could be held

next year.
In addition to expressing the feeling of those in attendance, I wish to add my personal hearty commendation to
those who originated and were a'ble to carry out this plan.
The Superintendents and Principals of the State are looking
forward with eager anticipation to the announcement of
the plans for the next short-term institute.
Very truly yours

JUNE MEETING, 1915

The report of the Extension Service for I914-I9I5 was
received from the Director, Associate Professor Henderson.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, this report was received and
ordered filed.
The following communication from       the Dean, of the
Graduate School was received and on motion of Regent
Hanchett, the Board approved the extension of the privilege
of registering in the Graduate School as part-time students,
as requested, to practicing engineers and physicians.
Your Honorable Board, at its meeting in June, 1912 (see
proceedings, page 465), adopted a resolution fixing the fee
for part-time students at ten dollars ($Io). According to
this resolution the benefit is extended only to teachers in
public, parochial, or private schools. Upon the recommendation of Dean Cooley, and the Heads of the various Engineering departments, the Executive Board of the Graduate
School decided to ask your Honorable Board to extend the
privilege of registering as part-time students to practicing
engineers and physicians, who might register in the Graduate School for work not exceeding five hours of credit,
each semester. There are in neighboring cities, especially
in Detroit and Toledo, a number of professional men who
would gladly take advantage of such an opportunity; in
fact two specific cases have been brought to my knowledge.
It is the opinion of the Executive Board of the Graduate
School that the benefits of university instruction might
well be extended to the engineers and physicians who wish
to continue their professional education beyond the undergraduate degree 'but who cannot return for regular work to
the University.
On recommendation of the Executive Board of the
Graduate School, Fellows were appointed as follows:Gas Engineering Fellowships, $400 each: John Thomas
Naylon, Bert Arnold:Standerline

Hubbard, Regent Bulkley, Regent Hanchett, Regent Gore,
and Superintendent Keeler. Absent, Regent Sawyer and
Regent Clements, who later took their seats.
The minutes for the meeting of July 22, I915, were approved as submitted to the members of the Board in proof
with minor changes on pages 221, 228, and 236.
Regent Clements took his seat.
The matter of changes in the administration of the reading room of the Alumni Memorial Hall (see pages 167 and
221) on motion of Regent Leland was referred to Regent
Gore and Librarian Bishop, with power, except with respect
to the question of additional salary for the Curator. Should
the question of such salary arise, the committee was requested to report its opinion to the Board.
Regent Sawyer took his seat.
On motion of Regent Clements, and in accordance with
a report signed August 19 by a committee consisting of
Dean Effinger, Dean Guthe, and Professor Shepard, the
Board directed that the South Wing be remodeled for the

262


OCTOBER MEETING, 1915


The following report was received from Professor Demmon, upon the matter referred to him at the special June
meeting (see page 183).
Since names serve as distinguishing marks, it is important, in dealing with such large and ever increasing numbers, that these names be as full and as permanent as possible. To this end all matriculants should be required to
give their full names (initials and nicknames to be avoided) at the time of registration. When once a name has
been entered upon the records, no change should be permitted in any part of the name, especially when such change
would necessitate cross-references in alphabeting. (The
filling out of an initial or other abbreviation should be allowed.)  In exceptional cases, requests should be treated
as follows:
I. The desired change should be sanctioned by a Court of
Record; or
2. Should be approved by the Board of Regents after a
full statement of the reasons therefor.
In the latter case, I would suggest that the President of
the University, the Secretary of the Board, and the Editor of the General Catalogue act as a committee to ascertain the facts, in each instance, and report them to the
Board. I would further suggest that the Secretary of the
Board be empowered to arrange for the proper instruction in this matter of every candidate at the time of matriculation.
On motion of Regent Beal, Professor Demmon's report
was accepted and his recommendations were adopted as the
rule of the Regents in such cases.
Regent Beal reported that 42.I9 acres of the White estate wood-land (see page 221) had been purchased September I, for $8,438, the seller agreeing to take care of this
year's taxes.
Regent Beal further reported against the purchase at
present of the property at 237 S. Ingalls St., Ann Arbor.
On motion of Regent Leland, Regent Beal's report in'these
two matters was approved and adopted.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the question of acquiring property at the corner of Ingalls St. and North University Ave. was referred to a committee consisting of Regent
Beal and Regent Clements.

Regent Leland reported that he had ordered repairs on
the Phillips Scholarship properties in Philadelphia (see page
227) to a total cost of between $9oo and $I,ooo, which repairs would place the property in good condition for rental.
The expense of these repairs is to be borne out of the accumulation in the Phillips Scholarship fund. On motion of
Regent Clements, the report of Regent Leland was approved
and adopted.
On motion of Regent Bulkley, the following report of
the Executive Committee was adopted and approved:To the Honorable Board of Regenlts:At the July meeting of the Regents, there was referred
to the Executive Committee, with power, the question
whether the lantern-slide shop, conducted by.Miss Dunbar
and Mr. Boyce in the basement of the Pharmacology and
Physiology Building, should be allowed to solicit work
from other universities and colleges.
After considering the question, your committee begs
leave to report that they have allowed the above-named
parties to solicit work by letters and circulars from laboratories and other universities and colleges, it being understood that the University is to receive twenty per cent of the
gross charges for work secured in this way.
Respectfully submitted,

discretion of the committee.
Only the examination in Latin shall be absolutely required; but any student who has had preparation in two
units of Greek may elect to be examined upon them as well
as upon four units of Latin. If the combined grade of his
examinations in Greek and Latin is equal or superior to
the grade of a candidate who presents Latin only, he will be
given the preference in the awarding of the scholarships.
(b) The successful candidate or candidates shall be
required during the year of tenure to pursue each semester
one full course of four hours in Greek, and one full course
of four hours in Latin.
(c) The scholarship held by any successful candidate

second year, provided that the applicant has attained in his
courses in Latin and Greek a grade not less than B and continues the study of both languages during his second year,
to the amount of three hours each per semester.
(d) The Committee in charge of the scholarships
shall determine, after considering the merits of the individual cases, whether it is more expedient to renew the
scholarships for a second year or to award new ones.

character of the candidates shall be observed.

Respectfully submitted,
SHIRLEY W. SMITH,
For the Committee.
On motion of Regent Clements, the President and Secretary were authorized to take such action as they deemed
the duty of the University required in the case of Miss Clara

The Executive Committee presented the following, reports all of which were duly accepted an(l approved by the
Board:At the last meeting of the Board the question of the
salary of the Registrar of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts was considered and certain results
reached that proved to be unsatisfactory to the Registrar
and to embarrass the relationship between his office and the
office of the Dean of said College. At a meeting of your




OCTOBER MEETINGG, 1915


271


Committee, held July 24, it was determined to advise the
Board of Regents to fix the salary of Registrar Hall at
$3,500.00, $2,500.00 of that sum to be regarded as the salary
for his work as Registrar and such incidental teaching as
he may do, $500.00 for his work as editor of the University
Catalogue and announcements, $250.00 for his work in passing upon admissions on diploma, and $250.00 for his work
as auditor of the accounts of student organizations.
Your Committee further recommends that Professor
Hall's title be changed to that of Registrar and Professor
of Mathematics. In order to avoid confusion, it is further
recommended that the title of the Registrar of the Homoeopathic Medical School be changed to that of Recorder
of the Homoeopathic Medical School.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
Your Executive Committee, at a meeting held August
18, I915, appointed Dr. Gilbert H. Taylor Instructor in the
Department of Latin ifor the next university year at a salary
of $I,ooo, in place of Professor Henry A. Sanders, who has
leave of absence for the year. This salary is to be deducted
from the salary of Professor Sanders, it being a condition
of his leave of absence that he supply a satisfactory substitute for his university work. This appointment was made
by your Committee upon the nomination cf Professor Sanders.
Your Executive Committee at a session held August
23, 1915, appointed Mr. Harley H. Bartlett, of Washington, D. C., as Acting Assistant Professor for the term
of one year in place of Dr. Henri T. A. Hus, recently
given a leave of absence for three years, the salary of Mr.
Bartlett to be the same as that provided for in the budget
for Dr. Hus, namely, $I,800. In order to secure the services
of Mr. Bartlett it was necessary that this appointment be
made during the vacation.
At the last meeting of the Regents, July 22, I915, the
sum of $I,300 was set aside from the general fund for the
expense of moving the old Psychological Laboratory and
putting it in condition for use by the Highway Engineering
Laboratory.
Upon investigation it has been found to be impracticable
to move this laboratory. Dean Cooley and Professor Riggs
have concluded that the Highway Laboratory can be accom



272


OCTOBER MlEETING, 1915


modated for a time at least in the old Power Plant, and
have asked that so much of the said $1,300 as is necessary
for that purpose, may he used in adapting a part of the old
Power Plant for the work of Highway Engineering. The
entire Power Plant has been set aside for the use of the,Mechanical Engineering Department. Professor Allen consents to the temporary use of a part of it for Highway Engineering. It should be said that the changes that must be
made for the purpose of adapting the building for the Highway Engineering work are changes that would have to be
made for work in Mechanical Engineering.
As this seemed to be an emergency case, your Executive Committee, at a meeting held August 26, I915, authorized the use of so much of the $I,300 as may be found necessary in making the changes suggested. Your Committee
asks the Regents to confirm its action.
At a meeting of the Executive Committee held September I, Ii95, your Committee authorized the Department
of Forestry to prepare and post, at the Saginaw Forestry
Farm, notices prohibiting persons from shooting, or using
firearms in any way, on said farm, and prohibiting also the
starting of fires on the property. The Committee directed
that it should be stated in such notices that the prohibition
was by the authority of The Regents of the University of
Michigan. The Committee asks that this action may be confirmed by the Regents.
At a meeting of the Executive Committee held September I, 1915, it was ordered that insurance to the extent of
$20,000 be placed upon the contents of the Martha Cook
Building, and the Committee begs to report that this was
done. It seemed to the Committee particularly desirable
that the insurance be placed upon the contents now, as there
is more than ordinary danger from fire while the building
is being made ready for use. The Committee asks that this
action be authorized by the Regents.
Your Executive Committee at a meeting held September 24, 1915, took action as follows:i. Mr. Albert R. Bailey, Assistant Professor of Civil
Engineering, was granted leave of absence for the first semester, 1915-1916, without salary, in order that he might
continue his connection with the appraisal of the New Jersay Public Service Corporation's electric lines. Dean Cool



OCTOBER MJEETING, 1 915

ey represented to your Committee that it seemed advisable
that this request be granted, as the experience that M\r. Bailey would gain by this outside work would make him more
valuable in his university work. He represented further that
just now it is possible to supply his place readily.
2. To provide for Mr. Bailey's work, your Committee appointed Mr. Norman Kirkwood Sheppard, as Instructor in Civil Engineering for the first semester at a salary
rate of $I,Ioo.oo per year. Mr. Sheppard, who is now connected with the Saginaw and Bay City Railway, Light &
Power Co., was recommended for this work by Dean Cooley
and Professor Riggs.
Dean Cooley further recommended, in order to help out
the work in Railway Engineering due to the absence of Professor Bailey, the reappointment of Mr. William H. Sellew
of the Michigan Central engineering staff as Non-Resident
Lecturer on Railway Engineering for the year I915-I916 at
$300.00, which would necessitate the use of the remainder of
Professor Bailey's salary for the first semester. A request
for the reappointment of Mr. Sellew, who lectured here two
years ago, was made in the last budget of the College of
Engineering, but was cut out before the budget was adopted. Your Committee concluded not to pass upon this request, but to refer it to the full Board.
The recommendation of Dean Cooley is attached hereto.
3. Mr. Winthrop R. Wright was appointed Instructor
in the Department of Physics in place of Mr. Glenn Alfred
Shook, resigned, at a salary of $I,ooo.oo.
4. Mr. Charles F. Meyer was appointed Instructor in
Physics for the university year I915-I916 only at a salary
of $I,ooo.oo. This appointment was made necessary by the
death of Dean Guthe. By means of this appointment and
a rearrangement of the work in the Department of Physics,
the teaching of the department can be carried for the year.
These appointments were made on the recommendation of Dean John R. Effinger of the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts.  His recommendation is attached
hereto.
Your Committee asks the confirmation of its action as
hereinbefore set forth, by the full Board.
On motion of Regent Bulkley, the Board appointed Mr.
William  I.' Sellew  as Non-resident Lecturer on Railway
Engineering for the university year I9i5-1916 at the salary




274

of $300 as suggested. without direct recommendation, in the
last of the reports of the Executive Committee above.
The Executive Committee further reported that by a
majority vote they had allowed the sum of $50 for an exhibit by the University in connection with the State Highway Commission at the West Michigan State Fair. This
action of the Executive Committee was approved.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the Board appointed
John Castelar Parker as Professor of Electrical Engineering and Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering
at the salary of $4,ooo per year, beginning with the first of
the University year I915-1916.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the title of Professor
George W. Patterson was changed to: "Professor of Engineering Mechanics."
A request of a student for a refund of the $5 outdoor
physical education fee was referred to the Board in Control
of Athletics for report at the next meeting.
Professor A. G. Ruthven informed the Regents that
the Museum had received a very valuable collection of
owls from Dr. Bryant Walker, of Detroit. On motion of
Regent Bulkley, this gift was accepted and the thanks of
the Regents were formally voted to Dr. Walker.
On motion of Regent Bulkley, the Board voted not to
exceed $80 for the traveling expenses of Professor F. W.
Kelsey on a trip to New York and Boston in connection with
the manufacture of the plates for various publications.
Dean Cooley gave notice to the Regents that Mr. Roy
D. Chapin, President of the Hudson Motor Car Company
of Detroit, had signified his intention to maintain for three
years an annual fellowship of $5oo in Highway Engineering. On motion of Regent Hubbard, this gift was accepted
and the Secretary was directed to transmit the thanks of the
Regents to Mr. Chapin for his co-operation with this work.
On motion, the Regents took a recess until 5 P. M.

NOVEMBER MEETING
UNIVE,RSITY 01 MICHIGAN, 1
ANN ARBOR, November 2, I915. 
The Board met in the Regents' Room at Io P. M. Present, the President, Regent Leland, Regent Beal, Regent
Sawyer, Regent Hubbard, Regent Clements, Regent Bulkley, and Regent Hanchett. Absent, Regent Gore and Superintendent Keeler.
On motion of Regent Clements, the minutes of the meeting of October 15 were approved as submitted to the members in proof, with a number of changes in typography and
forms of expression.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the Board authorized
traveling expenses of not over $30 to cover 'a trip by Professor Joseph Bursley to Gary, Ind., to investigate there the
question of economical use of space in school buildings.
Regent Sawyer presented the following letter, addressed
to himself:
I have considered the matter taken up in our discussion
of last evening and should be pleased to undertake the making of a general plan or scheme for the University Hospital
at Ann Arbor.
I will undertake this work for a fee in full of $I50o.
This work would cover consultations with the Hospital
Committee at Ann Arbor and the developing and revision
of such ideas as may arise at these consultations and the
forming of a general plan showing elevations, etc., at a
small scale. This would include the elaboration of the individual schedules of building or buildings under prospect of
present construction to a point where a fair estimate of the
cost of the same could be made. If it is desired to go outside
of Ann Arbor for consultation or to visit other institutions,
I will give my time to this travel provided my actual expenses are paid.
Assuring you of my best efforts should I be entrusted
with this commission, I am
Yours truly,
WM. B. STRATTON.
November 2, I915.




298


2NOVEMBlER MEETING, 9_15


On motion of Regent Sawyer, the Board accepted the
proposal of Mr. Stratton with the understanding that the
Regents assumed no obligation to commission Mr. Stratton
to prepare the building plans and specifications for any structure which might ultimately be erected under the general
plan or scheme. The sum of $500 was added to the original
appropriation of $I,oo0   (see page I89) for this purpose.
On motion of Regent Beal, the Board authorized the
employment in the Engineering Shops for this year only of
a part time mechanic for the construction of apparatus for
the Department of Physics, at the salary of $30o     payable
out of funds already appropriated for the Physics salary
roll.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, the Board set aside the
sum  of $250 for the purchase of four alternating current
motors for the Printing Plant.
The following communication was received:GENT'LEMEN:In past years much confusion and some loss arose
through delay in the payment of students' fees at registration time. To avoid this difficulty a number of years ago
the Regents directed that all matriculation, annual, and
laboratory fees must be paid in advance of registration.
This regulation, strictly enforced, has worked a vast improvement. Sometimes, however, hardship has arisen in
individual cases, as with students who have almost but not
quite money enough to register, or who are certain of
money for their fees within a comparatively short time.
To obviate this trouble, the Auditing Board suggests
to the Board of Regents the desirability of authorizing the
Auditing Board, or its proper representative, to make loans
to students in certain cases, out of the University Trust
Funds, where the University can be absolutely protected
through the refund of fees due to students who withdraw
within specified periods.
If a student withdraws within two weeks he is entitled to a refund of his entire fee. Therefore, since the
University has the money in its own hands, the University would be protected during a period of two weeks for
the loan of the entire amount of students' fees. Similarly
the University would be protected on a loan of 5o% of the




NOVEMBER MEETING, 915r


299


annual fee for a term of eight weeks, and on a loan of
40% of the annual fee for a term of one semester. The
following form of note is suggested:Ann Arbor, Michigan,............Ig9....................
On or before.............next I promise to pay to the
University of Michigan or order the sum of................
Dollars for value rec&ived. In consideration of this loan
being made me without other security than my own signature, I agree and promise that should this loan not be repaid on or before the above-named due date, I will on said
due date withdraw from my connection as a student with
said University of Michigan, and said University is hereby
authorized, in the event of the non-payment of this note on
or before the above-named due date, to terminate my connection as a student with said University and out of the
amount due me as a refund of fees in consequence of my
withdrawal on or before such date, to withhold a sum
equal to the then unpaid portion or whole of this note, the
sum so withheld to be applied in final payment of this note.
(Signature)...........................
A fee of $I.oo or interest at the rate of 6% per annum,
whichever amount is greater, has been deducted from the
proceeds of this loan when made.
The fee for or interest on this loan would not be great
enough to be burdensome and would yet prevent students
from borrowing needlessly. There would always be a sufficient amount in the Trust Funds to make these loans, as
doubtless they would not aggregate all told $Iooo.oo.
Respectfully submitted,
SHIRLEY W. SAMITH, Secretary,
for Auditing Board.
On motion of Regent Hanchett, the Board approved and
authorized the suggested plan of loans.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, Mr. Edward A. Rykenboer was authorized to enroll in the Graduate School for
the present year, on payment of the $Io fee required of
those whose work, with the exception of their dissertations,
is completed (see pages 49-50).




300


NO VELMEBER MEETING, 1915


On motion of Regent Sawyer, the Board set aside the
sum of $328.85 for changes in the north and south hallways
of the main east and west corridors of the second floor of
the Palmer Ward.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the Board referred to
the President, with power, the request of Miss Alice E.
Hunt that on account of illness she might be granted temporary leave of absence, with salary.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, Mr. F. W. Pawlowski
was promoted to be Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the salary of $I,70o, effective with the beginning of the present University year.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the Board declined at
this time to grant a promotion to Mr. C. E. Wilson, Instructor in Mechanical Engineering.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the Board referred to
the Buildings and Grounds Committee for report a communication from Dean Cooley requesting better provision
than the present for alternating current service to the Electrical Engineering Laboratory.
Regent Leland and Regent Bulkley recommended that
no action be taken at present toward the sale of certain vacant lots in Detroit owned by the University (see page 269).
On motion of Regent Clements, Regent Leland was authorized to write the New York Trust Company, administrator of the estate of the late Williston S. Hough, requesting that Company to act as it might think most advantageous
to the estate with respect to the proposed sale of shares of
American Brass Company stock.
Regent Leland was excused.
The Secretary reported the information he had thus far
been able to secure and the action he had felt justified in
taking with respect to fire insurance upon the Psychopathic
Hospital (see page 264). On motion of Regent Clements
this question was referred to Regent Bulkley and the Secretary, with power.
On motion of Regent Hanchett, the Board voted that the
question of reducing the number of vouchers required in
the payment of University obligations (see page 265) be
laid upon the table.




NAO EMBER MEETING, 1915


301


On motion of Regent Hanchett, the Board adopted the
following resolution:Resolved, That the Secretary and Treasurer be instructed to consider and take up with the Auditor General the
question whether the accounting methods affecting in common the Auditor General's office and the University business
offices might not be somewhat simplified.
The Secretary and the Treasurer were requested to report at an early date upon this matter.
The President reported that he had authorized a loan
from the 1894 Class Fund to Miss Jamie Morgan (see page
276).
The Secretary reported that in the opinion of the attorneys of the Board the University would acquire a good
title to certain lands adjacent to the Bogardus Engineering
Camp (see page I67) through a deed signed by W. J. Galloway but lacking the signature of his wife who has not been
a resident of this state since 1902. On motion of Regent
Clements, the Secretary was authorized to accept such deed.
The President presented a communication from  Mrs.
Josephine P. McGowan, the widow of the late Regent Jonas
H. McGowan, transmitting a check for $500 to constitute
a loan fund in memory of Mr. McGowan. The donor requested that the fund should be administered by the President and the Dean of the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts as a loan fund for the benefit of needy students in
that College.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, this gift was accepted
under the conditions stated, and the Secretary was directed
to communicate to Mrs. McGowan the thanks of the Regents.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, the Board authorized the
reimbursement of Mrs. Margaret E. Hunt for taxes paid
by her on California lands in which the University has a
contingent interest (see page Io2). These payments aggregate for the present year and for the final installment of
the preceding year the sum of $206.47, plus possible collection fees.
The Secretary presented a claim of James W. McKernan
and Katherine McKernan for alleged damages to property




302


NO VEMBER.MEETING, 1915


due to the construction of the side track from the Michigan
Central Railroad to the Heating, Power, and Lighting
Plant.   This claim was referred to the Secretary and the
attorneys of the Board for report.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, Mr. Wayne J. Atwell was
authorized to register for the present University year as a
resident of Michigan.
The Secretary presented correspondence between Dean
Cooley and M\r. John S. Dodge, of Detroit, transmitting the
sum of $io,ooo as a student loan fund in accordance with a
proposed agreement, as follows:Know all men by these presents, that I, John F. Dodge
of the City of Detroit, County of Wayne, and State of
Michigan, do hereby give and donate to the Regents of the
University of Mlichigan the sum of Ten Thousand ($Io,ooo)
Dollars, the purpose and conditions of said gift being as
follows:I. The purpose of this gift is the establishment of a
loan fund in the College of Engineering of the University,of Michigan, the beneficiaries of such fund to be seniors
and juniors in said College and said fund to be known as the
John Frank Dodge Loan Fund, College of Engineering.
2. The moneys of this fund shall be handled by the
Treasurer of the University of 'Michigan and shall be by
him, under the direction of the Finance Committee of the
Regents, kept constantly invested so far as the purpose of
the fund makes such investment practicable.
3. The conditions of this gift are the following:a. Said fund shall be administered by a committee
consisting of the President of the University, the Dean
of the College of Engineering, and the Professor at
the head of the department in which the applicant for
aid is enrolled.
b. The principal and interest of said fund shall
be loaned in sums not exceeding one hundred dollars
for any one year and not exceeding two hundred dollars to any one student, to seniors or juniors in said
College of Engineering whose record as students and
whose needs, in the judgment of said committee, justify
-uch loan.
c. Upon receiving the money the applicant shall
sign a note for same, payable to the Treasurer of the




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1915


303


I'iiversity of Michigan, the time and interest rate to be
as provided in paragraphs d and e.
d. The time for payment of loans shall be fixed
so as not to exceed two years from the date of graduation of the students receiving loans. This time may,
however, be extended at the discretion of the Committee, if in its judgment such extension of time is
proper and deserved; but no extension of time shall
be given until the note shall have become due and payable, and then only on evidence establishing its propriety and necessity.
e. All loans shall bear interest at the rate of five
per cent per annum from the time of graduation until
the time of repayment.
4. If in the future this fund shall grow to -exceed the
needs of its original purpose as a loan fund, the interest
on such excess shall, when it accumulates in sufficient
amount, be used to encourage research and to establish fellowships in engineering under such conditions and on such
terms as the Regents may prescribe, being advised in the
premises by the President of the University and the Dean
of the College of Engineering. At such time the title of the
fund may be changed to include the terms research and
fellowships, one or both. Provided, however, that no funds
shall be used for research or fellowship work that will in
any way impair the original capital of this fund.
1I WTitness Whereof, I 'have hereunto set my hand this
iSth day of October, A. D. I915.
JOHN FRANK DODGE.
The Regents of the University of 'Michigan hereby accept the donation provided for in the foregoing instrument.

The Board met in the Regents' Room         at Io A. M.
Present, the President, Regent Leland, Regent Sawyer,
Regent Hubbard, Regent Clements, Regent Bulkley, Regent
Hanchett, Regent Gore, and Superintendent Keeler.        Absent, Regent Beal, who later took his seat.
On motion of Regent Hubbard, the minutes of the
meeting of November 2 were approved as submitted to the
members in proof, with changes on pages 300 and 302.
Regent Beal took his seat.
The   Secretary   read  the  following   self-explanatory
letter:PROFESSOR H. H. HIGBIE,
Department of Electrical Engineering.
MY DEAR PROFESSOR HIGBIE:The Regents at their meeting November 2, failed to take
definite action with respect to the circulation of reports
of the test of lamps, although the matter was discussed at
some length. It was my impression from the discussion,
that they thought it unwise on the whole to make public use
of the tests made here for our own guidance or for the
guidance of the State institutions, since such use of these
tests might be, in the course of business, prejudicial to the
legitimate business interests of citizens of this State, the
competitive business interests not always being fair to one
another in their use of material which is scientifically and
technically correct.
Therefore it should be understood that until further
notice, results of tests of this sort should not be given
out, and these tests should not be furnished to the {State
Buyers' Association nor anybody else, except on assurance
that they will be regarded as confidential.
Sincerely yours,
SHIRLEY W. SAMITH

tion of Regent Sawyer, the Board approved this recommendation.
On motion of Regent Clements, the Board denied the
request for improved alternating current service for the
Electrical Engineering Laboratory (see page 300).
The Secretary presented a report for the Treasurer

I)CEM/IBER MEETING, 1915

should be transferred to the Buildings and Grounds Department, and that his responsibility hereafter should be

of to the Superintendent of the University Hospital.
Regent Sawyer stated that he had carefully considered
the statements of facts submitted to him by Dr. James G.
Cumming and the Secretary relative to the salary adjustment during Dr. Cumming's recent leave of absence. Regent Sawyer moved that it be the sense of the Board that

motion, prevailed.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, the Board requested the
Buildings and Grounds Committee to prepare and submit
plans and estimates for a storeroom at the University

the hospital pending the final adjustment of the matter
should be discontinued for the remainder of the fiscal year.
A request from  Dean Hoff that the Dental Building
might be used on Saturday afternoon for a special clinic
for Ann Arbor school children was referred, with power,

at the University of Michigan in memory of the late Mr.
Cho'lett C. Beach of Battle Creek. The amount of the
fund is $I,200.00.

Graduate School.
DEAR SIR:I am handing you herewith a letter from Mr. Roy D.
Chapin relative to a fellowship in Highway Engineering.
The offer was made some time in October and I think has
been acknowledged by the Regents but the conditions were
to be submitted to Mr. Chapin and agreed upon.
Last Saturday I had a conference with him and we
reached an oral agreement as follows:The fellowship is to be given as the R. D. 'Chapin Fellowship in Highway Engineering.
It is open to graduates in Civil Engineering of the
University or of the Agricultural College and it is the desire
of Mr. Chapin if possible to restrict it to citizens of,Michigan who intend to reside in Michigan.
The research work done by the holder of the fellowship is to be along the lines of the determination of the
best wearing surfaces for highway construction in the State,
and is to include the investigation either of strength of materials or methods of construction or effect of traffic on
different classes of the more permanent type of road construction.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1915


333


The results of all investigations' are to be published for
the benefit of the people of the State of Michigan, and
are to be published in such form that they may be available to the people interested in the subject.
As the offer was made it was a straight $5oo fellowship without provision for any money for expenses. Necessarily, any investigation of this sort is going to involve
a considerable amount of expense in the way of labor in
building sample pieces of roadway for testing, setting up
of equipment, etc., and Professor Hoad and myself felt that
to get the most effective work we should have an ample
allowance for expenses.  I therefore brought the matter
to Mr. Chapin's attention with the result that he has made
the offer as per the enclosed letter.  You understand that
we will probably have no difficulty in securing free 9f
cost to the University all the materials we need for testing.
I hope that by the beginning of the second semester
we may be able to recommend some one who is of the
right calibre to handle this very important work.
I am sending the matter to you in order that further
official correspondence regarding the final acceptance of the
gift shall be in accordance with the ideas of the Graduate
ABoard.
Yours very truly,
H. E. RIGGS
November 26, I915
PROF. H. E. RIGGS,
University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
iMY DEAR PROF. RIGGS:Confirming our conversation the other day, I will make
my fellowship for two years at $5o00.00 a year, and an allowance of $250.00 for expenses. I shall be glad to send a
check for $I,5oo to the Treasurer of the University when
you finally approve of the plans.
I should like to consult with whomever you grant the
fellowship to, and keep in touch from time to time as to
what progress he makes. Am so muclh interested in the subject that I might be of some help as to suggestions for
research. Don't you think that he ought to be a Michigan
citizen who intends living here in the State?
Very truly yours,
R. D. CHAPIN

﻿JULY MEETING, 2009

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
July 16, 2009
The regents convened at 2:15 p.m. in Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Ilitch, Richner, and White. Also
present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Chancellor Little, Vice President
May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President
Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regents Newman and Taylor and Vice President Lampe were absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She called attention to the fact
that the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers have been named among
the best in the nation by U.S. News & World Report, and that the University has been
named a "great place to work" by the Chronicle of Higher Education for the second
consecutive year. She also noted that President Obama had appointed a former faculty
member, Dr. Francis Collins, as director of the National Institutes of Health. She
concluded by recognizing the death of Gary Winisky, a construction worker, who had
died recently at the work site of the new C.S. Mott Children's and Women's Hospital.
Regents' Resolution in honor of Robert Kelch
President Coleman called on Regent Richner, chair of the Board of Regents.
Regent Richner invited Dr. Robert Kelch, former executive vice president for medical
affairs, to the podium, and read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan salute Robert P. Kelch
as he completes his service as executive vice president for medical
affairs on September 14, 2009.
When Dr. Kelch assumed this position in 2003 after having
served in top leadership roles at the University of Iowa, he was returning
home, to the institution where he had been trained and had built his
career as a clinician, researcher, and administrator. In appointing him
to the EVPMA position, President Mary Sue Coleman described the
leadership, depth of experience, and vision that Dr. Kelch would bring to
the University, and these were prescient words indeed for his
extraordinary accomplishments during six years at the helm of the
University of Michigan Health System.
Under his leadership, the UMHS experienced unprecedented
capital growth and expansion, including completion of the Rachel
Up John Building, home of the nation's first comprehensive depression
center, the  Biomedical Science   Research  Building, and  the
Cardiovascular Center. The health system also launched construction of






﻿July Meeting, 2009

the Kellogg Eye Center Expansion Project and the new Children's and
Women's Hospital, and purchased the former Pfizer property, with its
promise as a transformative milestone in the University's history.
Equally important are the changes in internal culture that Dr. Kelch
brought to the health system, where he fostered an atmosphere of
collaboration, teamwork, and innovation. These values, focusing on the
outcomes that can be achieved through collective intelligence, now
permeate every aspect of the health system, from patient care to research
to the design of new buildings, and serve as a lasting legacy of Dr.
Kelch's vision.
It is with the utmost respect, gratitude, and admiration that the
Regents acknowledge his incomparable contributions and name Robert
P. Kelch executive vice president emeritus for medical affairs.
A standing ovation followed. Dr. Kelch responded by thanking his wife and
acknowledging her support during their 46 years of marriage. He also thanked President
Coleman, the regents, and the executive officers for all of their support.
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report-Ann Arbor Campus
Professor Fred Askari, chair of the Committee on the Economic Status of the
Faculty, presented the CESF report for the Ann Arbor campus. He pointed out that the
University is recognized as being in the top tier for collaborative governance. He noted
that because 50% of the faculty will be eligible for retirement in a few years, salaries
and benefits need to continue to be competitive to help in recruitment and retention
efforts. He acknowledged the "fine job" being done in budgetary planning by the
regents and administration but also expressed the continuing concern of the faculty
about retiree health benefit obligations and other issues affecting retirees, current
faculty members, and recruitment and retention.
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report-Dearborn Campus
Professor Karen Strandholm presented this report. She cited a study comparing
faculty salaries on the Dearborn campus with those at peer institutions which found that
that over 90% of assistant, associate, and full professors at the UM-Dearborn are being
paid within 90% of the salaries at peer institutions, and more than 50% in each category
are being paid above the average.
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report-Flint Campus
Professor Aviva Dorfman expressed appreciation regarding efforts have been
made to make salaries on the Flint campus comparable with those at peer institutions.
She expressed the committee's concern about the decline in the number of tenure and
tenure-track core faculty that coincides with increases in the number of full- and part-
time lecturers and full-time professional and administrative positions, growth in student
enrollment and in academic programs. Recommendations include convening a campus
discussion to consider the implications to the mission and academic quality of the Flint
campus if the trends outlined in the report continue, and to continue the efforts to
improve salaries until they are comparable with those at peer institutions.






﻿July Meeting, 2009

Transportation and Parking Services Strategic Plan Update
Associate Vice President Hank Baier presented an update on transportation and
parking. He described the variety of choices the University offers for commuters,
including parking at core, peripheral, and off-site locations, free rides on AATA buses
and free parking at one of three Park & Ride lots, University buses, vanpools and
carpools, commuter express bus service, car-sharing through Zipcars, and guaranteed
"ride home" cab service which provides rides for commuters without a car on campus
in case of emergency.
Mr. Baier noted that ridership on UM buses has increased by 26% since 2004,
while service hours have increased by only 14%. During this time period, UM
ridership on AATA buses nearly doubled, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total
increase in ridership during that period on AATA buses. The subsidy provided by the
University to the AATA, plus federal dollars from UM bus ridership brought into the
regional system, covers nearly the full fare for every UM rider on the AATA bus
system. To further encourage alternative transportation, the University also subsidizes
van pools.
Mr. Baier reviewed plans surrounding current parking and transportation
projects. He reported that with the addition of 200 surface spaces to be added on Wall
Street in the near future, the planned Wall Street parking deck has been placed on hold.
At the same time, the University is holding discussions with Ann Arbor city officials on
the idea of developing a Fuller Road intermodal transportation station that would
provide some sort of transportation linkage, with parking, between the North Campus
area and medical campus. The recently acquired North Campus Research Complex
includes 2,800 parking spaces, and it is expected that this parking area, along with a
new Park and Ride lot at US-23 and Plymouth Road, can be used for remote parking for
health system employees.
Mr. Baier displayed a map indicating how proposed commuter rail systems
could be used by UM employees, and noted that if these systems are put in place, the
University would consider subsidizing the fares for employees who use them. An
additional subscription bus service route to Canton is under consideration.
In response to a question, Mr. Baier noted that the Zipcar service has grown
from 4 to 13 cars, making it a successful program. Executive Vice President Slottow
pointed out that the economic model of subsidizing commuter transportation, which
reduces that number of parking structure spaces needed on campus and contributes to
the University's sustainability efforts, is a "win-win" situation for the University.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White reported that
attendees at that morning's meeting had included Regents Ilitch and Maynard,
Executive Vice President Slottow, and for part of the meeting, Regent Darlow and
President Coleman. Agenda topics included a review of the Human Capital Report,
with Associate Vice President Laurita Thomas, Senior Business Analyst Tom Palmer,
and UMHS Chief Human Resources Officer Deb Childs. The committee also received

Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner
announced that he had appointed Regent Newman as chair of this committee and had
also reappointed Regent White as chair of the Finance, Audit and Investment
Committee. Regent Newman had attended the committee meeting but since she could
not attend the regents' meeting, she asked Vice President and Secretary Churchill, who
had been in attendance, to report on the meeting.
Vice President Churchill reported that the Personnel, Compensation and
Governance Committee had met that morning. It was chaired by Regent Newman, with
Regent Darlow and President Coleman in attendance for parts of the meeting. The
committee reviewed the president's travel and hosting expenses with Associate Vice
President Miranda, reviewed proposed housekeeping revisions to the Regents' Bylaws,
received an update from Provost Sullivan on dean and director searches, and reviewed
the faculty and staff recruitment and retention report for all three campuses, with
special focus on the diversity report, with Associate Vice President Thomas, Tom
Palmer, Deb Childs, and Provost Sullivan.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.

reported that for the 15th year in a row, the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health
Centers have been listed in the U.S. News and World Report's honor roll of the nation's
best hospitals, and is the only one in Michigan to be listed. She named some of the
programs that have been ranked among the top 20 in the country.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper introduced Laura Blake
Jones, associate vice president and dean of students. She reviewed all of the
improvements that have been made to campus residence halls through the Residence
Life Initiative (RLI) in recent years, and noted that the agenda includes a
recommendation for approval of the schematic design for the renovation of Couzens
Hall, the latest project to be funded through the RLI.

﻿SEPTEMBER MEETING, 2009

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
September 17, 2009
The regents convened at 3:05 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill,
Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Person,
Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice
President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent White left
the meeting at about 3:30 p.m.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She called attention to some of
the campus events that have marked the beginning of the new academic year, including
the dedication of the newly renovated Stockwell Hall, the inauguration of an academic
theme year focusing on the role of university museums, and the participation of Chief
Justice John Roberts in the celebration of the Law School's 150th anniversary. She
also commended faculty and staff on the University's historic achievement of $1 billion
in research expenditures.
Life Sciences Institute Update
President Coleman introduced Professor Alan Saltiel, director of the Life
Sciences Institute ("LSI"). She noted that in addition to serving as director of the LSI,
he is also carrying on an active research career focusing on diabetes, and had recently
discovered a gene in mice that has promising possibilities in the area of obesity.
Professor Saltiel announced that the LSI has achieved its goal of recruiting a
diverse array of faculty who are working across many complex areas of biology and
medicine.  It has a full complement of 29 faculty representing 14 academic
departments, along with a scientific staff of about 450 scientists and students. He noted
that faculty have won a number of awards, have published in major academic journals,
and have received over $150 million in research funding.
Professor Saltiel observed that the most notable characteristic of the LSI faculty
is their excitement about and commitment to working together, and this is the most
singular feature of the LSI. He gave an example how the active collaboration among a
number of researchers working in different labs from across the institute resulted in the
discovery of a new discovery that may have implications for the treatment of diabetes
and obesity. To bring its collaborative environment to the rest of the campus, the
institute has established a number of centers and partnerships on campus and with other
institutions. It is also working on spin-off technologies and on translating basic clinical
discoveries to clinical application.

23






﻿September Meeting, 2009

President Coleman remarked that the original vision for the Life Sciences
Institute has come to fruition, and it is exciting to see that it is functioning exactly as
had been envisioned when it was founded.
University/Community Engagement
President Coleman called on Vice President Wilbanks, who noted that the
interactions among the various University, city, county, and community entities and
individuals takes many forms, including formal interactions by staff from government
relations and business and finance. She introduced Jim Kosteva, director of community
relations.
Mr. Kosteva noted that the University has an extensive partnership with the city,
involving regular meetings with city staff to pursue cooperative ventures in a variety of
areas, including parking, transit, and transportation planning, and direct payments to the
city for utilities, construction fees, indirect payment of taxes through clinical and office
space rentals, and payments to the AATA to support free transportation for faculty,
staff, and students. This payment also benefits the city by providing leverage that
enables it to receive additional federal funds for regional transit.
In addition to making financial contributions, the University also is engaged in a
multitude of activities in support of business and economic development efforts, public
schools, and health care and community service organizations in Washtenaw County.
It contributes to regional transportation development efforts and to health and human
services agencies through its employees' contributions to the annual United Way
campaign. The University also provides innumerable cultural and athletic attractions
and events that contribute to the richness of the Ann Arbor community. Mr. Kosteva
concluded by listing some of the current discussions that are underway between the
University and city.
Annual Report on Development
Vice President May presented a summary of the year that ended June 30, 2009.
He noted that following the end of the Michigan Difference campaign that ended on
December 31, 2009, the receipts during the first half of 2010 were down 22% from the
previous year. Ongoing fundraising continues to do well, with almost $266 million
raised during the past year. Vice President May reported that a "post campaign plan"
that has been put into place, which focuses on excellent customer service, donor
stewardship, improving the highly effective development team, and finding new
sources of revenue. Vice President May described some of the efforts that have
occurred in each of these areas. He noted that a new donor database is being
implemented that will combine donor information from all university-wide resources;
this information had previously resided on separate databases and will immensely
enhance the ability to connect with donors.
Vice President May reported that regular large-gift fundraising activities are
continuing, but a newer reunion and reunion-giving program has been established. This
has created a new revenue stream. Another new revenue stream has been created in the
area of international fundraising.  The overall goal is to create a "culture of
philanthropy" at the University of Michigan.

﻿September Meeting, 2009

Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee.          Regent White reported that
attendees at that morning's meeting had included Regents Ilitch, Maynard, and Darlow,
along with Executive Vice President Slottow. For the first agenda item, the FY09
external audit results, participants included Associate Vice President Rowan Miranda,
Cheryl Soper, controller and director of financial operations, Dave Morlock, Health
System chief financial officer, Carol Senneff, executive director of University audits,
and   external  auditors   Rick   Stover, John     Mattie,  and   Chris   Hoffman,    of
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC).
Regent White announced that PWC has issued an unqualified opinion on the
University's 2009 financial statements, which means that the financial statements are
fairly presented and free of material misstatements. The second agenda item concerned
Sarbanes-Oxley workplan tasks and follow-up, which focuses on internal controls
process updates. Participants included Regents Ilitch and Maynard, President Coleman,
the same internal staff and external auditors who had participated in the first discussion,
and Brent Haase, internal controls compliance manager.
Personnel, Compensation      and  Governance Committee.        Regent Newman
reported that the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee had met that
morning.    Participants had included Regents Taylor, Darlow, and Deitch.           The
committee received an update from Provost Sullivan on dean and director searches, had
a discussion with Dean Ponce de Leon about the A. Alfred Taubman College of
Architecture and Urban Planning, and reviewed proposed bylaw changes that will be
brought to the board later this year.
Annual review of president. Regent Newman announced that the regents had
completed a review of the president over the last few months and gave the following
overview of her accomplishments in 2008-2009:
*   Successful completion of the $3.2 billion "Michigan Difference" campaign, raising more
private support at a public university than in the history of higher education.  This
included more than 190 new endowed professorships; 2,045 new endowed scholarships for
students; and 22 new buildings, such as the Ross School of Business, the Frankel Family
Wing of the U-M Museum of Art, the Computer Science and Engineering Building; and the
Walgreen Drama Center and Arthur Miller Theater.
*   Acquisition of the former Pfizer research site, now the North Campus Research Complex.
With 174 acres and 30 buildings, it is one of the largest physical expansions in U-M's 192-
year history, and will expand the university's research capacity - already among the
broadest in the nation - by 10 percent.
*   Strong management of the institution through a severe economic downturn. At a time when
other universities are laying off employees and cancelling construction projects, U-M is
moving forward. Because of a prudent investment strategy and conservative spending rule,
U-M's endowment is weathering the economic downturn better than most leading
universities. U-M has the highest possible credit ratings from Standard & Poor's (AAA)
and Moody's (Aaa).
* Achievement of more than $1 billion in research expenditures - a new U-M record.
Research spending rose 9.4 percent over the previous fiscal year, totaling $1.02 billion.
While the federal government continues to be the most significant source of support, the
University continues to achieve growing support from industry - a particularly strong
accomplishment given the economic downturn.

25






﻿September Meeting, 2009

*   Vocal and committed support for rebuilding the Michigan economy, including promoting a
stronger sense of innovation and entrepreneurism on campus; working to attract new
business to the region; and advancing the promising economic sectors of the future, such as
alternative energy and biosciences.
*   Strong ambassador for the University. President Coleman is strongly engaged at the local,
regional and national levels. This ranges from spending evenings making phone calls to
prospective freshmen, encouraging them to select U-M, to representing the University at
the first-ever National Summit, a gathering a national leaders to discuss and debate
America's economic future.  The Michigan Roundtable for Diversity and Inclusion
recognized her with its Humanitarian of the Year Award.
*   U-M continues to be a "hot" school. For the third consecutive year, prospective freshmen
applied for admission in record numbers; this year, nearly 30,000 students applied for
5,900 openings.
Regent Newman reported that despite all of her accomplishments, President
Coleman had requested that the board not consider raising her salary this year. Regent
Newman said the board had respected this wish, and that "we thank you for your
graciousness in allowing us to compliment you on everything you've done. We support
you, we're glad you're here, and thank you for all you've done."
President Coleman thanked the board for their support, and thanked her
executive officer colleagues for the parts they've played in the University's success
during her administration. "It's been a great team, it's been a great honor, and it's been
terrific to have the support from the board. It means a lot and it helps us do what we
need to do." President Coleman also pointed out that none of the deans or executive
officers had received salary increases for 2009-2010.
Public Comments
Regent Richner noted that one of the public comments speakers, Judge Michael
Warren, of the Oakland County Circuit Court, had requested that he and his colleague
be allowed to address the board at this time, rather than at the scheduled time at the end
of the meeting. There being no objections, the Regents heard comments from Hon.
Michael Warren and David Weissman, alumni, on the subject of Patriot Week.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.

huge team effort from across the University. He noted that $655 million of the funding
came from the federal government, an increase of 7% over the previous year, and
within that category, funding from the Department of Energy rose by 24% and funding

26

﻿September Meeting, 2009

Kenneth G. Lieberthal, Ph.D., Arthur F. Thumrnau Professor, professor of
political science, College of Literature, Science and the Arts, William Davidson
Professor of Business Administration, and professor of business administration,
Stephen M. Ross School of Business, retired from active faculty status on May 31,
2009.
Professor Lieberthal received his B.A. degree from Dartmouth College in 1965,
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University in 1968 and 1972,
respectively. From 1972-83 he was on the faculty of Swarthmore College. He joined
the University of Michigan faculty as a professor of political science in 1983 and was
appointed William Davidson Professor of Business Administration and professor of
business administration in 1995.
Professor Lieberthal's main research contributions have been in the area of
bureaucratic politics, Chinese politics, and U.S.-China relations. As part of an
extensive research project in the 1980s, Professor Lieberthal developed a system of
analysis for China's political system, the largest unified bureaucratic structure in the
world. This analysis contributed to a deeper and more nuanced understanding of
central-local relations, bureaucratic decision-making, and elite level policy choices.
Professor Lieberthal's research also drew attention to the fragmented nature of the
Chinese political system, a key explanatory factor for weak policy implementation of
the Chinese central state. His commitment to public service and his wide engagement
on U.S.-China relations have extended the impact of his research to U.S. policymaking
toward China. He has served as an advisor to the White House, the U.S. Department of
State, the United Nations Association, and other bodies.
Professor Lieberthal taught undergraduate and graduate courses in comparative
politics, with a special emphasis on the politics of China. He was a faculty associate
and director (1986-89) of the Center for Chinese Studies, and was a fellow and director
of the William Davidson Institute from 2001-09. His excellence as a teacher was
recognized by his appointment as an Arthur F. Thumrnau professor in 1995, and he
received the University's Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award in 2004.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Kenneth
G. Lieberthal Arthur F. Thumrnau Professor Emeritus, professor emeritus of political
science, William Davidson Professor Emeritus of Business Administration, and
professor emeritus of business administration.

research fellow in the Biophysics Research Division (BRD) in 1989, and was promoted
to assistant research scientist in 1992, and associate research scientist in 2005.
Dr. Mirkin's research focused primarily on two areas. The first, molecular
orbital calculations on peptides and proteins, was designed to provide more physically
rigorous predictions of the three-dimensional structures of these molecules from
analyses of their infrared and Raman spectra. Her other major focus involved quantum
mechanical calculations associated with a program to develop more physically accurate

63






﻿September Meeting, 2009

potential energy functions for the modeling of structure and dynamics in biological
systems. From 1996-99 she was co-principle investigator on the National Science
Foundation sponsored project, "Energy Functions for Spectroscopy and Dynamics of
Proteins." She has published in numerous leading scientific journals and her research
contributions have been vital to the success of BRD programs.
Dr. Mirkin was a lecturer in physics and biophysics and was an active member
of the University community. She served on the executive and program committees of
the BRD, was on the boards of the University of Michigan Alumni Association and the
Hispanic Alumni Council, and was a faculty advisor to the graduate student chapter of

Noemi G. Mirkin associate research scientist emerita.
Elizabeth Fay Sulzby, Ph.D., professor of education in the School of
Education, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2009.
Professor Sulzby received her B.A. degree from Birmingham-Southern College
in 1963, her M.Ed. degree from the College of William and Mary in 1969, and her
Ph.D. degree from the University of Virginia in 1977. From 1977-83, she was on the
faculty of Northwestern University. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as
an associate professor in 1983, and was promoted to professor in 1990.
A leading authority on child literacy development, Professor Sulzby's research
focused on the etiology, assessment, and applications of emergent literacy. She co-
authored Emergent Literacy: Writing and Reading (1986), which is credited with
establishing the research field of emergent literacy. Her work sought to understand the
dynamics of reading and writing behaviors and concepts that develop into conventional
reading and writing. A prolific author and editor, Professor Sulzby published and
reviewed numerous scholarly books, journal articles, and monographs.
An innovative instructor and dedicated mentor, Professor Sulzby taught
undergraduate and graduate courses that focused on child language and literacy
development, linguistics, and educational research methods. Professor Sulzby was
president of Literacy Development and Young Children, a special interest group of the
International Reading Association, from 1988-90. She was a member of the National
Academy of Sciences/National Research Council's Committee on the Prevention of
Reading Difficulties in Young Children from 1995-97, and is a fellow of the American

64






﻿September Meeting, 2009

at the Royal Technical College in Stockholm, Sweden, from 1954-56, and at Columbia
University from 1956-57. He joined the Schering Corporation as a chemist in 1957 and
became senior director of research in 1975. Professor Topliss came to Ann Arbor in
1979 as director of chemistry at Warner-Lambert/ Parke-Davis, and was promoted to
vice president of chemistry in 1983. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in
1983 as an adjunct professor of medicinal chemistry, and was promoted to professor in
1992.
Professor Topliss is a distinguished and internationally renowned scientist in
the field of medicinal chemistry. He is considered among the top scientists world-wide
in the area of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) of medicinal agents.
This theoretical field forms the basis of creating new organic compounds as potential
therapeutic agents and provides for a rational approach to drug design. His book on
this topic, originally co-authored with J.Y. Funkunaga in 1978, is considered to be a
classic in the field. He has published numerous research papers and is an inventor on
33 patents. Within the College of Pharmacy, Professor Topliss has been actively

Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted a memorial statement for
Elizabeth A. Young, M.D., professor of psychiatry and research professor.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Elizabeth A. Young, M.D., professor of psychiatry and research professor,
Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute, Medical School, and research
professor, Reproductive Sciences Program, who died on September 1, 2009 after a
yearlong battle with leukemia. She was 59 years old.
Dr. Young was raised in the Detroit and Chicago areas and received her
undergraduate education at the University of Dayton in Ohio. She earned her medical
degree from The Ohio State University in 1976, and completed her residency in
psychiatry at the same institution in 1979. She came to the University of Michigan
Medical School in July 1979 as a research fellow in the Department of Psychiatry
Clinical Studies Unit. In 1981 she joined the laboratories of Drs. Huda Akil and
Stanley Watson at the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute (MBNI) as a
postdoctoral fellow. She then received a physician scientist training grant and joined
the faculty of the MBNI and the psychiatry department, where she moved through the
ranks to the senior positions she occupied at the time of her death.
Dr. Young was an internationally renowned biological psychiatrist and
neuroendocrinologist, who conducted seminal research on stress biology and its role in
severe depression and other mood disorders. She also had many other scientific
interests, most prominent among them the role of gender differences in vulnerability to

65






﻿September Meeting, 2009

mood disorders. Her work has established the basis for many lines of enquiry into
human psychopathology.
Dr. Young was a loving wife and stepmother, a caring physician, a wonderful
collaborator and mentor, an ardent gardener, and a devoted friend. As we mourn her
loss, our condolences go to her husband, Dr. Peter Hinman, her step-daughter, Dr. Mira
Hinman, and her two step-granddaughters.
Degrees. There are no actions with respect to degrees this month.

﻿September Meeting, 2009

center is to be constructed. She noted that another, more comprehensive overview of
South Campus planning will be presented at a later date.
Ms. Gott introduced Don Dethlefs, CEO of Sink Combs Dethlefs Architects,
who presented the schematic design for the player development center. He noted that
the key component of the center is a double practice court that will be two stories high
and will fit below the concourse level in Crisler Arena to allow for possible future
additions to Crisler Arena. Mr. Dethlefs displayed diagrams of each floor of the facility
and displayed renderings of the exterior, noting that because it will be built into the hill
it will have a low profile. He noted that the roof has a flexible design so that it could

﻿OCTOBER MEETING, 2009

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
October 15, 2009
The regents convened at 3:30 p.m. in the Harding Mott University Center on the
campus of the University of Michigan-Flint. Present were President Coleman and
Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White. Also
present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Chancellor Little, Vice President
Lampe, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz,
Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and
Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She commented on the vibrancy
of the Flint campus and community, noting that enrollment is up 7% from a year ago
and that the campus has attracted a number of transfer students. President Coleman
noted that the World Stem Cell Summit is being held in Detroit in 2010, and that the
University Research Corridor (consisting of the University of Michigan, Wayne State
University, and Michigan State University) would play a major role in this event.
President Coleman also commented about the University's burgeoning technology
transfer activity and its importance to regional economic development. Lastly, she
commended Professor C.K. Prahalad on his being named the most influential
management thinker in the world in the "Thinkers 50," a biennial list of the world's
leading management gurus.
Chancellor's Report: University of Michigan-Flint
Chancellor Person reported on the transformation that is occurring in the city of
Flint, from "auto town" to "college town," and the role that the University of Michigan-
Flint and other area colleges are playing in this transformation. She displayed a video
that showcases some of the positive things that are happening in the city as it is
changing its identity to that of a lively college town.
Chancellor Person then introduced Interim Provost Vahid Lofti, who reported
on the Flint campus's expanded initiatives in the area of serving students who are
veterans. He reported that in March 2009, the campus launched a broad-based Student
Veterans Support Program, which provides a centralized source of information and
support for returning veterans in their transition from military life to that of a civilian
and student. He described some of the initiatives that the program has established,
noting that it has been successful in attracting students, with 142 "certified veteran
students" currently affiliated with the program. He recognized faculty, staff, and
student veterans who were present at the meeting, including Jeremy Glasstetter, a
veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, founding president of the Flint chapter of the
Student Veterans of America, and state director of this organization.

﻿October Meeting, 2009

H1N1 Flu Update
President Coleman introduced Dr. Robert Ernst, medical director of the
University Health Service, who presented an overview of H1N1 flu activity nationwide
and locally, and the University's response to and preparedness activities in anticipation
of the spread of the disease.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White reported that
attendees at that morning's meeting had included Regents Ilitch, Maynard, and Darlow,
President Coleman, and Executive Vice President Slottow. The bimonthly audit and
compliance program was reviewed with Carol Senneff, executive director of University
audits, and Vice President and General Counsel Suellyn Scarnecchia. The second
agenda item, "internal control certification," was reviewed with Associate Vice
President Rowan Miranda, who noted that progress with internal control certification is
on schedule. The committee also met with Erik Lundberg, chief investment officer, to
discuss the endowment spending rule and to review the FY 2009 Annual Report on
Investment Performance. Regent White made the following statement regarding the
FY 2009 investment performance:
"As set forth in the State of Michigan Constitution, the Board of Regents has "general
supervision" over the University. The board controls and directs all of the expenditures from
the University's funds. As part of that broad responsibility, the board is charged with the
fiduciary duty to take a long-term view in preserving and growing University endowment funds
over the life of the University. This responsibility falls to those who have served before us, those
currently serving on the board, and our successors.
As part of that broad responsibility, a decade ago, the Board of Regents made a
decision to change the way in which the University of Michigan managed the University's
endowment. FY 2009 marked the 10th anniversary of the board's decision to delegate
responsibility for managing the University's endowment and other investment pools to the new
Investment Office. Even though the banking crisis, in the short term, created a challenging
year, over the past ten years, the University's endowment has earned an annualized return of 9
percent. An annualized 9 percent return over the past 10 years is at the upper end of the top
quartile for all college and university endowments. This is in contrast to the S&P 500, which
lost on average 2.2 percent per year for the same period and where the average university
endowment returned 4.2 percent. If the UM endowment had performed at that level, it would be
$2 billion smaller than it is today. The 20-year compound growth rate for the endowment is
14%.
In FY 2009, as of June 30th, the University of Michigan's endowment was valued at $6
billion, down from an all-time high of $7.6 billion in FY 2008. The equity-oriented portion of
the long-term portfolio returned a negative 23 percent last year. Although these numbers show
a significant decline in one year, the endowment is, however, invested for the long-term and the
overall performance of the portfolio is consistent with our diversified strategy to provide an
ample amount of return to support for operations, while protecting the corpus and fostering the
endowment's growth.
The University of Michigan's endowment spending rule, providing quarterly
distributions equal to a 5.0 percent annual rate of the trailing 28-quarter average market value,
is a policy that has helped insulate University operations from volatility always present in the
market. The endowment spending rule has allowed the University to provide $244 million to
support operations this past year, a slight increase from 2008, while at the same time continue
to increase actual dollar distributions to units and still grow the corpus. In fact, we expect to be
able to increase distributions next year as well. To put these numbers in perspective, over the
past five years, the University's long-term investment strategy and spending policies have

82






﻿October Meeting, 2009

generated $1 billion in endowment distributions to support University operations.
As in prior years, a detailed analysis of the endowment performance by asset class is
included in this year's Annual Report of Investments."
On behalf of the Board of Regents, Regent White recognized Erik Lundberg,
chief investment officer, and his team, "for their excellent and outstanding work," and
noted that Mr. Lundberg would be available to answer questions after the meeting.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Newman
reported that the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee had met that
morning with herself and Regents Taylor and Deitch in attendance. Provost Sullivan
presented the annual report on dean and director reviews and searches, and Chancellor
Person gave a report on faculty recruitment and retention on the Flint campus. She
noted that a search firm had been retained to search for candidates for the position of
provost, and that enrollment on the Flint campus had increased by 500 students.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.

﻿October Meeting, 2009

Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted a memorial statement for
Bruce D. Parfitt, Ph.D., associate professor of biology at the University of Michigan-
Flint.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Bruce D. Parfitt, Ph.D., associate professor of biology, Department of
Biology, College of Arts and Sciences, University of Michigan-Flint, who died on
September 3, 2009 at age 56.
A native of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Professor Parfitt received his B.S. degree from
the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in 1977, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from
Arizona State University in 1980 and 1991, respectively. From 1991-95 he was
assistant scientific editor and then scientific and managing editor of Flora of North
America at the Missouri Botanical Garden. He joined the University of Michigan-Flint
faculty as assistant professor in 1995, and was promoted to associate professor in 2001.
Within the Department of Biology, Professor Parfitt served as chief botanist,
bringing a wealth of experience to this position. His skills as a writer and editor and his
classical training in plant taxonomy significantly strengthened the undergraduate and
graduate biology programs. Among his students he was, as one undergrad put it, "a
slacker's nightmare." While he kept high standards, edited papers relentlessly, and
challenged assumptions, he was generous in the time he devoted to students' success in the
classroom, the lab, the field, and in their personal lives. He was chair of the Department of
Biology from 2004-07, and served on several committees within the department and the
college. Professor Parfitt was a skillful editor and a solid scholar, whose publications
included over 35 book chapters/sections, more than 25 refereed journal articles, and many
other published writings. He was perhaps best known for having co-authored the definitive
work on cacti-volume four of the prestigious compendium, Flora of North America-a
work that reflects his discovery of new species and encyclopedic knowledge. During the
final stage of his illness, he completed drafts of manuscripts about five plant families
for the "Vascular Plants of Arizona" project.
Professor Parfitt was a valued colleague whose untimely passing will leave a
void on the Flint campus. As we mourn the loss of this esteemed scholar and teacher,
our condolences go to his mother, Myrtle Parfitt, his brothers, Arden and Craig, and
their families.
Degrees. President Coleman submitted recommendations for honorary degrees
to be awarded to the following individuals: Grace Lee Boggs, civil rights leader,
Doctor of Humane Letters; Jeff Daniels, actor, Doctor of Fine Arts; Helen Thomas,
journalist, Doctor of Humane Letters, and Edward O. Wilson, biologist, naturalist, and
sociobiologist, Doctor of Science. It was noted that these degrees are to be awarded at
the December 2009 commencement.
Approval of Consent Agenda. On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by
Regent Maynard, the regents unanimously approved the consent agenda.
University of Michigan Financial Statements for the Year Ended June 30, 2009
Executive Vice President Slottow submitted for approval the consolidated
financial statements for fiscal year 2009 and the separate audited financial statements
for the hospitals and health centers, intercollegiate athletics, and the Veritas Insurance

On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Ilitch, the regents
unanimously approved the University of Michigan financial statements for the year
ended June 30, 2009.
Identity Theft Prevention Program
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Maynard, the regents
unanimously approved the Identity Theft Prevention Program, as described in the
regents communication.

On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Darlow, the Regents
unanimously approved the Administrative Services Building Substation Replacement
Project as described, and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding
construction contracts, providing that bids are within the approved budget.
Central Power Plant Water Treatment System Improvements
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved the Central Power Plant Water Treatment System Improvements
Project as described, and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding
construction contracts providing that bids are within the approved budget.
Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman announced that the agenda includes 3 conflict of interest
items, each of which requires 6 votes for approval. On a motion by Regent White,
seconded by Regent Ilitch, the regents unanimously approved the following
agreements:
Lease Amendment Agreement with 1250 North Main LLC
The Regents approved a lease amendment agreement with 1250 N. Main LLC,
for property located at 125 North Main Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Because Peter T.
Allen, a University of Michigan employee, is also a member of 1250 North Main LLC,
this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the lease amendment agreement are the Regents of the University of
Michigan and 1250 N. Main LLC.
2. The service to be provided is the lease amendment of 14,000 square feet in a building
at 1250 North Main Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan, for twenty-one months, retroactive
from September 1, 2009 through May 31, 2011, at a monthly rate of $20,416.67.
Tenant will be responsible for gas, electric and water and sewer usage plus janitorial
service. Tenant will be responsible for a portion of the operating expenses of the
building.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Peter T. Allen, a University of
Michigan employee, is a member of 1250 N. Main LLC.

﻿October Meeting, 2009

Authorization to make payments to the Institute for Social and Environmental Research
The regents authorized the Institute for Social Research ("ISR") to make
payments to the Institute for Social and Environmental Research ("ISER") to conduct
research in the Chitwan Valley of Nepal. Because Dr. Dirgha Jibi Ghimire, a
University of Michigan employee, is also director and a member of the board of
directors of ISER, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.   The following    information   is provided   in  compliance with    statutory
requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan, ISR, and
ISER.
2. The payments to ISER are for conducting research in the Chitwan Valley of Nepal
for three separate projects for a total of $19,841: $8,856 to study migration during
armed conflict, $6,715 to gather information on village elders, and $4,270 to study
social exclusion and marginalization.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Dr. Dirgha Jibi Ghimire, a University
of Michigan employee, is a director and a board member of ISER.
Patent Option Agreement between the University of Michigan and JV Biolabs, LLC
The regents approved a patent option agreement with JV Biolabs, LLC
("Company") to enable the Company to obtain an option to license the following
technology from the University: UM File No. 4059, "The Use of Two Botanicals with
Complementary Activities for Improvement of Skin." Because Kent Johnson and
James Varani, University of Michigan employees, are also partial owners of the
Company, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.
The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and JV Biolabs, LLC.
2. Option terms include giving the Company an option to obtain an exclusive license
with the right to grant sublicenses. The Company will pay an option fee and ongoing
patent expenses during the term of the option agreement, and would pay a royalty on
sales and reimbursement of patent costs if the option is exercised and a license is
executed. The University will retain ownership of the licensed technology and may
continue to further develop it and use it internally. No use of University services or
facilities, nor any assignment of University employees, is obligated or contemplated
under the agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees and indemnification apply,
and the contract may be amended by consent of the parties. University procedures for
approval of these changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest review
will be done as appropriate.
3. The pecuniary interest of Kent Johnson and James Varani arise from their ownership
interest in JV Biolabs, LLC.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (U1VHHC) Bylaws of the UVHHC
Executive Board
Executive Vice President Pescovitz requested approval of revisions of the
Bylaws of the UMHHC Executive Board ("UMHHCEB"). She pointed out that the
proposed   revisions   have   already  been   reviewed   by   the  Regents    Personnel,
Compensation and Governance Committee, and that their approval would require a
revision to the Bylaws of the Board of Regents. If the UMHHCEB bylaws are
approved, the proposed revisions to the Regents' Bylaws will be posted next week for
public comment and submitted for approval at a subsequent meeting.

101






﻿October Meeting, 2009

﻿NOVEMBER MEETING, 2009

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
November 19, 2009
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, Taylor,
and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Chancellor
Little, Vice President Lampe, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice
President Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow,
Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Darlow participated via
telephone.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She announced that Brian
Coppola, professor of chemistry, had just been named 2009 national professor of the
year by the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education and the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching for his commitment to undergraduate
education. This marks the second time in four years that this award had been given to a
University of Michigan professor, as Buzz Alexander, professor of English language
and literature, had received the award in 2005.
President Coleman also noted that the University of Michigan is one of the top
schools in the nation in the number of faculty and students receiving Fulbright awards
for 2010, and reported on a recent visit to the Ann Arbor office of Google, where a
large percentage of the staff are Michigan alumni.
Regent Richner complimented President Coleman on being named by Time
magazine as one of the top ten college presidents in the country. A round of applause
followed.
Annual Report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA)
Professor Michael Thouless, chair of SACUA, presented a report on the current
state of shared governance at the University of Michigan. He reported that shared
governance is relatively healthy, but some work needs to be done to embed it fully into
the structure of the institution, so that it will be less vulnerable to the individual whims
of faculty and administrators. He stressed the importance of ensuring that the unique
perspective of faculty members is included in any decision-making process that affects
the teaching environment, because so much of the institution's reputation rests on the
quality of its faculty. In light of the increasing centralization being brought about by
budgetary pressures, he urged that mechanisms be developed to ensure that "real, two-
way communication between faculty and administration occurs before, not after,
decisions are made." Professor Thouless pointed out that since many decisions are
made below the level of the vice presidents, faculty need to be better integrated into
shared governance at these levels of decision-making.

﻿November Meeting, 2009

Presentation: Space Utilization Initiative
Provost Sullivan reported that the Space Utilization Initiative is a five-year
effort, launched 2V2 years ago, aimed at improving the utilization of space and facilities
in the core teaching and research missions that are funded by the General Fund. The
motivation was to use current space as effectively as possible, so as to limit facilities
expansion and the resulting cost increases that could lead to tuition increases. She
pointed out that the lessons learned through the Space Utilization Initiative will help in
developing best practices for utilizing the North Campus Research Complex, even
though it is not part of the initiative. Provost Sullivan introduced Frances Mueller,
project director for the Space Utilization Initiative.
Ms. Mueller noted that the goals of the initiative are to lead the University in
better utilizing its space, thereby limiting the need for future expansion, while
containing operating costs and leveraging the highest quality spaces for the academic
and research mission. The initiative does not include space operated by the health
system, athletics, or parking and transportation. She pointed out that the initiative
represents a change in the long-standing campus culture in which space is considered to
be a "free good" and that once space has been allocated to a unit, it is theirs indefinitely
and there is a general reluctance to share it. However, as a result of the initiative, all
space is now considered to be an institutional resource that must be used for the highest
priority needs and managed effectively to the benefit of the institution as a whole.
Ms. Mueller described the structured procedures which must be followed when
units request major capital expansion projects. This enables the administration to
review all requests collectively and determine which ones are the highest priority for
the institution. Classroom utilization and research space productivity reports have also
been implemented, allowing units to identify and reassign space for higher priority
needs, and campus guidelines for office and research space allocations have been
established. The classroom utilization report, illustrating time utilization by day and by
hour across campus has set a baseline for campus utilization going forward, with a
target goal of 70% for time utilization and 65% for seat utilization to set a standard for
efficiency.
As a result of the initiative, the University is taking aggressive steps to improve
utilization by requiring that all general purpose classrooms be shared campus-wide, that
under-utilized classrooms be repurposed for higher priority academic or research needs,
and requiring that the provost approve requests for any new classroom space. In
addition to sharing classrooms across campus, computer server rooms will also be
shared, freeing up space used for unit computer servers for other needs. Facilities for
housing animal research subjects (vivaria) are also being studied for sharing and
consolidation.
Ms. Mueller gave examples of space that has been converted to serve other
needs, reducing lease costs and avoiding millions of dollars in new construction costs
and annual operating costs that would have been incurred by new construction. In
summary, the space utilization initiative has resulted in a significant reduction in
building growth, a reduction in energy consumption, and a significant shift in campus
culture regarding the utilization of space.

﻿November Meeting, 2009

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for 10
retiring faculty members.
James W. Albers, M.D., professor of neurology, professor of neurology in
physical medicine and rehabilitation, professor of neurology in psychiatry in the
Medical School, and professor of environmental health sciences in the School of Public
Health, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2009.
Dr. Albers received five degrees from the University of Michigan: B.S.E. (1965),
M.S. in bioengineering (1966), M.S. in psychology (1968), Ph.D. (1970), and M.D. (1972).
Following an internship and residency at the Mayo Clinic from 1972-76, he served 3 years
as a faculty member at the Medical College of Wisconsin. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an associate professor of neurology in the Department of Neurology
and the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in 1979, and was promoted to
professor in both departments in 1983. He received additional appointments in the School
of Public Health in 1991 and the Department of Psychiatry in 1997, and was assistant dean
for instructional faculty in the Medical School from 2004-07.
A specialist in neuromuscular disease, Dr. Albers established the Neuromuscular
Program and directed the Electromyography Laboratory. Through his research, he made
seminal contributions to our understanding of the natural history of diabetic neuropathy
and the toxic effects of chemicals on the peripheral nervous system. He published more
than 140 peer-reviewed articles and 39 book chapters, and co-authored the definitive two-
volume text, Neurobehavioral Toxicology. Dr. Albers is also a superb clinician with a
sophisticated understanding of complex neuromuscular disease and a mastery of
electrodiagnostic techniques. The coupling of this clinical acumen with a gentle bedside
manner has made him the person to go to in this field. He trained more than 50
neuromuscular fellows, many of whom have gone on to serve as academic leaders in the
field. In 2000, Dr. Albers received the Adolph G. Kammer Merit in Authorship Award
from the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine for his
exemplary service and outstanding contributions to the field of occupational medicine,
and in 2002, he received the Distinguished Physician Award from the American
Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator, clinician, and investigator
for his dedicated service by naming James W. Albers professor emeritus of neurology,
professor emeritus of neurology in physical medicine and rehabilitation, professor
emeritus of neurology in psychiatry, and professor emeritus of environmental health
sciences.
Judith C. Avery, A.M.L.S., senior associate librarian in the University Library,
retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2009.
Ms. Avery received her B.A. degree from Michigan State University in 1966
and her A.M.L.S. and A.M. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1968 and 1976,
respectively. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant librarian in
1968, and was promoted to associate librarian in 1972 and senior associate librarian in
1974.
Ms. Avery served as acting co-head of the Undergraduate Library from 1985-
86, and then joined the Graduate Library reference department as head of the Library
Science Library and education and psychology subject specialist. In 1987, Ms. Avery

121






﻿November Meeting, 2009

was appointed head of reference services for the Graduate Library. During this time,
she was responsible for reference, the microform reading room, and the Information
and Library Studies Library. In 1993, she was named the English language and
literature, American culture, Canadian studies, and British and U.S. history subject
specialist. Ms. Avery took the lead on several key digital library initiatives in the
humanities including the Making of America. Other contributions included service on
two University institutional review boards.
A dedicated and effective teacher and colleague, Ms. Avery focused on helping
faculty and students utilize the library's resources for their teaching and research. She
excelled in the user-centered areas of reference, instruction, and outreach, and her long
experience, knowledge, and subject expertise served as the basis for building rich
collections. Scholars for many years to come will benefit from her forethought,
leadership, and deep understanding of the collection.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated service by
naming Judith C. Avery senior associate librarian emerita.
Kathryn L. Beam, A.M.L.S., librarian in the University Library, retired from
active faculty status on August 31, 2009.
Ms. Beam received her B.M. degree from the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in
1965, her B.A. degree from Oberlin College in 1967, her M.A. degree from Case
Western Reserve University in 1976, and her A.M.L.S. degree from the University of
Michigan in 1983. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as an associate
librarian in 1983, and was promoted to senior associate librarian in 1998 and librarian
in 2006.
As a rare manuscripts expert and curator of the humanities collections, Ms.
Beam worked to promote the University Library's Special Collections to thousands of
students, faculty, alumni and visitors. Her outreach efforts focused on integrating the
use of rare books and manuscripts into undergraduate education and scholarship, and
she shared her knowledge of the history of books with students in a variety of
disciplines. She also authored numerous interpretive exhibits designed to highlight the
collections for a broad audience, including a popular exhibit on the history of the Bible
that attracted thousands of visitors over the years.
With Professor Traianos Gagos, Ms. Beam co-authored The Evolution of the
English Bible: From Papyri to King James, a CD-ROM that utilized the special
collections to explore biblical text and images over the course of sixteen centuries. In
1999, this work became the first electronic publication to receive a University of
Michigan Press Book Award. Her professional activities included serving on the
editorial board of RBM: A Journal of Rare Books, Manuscripts, and Cultural Heritage,
and chairing a taskforce on the core competencies for professionals in the special
collections field. Within the University, Ms. Beam served as chair of the Librarian's
Forum and member of the Senate Assembly and Academic Affairs Advisory
Committee. Her deep knowledge of rare books and manuscripts collections and her
enthusiasm for books and their history are greatly appreciated and will be deeply
missed.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated service by
naming Kathryn L. Beam librarian emerita.

﻿November Meeting, 2009

Kathleen Ford, Ph.D., research scientist in the Department of Epidemiology in
the School of Public Health, retired from active faculty status on August 24, 2009.
Dr. Ford received her B.A. degree from Boston College in 1971, and her M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees from Brown University in 1973 and 1975, respectively. From 1978-
85, she was an assistant professor at The Johns Hopkins University. She joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an associate research scientist in 1985 and was
promoted to research scientist in 1993.
Dr. Ford has conducted a number of studies with NIH funding and served on
numerous AIDS-related NIH study sections.  Many of her studies focused on
prevention of HIV infection within the U.S. population as a whole and in the African
American and Latino communities in Detroit. Over a ten-year period, she conducted a
series of behavioral and intervention studies of groups at high risk for HIV infection in
Indonesia. She also did research on the impact of the AIDS epidemic on children in
Africa and developed a methodologically-oriented course on AIDS research for
epidemiology graduate students. Recently, she was a visiting professor at Mahidol
University in Thailand, where she taught an international group of Ph.D. students and
conducted research related to the HIV risk of migrant workers, aging and sexuality, and
internal migration and household welfare. From 2005-09, Dr. Ford was a visiting
professor at the Institute for Population and Social Research in Bangkok, Thailand.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Kathleen
Ford research scientist emerita.
Julie C. Grygotis, A.M.L.S., senior associate librarian in the University
Library, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2009.
Ms. Grygotis received her B.A. degree from Michigan State University in 1970
and her A.M.L.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1972. She joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant librarian in 1972, and was promoted to
associate librarian in 1975 and senior associate librarian in 1985.
As head of the Retrospective Conversion Unit in the Monograph Cataloging
Division, Ms. Grygotis led the in-house conversion of bibliographic card catalog
records into machine readable form, which became the basis of the library's online
catalog. In 1987, Ms. Grygotis became the head of the Automation Unit, which was
responsible for high speed cataloging of monographs in all Western languages for the
University Library system. Later, she managed the Pinyin Conversion Project, which
converted catalog records from the Wade Giles to the Pinyin system as recognized by
the People's Republic of China, and then became head of the Authorities and Database
Management Unit.
The University Library was one of the first and largest libraries to complete a
comprehensive retrospective conversion of its card catalog records into machine
readable form, and through her leadership of this and subsequent efforts, Ms. Grygotis
has had a significant impact on the development of the library's modem online catalog
services. She served on the Mirlyn Implementation Team, which launched the library's
first online catalog in 1988, and was also a member and chair of the Cataloging Policy
Council.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated service by
naming Julie C. Grygotis senior associate librarian emerita.

123






﻿November Meeting, 2009

Mei-Ying Lin, M.S.L.S., senior associate librarian in the University Library,
retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2009.
Ms. Lin received her B.A. degree from the National Chengchi University in
Taipei, Taiwan, in 1964 and her M.S.L.S. degree from Wayne State University in 1969.
She joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1969 as a Chinese cataloging librarian
in the Asia Library, and was promoted to associate librarian in 1992 and senior
associate librarian in 2003.
During her forty years' tenure at Michigan, Ms. Lin has made significant
contributions to the Asia Library as it has developed into one of the country's largest
resource centers for East Asian studies. With her expertise in cataloging and her solid
command of Chinese language and culture, Ms. Lin processed thousands of Chinese
materials in various formats each year. As Chinese cataloging supervisor and then
supervisor of technical services in the Asia Library during the 1990s, Ms. Lin played a
crucial and leading role in the library's transition from the original card catalog to the
online OPAC, and in the adoption of many new information processing technologies
and systems. She also managed other important large-scale projects, including the
RECON record clean-up project, the creation of analytical records for several massive
Chinese sets, and the Wade Giles-Pinyin conversion. From 2003-08, she served as
interim co-director of the Asia Library, overseeing the administrative responsibilities
and daily operations. Ms. Lin is also an effective and thoughtful trainer, who designed
and implemented extensive training programs that enhanced the professional
knowledge and skills of numerous members of the Asia Library's staff.  Her
contributions to the University Library will be greatly missed.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated service by
naming Mei-Ying Lin senior associate librarian emerita.
Lynn F. Marko, A.M.L.S., librarian in the University Library, retired from
active faculty status on August 31, 2009.
Ms. Marko received her A.B. and A.M.L.S. degrees from the University of
Michigan in 1969 and 1970, respectively. She joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an assistant librarian in 1971, and was promoted to associate librarian in 1973
and librarian in 1974.
Ms. Marko's most notable contributions to the library came from her service as
head of the Monograph Cataloging and Bibliographic Searching Division. Under her
direction, cataloging productivity increased, processes were adapted to new workflows
and technologies, and major retrospective conversion projects were undertaken and
typically completed ahead of schedule. Ms. Marko led her staff by example and rallied
them around new challenges. Leaders in the library commended Ms. Marko on her
ability to not just improve productivity but to help staff adapt to rapidly changing
circumstances while maintaining a high level of morale during a period of tumultuous
change. She was a true force in making great and innovative things happen.
Ms. Marko has been a pioneer and committed collaborator in shaping the
University Library and its adaptation to a Web-enabled world. From developing library
productivity metrics to cataloging electronic resources to developing new methods for
describing content, Ms. Marko played a leading role. She contributed to several high-
profile national efforts, including NEH-funded research led by Marianne Gaunt and
cataloging of Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research data sets.

124






﻿November Meeting, 2009

Recognizing the need for Web-aware metadata standards, Ms. Marko was instrumental
in the development of Dublin Core from its inception.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming Lynn F. Marko
librarian emerita.
Patricia W. Martin, A.M.L.S., senior associate librarian in the University
Library, retired from active faculty status on July 31, 2009.
Ms. Martin received her A.B. degree from the University of Michigan in 1967,
her M.A. degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1969, and her A.M.L.S. degree
from the University of Michigan in 1975. She joined the University of Michigan faculty
as an assistant librarian in the Taubman Medical Library in 1993, and was promoted to
associate librarian in 1994 and senior associate librarian in 1999.
Throughout her tenure at Michigan, Ms. Martin has been dedicated to providing
excellent service and access to library resources. She served as head of Education and
End-User Search Services from 1994-98, head of End-User Electronic Systems from
1998-2006, and liaison and InfoPoint Services librarian from 2006-09, and was a leader
in establishing a Web presence for Taubman Library. She was responsible for the
implementation of UM-Medsearch, a major resource for physicians, residents, faculty,
and students across campus. Ms. Martin's background and concern for the quality of
students' learning experience gave her opportunities to oversee the development of a
growing instructional program in the health sciences. Recently, Ms. Martin was
instrumental in securing funding for and managing the Michigan Health Literacy
Awareness Training Program to raise awareness of health literacy issues and provide
techniques and resources to improve patient care.
Ms. Martin served in a number of leadership roles within her profession,
including president of the Michigan Health Sciences Libraries Association, chair of the
Medical Library Association Membership Committee, and representative-at-large to the
Midwest chapter of the Medical Library Association. Within the University, she served
on several University Library committees and on the Librarian's Forum Board. Ms.
Martin's commitment to quality and excellence in service will be greatly missed.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated service by
naming Patricia W. Martin senior associate librarian emerita.
Judith J. Wilhelme, A.M.L.S., senior associate librarian in the University
Library, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2009.
Ms. Wilhelme received her A.B. and A.M.L.S. degrees from the University of
Michigan in 1968 and 1969, respectively. She joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an assistant librarian in 1969, and was promoted to associate librarian in
1973, and senior associate librarian in 1979.
In 1994, Ms. Wilhelme assumed responsibility for electronic resource ordering
and licensing, becoming the library's first electronic resources librarian. In this role,
she has been a vital link to publishers and vendors, providing leadership for major
collection decisions. Since 2004, when she was appointed head of the newly created
Electronic Acquisitions and Licensing Unit, the library has depended on her electronic
resource expertise to navigate the complex world of licenses, contracts, and electronic
resource management systems. During her forty years with the University Library, Ms.
Wilhelme served on numerous committees, participated in several long-term projects,

125






﻿November Meeting, 2009

and helped implement the acquisitions functions of multiple library management
systems. Throughout her career, she has worked closely with selectors and collection
coordinators. As a supervisor, she was committed to organizational diversity and
supporting the professional development of her staff.
Ms. Wilhelme's commitment to librarianship extended beyond the University.
She was active in numerous professional organizations, including the Michigan Library
Association and the North American Serials Interest Group (NASIG). Ms. Wilhelme
served as vice-chair of the NASIG planning committee for the conference held on the
University of Michigan campus in June 1997.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming Judith J.
Wilhelme senior associate librarian emerita.
Grace A. York, A.M.L.S., librarian in the University Library, retired from
active faculty status on August 31, 2009.
Ms. York received her B.A. degree from Wayne State University in 1968 and
her A.M.L.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1969. She joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant librarian in 1969, and was promoted to
associate librarian in 1973, senior associate librarian in 1975, and librarian in 1999.
Ms. York was a pioneer in providing broad access to government documents in
electronic format, long before the ubiquity of the World Wide Web. She envisioned the
potential of the Internet in its earliest stages, beginning in 1986 when she served as a
public contact for an experiment to bring the U.S. Commerce Department's Economic
Bulletin Board online. She began distributing free census data on the Internet in 1991,
and was the first known person to provide U.S. congressional email addresses in a
public directory (1994). She created and maintained the website, Government
Resources on the Web, which received 2.2 million hits in its first year and reached 30-
50 million hits per year as time progressed. The library's government documents
website has won numerous awards and accolades over the years.
Ms. York's work has had national and international impact. She created model
remote library services in support of University programs in Washington, was a
reviewer for the public services section of the U.S. Government Printing Office's
Federal Depository Manual, and was the first person to speak out about a proposal to
start charging the public for government access on the Web. Ms. York's honors
include the American Library Association's "Documents to the People Award" (1998),
the Michigan Government Documents Roundtable's Lifetime Achievement Award
(2003), the ALA GODORT James Bennett Childs Award for distinguished
contributions to documents librarianship (2006), and the University of Michigan's
University Librarian Achievement Award (2007).
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated
service by naming Grace A. York librarian emerita.

﻿November Meeting, 2009

Varsity Drive Building and Alexander G. Ruthven Museums Building Museum of Zoology
Collection Relocation and Renovations
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that the purpose of this project is to
protect the Museum of Zoology's "wet" specimen collection by moving most of it to
space on Varsity Drive designed specifically for this purpose. The teaching collection,
consisting of about 7% of the specimens, will remain in the Ruthven Museums
Building in a renovated safe storage area designed for this purpose. He introduced
Jeffrey Hausman, senior vice president of Smithgroup, Inc. to present the schematic
design.
Mr. Hausman displayed a site plan for the Varsity Drive Building and noted that
an additional loop road would be created for fire service and as a means of egress. He
described the schematic design for the renovation, which include state-of-the-art
storage for priceless specimens, research space, and office space. He also described the
renovation for Ruthven Museum that will house the working collection and provide
teaching space. On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent White, the
regents unanimously approved the schematic design for the Varsity Drive Building and
Alexander G. Ruthven Museums Building Museum of Zoology Collection Relocation
and Renovations Project as presented at the meeting.
Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman announced that the agenda includes 4 conflict of interest
items, each of which requires 6 votes for approval. Regent Richner requested recusal
from voting on the agreement with TruEnamel. Regent Newman questioned why some
agreements involving faculty or staff members receiving relatively small payments for
services are subject to regental approval and requested additional information. On a
motion by Regent Richner, seconded by Regent Deitch, the regents unanimously
approved the following three agreements:
Authorization for Payment to Jazz Pie Music
The Regents approved a payment by the Law School's Office of Development
and Alumni Relations ("LSODAR") to Jazz Pie Music ("JPM") for a musical
performance provided at a LSODAR event. Because Roderick McDonald, Christopher
Smith, and James Dapogny, University of Michigan employees, are also members of
JPM, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the amendment agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan
and the Law School's Office of Development and Alumni Relations and Jazz Pie
Music.
2. The service provided was musical entertainment during a tailgate event on September
26, 2009 for one and a half hours. The total payment for the service was $900.

﻿DECEMBER MEETING, 2009

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
December 17, 2009
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Richner, and White.
Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Chancellor Little, Vice
President Lampe, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President
Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost
Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Taylor was absent; Regent Newman
participated via telephone.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She commented on the
upcoming commencement, called attention to a licensing agreement between a
University of Michigan spin-off and a major pharmaceutical company for University of
Michigan patented technology, and noted that 10 University faculty members have
been named Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She
also called attention to recent gifts from the Ted and Jane Von Voigtlander Foundation
for the new Women's Hospital, and from alumnus and former football star Charles
Woodson for the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. Lastly, she highlighted her comments
at a recent commencement address she had given at Grand Valley State University
("GVSU").
Regent Richner announced that GVSU's recognition of President Coleman,
coupled with the University's growing number of relationships and partnerships with
institutions, friends, and alumni on the west side of the state, have led to the decision to
hold the April 2010 regents' meeting in Grand Rapids.
President Coleman then called on Janet Weiss, dean of the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies.
Continuous Enrollment Policy for Students in Ph.D. Programs
Dean Weiss reported that the continuous enrollment policy, expected to become
effective in fall 2010, will require that Ph.D. students stay registered for each fall and
winter semester from matriculation until degree completion unless they are on an
approved leave of absence. The purpose of the policy is to help Ph.D. students achieve
their goal of completing their degrees, and to ensure that faculty and staff who support
doctoral students are paying continuous attention to their progress and support. She
noted that currently, only two-thirds of Ph.D. students complete their degrees. One
motivation for the plan is to improve this ratio, thereby helping not only current
students, but making the University of Michigan a more attractive institution for Ph.D.
students in general.
Dean Weiss noted that the policy provides tuition support to enable all Ph.D.
students to have continuous access to University services and resources without

135






﻿December Meeting, 2009

interruption. The policy has a leave of absence provision which allows students to take
time away from graduate study when necessary for family or health reasons.  The
policy is also fiscally responsible and revenue neutral; it does not create new financial
burdens for the University and does not increase tuition.
Dean Weiss reported that the design and implementation planning for the policy
involved key stakeholders, including faculty, students, staff, and other deans and
university administrators. Procedures have been put in place to address concerns
expressed by students during the development of the policy. Pending approval by the
regents of a lower tuition rate for Rackham Ph.D. candidates at the June 2010 meeting,
the policy will take effect in Fall 2010.
During the discussion that followed, Dean Weiss described faculty mentoring
initiatives and explained how the leave of absence policy will work. Provost Sullivan
noted that she is very confident in the soundness of the financial projections for this
policy, but should projections fall short, the provost's office would provide a financial
backstop.
Entrepreneurial Activities at the University of Michigan
Thomas Kinnear, Eugene Applebaum Professor of Entrepreneurial Studies and
executive director of the Samuel Zell and Robert H. Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial
Studies, reported on entrepreneurial activities at the Stephen H. Ross School of
Business, and Thomas Zurbuchen, associate dean for entrepreneurial programs and
professor of space science and aerospace engineering in the College of Engineering,
reported on the "MPowered" entrepreneurship program within the College of
Engineering. Both professors stressed the importance of developing the entrepreneurial
mindset and providing a broad-based entrepreneurial education, and both gave
examples of the real impact the programs have had on students in terms of winning
competitions, summer internships, and scholarships, and providing venture capital. The
two colleges offer many cross-disciplinary courses and foster cross-disciplinary
collaboration among students from across campus. It was also noted that through
community engagement, a key component of the entrepreneurial programs, local
businesses often partner with student entrepreneurs in an effort to see them succeed,
and the professors pointed out how the regional economy benefits from entrepreneurial
activities at the University. They noted that the burgeoning sense of support and
interest throughout the University in recent years has created a noticeable sense of
excitement.
The regents expressed enthusiasm and support for the entrepreneurial efforts
described in the presentation and expressed the hope that these efforts would result in
students remaining in the area to continue these activities after they graduate.
2009 Annual Environmental Sustainability Update
Terry Alexander, executive director of the Office of Campus Sustainability,
reported that President Coleman had recently established  an environmental
sustainability initiative that provides an opportunity for students, faculty, and staff to
become involved in solving world sustainability issues. He then updated the regents on
the status of the University's six-point environmental and energy initiative. Point One,
an annual environmental report, is available in paper and electronic format. It

136






﻿December Meeting, 2009

highlights progress made during the past year, and describes educational programs and
student initiatives in this area. The report illustrates the success of the campus's efforts
at reducing per capita energy consumption, green house gas emissions, and water use in
the face of increased population and increased gross square footage of building space.
There has been little progress in Point Two, renewable energy. In the area of
alternative transportation, Point Three, there has been a great deal of progress, as has
also been the case with respect to green purchasing and recycling, Point Four. In the
area of new construction and renovation projects (Point Five), he said that the goal is to
exceed the 2007 ASHRAE energy efficiency rating by 30%, and that the new,
improved LEED standards (version 3.0), are currently being evaluated to determine
whether to adopt them as a campus standard. Point Six is development of the "Planet
Blue" program. He noted that there has been a reduction in energy use in the six pilot
buildings involved in this project, and plans call for a total of 90 buildings to be brought
into the program over a three year period.
Mr. Alexander also described the Climate Savers Initiative, which focuses on
energy reduction in the area of server systems and other networking technologies.

﻿December Meeting, 2009

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for 4
retiring faculty members.
David W. Cohen, Ph.D., professor of history and professor of anthropology in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 2009.
Professor Cohen received his B.A. degree from the University of Wisconsin in
1965 and his Ph.D. degree from the University of London in 1970. From 1968-93 he
was a faculty member first at The Johns Hopkins University (1968-89) and then at
Northwestern University (1989-93). He joined the University of Michigan faculty as
professor of history and professor of anthropology in 1993.
Professor Cohen is an exceptional scholar who applies anthropological theory to
interpreting historical events in Africa. He was a pioneer in the development of the
interdisciplinary field of anthro-history and has a reputation among African historians
as being one of the most creative scholars of Uganda and Western Kenya. He is the
author or co-author of nine books and a wide range of articles. Professor Cohen was
the founding director of the International Institute (1993-99), and held additional
appointments as professor of social science in the Residential College (1997-2004),
associate chair of the history department (2002-04), and director of the doctoral
program in anthropology and history (2004-07). From 2004-09, he held the title of
Lemuel A. Johnson Collegiate Professor of African History and Anthropology.
An innovative teacher, Professor Cohen taught undergraduate and graduate
courses in African history, historical anthropology, cultural anthropology, ethnology,
and comparative methods in historical inquiry. He supervised or co-supervised 28
doctoral dissertations and was a mentor for graduate students in history, anthropology,
and the joint program in anthropology and history. In 2003 he received the John
D'Arms Award for Distinguished Graduate Mentoring in the Humanities.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
David W. Cohen professor emeritus of history and professor emeritus of anthropology.
Harry J. D'Souza, Ph.D., professor of mathematics, in the College of Arts and
Sciences, University of Michigan-Flint, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 2009.
Professor D'Souza received his B.Sc. degree from St. Xavier's College, Bombay,
India, in 1976, his M.Sc. degree from the University of Bombay, India, in 1978, and his
M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Notre Dame in 1980 and 1983,
respectively. He joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty as an assistant professor
in 1983, and was promoted to associate professor in 1989 and professor in 1997.
Professor D'Souza is an active researcher who has focused on algebraic geometry
and number theory.   He has published in prestigious journals on a variety of
mathematical topics and has made numerous presentations at national and international
seminars. Professor D' Souza has leveraged his membership and participation in the UM-
Ann Arbor Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory Seminars and the UM-Flint
Mathematics Department Research Seminars to build productive relationships between
mathematicians and across both campuses.

149






﻿December Meeting, 2009

A dedicated and energetic mathematics teacher, Professor D'Souza has focused
his efforts on instructional innovation and superior student achievement. He has
supervised over a dozen honors theses and individual projects and has been also active in
working to improve precollege students' preparation and awareness of the mathematical
core of science and engineering.  Professor D'Souza has been active in faculty
governance, has served on numerous departmental and university committees, and has
been an influential member of the Greater Flint Educational Consortium. His honors
include the UM-Flint Faculty Award for Scholarly or Creative Achievement (1992) and
the Distinguished Faculty Award from the Michigan Association of Governing Boards
(1993).
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and scholar by naming Harry
J. D'Souza professor emeritus of mathematics.
Barbara A. Therrien, Ph.D., associate professor of nursing in the School of
Nursing, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2009.
Professor Therrien received her B.S.N. degree from Syracuse University in
1971, her M.N. degree from the University of Washington in 1973, and her Ph.D.
degree from the University of Michigan in 1982. She joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor of nursing in 1983, and was promoted to
associate professor in 1990.
Professor Therrien's research focused on neuroscience and neurobehavior
nursing and training. She investigated disorientation and models for nursing therapy,
the effects of gender on disorientation behavior, and the physiological effects of the
Valsalva maneuver. A prolific researcher, she served as co-principal investigator on
numerous National Institutes of Health sponsored projects and published in the leading
nursing journals. She developed her course curricula utilizing the latest scientific
developments in genetics and neurophysiology.  Professor Therrien was deeply
committed to mentorship and doctoral education. She served as chair and member of
numerous dissertation committees, and many of her former students have achieved
successful careers in academics, research, and health care.
Professor Therrien co-founded and served as the first president of the American
Association of Neurosurgical Nurses. Within the School of Nursing, she was director
of the Center for Enhancement and Restoration of Cognitive Function from 1996-2008.
Under her leadership, the center established innovative educational, clinical, and
research initiatives targeting the understanding and management of cognitive function
and health. Her honors include the Teacher of the Year Award from the School of
Nursing (1991), induction into the American Academy of Nursing (1991), and the
Honor a Researcher Award from the Midwest Nursing Research Society (1996).
Andrew K. Vine, M.D., C.M., professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences,
in the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on October 2, 2009.
Dr. Vine received his B.Sc. and M.D., C.M. degrees from McGill University in
1968 and 1972, respectively. He completed an ocular pathology fellowship at McGill
University (1974-75), his ophthalmology residency at the Royal Victoria Hospital,
McGill University (1975-78), and a retinal diseases fellowship at the University of
California, San Francisco (1979). He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an

150






﻿December Meeting, 2009

assistant professor of ophthalmology in 1980, and was promoted to associate professor
in 1986 and professor in 1994.
Dr. Vine has consistently displayed fine clinical judgment, an interest in high
quality research, and a commitment to educating his trainees and peers. As a
researcher, he has performed pioneering work in fluorophotometry as it applies to
retinal conditions. In 1989, following six months in Paris studying thrombosis and
fibrinolysis, he co-authored the paper, "The Role of Abnormalities in the Anticoagulant
System and Fibrinolytic System in Retinal Vascular Occlusions," which was published
in the Survey of Ophthalmology (1993). His long list of publications is an indication of
the breadth of his knowledge about the diseases of the human retina.
Dr. Vine has engaged in numerous regional, national, and international activities
as a teacher, clinician, and researcher. He has served as an associate examiner for the
American Board of Ophthalmology and guest speaker at the prestigious International
Society of Fluorescein Angiography, in Baden-Baden, Germany. He is a member of
the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the Association for Research and Vision in
Ophthalmology, the Michigan Ophthalmological Society, and the International Society
of Ophthalmic Ultrasound. Dr. Vine received the Honor Award (1989) and the Senior
Achievement Award (2002) from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and
continues to be listed in The Best Doctors in America and America's Top Doctors for
Cancer.
The Regents salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Andrew K.

Authorization to name the Women's Hospital in honor of the late Ted and Jane Von
Voigtlander
Executive Vice President Pescovitz acknowledged the individuals who worked
with the Von Voigtlander family on their gift of $15 million from the Ted and Jane Von
Voigtlander Foundation, including Dr. Tim Johnson, chair of the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynecology.
Regent Newman stated that "this is a true honor for me today to move the
naming of the new women's hospital in honor of the late Ted and Jane Von Voitlander.
Almost 14 years ago, I spent a few days at the current Women's Hospital under the
watchful eye of Dr. Tim Johnson, and I have a 13-year-old to prove it. Tim is currently
chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Arthur F. Thurnau Professor,
Bates Professor of Disorders of Women and Children, and professor of obstetrics and
gynecology in the Medical School, professor of women's studies in the College of
LS&A, and research professor, Center for Human Growth and Development, and I
recall 14 years ago Dr. Johnson talking about improvements and things he wanted to do
in women's health. I am just thrilled that he is there in the room today and that we are
naming the Women's Hospital for the Von Voitlander family, because I know not only
how much this means to him and everybody else who is associated with the hospital,
but how much this gift means to women's health under the watchful eye of Dr.
Johnson." She went on to thank the Von Voitlander family, congratulate Dr. Johnson
and others, and said it was her privilege to move that the regents formally designate the
Women's Hospital at the University of Michigan as the Von Voigtlander Women's
Hospital. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

nine agreements:
Agreement between the University of Michigan and McCreadie Group, Inc.
The Regents approved an agreement between the UMHS Department of
Pharmacy Services and McCreadie Group, Inc. ("McCreadie") for annual software
support and maintenance. Because Scott R. McCreadie, a University of Michigan
employee, is also director of McCreadie, this agreement falls under the State of

compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and UMHS
Department of Pharmacy Services and McCreadie Group, Inc.
2. The agreement is to provide software support for WebIDS for 5 years through 2014,
not to exceed a total of $77,000. The first year of software support is $14,500.

Incorporated
The regents approved an option agreement with Fusion Coolant Systems
Incorporated ("Company") allowing the Company to option the following technologies
from the University: UM File No. 3024, "Metal Working Lubricant Formulations

Michigan employee, is also an owner of the Company, this agreement falls under the
State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Fusion
Coolant Systems Incorporated.
2. Terms include giving the Company an exclusive option to the technology. The

retain ownership of the optioned technology and may continue to further develop it
and use it internally. No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment
of University employees, is obligated or contemplated under the agreement.
Standard disclaimers of warrantees and indemnification apply, and the contract may
be amended by consent of the parties. University procedures for approval of these
changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest review will be done as
appropriate.
3. The pecuniary interests of Dr. Skerlos arise from his ownership interest in Fusion
Coolant Systems Incorporated. For this specific file, Dr. Skerlos is an inventor and
will be considered for any share of revenue received by the University.
License Agreement between the University of Michigan and ChemXLerate LLC
The   regents   approved   a   license  agreement    with  ChemXLerate      LLC
("Company") to enable the Company to license the following technology from the
University: UM File No. 2134 and 2134c 1, "Methods for the Generation of Crystalline
Polymorphs." Because Adam Matzger and Antek Wong-Foy, University of Michigan

of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
ChemXLerate LLC.
2. Agreement terms include granting the Company a non-exclusive license without the
right to grant sublicenses to the added technology. The Company will pay a royalty
on sales. The University will retain ownership of the licensed technology and may
continue to further develop it and use it internally. No use of University services or
facilities, nor any assignment of University employees, is obligated or contemplated
under the agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees and indemnification apply,
and the contract may be amended by consent of the parties. University procedures for
approval of these changes will be followed and additional review by the OVPR
Conflict of Interest Committee will be done as appropriate.
3. The pecuniary interests of Drs. Matzger and Wong-Foy arise from their ownership
interest in ChemXLerate LLC.

Technologies, Inc.
The regents approved an amendment to an option agreement with NeuroNexus
Technologies, Inc. ("Company") to add new technology to its existing option

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to determine: (i) the specific amount of the cost of each
component of the Project to be financed from the proceeds of the Bonds; (ii) the portion, if any, of the
Notes to be refinanced using the proceeds of the Bonds; and (iii) the portions, if any, of the Outstanding
General Revenue Bonds, Senior Lien Indebtedness and Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds to be
refunded using the proceeds of the Bonds, based on whether such refinancing would produce interest
costs savings, more favorable debt service schedules, more flexible documentation or a more favorable
security structure for such outstanding indebtedness, and to cause to be called for redemption such of the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, Senior Lien Indebtedness and Outstanding Hospital Revenue
Bonds as is appropriate and consistent with the foregoing objectives. Subject to the Issuer's policies
regarding approvals of capital projects, any Authorized Officer may subsequently approve additional
components of the Project and specify that such additional components shall be financed in whole or in
part from the proceeds of the Bonds, upon which occurrence such components shall thereupon become
components of the Project hereunder.
2. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Bonds in one or more series
to be designated GENERAL REVENUE BONDS, with appropriate series designations, if any, in the
aggregate original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but not to exceed the
principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of  THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION
DOLLARS ($380,000,000), plus the amount, if any, required to refund all or any portion of the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, Senior Lien Indebtedness, Notes and Outstanding Hospital
Revenue Bonds and costs related to the refunding. The Bonds shall be dated as of the date or dates
established by an Authorized Officer, and shall be issued for the purpose of providing funds which,
together with other available funds, will be used to pay all or a portion of the costs of the Project, all or a
portion of the costs of refunding all or a portion of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, the Senior
Lien Indebtedness, the Notes and the Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds and the costs related to the

160






﻿December Meeting, 2009-Appendix

issuance of the Bonds and the refunding, including capitalized interest, if any, for such period as an
Authorized Officer may determine appropriate, and bond insurance premiums, if appropriate. The Bonds
shall be serial Bonds or term Bonds, which may be subject to redemption requirements, or both, as shall
be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first maturity shall be no earlier than April 1, 2010 and
the last maturity shall be no later than December 31, 2044. The Bonds may bear no interest or may bear
interest at stated fixed rates for the respective maturities thereof as shall be established by an Authorized
Officer, but the weighted average yield (computed using the stated coupons and the stated original
offering price) for the Bonds shall not exceed 7.0% per annum for tax-exempt Bonds or 11.0% per annum
for taxable Bonds, and the Bonds may be issued in whole or in part as capital appreciation bonds, which
for their term or any part thereof bear no interest but appreciate in principal amount over time at
compounded rates (not in excess of 7.0% per annum for tax-exempt Bonds or 11.0% per annum for
taxable Bonds) to be determined by an Authorized Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds may
bear interest at a variable rate of interest for all or a portion of their term, and the variable rate of interest
shall not exceed the lesser of the maximum rate permitted by law or the maximum rate, if any, to be
specified in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds may be subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to
maturity at the times and prices and in the manner as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but
no redemption premium shall exceed 3% of the principal amount being redeemed unless the redemption
price is based on a "make whole" formula, in which case no redemption premium shall exceed 40% of the
principal amount being redeemed. Interest on the Bonds shall be payable at such times as shall be
specified by an Authorized Officer. The Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form in denominations,
shall be payable as to principal and interest in the manner, shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and
shall be executed and authenticated, all as shall be provided in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds shall be
sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement or through a competitive sale or
bidding process pursuant to a Notice of Sale for a price to be established by an Authorized Officer (but
the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of original issue discount, shall not exceed 1.5% of the principal
amount thereof) plus accrued interest, if any, from the dated date of the Bonds to the date of delivery
thereof.
All or any portion of the Bonds may, subject to the parameters set forth above, be issued as Build
America Bonds or under any other structure established or enhanced by the provisions of ARRA, and in
connection therewith, each of Authorized Officers is authorized to make, for and on behalf of and as the
act of the Issuer, any and all designations or elections (revocable or irrevocable), to execute and deliver
any agreements, certificates or other instruments to or with the federal government or any agency thereof
or the State of Michigan or any agency thereof, and to take any other actions necessary for the Bonds, the
holders of the Bonds and the Issuer to receive any benefits, funds or federal subsidies available under
ARRA.
In relation to the debt service on all or any portion of the Bonds, or in relation to debt service on all or
any portion of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds or the Senior Lien Indebtedness, any of the
Authorized Officers may, at any time, on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into an interest rate
swap, cap, forward starting swap, option, swaption, rate lock or similar agreement or agreements
(collectively, the "Swap Agreement") with a counter-party or counter-parties to be selected by the
Authorized Officer. Such Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the Issuer and the
counter-party related to interest on all or a portion of the Bonds, the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds
or the Senior Lien Indebtedness, at indexed or market established rates. If the Swap Agreement is entered
at approximately the same time as the issuance of the Bonds, the expected effective interest rates on the
Bonds, taking into account the effect of the Swap Agreement, shall be within the limitations set forth
herein. Any Swap Agreement in the form of an option, swaption or forward starting swap may, if the
Bonds to which such agreement relates are not ultimately issued, be required to be terminated, with a
possibility of a resulting termination payment due by the University.
Any or all of the Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the option of the holder thereof or
to mandatory tender. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any Bonds subject to tender options may be
made payable from General Revenues, from available cash reserves of the University, subject to such
limitations as may be specified in the Trust Indenture, or from, directly or as support for the cash
reserves, a letter of credit, line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity device, or
one or more of the same, or any combination thereof (collectively, the "Liquidity Device"), all as shall be
determined by an Authorized Officer. The Liquidity Device, or any part thereof, may also be used to

161






﻿December Meeting, 2009-Appendix

provide liquidity for any other indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer, including the Notes, the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, any variable rate Senior Lien Indebtedness and any variable rate
Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds. Any reimbursement obligation for draws under the Liquidity
Device shall be a limited and not a general obligation of the Issuer, payable from, and may be secured by
a pledge of, General Revenues. Any portion of the Liquidity Device which provides liquidity for any
Senior Lien Indebtedness or Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds may, but shall not be required to, be
additionally or alternatively payable from, and may be secured by a lien on, any revenue stream securing
the obligations for which the liquidity is provided. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and
deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any agreements or instruments necessary to obtain, maintain,
renew or replace, and provide for repayments under, any Liquidity Device deemed by such officer to be
required for the purposes of this Resolution.
Any Bonds authorized and issued hereunder may, at any time, upon direction of an Authorized Officer,
be subsequently converted to another mode or structure authorized hereby, either through procedures
established in the Trust Indenture pertaining thereto, or through the issuance hereunder of refunding
bonds to refund and replace the outstanding Bonds to be converted. Any such refunding bonds issued
hereunder shall be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Resolution. Any
Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any documents or
instruments, including but not limited to, any amendments to the Trust Indenture, necessary or convenient
for the purpose of accomplishing the conversion as described in this paragraph.
3. The Bonds, and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement, if any, and the Liquidity
Device, if any (except as specifically provided otherwise in Section 2 hereof or below in this Section 3),
shall be limited and not general obligations of the Issuer payable from and secured by a lien on the
General Revenues (as shall be defined in the Trust Indenture in a manner generally consistent with the
definition thereof contained in the Trust Agreements pursuant to which the Outstanding General Revenue
Bonds were issued), subject only to the senior liens on portions of General Revenues securing the
respective series of Senior Lien Indebtedness (until each respective series of such Senior Lien
Indebtedness is paid or defeased in accordance with its terms). The lien on General Revenues securing
the Bonds shall be on a parity basis with the lien securing the Notes and the Outstanding General
Revenue Bonds. The Bonds and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement, if any, and the
Liquidity Device, if any, may also be payable from and secured by a lien on moneys, securities or other
investments from time to time on deposit in certain funds created pursuant to the Trust Indenture or
agreements entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount of or interest or premium on the Bonds,
or for the payment of any amounts owing under the Swap Agreement, if any, or the Liquidity Device, if
any, or any claim based thereon against the State of Michigan, or any officer or agent thereof or of the
Issuer or the University, as individuals, either directly or indirectly, nor, except as specifically provided in
the Trust Indenture or the instruments entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or the
Liquidity Device, if any, against the Issuer, nor shall the Bonds and interest with respect thereto, or any
obligations of the Issuer in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or Liquidity Device, if any
(except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 2 hereof), become a lien on or be secured by any
property, real, personal or mixed of the State of Michigan or the Issuer, other than the General Revenues
and the moneys from time to time on deposit in all or part of the funds established by the Trust Indenture
or the agreements entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or Liquidity Device, if
any.
Any pledge of General Revenues, and funds specified in the Trust Indenture or agreements entered into in
connection with the Swap Agreement, if any, or Liquidity Device, if any, shall be valid and binding from
the date of the issuance and delivery of the Bonds or such agreements, and all moneys or properties
subject thereto which are thereafter received shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without
physical delivery or further act. The lien of said pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties
(other than the holders of any outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations secured by a senior or parity
lien on any portion General Revenues) having a claim in tort, contract or otherwise against the Issuer,
irrespective of whether such parties have notice of the lien.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any obligations of the Issuer under the Swap
Agreement or any agreement with respect to the Liquidity Device may, if determined appropriate by an

﻿JANUARY MEETING, 2010

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
January 21, 2010
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive
Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President
Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She began her remarks by
noting that many students, faculty, and staff are involved in activities surrounding the
Haitian earthquake relief and recovery effort.
President Coleman congratulated Provost Terry Sullivan on having been
appointed president of the University of Virginia, and noted that the agenda includes
the proposed appointment of Regent Emeritus David Brandon as the Donald R.
Shepherd Director of Intercollegiate Athletics. She also commented on the campus
memorial service for President Emeritus Robben Fleming that had been held the
previous day.
Public Comments (agenda-related topic)
The Regents heard comments from James D'Amour, alumnus, representing the
Sierra Club of Huron Valley, on the proposed Fuller Road intermodal transportation
station.
Annual Report on Research
Vice President Forrest announced that in FY2009, total research expenditures at
the University of Michigan had exceeded $1 billion, and that the University had
received additional funding of approximately $220 million in federal stimulus grants.
This, combined with the University's investment in and establishment of the North
Campus Research Complex (NCRC), and the campus culture that embraces innovation
and entrepreneurship, provides a "truly unusual opportunity for the University of
Michigan to be a leader among universities world-wide."
Vice President Forrest displayed charts summarizing the annual growth of
University of Michigan research expenditures. In a year when the gross domestic
product of the United States dropped by over 3 percent, the University's research
expenditures grew by 9.4 percent, he noted. Industry-funded research, in the form of
both direct grants and subcontracts, also grew by about 6 percent, to $65 million.
During FY2009, a year in which financing was very hard to obtain, the University
disclosed a record-breaking 350 inventions, and 8 start-up companies were launched
based on University of Michigan technology. In addition, $82 million in venture
capital was invested in previously-established UM spin-offs.

167






﻿January Meeting, 2010

Vice President Forrest pointed out that with over $1 billion in expenditures,
research represents the third largest enterprise at the University, behind the health
system and education, and ranked third nationally among the ten largest research
universities. He concluded by commenting on the transformational opportunity
presented by the NCRC. It will allow the University to reinvent how research is used to
solve the largest problems facing humankind, creating a new research paradigm
involving partnerships among academia, industry, and government, nationally and
internationally. He recognized the efforts of the Division of Research Development
and Administration and Associate Vice President Marvin Parnes for their work in
assisting faculty in their research efforts.

1959 and was appointed assistant professor of electrical engineering in 1963. He was
promoted to associate professor in 1967 and professor in 1971, and was appointed
professor of atmospheric and oceanic science in 1973.
A pioneer in atmospheric and planetary science, Professor Nagy researched the

a co-investigator and interdisciplinary scientist on NASA's 1978 Pioneer Mission to
Venus, was an interdisciplinary scientist on NASA's 1981 Dynamics Explorer mission,
and has been co-investigator of numerous plasma and neutral gas experiments on
NASA and international missions. Most recently, he participated in the POLAR
spacecraft orbiting Earth, the Nazomi mission to Mars and the operational Cassini
mission to Saturn.
Professor Nagy served as associate vice president for research from 1987-90
and was interim director of the Space Physics Research Laboratory from 1989-91. He
has served on or chaired 50 scientific committees, convened 10 scientific symposiums,
and was president of the Space Physics and Aeronomy Section of the American
Geophysical Union. He is a member of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science and the International Academy of Astronautics, among other organizations,
and is a fellow of the American Geophysical Union. Within the University, he received
the Stephen S. Attwood Excellence in Engineering Award (1998) and the Distinguished
Faculty Achievement Award (2003).
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Andrew
F. Nagy professor emeritus of atmospheric and oceanic science and professor emeritus

The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Katherine Terrell, Ph.D., professor of business economics, corporate
strategy and international business in the Stephen M. Ross School of Business and
professor of public policy in the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. Professor
Terrell died on December 29, 2009 at the age of 59.
Professor Terrell received her B.A. degree from Mary Baldwin College in 1971,
her M.A. degree from George Washington University in 1973, and her Ph.D. degree

200






﻿January Meeting, 2010

from Cornell University in 1984. She joined the University of Michigan business
school faculty as an associate professor in 1996 and was promoted to professor in 2000.
She was appointed associate professor of public policy in 1998 and was promoted to
professor in 2001. She was also an active faculty affiliate of the Center for Latin
American and Caribbean Studies and the Center for Russian and East European
Studies.
Professor Terrell was an expert on the impact of government policies and the
effect of globalization on wages, employment, income inequality, and firm performance
in emerging market economies. Her research and teaching focused on countries in
Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America, where she grew up. In addition to her
research, Professor Terrell consulted with many international organizations, including
the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Within the Ross School,
Professor Terrell worked closely with doctoral students and coordinated the business
economics and international business Ph.D. program. At the Ford School, she created
the International Economic Development Program, which has given hundreds of public
policy students the opportunity to travel abroad and connect with real-world policy
issues in developing countries.
As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our heartfelt
condolences to her husband, Professor Jan Svejnar, her son Daniel, and her daughter
Laura.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of President Emeritus Robben Wright Fleming on January 11, 2010, at the
age of 93.
Robben Fleming was the University's ninth president, serving as president and
professor of law from 1968 to 1978. With a background in labor law and expertise in
dispute mediation, he had the ideal background and temperament to lead the University
during this tumultuous period. With his friendly, forthright, open-minded approach,
augmented by twinkling blue eyes, a disarming sense of humor, and a sincere desire to
resolve conflicts in a manner satisfactory to all parties, he artfully diffused numerous
potentially dangerous situations that arose during his presidency. President Fleming
also will be remembered for having committed the University to set new and higher
goals in its efforts to improve equal educational opportunity and access.
After stepping down from the presidency in 1978 to become president of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, he returned to the University of Michigan in 1982
as professor of law, retiring in 1985 as professor emeritus and president emeritus.
Upon the resignation of President Shapiro in 1988, President Fleming graciously agreed
to return once more, this time as interim president. During this period, he served not as
a mere caretaker, but a leader, guiding the University through a trying year in terms of
financial planning and in bringing closure to some difficult and long-standing social
issues.
As the regents stated when they named the Administration Building in honor of
Robben Fleming and his beloved wife and life partner Sally, "Robben W. Fleming led
the University of Michigan for 11 years, through good times and bad, with caring and
skill, sensitivity and humanity.... Most of all, he brought to the University of Michigan
a sense of values made concrete in the acts and choices of every day. Quietly,

201






﻿January Meeting, 2010

modestly, yet masterfully he articulated in his presidency the great goals of that process
of education to which we are dedicated."
We mourn the loss of this beloved member of the University of Michigan
family, and send our condolences to his children, Nancy Reckord, James Fleming, and
Betsy DiMaggio, and his five grandchildren.

Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the University has negotiated a
memorandum of understanding with the City of Ann Arbor for a project to be located

University will manage the construction project. Regent Darlow noted that the site in
question appears on the map to be a parking lot, but that the public comments speaker
had claimed it is city parkland. Associate Vice President Hank Baier noted that the
property had been leased from the city for at least two decades for use as a parking lot,
and while the University is not aware of any restrictions on the use of this property, its
status would be thoroughly investigated before the project is undertaken.
On a motion by Regent Darlow, seconded by Regent Richner, the regents
unanimously approved proceeding with the design of the Fuller Road Station Project
and authorized commissioning Walker Parking Consultants for its design. It was noted

with Disabilities Act (ADA). In response to a question from Regent Darlow for further
details about compliance with the ADA, Associate Vice President Hank Baier stated
that as the designs are developed, they will be shared with community members
concerned with these issues as well as with consultants, architects, and legal experts.
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the regents unanimously

﻿February Meeting, 2010

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for 2
retiring faculty members.
George L. Kenyon, Ph.D., professor of pharmaceutical chemistry in the
College of Pharmacy, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2009.
Professor Kenyon received his B.S. degree from Bucknell University in 1961
and his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University in 1963 and 1965,
respectively.  He held an NIH  postdoctoral fellowship in biochemistry at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1965-66, and was a faculty member at the
University of California, Berkeley (1966-72), and then at the University of California,
San Francisco (1972-98), where he began his career as assistant professor and
culminated it as dean of the School of Pharmacy. Professor Kenyon joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1998 as dean of the College of Pharmacy, professor
of pharmaceutical chemistry, and the Tom D. Rowe Collegiate Professor of Pharmacy.
An internationally renowned bioorganic chemist, Professor Kenyon is best
known for his synthesis of a variety of reagents and substrate analogues used to study
the mechanism of action of creatine kinase, mandelate racemase, and benzolylformate
decarboxylase. His work has led to an understanding of how enzymes have evolved by
sharing common chemical steps. He has also contributed to structural-based drug
design of anti-HIV agents and antiparasitic agents, such as for the treatment of malaria.
Professor Kenyon is well known for being the first to apply the use of simple
alkanethiol groups for the temporary blocking of sulfhydryl groups of enzymes,
including a widely used reagent that has become known as "Kenyon's Reagent." The
enzymes Professor Kenyon studied are among the best mechanistically understood of
all enzymes in their respective classes. His important discoveries have led to several
patents and numerous publications, and his distinguished work is widely used by other
biochemical scientists.
Professor Kenyon is not only highly regarded as a scientist, but is also an
outstanding educator and active contributor to his profession. His numerous honors
include election as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science (1990), and as president of the International Union of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology (2003).
The Regents now salute this distinguished scientist and educator for his
dedicated service by naming George L. Kenyon professor emeritus of pharmaceutical
chemistry and dean emeritus, College of Pharmacy.
Benjamin Lev, Ph.D., professor of decision science in the College of Business,
University of Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active faculty status on December 31,
2009.
Professor Lev received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Technion - Israel
Institute of Technology in 1964 and 1968, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from Case
Western Reserve University in 1970. He was a member of the faculty at Temple
University from 1970-87 and Worcester Polytechnic Institute from 1987-90. He joined
the University of Michigan-Dearborn faculty in 1990 as dean of the School of
Management and professor of management.
Professor Lev served as dean until 1992 and was chair of the Department of
Management Studies from 2001-03. A dedicated teacher with high standards, he

229






﻿February Meeting, 2010

demanded superior performance and promoted a culture of cooperative learning within
the department. Professor Lev has served as editor-in-chief of Omega - The
International Journal of Management Science since 2003 and co-editor-in-chief of the
International Journal of Management Science and Engineering Management since
2006.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Benjamin
Lev professor emeritus of decision science.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported to the regents
this month.
Degrees. Provost Sullivan submitted for approval final degree lists for the
December 2009 commencements and changes to previously approved degree lists.
Approval of Consent Agenda. On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by
Regent White, the regents unanimously approved the consent agenda.
Report of University Internal Audits, October through November 2009
Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the report of Office of University
Audits activities for the period October through November 2009.
Alternative Asset Commitment
Executive Vice President Slottow informed the regents of a follow-on
investment that has been made with Ashmore Global Special Situations Fund 5, L.P., a
previously approved absolute return partnership.
Central Campus Transit Center
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that this project, to provide bus
shelters and resurface North University Avenue between Fletcher and Church Streets,
would increase pedestrian safety and improve pedestrian flow and general safety and
mobility in the area. It will also create an accessible entrance into the Alexander G.
Ruthven Museums Building.
Associate Vice President Hank Baier gave a presentation describing the project,
displaying photos of existing conditions at the site, followed by schematic drawings of
the project and a rendering of the completed project. He described the pedestrian and
vehicular safety and mobility improvements that will result when the project is
completed. Funding will be provided from federal transportation funds and federal
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds via the Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority, with the University providing matching funding from
business and finance resources, parking resources, and utility resources.
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Richner, the regents
unanimously approved the Central Campus Transit Center Project as described, and
authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding construction contracts providing
that bids are within the approved budget.

Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman announced that the agenda includes 8 conflict of interest
items, each of which requires 6 votes for approval. On a motion by Regent White,
seconded by Regent Richner, the regents unanimously approved the following eight
agreements:
Agreement between the University of Michigan and Handoff Solutions, LLC
The Regents approved an agreement between the University of Michigan Health
System ("UMHS") and Handoff Solutions, LLC ("Handoff") for access to radiological
images via a proprietary web-based software service. Because Jeffrey E. Terrell, James
J. Law and Adrian Weyhing, University of Michigan employees, are also chief
executive manager, chief technology manager, and chief operations manager,
respectively, of Handoff, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan, UMHS, and
Handoff Solutions, LLC.
2. The agreement is for web access services at www.MeAndMyDocs.com to manage
and share patients' radiological images at a discounted rate of $3 per study. The
contract for Handoff's services will be prepared upon approval through 2014 and is
not to exceed a total amount of $300,000.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Dr. Jeffrey E. Terrell, James I. Law,
and Adrian Weyhing, University of Michigan employees, are each principal members
of Handoff.
Subcontract Agreement between the University of Michigan and Wolverine Energy
Solutions and Technology Inc.
The regents approved a subcontract agreement with Wolverine Energy
Solutions and Technology, Inc. ("Company") allowing the Company to subcontract a
portion of the work on an award it has received from the Department of Defense to
support research entitled "Development of Strategic Organic Energy Storage Capacitor
Devices" (to be performed by Dr. Theodore Goodson). Because Theodore Goodson
and his spouse, Stephanie Goodson, both University of Michigan employees, are also
part-owners and officers of the Company, this agreement falls under the State of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Wolverine Energy Solutions and Technology Inc.
2. The total subcontract to the University will be $40,000 for a one-year period
(approximately January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010). Since research
agreements are often amended, the agreement includes provisions for changes in the

231






﻿February Meeting, 2010

time, amount, and scope. University procedures for approval of these changes will
be followed and additional review by the Conflict of Interest Committee will be done
as appropriate.
3. The pecuniary interests of Theodore Goodson and Stephanie Goodson arise from
their status as part-owners and officers of Wolverine Energy Solutions and
Technology, Inc.
Option Agreement between the University of Michigan and Reveal Design Automation, Inc.
The regents approved an option agreement with Reveal Design Automation,
Inc. ("Company") to enable the Company to option the following technology from the
University: UM File No. 4434, "Automatic Scalable Verification for Hardware

﻿MARCH MEETING, 2010

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
March 18, 2010
The regents convened at 3:10 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill,
Chancellor Little, Vice President Lampe, Vice President May, Chancellor Person,
Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice
President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She announced that the Higher
Learning Commission had concluded its meetings on campus this week and would be
recommending that the University of Michigan be reaccredited for another 10 years.
She reported that a month-long celebration of the 40th anniversary of Earth Day was
underway on campus, and noted that the April 2010 regents' meeting is being held in
Grand Rapids.
Health Benefits Update
President Coleman introduced Laurita Thomas, associate vice president for
human resources, who gave an overview of the University's benefits principles and
strategies, recent health plan initiatives, and savings that these initiatives had created.
She also described how the University compares to its peer institutions in the benefits
area, noting that it delivers health benefits at a lower cost than its peers. She reported
that a major focus for 2010-2011 will be retiree health benefits, since these currently far
exceed the market. A committee has been formed to make recommendations regarding
eligibility requirements and retiree contribution levels for retiree health benefits, with a
goal of being competitive with the market while lowering the cost of the University's
retiree health benefits.
President Coleman applauded the manner in which Associate Vice President
Thomas has proceeded over the years with adapting the University's benefits packages
and cost structures to the changing market place. Regent Richner expressed agreement
with this. Noting that the University has a target employee contribution level of 30%,
he asked how this compares with the percentage contributed by state employees for
their health insurance. Vice President Wilbanks responded that the contribution level
for state employees is 5-7%. President Coleman pointed out that the University has
implemented a three-pronged approached, consisting of cost savings, cost sharing, and
health promotion behaviors.
Executive Vice President Slottow thanked Marty Eichstadt, director of benefits,
for her long-standing leadership and expertise in these areas.

﻿March Meeting, 2010

Resolution in Honor of Olympic Athletes
President Coleman announced that the 4 students who had competed in the 2010
Vancouver Olympics ice dancing competition were in the audience, and called them to
the podium. She commented on what gracious, talented representatives of the
University they had been during the competition. She called on Regent Newman, who
read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan applaud the
University's four Olympic athletes who represented the United States so
superbly in the 2010 Winter Olympics ice dancing competition.
Juniors Meryl Davis and Charlie White and sophomores Emily
Samuelson and Evan Bates qualified for the U.S. Olympic team after
placing first and third, respectively, in the U.S. National Championships.
At the Olympics, Meryl and Charlie, with their dazzling performances,
won a silver medal for the United States team. Emily and Evan were
lauded for their eleventh place finish, which positioned them to be strong
contenders for the United States Olympic team in 2014.
The Regents take great pride in Meryl Davis, Charlie White,
Emily Samuelson, and Evan Bates for being such splendid ambassadors
for the Maize and Blue at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games. Their
enthusiasm, poise, and dedication showed the world what it means to be
a Michigan Wolverine. As they head to Torino, Italy, to compete in the
World Championships, we salute them and say, "Hail to the Victors, and
Go Blue!"
Ms. Davis commented, "We can't tell you how much we appreciate this
honor... I think I speak for all four of us when I say that we've been nothing but
supported the whole way, and it means the world to us. To be able to pursue our
educational careers on top of our athletic career is so important to us, and it's an honor
to be here today."
Mr. White noted, "We were so proud to be there and to be able to represent the
University. It was such an honor. We are some of the very few figure skaters who are
pursuing higher education, and for all four of us to go to the University of Michigan is
really amazing. We were so proud to be out there with the Maize and Blue."
Mr. Bates commented, "I was born and raised in Ann Arbor and have been the
biggest Michigan fan for my entire life. All of us are truly big Michigan fans. And
since we can't represent the University in varsity sports, when we go to the Olympics
and go abroad, we do take the Block M with us wherever we go, and we represent it in
the best way we possibly can."
Ms. Samuelson stated, "We are all grateful for this huge honor. Whenever we
go to a competition, we definitely feel the entire University of Michigan campus behind
us in the emails, text messages, and phone calls we receive from professors, students,
faculty, everybody. It's been amazing. Thank you so much for everything, and we're
proud to be Wolverines."

the University through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) (federal

University had received a clean opinion on its OMB A-133 audit. PWC made several
observations regarding actions that could be taken to bring about further efficiencies or
improved processes in the future, and these were reviewed. The committee then met
privately with the PWC team. The last agenda item involved a review of the bimonthly
report of University internal audits with Ms. Senneff.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Newman
reported that the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee had received an
update from Provost Sullivan on personnel matters and an update on dean

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted one faculty

Harry S. Greenberg, M.D., professor of neurology, retired from active faculty
status on February 28, 2010.
Dr. Greenberg received his B.A. degree from Cornell University in 1968, and
his M.D. degree from the State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate Medical
Center in Syracuse, New York, in 1973. Following an internship at SUNY Upstate
Medical Center, he completed a neurology residency at Stanford University (1974-77),
a neuro-oncology fellowship at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (1977-
79), and a neurology fellowship at New York Hospital of Cornell University (1978-79).
He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1979 as an assistant professor of
neurology, and was promoted to associate professor in 1985 and professor in 1991.
From 1991-2003, he was also professor of surgery in the Section of Neurology.
Dr. Greenberg made substantial contributions to teaching, clinical programs,
and the field of neuro-oncology. A superb clinician with a sophisticated understanding
of brain tumors, he provided state-of-the-art treatment for many years to countless
patients suffering from this affliction. During this time, he also trained four
postdoctoral fellows in neuro-oncology. More recently, he modified his clinical
practice to provide care for patients in the general neurology clinic. In both spheres, he
was recognized as an outstanding teacher with an exceptional eye for clinical detail. Dr.
Greenberg authored more than 90 articles in peer-reviewed publications and co-
authored more than 25 book chapters. He served as president of the Michigan
Neurological Association (1995-97), president of the Section on Neuro-Oncology of the
American Academy of Neurology (1998-2000), and was a member of the Board of
Directors of the Society for Neuro-Oncology (1999-2002).
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator, clinician, and investigator
for his dedicated service by naming Harry S. Greenberg professor emeritus of
neurology.

William J. O'Brien, Ph.D., professor of dentistry in the School of Dentistry,
will retire from active faculty status on April 30, 2010.
Professor O'Brien received his B.S. degree from The City University of New
York in 1958, his M.S. degree from New York University in 1961, and his Ph.D.
degree from the University of Michigan in 1967. From 1961-70 he was a faculty

Materials from 1967-70. He joined the University of Michigan School of Dentistry
faculty as an associate professor in 1970 and was promoted to professor in 1973.
Professor O'Brien's research focused on the esthetic properties of restorative
materials derived from composites and ceramics. He also studied the strengthening
mechanisms of ceramics for use as dental crowns and as inlays to replace amalgam
restorations. Professor O'Brien received continuous grant funding for 32 years from
such agencies as the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Dental
Research, the Surface Science Laboratory, and Delta Dental. He was the principal
investigator of a National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research Materials
Science Center and director of a National Institutes of Health training grant in
biomaterials. He published numerous articles in leading, peer-reviewed journals,

﻿April Meeting, 2010

Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman announced that the agenda includes 5 conflict of interest
items, each of which requires 6 votes for approval. On a motion by Regent Taylor,
seconded by Regent White, the regents unanimously approved the following five
agreements:
Agreement between the University of Michigan and the Society of Hospital Medicine
The Regents approved an agreement between the University of Michigan
Medical School Department of Internal Medicine ("UMMS") and the Society of
Hospital Medicine ("SHM") for personnel and operating expenses incurred by SHM
physician mentors and administrators tasked with optimizing the transition of care
process. Because Dr. Scott Flanders and Dr. Christopher Kim, University of Michigan
employees, are also board president and project director, respectively, of SHM, this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan, UMMS, and
SHM.
2. The subcontract agreement is for personnel and operating expenses incurred by SHM
physician mentors and administrators tasked with optimizing the transition of care
process. This project is part of a funded program by Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Michigan ("BCBS") in support of physician group incentive programs on quality and
safety. UMMS is a coordinating center for this project and pending additional
funding from BCBS in the following years, UMMS plans for annual disbursements
to SHM of approximately $225,000 through 2012, not to exceed a total cost of
$680,000.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Dr. Scott Flanders and Dr.
Christopher Kim, UMMS employees, are board president and project director,
respectively, of SHM.

The regents approved the School of Music, Theatre & Dance ("SMTD") making
payments to and entering into an agreement with Equilibrium Ltd. ("Equilibrium") for
various services related to distribution of CDs. Because Michael W. Udow, a
University of Michigan employee, is also president of Equilibrium, this agreement falls
under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties involved in the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan,
SMTD, and Equilibrium.
2. The payments and agreement are for various services related to distribution of CDs
through May 31, 2014, not to exceed a total cost of $29,390.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Michael W. Udow, a University of
Michigan employee, is the artist of this original piece.
Master Subrecipient Agreement between the Regents of the University of Michigan and
the Hope Foundation
The regents approved a master subrecipient agreement with the Hope
Foundation that will enable research projects involving the foundation to be performed
in a timely manner and that provides a stable and ongoing support mechanism to
support collaboration between the Medical School and the other institutions
participating in the Southwest Oncology Group. Because Larry Baker and Anne Schott,

276






﻿April Meeting, 2010

University of Michigan employees, are also directors and officers of the Hope
Foundation ("Foundation"), and other non-faculty University employees are both
employees of the University and serve functions related to the operation of the
Foundation, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.   The following    information  is provided   in  compliance with    statutory
requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and the Hope
Foundation.
2. The University will enter into an agreement with the Foundation that will cover
standard procedures for performance of projects as well as provisions implementing
University and federal or other sponsor required policies. The agreement will cover
an initial six-year period with a total authorization not to exceed $25,000,000. The
University will use standard procedures to justify the placement of projects with the
Foundation and will review the cost of each project. Budgets will be reviewed and
approved by authorized representatives of the requisitioning unit and the Office of
Contract Administration. The agreement includes provisions for changes in time,
amount, and scope of each supported project and the master agreement itself.
University procedures for approval of each project will be followed and additional
review by the Medical School Conflict of Interest Board will be done on a project-
by-project basis.
3. Drs. Larry Baker and Anne Schott receive no compensation from the Foundation and
have no financial interest in the Foundation.
Subcontract Agreement between the University of Michigan and Arbor Photonics, Inc.
The regents approved a subcontract agreement with Arbor Photonics, Inc.
("Company") to allow the Company personnel with unique skills to have access to and
use existing experimental setups and equipment at the University that will enable
characterization  of optical properties    of  Chirally-Coupled-Core    fiber  samples
previously fabricated and owned by the University, and thus move them closer to
commercialization. Because Almantas Galvanauskas, a University of Michigan
employee, is also co-owner and member of the board of directors of the Company, this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the subcontract agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan
and Arbor Photonics, Inc.
2. Under the project, a total contract of $7,081 is anticipated to cover a period of eight
months. The terms of the proposed agreement will conform to University policy. In
the event of an amendment, University procedures for approval of these changes will
be followed and additional conflict of interest review will be done as appropriate.
3. The pecuniary interest of Dr. Almantas Galvanauskas arises from the fact that he is
part-owner and a member of the board of directors of Arbor Photonics, Inc.
Amendment to Agreement between the University of Michigan and Arbor Research
Collaborative for Health
The regents approved an amendment to an agreement with Arbor Research
Collaborative for Health ("ARCH") involving the research project "International
Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns" (I-DOPPS). Because Drs. Robert Merion and
Robert Wolfe, University of Michigan employees, are also employees of ARCH, this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Arbor
Research Collaborative for Health.

277






﻿April Meeting, 2010

2. The amendment adds $149,740 of funding to the I-DOPPS project, bringing the total
funding to $2,675,316 and extends the period of performance to December 31, 2010.
The University's standard contract provisions continue to apply. Since research
agreements are often amended, the agreement as amended continues to include
provisions for changes in time, amount, and scope. University procedures for
approval of these changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest reviews
will be done as appropriate.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Robert Merion and Robert Wolfe are
employees of both the University of Michigan and Arbor Research Collaborative for
Health.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Henry Ford Estate-Fair Lane
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that the University has an
opportunity to transfer the Henry Ford Estate to the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House
("Ford House"), a tax-exempt, non-profit private operating foundation that would
assume stewardship responsibilities for the estate. The Ford House is committed to
raising sufficient funds to enhance the stewardship of the property and to achieve the
highest level of museum practice in its operation.
Regent Taylor moved that the executive vice president and chief financial
officer be given authority to execute a quit claim deed for the real property and execute
agreements and other actions as necessary to consummate the transfer of Henry Ford
Estate real estate, property and University funds currently restricted to estate use to the
Ford House, or affiliated tax-exempt entity created for the purpose of owning and
operating the Henry Ford Estate. Regent Richner seconded the motion. Regent Deitch
recused himself from voting due to a conflict of interest. The vote was then taken and
the motion was approved unanimously by all seven regents who participated in the
vote. Regent Newman pointed out that it is unusual for the University to give back
property, and that this transaction was arrived at as the result of a long, carefully
considered process.
University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) Washtenaw Community Health
Organization (WCHO) Reappointments to the WCHO Board of Directors
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the reappointments of Gene Brown and Michael Dabbs to the
WCHO Board of Directors.

﻿MAY MEETING, 2010

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
May 20, 2010
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Fairlane Center on the campus of the
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Present were President Coleman and Regents
Darlow, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were
Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Chancellor Little, Vice President Lampe, Vice
President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President
Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regent Deitch was absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order and commented on the vitality of
the Dearborn campus and the many accomplishments of its student body and faculty.
She welcomed to the meeting more than 30 higher education leaders from China who
are taking part in the University's biennial Michigan-China University Leadership
Forum, and who today are focusing on observing the workings of the University's
publicly elected governing board.
President Coleman noted that among the items being considered at this meeting
is a recommendation to reappoint Chancellor Dan Little for a third five-year term as
leader of the University of Michigan-Dearborn. "Dan has been tireless in advancing
UM-Dearborn and enhancing the University's role in metropolitan Detroit," she said.
"He is now the longest-serving chancellor in the 50-year history of the UM-Dearborn,
and I'm pleased to recommend his reappointment."
President Coleman announced that the men's gymnastics team was present to be
recognized for winning the NCAA championship in April 2010. She recognized
Athletic Director David Brandon, who commented on how proud the Athletic
Department was of this team, not only for winning its fourth national championship, but
because 11 team members had also received All Big Ten academic awards. Mr.
Brandon introduced head coach Kurt Golder, noting he had recently been named
NCAA National Coach of the Year by the National Association of Collegiate
Gymnastics Coaches. Following comments by Coach Golder, President Coleman
called the team to the podium and recognized Regent White, who read the following
resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan applaud and
congratulate the men's gymnastics team and its head coach, Kurt
Golder, for their 2010 NCAA championship victory. This marks the
program's fourth national title and the first national varsity team
championship for a Michigan team since 2005.
With its dazzling athletic prowess, fierce competitiveness, and

281






﻿May Meeting, 2010

unwavering resilience, the 2010 men's gymnastics team was a sight to
behold at the championship meet. Led by the outstanding vault
performances of seniors Kent Caldwell and Mel Anton Santander, junior
Thomas Kelley, and freshman Rohan Sebastian, the team literally
vaulted past defending champion Stanford University to secure the win
in the last event. Junior Chris Cameron, already named the 2010 Big
Ten Gymnast of the Year, captured the NCAA all-around title, while
senior Ryan McCarthy was crowned NCAA high bar champion. These
highly motivated student-athletes set a new program record, with seven
individuals receiving a total of 13 All-America honors.
Proving they are as adept in the classroom as on the mats, 11 of
the 18 eligible student-athletes on the men's gymnastics team were
recognized with Academic All-Big Ten honors for maintaining a
cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0, while junior Ben Baldus-
Strauss earned the NCAA Elite 88 Award as the student-athlete with the
highest grade point average competing at the 2010 Men's Gymnastics
NCAA Championship.
The Regents now salute the entire men's gymnastics team,
including Coach Golder and his staff for their triumphant national
championship victory. They are indeed the most valiant of victors.
A round of applause followed.
President Coleman commented on the successes of other sports teams, including
men's lacrosse (a club sport), which had just won its third consecutive national
championship, the softball team, which had won its third straight Big Ten
championship and is now competing in the NCAA regionals, and the women's tennis
team, which is currently ranked fourth nationally and is competing in the NCAA Sweet
16 tournament.   She also commented on the remarkable determination and
competitiveness of the baseball team, as shown in a recent, come-from-behind 15-14
victory after being down 14-0 against Northwestern University.
President Coleman introduced Derek Collins, associate dean for humanities in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
Non-Traditional Education Programs Task Force
Professor Collins gave an overview of the recommendations made by the Non-
Traditional Education Programs Task Force, which was charged with identifying
opportunities to expand revenue-generating opportunities, particularly in the area of
non-traditional educational programs (programs with an educational purpose that do not
immediately lead to a degree). The recommendations include developing a centralized
information source for continuing education information to increase the visibility of
existing course offerings. The task force believes this would have the potential to
double current net revenue from non-traditional educational programs in five years as
more programs are developed.
Several regents expressed support for this initiative, along with the hope that the
ideas would be pursued and implemented in a timely fashion. Provost Sullivan

282






﻿May Meeting, 2010

commented that this is one of five task forces exploring ways to enhance revenues and
decrease costs, and the most promising ideas emerging from each task force will be
aggressively pursued.
Implications for the University of Michigan Health System of National Health
Care Reform
President Coleman introduced Dr. Matthew Davis, associate professor of
pediatrics and communicable diseases, associate professor of internal medicine, and
associate professor of public policy. Dr. Davis gave a report on the possible
implications of the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
("Health Care Reform") on the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS). He
noted that the main features of the act all relate to increased coverage for millions of
Americans to be achieved through a variety of means by 2014. He reviewed how
features of the legislation might affect the UMHS.   Because many of the
implementation procedures and guidelines have not yet been developed, he noted that
the UMHS has an opportunity to help develop them and to broaden its patient base by
inviting newly covered patients to receive care at the UMHS. He pointed out that the
financial impact of the legislation is likely to have both positive and negative aspects
for the UMHS.
Dr. Davis concluded by observing that, while the health care reform legislation
is extraordinarily complex and presents immense challenges for health care providers,
the UMHS is well positioned to be very innovative in preparing for 2014 and to attract
patients who are seeking to receive and continue their care in a high quality
organization.
Following the presentation, Dr. Davis responded to questions from the regents
about other potential ramifications of the legislation.
The Scholarship of Engagement: Women's and Gender Studies at the University
of Michigan-Dearborn
Suzanne Bergeron, associate professor of women's studies and associate
professor of social sciences, gave a presentation describing how the Women's and
Gender Studies Program contributes to the University of Michigan-Dearborn's
"Metropolitan Vision" through its "scholarship of engagement" projects that engage
with a wide variety of programs and groups in southeastern Michigan.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White reported that Regents
Darlow, Ilitch, Maynard, and Richner, President Coleman, and Executive Vice
President Slottow had all attended the committee meeting that morning. Agenda items
included the FY2011 Hospitals and Health Centers (HHC) budget, with Executive Vice
President Pescovitz, HHC Executive Director and CEO Doug Strong, and HHC CFO
Dave Morlock, and the Athletic Department budget, with Athletic Director David
Brandon and Executive Director of Athletics Business Operations Jason Winters. The
committee also received an update regarding the Ross School of Business budget from
Provost Terry Sullivan and Vice Provost Phil Hanlon, and the regular bi-monthly
University Audits report from Executive Director of University Audits Carol Senneff.

included on the agenda. A 3% increase is requested, 2% of which would be designated
for a deep renovation of Alice Lloyd Hall as part of the Residential Life Initiative, and
the remaining 1% would be used to cover the costs of running the housing system. An
increase of 1% is being requested for Northwood Community Apartments.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little commented on how well
the Women's and Gender Studies Program fulfills the Dearborn campus's mission of
engaging with the surrounding community.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Person reported that the campus is
experiencing dramatic enrollment increases for spring, summer, and fall terms. She
also reported that the campus had received official notification of its reaccreditation for

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted 17 faculty retirement
memoirs.
Julian P. Adams, Ph.D., professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental
biology, and professor of ecology and evolutionary biology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2010.
Professor Adams received his B.Sc. degree from the University College of
North Wales in Bangor, United Kingdom in 1965, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of California, Davis in 1969. He joined the University of Michigan faculty
in what is now the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology as
an assistant professor in 1970, and was promoted to associate professor in 1975 and
professor in 1984. He was appointed professor of ecology and evolutionary biology in
2005.
Professor Adams' research focused on genetics and evolutionary biology,
specifically the areas of microbial evolution and human population genetics. He
worked at the intersection of molecular biology and evolutionary biology, seeking to
explain evolutionary changes in biochemical, molecular and physiological terms. His
expertise in this area led to his service as chair of the NIH Genetics Study Section and
chair of the Gordon Conference on Microbial Population Biology. He was a resident
fellow at the Rockefeller Institute in Bellagio, Italy, and a senior fellow in the Michigan
Society of Fellows. His awards include an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship, a
Fulbright Scholarship, a U.S. State Department Jefferson Fellowship, and a NATO
Fellowship.
While he taught a variety of courses in genetics and biology throughout his
career, most recently Professor Adams found great satisfaction in teaching a course for
non-science majors in genetics and public policy. Within the Department of Biology,
he served as associate chair from 1985-89 and chair from 1996-2001. In 2001, when
the biology department was reorganized, he became one of the founding faculty
members of the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service by naming Julian P. Adams professor emeritus of molecular, cellular,
and developmental biology, and professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary
biology.

University in 1963, 1965, and 1968, respectively. He was a researcher at the Solid
State Physics Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1968-73 and at
the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center General Science Laboratory from 1973-87. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty as professor of physics in 1987, and was
appointed the Joaquin M. Luttinger Collegiate Professor of Physics in 2004.
Professor Allen's scientific work has had a major impact on the field of solid-
state physics. His experiments and expertise in electron spectroscopy helped to shape
the development of the branch of physics known as "highly correlated electron
systems." In contrast to the usual electronic materials that are described as Fermi

303






﻿May Meeting, 2010

liquids in terms of Landau quasiparticles, solids typified by the highly correlated
motion of their electrons possess unique electronic, magnetic and transport properties.
These highly correlated electron systems are more akin to the concept of Luttinger
liquid, where features such as charge and spin separation and non-universal power-law
singularities in the particle spectral functions give rise to novel and exotic forms of
matter. Professor Allen's achievements have been recognized by his election as a
Fellow of the American Physical Society (1990), and being awarded the Senior U.S.
Science Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (1989) and the Frank
Isakson Prize from the American Physical Society (2002).
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher, scholar, and scientist by

﻿May Meeting, 2010

Arthur G. Wasserman, Ph.D., professor of mathematics in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status May 31, 2010.
Professor Wasserman received his B.S. degree from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in 1960 and his Ph.D. degree from Brandeis University in 1965. From
1965-68, he was a Benjamin Peirce Instructor in Mathematics at Harvard University.
He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1968, and was
promoted to associate professor in 1970 and professor in 1980.
Professor Wasserman's research focused on differential topology.  More
specifically, he studied manifolds via their symmetry groups-the theory of
transformation groups. He established the basic theorems of differential topology for
manifolds with a group action, developed methods for classification of manifolds with
symmetry up to cobordism, and has worked on "desingularization" of group actions on
manifolds and found residue theorems. Algebraic realization of manifolds and
foliations are among other topics that he has investigated. Professor Wasserman has
published two monographs and more than 75 papers in the field of differential
equations, frequently using topological methods. For the past 20 years he has been
researching the differential equations that arise in mathematical physics, specifically the
Einstein equations of general relativity coupled with other fields including the Yang
Mills equations, wave maps coupled to gravity, o-model solitons, and mini-boson stars.
Professor Wasserman was a dedicated advisor for undergraduate students within
the Department of Mathematics. In 1991, he received the LSA Excellence in
Concentration Advising Award recognizing his efforts.   Professor Wasserman
developed two mathematics courses covering computer algebra systems for beginning
students in the department. He mentored three graduate students and served on the
doctoral committees of several others.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
Arthur G. Wasserman professor emeritus of mathematics.
Thomas E. Weisskopf, Ph.D., professor of economics and professor of
Residential College in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from
active faculty status on May 31, 2010.
Professor Weisskopf received his A.B. degree from Harvard University in 1961,
and his Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966. From
1968-72, he was an assistant professor at Harvard University. He joined the University
of Michigan faculty as an associate professor in 1972, and was promoted to professor in
1979. He was appointed professor of Residential College in 2005.
In his research, Professor Weisskopf addressed three fundamental questions of
economic transformation: How does a poor country become rich, how does a command
economy become a market economy, and how does a rich market economy become
just. Professor Weisskopf brought to these questions an exceptionally rich array of
resources, including linguistic expertise, contextual knowledge, and quantitative
technique. During the 1970s, with a handful of others, he founded the school of radical
political economy. His Beyond the Wasteland: A Democratic Alternative to Economic
Decline (1983), coauthored with Samuel Bowles and David Gordon, offered a timely
diagnosis of American economic problems and an enduring blueprint for American
economic renewal. It is one of the two or three most important books ever published by
members of his school. Translated into French, Japanese, and Spanish, it led to After

312






﻿May Meeting, 2010

the Waste Land: A Democratic Economics for the Year 2000 (1991). The maturity and
breadth of Professor Weisskopf's insights are on full display in his Affirmative Action
in the United States and India: A Comparative Perspective (2004).
Professor Weisskopf served for eight years as director of the Residential
College, where he was much admired for his calm and fair-minded leadership, his wit,
and his dedication to undergraduate learning.  He served on numerous major
committees throughout the university and was resident director of the study-abroad
program in Aix-en-Provence. He held visiting lectureships at institutions in Ukraine
and Moscow. Everywhere he went, Professor Weisskopf was admired for his
commitment to academic values and for his personal integrity.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Thomas E.
Weisskopf professor emeritus of economics and professor emeritus of Residential
College.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill reported the deaths of two faculty
members. Provost Sullivan noted that Professor Prahalad, had twice been named "the
world's most influential business thinker" by the Thinkers 50 List of the Top 50
Management Thought Leaders in the World, and that "it is impossible to exaggerate
C.K.'s impact on business and business education around the world."
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of John F. Devlin, Ph.D., associate professor of physics in the College of
Arts, Sciences, and Letters, University of Michigan-Dearborn, who died on April 23,
2010 at the age of 65.
Professor Devlin received his B.A. degree from the State University of New
York at Binghamton in 1966, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Michigan State
University in 1968 and 1970, respectively. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at
the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in 1972 and was a staff physicist at the
Battelle-Columbus Laboratories in Columbus, Ohio from 1972-76. He joined the
University of Michigan-Dearborn faculty as an assistant professor of physics in 1976,
and was promoted to associate professor in 1982.
Professor Devlin's research focused on the structural properties of metals, the
transport properties of liquid metals and alloys, and computational approaches to the
electronic structure of metals. An outstanding teacher, he taught a full spectrum of
physics courses, ranging from introductory level to upper division. Professor Devlin
also demonstrated an abiding commitment to faculty governance and university affairs.
He chaired the Department of Natural Sciences and the physics discipline within the
Department of Natural Sciences, was chair of the Faculty Advisory Committee on
Campus Affairs, and served on the Executive Committee of the College of Arts,
Sciences, and Letters. He served as an advisor to physics students and chaired the
Natural Sciences Scholarship Committee. In recognition of his teaching excellence and
his commitment to students, he was twice awarded the UM-Dearborn Distinguished
Teaching Award-in 1978 and 1987-and received the Michigan Association of
Governing Boards Distinguished Faculty Award in 1986. He was a member of Sigma
Xi, the scientific research society, and the Phi Kappa Phi honor society.
During his 34-year career at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, Professor
Devlin left a lasting mark on the institution through his generous spirit, innovative

teaching style, and breadth of knowledge. As we mourn the loss of our beloved
colleague, we also extend our sincere condolences to his wife, Judy, and members of
his family.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Coimbatore K. Prahalad, D.B.A., Paul and Ruth McCracken
Distinguished University Professor of Corporate Strategy and professor of corporate
strategy and international business in the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, who
died on April 16, 2010 at the age of 68.
Professor Prahalad received his B.Sc. degree from the University of Madras
(India) in 1960, his postgraduate diploma in business administration from the Indian
Institute of Management in 1966, and his D.B.A. degree from Harvard University in
1975. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a visiting associate professor in
1977, and was promoted to associate professor in 1978 and professor in 1987. He was
appointed Harvey C. Fruehauf Professor of Business Administration in 1993, and Paul
and Ruth McCracken Distinguished University Professor of Corporate Strategy in 2005.
He also served as distinguished fellow at the University's William Davidson Institute,
where he played an important advisory role for the Institute's Base of the Pyramid
research initiative.
Professor Prahalad was one of the most beloved teachers and influential thinkers
at the University of Michigan. He was twice ranked as the world's most influential
business thinker, most recently in October 2009, by the "Thinkers 50" list of the top 50
management thought leaders in the world. Professor Prahalad's work has been
enormously influential since 1990, when he and Professor Gary Hamel co-authored the
article, "The Core Competence of the Corporation," in the Harvard Business Review. He
and Professor Hamel further developed their thinking in Competing for the Future
(1994). His book The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty
Through Profits (2004) is considered to be indispensable for executives and scholars
seeking to understand emerging markets. Professor Prahalad's most recent book, The
New Age of Innovation (2008), co-authored with Professor M.S. Krishnan, examines how
companies can build organizational capabilities that allow them to achieve and sustain
continuous change and innovation. His awards include the Faculty Pioneer Lifetime
Achievement Award from the Aspen Institute, the Italian Telecom Prize for Leadership
in Business and Economic Thinking, and the Lal Bahadur Shastri Award for Excellence
in Management, presented by the president of India.
As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our heartfelt
condolences to his wife Gayatri, his son Murali, his daughter Deepa, and his three
grandchildren.

﻿JUNE MEETING, 2010

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
June 17, 2010
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Ilitch, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little,
Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice
President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice
President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She congratulated Chancellor
Little for having recently received a 2012 "Closing the Gap Award" from New Detroit,
recognizing Chancellor Little's leadership on the Dearborn campus, and in particular,
for developing its "Metropolitan Vision." President Coleman also noted that 43
Michigan students had received Fulbright grants, the highest number ever, and that later
this month she would be leading a delegation of administrators and deans to Shanghai
Jiao Tong University and Peking University in China to expand existing research
partnerships.
Noting that the new chair and vice chair of the Board of Regents are elected
annually at the June meeting, President Coleman thanked Regent Richner for his
leadership as chair during the past year and Regent Darlow for her contributions as vice
chair. She then called on Regent Richner.
Comments from Regent Richner
Regent Richner thanked Regent Newman for her leadership as chair of the
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, Regent White for her leadership
of the Finance, Audit and Investment, and Regent Darlow for her assistance as vice
chair of the board.
Election of Board Officers for 2009-2010.

Board of Regents and Regent Denise Ilitch as vice chair, effective July 1, 2010, through
June 30, 2011. Regent Taylor seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regent Darlow thanked Regent Richner for his tremendous contributions as
chair during the past year.
Introductory Comments Regarding Proposed 2010-2011 Revenue and
Expenditure Operating Budgets
President Coleman noted that the agenda includes the review and approval of

developing these budgets, and thanked the Board of Regents for the many hours they

321






﻿June Meeting, 2010

have devoted to this year's process. She pointed out that most of the deans were in
attendance at the meeting and thanked them for helping to identify millions of dollars in
savings while recruiting and maintaining exceptional faculty and innovative programs.
President Coleman reported that General Fund expenses have been reduced by $159
million in recent years, and that the University has been aggressive in lowering costs
for utilities and health care.
During the past decade, the University has experienced the slowest annual
growth in resident in-state tuition increases among Michigan universities, President
Coleman said, and the proposed 2010-11 budget continues that trend. It also
recommends a substantial increase in the financial aid budget.
President Coleman pointed out that the provost and chief academic officer is at
the heart of the budget-building process, and that this would be Provost Sullivan's final
Board of Regents' meeting at the University of Michigan. She continued, "As she
prepares to leave Ann Arbor for the presidency of the University of Virginia, I want to
say again how thrilled we are for her. I also offer my deepest gratitude for her
leadership, her acumen, and her counsel as provost," and for her "tremendous sense of
humor." She called on Regent Richner.
Regent Richner called Provost Sullivan to the podium and read the following
resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate and
commend Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs
Teresa A. Sullivan as she departs the University on August 1, 2010, to
become president of the University of Virginia.
From her first day on the job in June 2006, Provost Sullivan
impressed all who met her with the depth and breadth of her knowledge;
her friendly, unflappable demeanor; her forthright approach to tackling
tough problems; and her commitment to sustaining and enhancing an
academic environment that has kept the University of Michigan at the
forefront of universities worldwide.  The remarkable legacy of her
accomplishments, which touch the entire panoply of issues confronting
the Provost's Office, will be felt for years to come.
Provost Sullivan assumed the role of chief academic and budget
officer during the most challenging economic environment in a
generation. Drawing on her considerable administrative skills, and
armed with her prudent, disciplined approach to fiscal planning, she was
able to identify funding for the hiring of 100 new tenure-track faculty
members while strengthening the fiscal foundation that has made
Michigan a national model of a well-run university. With the enthusiastic
support of the faculty, she launched innovative programs for the
development of academic leadership among department chairs and
associate deans and expanded the faculty ombuds program.   She
developed a systematic process for review of capital projects within the
schools and colleges, and she established task forces on cost reduction

322






﻿June Meeting, 2010

and revenue enhancement. Equally impressive are the nine deans and
two major directors who have been appointed under her leadership.
The regents now salute Teresa A. Sullivan and her husband, legal
scholar and Law School faculty member Douglas Laycock, and extend
their fondest best wishes to them both as they assume their new posts at
the University of Virginia.
A round of applause followed.
Provost Sullivan thanked the regents, noting that "Doug and I have enjoyed
every day in Ann Arbor," and that it has been a "great privilege and honor to be
associated with one of the great universities in the world." She thanked her vice
provosts, and her "wonderful, dedicated staff, especially Karen Gibbons, who is the
best chief of staff one could ever have." She thanked the deans, executive officers, and
the board, for "a terrific experience."
Electronic Agenda Materials
President Coleman pointed out that some regents have begun using i-Pads in
order to access their agenda materials electronically. The eventual goal is to eliminate
paper agenda books and other documents associated with regents' meetings.
2010-2011 Operating Budgets - All Campuses
Executive Vice President Slottow gave a presentation focusing on the
University's balance sheet, which is one indicator of the overall strength of the
University. He said that two things are fundamental to protecting and strengthening the
balance sheet--adherence to sound financial policies and principles, and having a strong
internal control structure.
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the University has net assets of
$9.3 billion. Threats to the balance sheet include future liabilities, such as $1.6 billion
in "other post retirement benefits" and more than $100 million in deferred maintenance
of buildings. Other threats include capital market volatility, the Michigan economy,
rising health care and energy costs, and competition for faculty.
Progress has been made toward endowing the General Fund. Over the last six
years, UM has added approximately $230 million, which provides $12 million to
support General Fund activities. And new external revenue sources and internal
reallocations contribute over $64 million annually to General Fund activities.
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that the University owns a vast number
of physical assets that need to be maintained, and described how commitment to
renewal of the physical plant pays off by both mitigating the need for building
replacement and reducing the annual operating costs of buildings.
In the area of human capital, Executive Vice President Slottow pointed out that
since nearly 40% of the University's employees and 54% of managers will be eligible
for retirement within the next five years, administrators are focusing more on
succession planning.  He described various programs focused on increasing
productivity and improving the work environment for faculty and staff.

﻿June Meeting, 2010

Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the University enjoys the highest
possible credit ratings, due to its prudent debt management policy, aggressive interest
expense management, and other factors. In conclusion, he observed that the annual
operating budget is only one indicator of the University's financial condition, and that
the proposed budget is consistent with maintaining the University's overall financial
health.
2010-2011 Operating Budgets - All Campuses; Proposed Ann Arbor General
Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates for FY 2010-2011
Provost Sullivan reported that total operating revenues will increase by 7.2%,
from $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion, with growth in both the academic enterprise and the
auxiliary operations. An unplanned growth in enrollment has led to yields that are
significantly higher than last year, leading to an increase of 800 undergraduate students
and 600 graduate students over last year's budgeted numbers. There have also been
significant increases in sponsored research activities. Total expenditures do not equal
total revenues, due to the fact that auxiliary funds are permitted to operate with a
margin.
On the Ann Arbor campus, the primary objectives of the General Fund budget
include enhancing the quality of the academic experience, holding the increase in cost
of attendance to a minimum, and investing significantly in financial aid. She pointed
out that the FY 2011 General Fund budget incorporates a multi-year view of costs and
revenue projections. It has been thoughtfully developed in a period of extreme
financial stress and uncertainty, challenging the administration to reallocate resources
to the highest priorities so as to maintain and enhance the student experience at an
affordable cost.
It is assumed that the state appropriation will be $315.1 million, $1.4 million
less than was budgeted in FY 2010, but the appropriation could be further reduced
based on the state's revenue situation. Tuition revenue now comprises 65% of General
Fund revenue. The budget proposal includes aggressive cost containment, totaling
nearly $39 million in reductions in the coming fiscal year. These reductions are in
addition to ongoing cost containment efforts that have removed more than $159 million
in recurring General Fund expenditures during the past seven years. All new initiatives
will be funded through internal reallocation, which allows the institution to maintain its
commitment to quality without increasing costs. These reallocations will make
possible such initiatives as expanding the Undergraduate Research Opportunity
Program, expanding faculty hiring initiatives to enable smaller class sizes, and
enhancing the clinical and skills-based curriculum in the Law School.
Provost Sullivan said that the ability to attend the University without regard to
family financial circumstances is a top objective; the budget includes $126 million in
centrally awarded financial aid, an increase of $8.3 million. She noted that a new
federal tax credit effective this year, coupled with University financial aid and a modest
tuition increase, will result in many families paying less to attend the University in the
coming fiscal year than they did in the current year. Most of the financial aid budget is
targeted at reducing loan burdens for resident students and unmet need for nonresident
students, and will result in an increase of 10.6% for centrally-awarded need-based
financial aid for undergraduate students. In addition, for 2010-2011, the University is

324






﻿June Meeting, 2010

launching a $3.6 million "Economic Hardship Program" which will be targeted to
resident undergraduate students whose family incomes range from $60,000-$100,000.
Grants of $500 will be awarded for the fall semester and will be renewable annually
until graduation for a maximum of four years.
Provost Sullivan said that the proposed tuition increase of 1.5% for resident
undergraduate students is the lowest tuition rate increase since 1984. The recommended
tuition increase for non-resident undergraduate students is 3.0%. Resident and non-
resident graduate student tuition will increase by 2.8%. The recommended FY 2011
General Fund budget for the Ann Arbor campus is $1,553,245, an increase of 6.8%
over FY 2010. Provost Sullivan noted that if the state enacts a significantly lower
appropriation than the current recommendation of $315.1 million, or enacts a mid-year
rescission, a mid-year tuition rate increase may be requested.
Provost Sullivan recognized the members of her budget team for their
extraordinary efforts in developing the budget.
Discussion of Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets and Proposed Ann
Arbor General Fund Operating Budgets and Student Tuition and Fee Rates for
FY 2010-2011
Regent Taylor moved approval of the revenue and expenditure operating
budgets for FY 2010-2011. Regent Richner seconded the motion.
Comments from Regent Darlow. Regent Darlow spoke in favor of the FY
2010-2011 Ann Arbor General Fund operating budget and student tuition and fee rates.
She thanked everyone involved in developing the budget and everyone across all
campuses for their efforts in controlling costs and finding efficiencies. She continued:
"For me, the limited tuition increase for resident undergraduates of 1.5%,
combined with very significant increases in need-based financial aid mean that the
University is reaching out to hard-pressed Michigan families, telling them that we know
how tough this economy is, and that we want to give them and their daughters and sons
who come here the support they need in these difficult times."
Regent Darlow noted that in recent years, while the University has achieved
strong gains in need-based aid, it has focused in particular on assuring adequate need-
based aid for lower income families. This year, the University's proposal will make a
huge difference for qualified Michigan students from middle-income families. The
Economic Hardship Program, which provides an additional $500 for their aid packages,
is much more than the $178 tuition increase and significantly decreases the amount of
their expected contributions when compared to last year. This program is in addition to
the budget designed to reduce their expected loan and contribution burdens by 10%, or
about $2,282 less than last year, for a family making between $60,00 and $80,000 per
year.
Regent Darlow concluded that while she does support the budget, she views it
as one step in the continuing challenge to ensure that all qualified Michigan students
have access to the University regardless of their financial circumstances.

325






﻿June Meeting, 2010

Comments from Regent Ilitch. Regent Ilitch pointed out that the state
continues to be challenged by the economic crisis. "As the state struggles to transition
its economy, families are mortgaging their futures to invest in their children so they can
compete in a new world economy. ... We have to fix our budget crisis from within, not
on the backs of working students and families." Noting that she had voted against the
proposed tuition increases on all campuses last year, she said she still has the same
concern for working families. "We need more innovation when addressing our
finances and setting tuition," she said. "We must explore ways to control the continual
escalation of tuition...and I will continue to fight for an affordable, accessible, and
quality education at the University of Michigan for all." She said she would be voting
against tuition increases again for the upcoming academic year.
Regent Ilitch noted that continual tuition increases limit opportunities for
middle and working class students to take advantage of a Michigan education, and
impact the economic diversity of the student body at a time of increasing hardship. She
acknowledged the progress that has been made in increasing the amount of need-based
financial aid, lowering the rate of tuition increases, and containing costs. "Yet we can
do more, and we must lead by example," she said. "It should no longer be the
assumption each year that we will raise tuition. Instead, we should ask, how can we
avoid it?" She noted that the University had received new revenue this year that could
have been used to help close the budget gap. "I will not support a tuition increase until
I'm convinced that there is nothing more we can do to avoid one without compromising
quality."
Comments from Regent Richner. Regent Richner commented that his son
would be entering the University of Michigan in the fall as a member of the class of
2014. The college search process his family undertook during the past year served to
"re-solidify my view that the University of Michigan is an incomparable institution, and
that we are so fortunate to have it here. I appreciate the hard work of all those who
have been involved in preparing this budget," he said. "I do believe it balances the
interests of affordability and accessibility, which I think are very important, with
preservation of quality. This, to me, is why I want my son to go to this university." He
expressed his support of the budget.
Comments from Regent Maynard. Regent Maynard said she supports the
budget because she appreciates the impact of tuition and loans on families. While she
agrees with Regent Darlow that the proposed budget is not the end game, but part of a
process, she noted that the budget does maintain the quality of the University of
Michigan.
Comments from Regent Deitch. Regent Deitch pointed out that this is a
restrained budget. Many individuals have contributed to it along the way, including
Regent Newman, with her idea to endow the General Fund, and Regent Darlow, with
her commitment and passion for working families. He said that "nobody worked
harder than Regent Darlow in helping us come to a budget that I think is balanced in
terms of all of the various interests." He commented that given all of the historical ups
and downs of the economic cycle that have played out through the University's history,
"I know that as we approach our 200th anniversary in 2017, we're still going to be here.
We're still going to be leading the state and leading the world. So you've got to

326






﻿June Meeting, 2010

balance the needs of people in the short term with the needs of the institution in the
long term. The value of the quality of a Michigan education cannot be underestimated,
but unfortunately, it is more expensive than we'd all like it to be."
He said he was "thrilled" by the additional commitment of funds to financial
aid, which is a direct response to the needs of the middle class, and that he appreciated
everyone's constructive approach to the process.
The vote was then taken on Regent Taylor's motion to approve the revenue and
expenditure operating budgets for FY 2010-2011, and it was approved, with Regents
Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Richner, Taylor, and White in favor and Regents Ilitch and
Newman opposed.
Proposed Ann Arbor General Fund Operating Budget for FY 2010-2011
Regent White moved approval of the proposed Ann Arbor General Fund
operating budget for FY 2010-2011. Regent Maynard seconded the motion and it was
approved, with Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Richner, Taylor, and White in favor
and Regents Ilitch and Newman opposed.
Proposed Ann Arbor FY 2010-2011 Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Regent White moved approval of the proposed Ann Arbor FY 2010-2011
student tuition and fee rates. Regent Darlow seconded the motion and it was approved,
with Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Richner, Taylor, and White in favor and
Regents Ilitch and Newman opposed.
Proposed Dearborn Campus FY 2010-2011 General Fund Operating Budget
Chancellor Little stated that the Dearborn campus faces the same conditions and
constraints described by Provost Sullivan. He said that during the past eight years, the
campus has preserved its priorities of preserving academic quality, preserving access,
and maintaining an equitable and productive learning and working environment. The
current budget continues the pattern of cost reduction and budget reallocations that has
occurred during the past eight years. The budget calls for an increase of 8.1% in
financial aid and is premised on a 1.5% growth in credit hours. The recommended
tuition increase of 3.9% for undergraduate students and 2.9% for graduate students is
the lowest in five years.
Regent White moved approval of the proposed Dearborn campus FY 2010-2011
General Fund operating budget. Regent Darlow seconded the motion. Regent
Newman stated that the University of Michigan-Dearborn and University of Michigan-
Flint have fewer opportunities than the Ann Arbor campus does to increase revenue to
counter a budget gap, and they are very dependent on the General Fund. She pointed
out that neither campus receives any funding from the Ann Arbor campus, and they are
to be commended for their efforts in developing a prudent budget. The vote was then
taken and the motion was approved, with Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White in favor, and Regent Ilitch opposed.
Proposed Dearborn Campus FY 2010-11 Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Regent White moved approval of the proposed Dearborn campus FY 2010-11
student tuition and fee rates. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was

327






﻿June Meeting, 2010

approved, with Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and
White in favor, and Regent Ilitch opposed.
Regent Newman left the meeting at that point.
Proposed Flint Campus FY 2010-2011 General Fund Operating Budget
Chancellor Person reported that the University of Michigan-Flint budget of
about $88 million assumes undergraduate and graduate enrollment increases of 4.0%
and 4.8%, respectively, and a 5.9% increase in institutional financial aid, which is 2%
above the combined tuition and fee increase. It assumes a state appropriation of
approximately $20.8 million; however, if that appropriation is significantly reduced or
there is a mid-year rescission, she might request a mid-year tuition increase. She noted
that the campus had been working aggressively at cost containment, particularly in the
area of energy savings. The proposed tuition increase is 3.9% for undergraduates and
2.9% for graduate students.
Regent Maynard moved approval of the proposed Flint campus FY 2010-2011
General Fund operating budget. Regent White seconded the motion, and it was
approved, with Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Richner, Taylor, and White in favor,
and Regent Ilitch opposed.
Proposed Flint Campus FY 2010-2011 Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Regent Maynard moved approval of FY 2010-2011 tuition and fee rates for the
Flint campus of 3.9% for resident undergraduate students and 2.9% for graduate
students. Regent White seconded the motion and it was approved, with Regents
Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Richner, Taylor, and White in favor, and Regent Ilitch
opposed.
2010-2011 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
Vice President Harper reported that the proposed amount of each fee is that
same as it was in 2010. On a motion by Regent Darlow, seconded by Regent Maynard,
the regents unanimously approved the following fees for 2010-2011: $7.19 per student
per term for Michigan Student Assembly, $6.00 per student per term for Student Legal
Services, and $1.50 per student per term for school/college governments.
2010-2011 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Harper stated that due to the efforts of the University Health
Service leadership and staff, the recommended University Health Service fee of
$171.20 per student per term is the same as it was for 2009-2010. On a motion by
Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved a
University Health Service fee of $171.20 per student per term for 2010-2011.
Proposed FY 2011 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers
(UMHHC) Operating Budget
Mr. Doug Strong, chief executive officer of the UMHHC, presented the
proposed FY 2011 UMHHC operating budget. He said that the Health System strives
to keep six elements in balance as an organization: financial success, quality and
safety, being a provider of choice, being an employer of choice, providing benefit to the

328






﻿June Meeting, 2010

community, and preparing for the future. He reported that all six elements are currently
in balance and are moving forward. The UMHHC is the only health care provider in
Michigan that saw patients from every county in the state in FY 2010. Mr. Strong
emphasized that activity continued to increase in all areas in FY 2010, and the FY 2011
plan calls for continuing, though smaller increases. He noted that 21 additional beds
opened in 2009-2010, and the new children's and women's hospital would add
significant capacity when it opens in 2011.
Mr. Strong reviewed the challenges and risks inherent in the FY 2011 budget.
These include the slow economic recovery and its effect on uncompensated care,
market consolidation, and the impact of the state budget on the Medicaid program. The
impact of national healthcare reform legislation, which will play out over the next ten
years, will require increased attention to quality and efficiency in order to keep pace
with the expectations of healthcare reform.
Mr. Strong displayed a slide illustrating operating revenues and expenses. The
operating margin in FY 2009 was 1.9%, and the FY 2010 margin forecast of $66
million is 3.3%, which is above budget, largely due to productivity increases. For FY
2011, the budgeted operating margin is 4.0%, or $83 million, based on operating
revenues of $2.089 billion and total expenses of $1.995 billion. He pointed out that this
is the first year that the UMHHC will exceed $2 billion in operating revenues.
Operating margin funds will provide cash to invest in future facilities, information
technology needs, and the Health System's research and education missions.
Mr. Strong concluded by reporting that the Health System remains financially
strong. Continued improvement should be expected in patient care quality and safety,
patient satisfaction, faculty and staff satisfaction, and financial performance.
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Richner, the regents
unanimously approved the proposed FY 2011 University of Michigan Hospitals and
Health Centers' operating budget.
FY 2011 University of Michigan Department of Athletics Operating Budget
Mr. David Brandon, Donald R. Shepherd Director of Athletics, reported that the
Athletic Department's budget surplus of $4.7 million for FY 2011 is sufficient to
sustain healthy operating margins. The budget includes a $4.5 million allowance for
deferred maintenance. The budget assumes no further improvement in premium seat
commitments, leaving an opportunity to add an additional $4.4 million in revenue. Mr.
Brandon reported that the department is in a sound financial position, with $35 million
in unrestricted operating reserves, an endowment balance of about $56 million, and a
deferred maintenance fund balance or $4.9 million. Total debt will increase to $215
million to cover the Player Development Center and Crisler Arena projects.
The FY 2010-2011 budget calls for revenues of $105,038,000 and expenses of
$100,307,000, yielding an operating surplus of $4,731,000. The balance sheet indicates
that total net assets have increased consistently since 2002, due to continued operating
surpluses, net investment income, gifts, and the fact that investment in net assets has
been equal to or more than depreciation.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted 5 faculty retirement
memoirs.
Robert A. Bender, Ph.D., professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental
biology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty
status on May 31, 2010.
Professor Bender received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1968 and 1976, respectively, and his M.S. degree from the
University of Maine in 1972. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
assistant professor in 1978, and was promoted to associate professor in 1984 and
professor in 1991.
Professor Bender's research focused on the regulation of microbial nitrogen
metabolism. He studied how bacteria can sense the presence of nitrogen-containing
compounds and then choose the most effective among them for degradation and
conversion into cellular material. His work on these central metabolic pathways
received continuous extramural funding for over 30 years, yielded more than 60
research publications, and earned him fellowships from the American Cancer Society
and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. Professor Bender served as a full
member of several NIH study sections between 1998 and 2008 and was editor of the
journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology from 1987-96. He was elected to the
American Academy of Microbiology in 1994.
An active and successful educator, Professor Bender taught a variety of courses
in molecular biology and microbiology as well as a highly successful course for non-
scientists, "AIDS and Other Health Crises." He mentored ten Ph.D. students and five
postdoctoral fellows, and was director of the graduate program in cell and molecular
biology from 1992-96. Professor Bender was a founding faculty member of the
Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology when it was
established in 2001, and served the department as associate chair for undergraduate
studies from 2005-08.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Robert A. Bender professor emeritus of molecular, cellular, and
developmental biology.
Edwin M. Curley, Ph.D., James B. and Grace J. Nelson Professor of
Philosophy and professor of philosophy, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2010.
Professor Curley received his B.A. degree from Lafayette College in 1959, and
his Ph.D. degree from Duke University in 1963. Between 1963 and 1993, he was a
faculty member at San Jose State University, Australian National University,
Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as a professor of philosophy in 1993. He was appointed
the James B. and Grace J. Nelson Professor of Philosophy in 1999, and reappointed in
2004 and 2009.
Professor Curley is best known for his work on Spinoza, including two seminal
books, Spinoza's Metaphysics (1969) and Behind the Geometrical Method (1988), and

347






﻿June Meeting, 2010

a new edition and translation of Spinoza's collected works. He is also the author of
Descartes Against the Skeptics (1978) and a new edition of Hobbes' Leviathan (1994),
and has published articles on Locke, Montaigne, Montesquieu, the philosophy of
religion, and the history of religious toleration. Professor Curley taught undergraduate
and graduate courses in early modem philosophy, graduate seminars on the history of
religious toleration, and a popular undergraduate course on the philosophy of religion.
He is a past president of the American Philosophical Association, a member of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a recipient of fellowships from the
National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute for Advanced Studies at
Princeton, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the National Humanities Center.

David F. Dolan, Ph.D., research associate professor in the Kresge Hearing
Research Institute, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Medical School, will retire
from active faculty status on June 30, 2010.
Professor Dolan received his B.A. degree from Indiana University in 1972 and
his Ph.D. degree from the University of Florida in 1983. Following a postdoctoral
fellowship at the University of Michigan's Kresge Hearing Research Institute from
1983-86, he joined the faculty as a research investigator in 1986. He was promoted to
assistant research scientist in 1992 and associate research scientist in 2001, and was
appointed research associate professor in 2003.
Professor Dolan's research involves defining the normal mechanisms involved
in sensory transduction of hearing. This basic understanding of normal sensory
transduction is fundmental to understanding the causes of hearing loss, presbycusis, and
tinnitus. His research efforts resulted in 65 journal publications, 11 book chapters, and
137 abstract presentations. Professor Dolan's research on efferent effects on cochlear
physiology, funded by the National Institutes of Health, improved our understanding of
how signals returning from the brain help to fine tune sound processing in the inner ear.
With his collaborators, both within the University of Michigan and at other institutions,
he has played an important role in characterizing the physiological correlates of a
variety of mouse strains with gene mutations that affect hearing.
Professor Dolan has served as a grant reviewer for governmental funding
agencies and has been a peer manuscript reviewer for several scientific journals.
Within the Kresge Hearing Research Institute, he played a critical role in transitioning
the institute's research model from a strain of guinea pigs that carry a virus that blocks
genetic mechanisms of restoring hearing to newly derived strains that are free of the
virus. This transition was of major importance for many studies being carried out at the
University of Michigan.
The Regents now salute this distinguished researcher for his dedicated service
by naming David F. Dolan research associate professor emeritus.
David E. Schteingart, M.D., professor of internal medicine, Medical School,

Charles F. Yocum, Ph.D., the Alfred S. Sussman Distinguished University
Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, professor of molecular,
cellular, and developmental biology, and professor of chemistry, College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2010.
Professor Yocum earned his B.S. degree from Iowa State University in 1963,
his M.S. degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1968, and his Ph.D. degree
from  Indiana University in 1971.  Following post-doctoral training at Cornell
University, he joined the University of Michigan faculty as assistant professor in 1973,

appointed the Alfred S. Sussman Collegiate Professor of Biology in 1998 and the
Alfred S. Sussman Distinguished University Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and
Developmental Biology in 2004.
Professor Yocum's research in molecular bioenergetics involves characterizing
the oxygen evolution reaction catalyzed by a photosynthetic enzyme, called photosystem
II, in plants and algae. He was the first to isolate the enzyme in pure, highly active form.
He then exploited this breakthrough to identify the inorganic ion cofactors of the reaction,
and to determine the functions of several of the proteins that make up the enzyme. His
method for the isolation of this enzyme was employed by many other groups, and has
served as the basis for numerous advancements in our understanding of the structure and
operation of the photosynthetic apparatus.
Professor Yocum taught introductory to graduate level courses in both biology
and chemistry. He chaired the Department of Biology from 1985-91, chaired the

349






﻿June Meeting, 2010

committee that formulated the current biochemistry concentration, and was an
undergraduate concentration advisor. Professor Yocum received numerous honors,
including the Henry Russel Award (1978) and the Margaret and Herbert Sokol Faculty
Award in the Sciences (1999). Professor Yocum is a fellow of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated

Professor Emeritus of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, professor
emeritus of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, and professor emeritus of
chemistry.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted a memorial statement for
Traianos Gagos, professor of papyrology and Greek, assistant research scientist, and
archivist.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Traianos Gagos, Ph.D., professor of papyrology and Greek and assistant
research scientist in the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts; and archivist in the University Library. Professor Gagos died on
April 24, 2010 at the age of 49.
Professor Gagos received his B.A. degree from the University of Ioannina,
Greece, in 1983, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Durham, England, in
1987. After one year as a British Academy visiting assistant research scientist at
Durham, he came to Michigan as a visiting assistant professor and visiting assistant
research scientist in 1988. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1991 as an
associate archivist of papyrology in the University Library, and was promoted to
archivist in 1997. He was appointed assistant professor in 1994 and assistant research
scientist in the Kelsey Museum in 1995, and was promoted to associate professor in
1999, and professor in 2008.
Professor Gagos was an outstanding teacher of Modem Greek, and was
instrumental in creating and building that program, which is now a concentration in the
College of LS&A. He was greatly respected throughout the Greek community of
southeastern Michigan. As archivist, he was a leader in making papyrology and the
Michigan collection accessible not only to scholars, but to students and the general
public, particularly through technology. Especially in his work on the carbonized
papyri from Petra, he demonstrated exceptional skill in deciphering damaged texts and
interpreting them in their historical contexts. In all his activities, he brought disparate
groups and disciplines together. His leadership was recognized by his service as
president of the American Society of Papyrologists.
Professor Gagos was a beloved mentor to undergraduate and graduate students
in classical studies, the Interdepartmental Program in Classical Art and Archaeology,
the Interdepartmental Program in Greek and Roman History, Modem Greek, History,
and Near Eastern Studies. He will be greatly missed at Michigan and around the world.
As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our sincere condolences
to his wife, Gina, and members of his family.
Degrees. There are no actions with respect to degrees this month.

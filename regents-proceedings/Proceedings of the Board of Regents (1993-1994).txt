University of Michigan Solar Car Team
President Duderstadt announced that on June 26, 1993, the University of
Michigan Solar Car Team had won the national championship in Sunrayce 93.
He complimented the team on this accomplishment and then called on Regent
McFee, who offered the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan wish to commend the
University of Michigan Solar Car Team for their extraordinary success
in winning the national championship in Sunrayce 93, a solar car race
from Arlington, Texas, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, for North American
colleges and universities.
The team which raised the necessary funding and designed and
built the solar car consisted of over 100 students from across the
campus, including the College of Engineering, School of Business
Administration, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and the
School of Art.
The race team, consisting of 21 key students, was faced with many
challenges, including the fact that they were considered the defending
champions by virtue of the first place finish of the 1990 solar car team
in the inaugural solar car race, Sunrayce 90. This year's team also had
to compete against 35 other teams, 20 of which were seasoned veterans
of Sunrayce 90.
The team successfully defended its crown by placing first in the
overall competition in spite of disputed penalties and cloudy weather.
The team strategy, teamwork, and a well-designed and reliable car were
the key factors in their successful demonstration of academic excellence
put into practice.
The Regents salute the 1993 Solar Car Team for their victory in
Sunrayce 93 and wish them continued success when they compete in the
World Solar Challenge in Australia in November of this year.
The motion was approved by acclamation, and there followed a round of
applause. The president recognized several members of the team who were in
attendance. Team leader Furqan Nazeeri accepted the resolution on behalf of the


2




July Meeting, 1993


team and spoke of the team's hopes for winning the world championship later in
the year.
1993-94 General Fund Operating Budget and Student Fees, Ann Arbor
Campus
President Duderstadt called on Provost Whitaker to present the proposed
1993-94 General Fund Operating Budget.
Provost Whitaker reviewed the underlying principals, long-term goals, and
short-term objectives used in preparing the 1993-94 budget. The objectives were
to provide a significant merit increase program, to meet increases in fixed costs,
to provide resources for the highest academic priorities, to maintain and enhance
access, to reinvest in the physical infrastructure, and to insure against forecasting errors in budgeted revenue. Provost Whitaker described the four sources of
General Fund revenues as being state appropriation, tuition and fees, indirect
cost recovery, and investment income. The 1993-94 budget calls for a zero increase in state appropriation, an increase of $26.0 million in tuition and fees, an
increase of $11.4 million in indirect cost recovery, and $0.4 million in other income. He noted that the indirect cost recovery rate had been increased from the
previous year and complimented the faculty for the increase in funded grants
and contracts that had led to the increase in that category. The budget also proposes a $50/term increase in the infrastructure maintenance fee, to yield an increase of $4.3 million. The total increase in General Fund revenue is $41.6
million, or 6.6 percent.
Provost Whitaker pointed out that the proportion of General Fund revenue
funded by state appropriation versus tuition and fees has gone from nearly 80
percent in the early 1960s to under 40 percent at the current time. The president
pointed out that publicly-funded institutions in 36 states had experienced a decrease in state appropriation last year, and he credited the Michigan legislature
for protecting its higher education budget from this situation. Regent Baker
observed that the reason tuition keeps rising is because the state has failed to
maintain the historic level of funding over the past 30 years.
Provost Whitaker credited the faculty for the projected increase in the
indirect cost recovery portion of the budget for 1993-94. He pointed out some
specific efforts that individual units are undertaking to contain costs and make
funds available for innovation through substitution. He noted that a compensation program was the highest budget priority for 1993-94 and complimented the
faculty and staff for having done an outstanding job in the face of no salary
increase in 1992-93.
Provost Whitaker then described the FY 1993-94 planned incremental
expenditures of $41.6 million as follows: compensation, $16.1 million; fixed cost
increases, $5.1 million; student financial aid, $8.8 million; new academic initiatives and other critical academic needs, $5.2 million; "pass-through" revenue,
$3.0 million; and the infrastructure maintenance fee, $3.5 million. To achieve an
adequate compensation increase, he noted that unit budgets had been increased
by 2.5 percent, staff benefits funding had been increased by $5.0 million, and


3




July Meeting, 1993


that units had been requested to make additional reallocations to permit further
increases in compensation.
The provost reiterated the University's policy of meeting the demonstrated
financial need of all regularly enrolled Michigan resident undergraduate students. He displayed a chart indicating that the outcome of this policy is that the
percentage of admitted freshmen who enroll by parental income is fairly even
across income classes, meaning that enrollment is independent of family income
for resident undergraduate students.
The proposed undergraduate tuition increases are 9.5 percent for residents
and 6.9 percent for nonresidents. For graduate students, the increase is 6.9 percent for both residents and nonresidents.
Regent Baker argued that the infrastructure maintenance fee ought to be
folded in with the tuition and fee increase figures to more clearly indicate the
total increased cost to students, noting that there is no assurance that the
infrastructure maintenance fee will actually be used for its stated purpose.
Regent Power commented that maintaining buildings and classrooms is a
responsibility of stewardship, and that the expanded fee is needed and will be
used to do this. He argued that it is appropriate to break down the various fees
charged to students according to their intended purpose, rather than combining
them into one sum, as suggested by Regent Baker.
In response to a question from Regent McFee, Provost Whitaker stated that
the approximate yearly cost for an undergraduate resident student, including
room and board and other expenses, is $11,200. He displayed charts showing
that for Michigan resident undergraduates, the University's two-term tuition
increase of $514 is the lowest of any other top ranking university nationally, as is
the total tuition cost for a Michigan first-year undergraduate at the same top
universities.
1993-94 UM-Dearborn General Fund Budget/Student Fee Rates
Chancellor Renick observed that tuition and fees and state appropriation
comprise 97.0 percent of the General Fund budget at UM-Dearborn. The proposed 1993-94 incremental budget of $2,040,000 provides for a salary program of
approximately 4.5 percent and for strengthening and broadening certain instructional programs. He stated that reallocation discussions are underway for the
1994-95 fiscal year, although it should be noted that a high percentage of the
budget is spent on teaching.
The incremental budget, to be funded by a 9.5 percent tuition increase, will
fund a salary program ($1,252,000), faculty promotions ($26,000), fringe benefits
($335,000), academic programs ($262,000), student financial aid ($145,000), and
a UM cost allocation increase ($20,000).
1993-94 UM-Flint General Fund Budget/Student Fee Rates
Chancellor Jones observed that the General Fund budget at UM-Flint is
comprised solely of tuition and fees and state appropriations. Given no increase


4




July Meeting, 1993


in the latter category, the proposed incremental budget must be funded almost
entirely with tuition increases. The proposed student fee increase of 8.5 percent
will yield $1,259,500, and a 5.0 percent internal reallocation will yield $628,950,
for a total incremental budget of $1,888,450.
Incremental expenditures include a 3.0 percent salary program ($692,000)
(following an inflationary increase was given in 1992-93); staff benefits increases
($200,000); student aid ($128,600), library/Central Energy Plant debt retirement
($200,000), and programmatic initiatives ($667,850).
Chancellor Jones noted that one of the continuing challenges of his
administration has been in the area of facilities development. He observed that
major new facilities, including the central energy plant and the new library, have
been funded entirely by private funding. However, because the University is not
receiving any state support for these facilities, it is required to fund the debt service on them. Chancellor Jones reported that he was planning to speak out about
the state's new policy of not providing operating funds for self-liquidating facilities, as this has a devastating impact on the Flint campus. He said that when an
institution raises money from private sources to fund a core facility, it is inequitable when the institution is penalized by not receiving state support for operations expenses.
In the discussion that followed, Regents Brown and Varner stated that they
would support the proposed tuition increase because the University has done the
very best it can do to maintain itself as one of the state's greatest assets in the
face of no increase in state support. President Duderstadt said that he is proud of
the combination of access and quality that the University of Michigan has been
able to maintain in the face of increasing financial constraints, especially when
compared with other state-supported institutions nation-wide.
Regent Deitch observed that Board members' responsibility for stewardship
over the institution requires that they be absolutely certain they are doing the
right thing. He believes that only the Regents have the independence to make
this type of judgment. He suggested that the Regents should be tough managers;
should insist on productivity, efficiency, lack of waste, and modesty in the
economic arena; should never be afraid to ask tough questions and should insist
on excellence. The Regents should think strategically. They should insist on
access and should be compassionate and caring and insist on a diverse and
inclusive community that welcomes all of its members. Finally, Regents should
be "tireless cheerleaders for the University of Michigan," which includes participating in the capital campaign, listening to the needs of the community, and supporting the administration in its efforts to maintain and enhance the institution.
Weighing the budget presentation against these values, Regent Deitch stated that
the only choice is to support the budget.
Regent Baker observed that the Regents have an obligation to control the
costs of education to the extent they can, and this can only be done by limiting
the number of dollars that are available. For this reason, he did not intend to
support the proposed tuition increase.


5




July Meeting, 1993


Regent McFee stated that she agreed with the principles outlined by Regent
Deitch. The public needs to be assured that the Regents recognize their
responsibilities and are doing everything possible to control costs, and the measures outlined by the administration demonstrate that this is being done.
The president noted that the Regents have a responsibility to serve people
for today and at the same time preserve the institution so that it can continue to
serve future generations.
Regent McGowan expressed agreement with the previous sentiments and
added that the chancellors of the Flint and Dearborn campuses deserve equal
recognition for their budget preparations. Regent Power agreed that due to past
and present good management practices at the University, the Regents are in a
position of being able to exercise their responsibilities with relative comfort compared with what is the case at other institutions.
There being no further comments, Regent Brown moved approval of the
General Fund operating budgets and student fee rates for 1993-94 for all three
campuses. Regent Waters seconded the motion, and it was approved, with Regents Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor and
Regent Baker opposed.
Regent Power observed that the decline in state support of higher education,
which has resulted in increased reliance on tuition, indicates a significant public
policy change, and this pattern is being repeated in public universities throughout the country. The general response has been to tighten expenses where possible and to increase tuition. But he cautioned that we can't keep doing this
indefinitely, and therefore more fundamental restructuring issues need to be examined. He suggested that the University should begin to look at the roles, missions, costs, and revenues associated with being a great public university.
There followed a ten-minute break at 10:55 a.im
The Regents reconvened at 11:05 a.m.
Minutes
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved the minutes of the meeting of June 1993.
Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports of investments, plant extension,
litigation, personnel-labor relations, and noncompetitive purchases over $2,000.
Vice President Kelly submitted reports of projects established and summaries of
a selection of current research.
Voluntary Support
The report of voluntary support for the month of June will be included in
the September agenda.

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
voted unanimously to adopt the following retirement memoirs:
Janice A. Clark, associate professor of music (music education) in the
School of Music and lecturer in education in the School of Education, retired
from active faculty status on May 31, 1993.
Professor Clark was born and raised in Canton, Ohio, where she was active
in public school music programs. She continued her studies at Westminster
Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey, where she graduated with her B.M. degree in 1951. She taught music at the Charles Ellis School for Girls in Pennsylvania from 1951-54; concurrently, she served as the organist-choir director at
Marple Presbyterian Church in Bromall, Pennsylvania. In 1954, Professor Clark
journeyed west to enroll as a graduate student at the University of Michigan,


14




July Meeting, 1993


where she received her M.Mus. degree in 1956. In 1955, she began an association
with the Dixboro Methodist Church as organist (later director of music) that
extends to the present. Following completion of her graduate studies, Professor
Clark became a consultant in elementary vocal music for the Livonia Public
Schools. She was appointed to the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer
(music education) in 1958, was promoted to assistant professor in 1962, and to
associate professor in 1969.
An active participant in music educators' associations at state and national
levels, Professor Clark has been especially energetic as a traveler to International
Society of Music Education meetings in Perth (1974), Montreux (1976), Warsaw
(1980), and Bristol (1982).
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Janice A Clark associate professor emerita of music (music education) and lecturer emeritus in
education.
Louis A. Ferman, professor of social work in the School of Social Work
and co-divisional director and research scientist in the Institute of Labor and
Industrial Relations, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1993.
Professor Ferman received his B.A degree from Brown University in 1952,
his M.A degree from Boston University in 1953, and his Ph.D. degree in sociology and industrial relations from Cornell University in 1961. He served as an
instructor and research associate at Wayne State University from 1957-63 and
joined the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations (ILIR) at the University of
Michigan as a research associate in 1959. He was named research director of
ILIR in 1965 and associate professor of social work in 1966. He was promoted to
professor of social work in 1969 and named divisional director (later, codivisional director) of ILIR in 1971. He received his appointment as research
scientist in 1988.
Since 1961, Professor Ferman's research has focused on the human problems of industrial societies. His research interests have included coping with
unemployment, plant shutdowns, manpower development, participative management, joint union-management training, and the informal ("off-the-books") economy. Regarded as the "father of informal economy research," Professor Ferman
has lectured, conducted seminars, and consulted both here and abroad on a wide
range of industrial topics. His publications include Poverty in America, Negroes
and Jobs, Job Development for the Hard-to-Employ, and Work Beyond Employment in Advanced Societies.
Professor Ferman is widely known in corporate, union, and legislative circles concerned with the development of industrial policy. Recently, he has been
involved in practical problems in economic development, such as career development of women in Third World countries, and the development of free markets
in eastern Europe.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Louis A Ferman
professor emeritus of social work and research scientist emeritus.
Warren E. Miller, research scientist in the Center for Political Studies at
the Institute for Social Research, and adjunct professor of political science in the


15




July Meeting, 1993


College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on
April 30, 1993.
Professor Miller received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of
Oregon in 1948 and 1950, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from Syracuse University in 1954. He came to the University of Michigan in 1951 as an assistant
study director in the Survey Research Center and was promoted to study director
in 1953. From 1954-56, he was an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley. He returned to the University of Michigan in 1956 as an
assistant professor of political science and research associate in the Survey
Research Center. He was promoted to associate professor in 1958, to research
scientist in 1959, and to professor in 1963. He was named the Arthur W.
Bromage Professor of Political Science in 1981. Since 1982, he has been a professor of political science at Arizona State University.
Professor Miller has done pioneering research in electoral and political
behavior, focusing on democratic processes and how to enhance them. His
frequently-cited works time and again have set the direction for the field. At the
University of Michigan, Professor Miller founded the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research in 1962, the Center for Political Studies in
1970, and the American National Election Study in 1977. He served as executive
director of the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research
until 1970, director of the Center for Political Studies until 1981, and principal
investigator of the American National Election Studies through April 10, 1993.
Among Professor Miller's many honors are his election as a fellow of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1977) and as a fellow of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (1984). He was awarded an honorary
Doctor of Philosophy degree by the University of Goteborg in 1972, and received
the University of Michigan Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award in 1977.
He served as president of the American Political Science Association in 1979-80.
The Regents now salute this distinguished political scientist for his dedicated service by naming Warren E. Miller research scientist emeritus.
Rosemary A. Sarr, professor of social work in the School of Social Work
and faculty associate in the Center for Political Studies, Institute for Social
Research, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1993, after 34 years of
service to the University of Michigan.
Professor Sarri obtained her B.A degree from the University of Minnesota
in 1946, her M.S.W. degree from the University of Minnesota in 1955, and her
Ph.D. degree in social work and sociology from the University of Michigan in
1962. After gaining several years of professional experience in the field, Professor
Sarri joined the faculty of the University of Michigan School of Social Work in
1959 as a lecturer. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1962, associate
professor in 1964, and professor in 1966.
Scholars and professional practitioners the world over consider Professor
Sarri to be a leading expert in the areas of child/family welfare policy and juvenile
and criminal justice systems. Most recently, she has collaborated with universities in Australia and Korea on the topics of child welfare and adoption and was
appointed by the minister of education to the Russian Social Welfare


16




July Meeting, 1993

social work education programs in Russia.
Professor Sarri has done extensive research and published widely on public
policy issues related to families, children, women, and justice systems. She has
also served the School of Social Work, the University, and many government
agencies through her extensive committee, consulting, and community activities.
Her teaching has been inspirational and her mentorship of students noteworthy.
Her retirement marks the departure of an esteemed member of the faculty of the
School of Social Work who has been devoted to the improvement of social welfare
systems.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Rosemary A Sarri
professor emerita of social work.

On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents

RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AMENDING RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE AND DELIVERY
OF HOUSING REVENUE BONDS SERIES 1993A AND
PROVIDING FOR OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO
WHEREAS, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer") adopted on April 16,
1993 a "Resolution of the Regents of the University of Michigan Authorizing the Issuance and
Delivery of Housing Revenue Bonds, Series 1993A and Providing for Other Matters Relating
Thereto" (the "Resolution"), which Resolution provided for the issuance and delivery of Housing
Revenue Bonds, Series 1993A (the "Bonds") for the purpose of providing funds to pay part of the
costs of the Project (as defined in the Resolution), refunding the Issuer's outstanding Prior Bonds
(as defined in the Resolution), to fund a debt service reserve fund for the Bonds, and to pay
certain costs incurred in connection with the issuance and sale of the Bonds and the refunding,
and
WHEREAS, it is now appropriate to amend the Resolution to permit the Issuer to covenant in the Indenture (as defined in the Resolution) to use Legally Available Funds of the Issuer
to pay debt service on the Bonds in the event the Net Revenues of the System are insufficient
therefor,
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. The Resolution is hereby amended as follows:
The first paragraph of Section 2 of the Resolution is hereby amended to read as follows:
'"The Bonds shall be limited and not general obligations of the Issuer payable from and
equally and ratably secured by an irrevocable pledge of the Net Revenues (as shall be defined in
the Indenture) of the University's Housing System (as shall be described and defined in the
Indenture) and moneys from time to time on deposit in certain of the funds created pursuant to
the Indenture. The lien created by the Indenture on the portion of the Net Revenues previously
pledged for debt service on the Prior Bonds shall be subordinated to the liens thereon securing
the Prior Bonds until the respective related issues of the Prior Bonds are defeased or paid. The
Authorized Officers, or either of them, are authorized, if appropriate, to renegotiate the security
for any of the Prior Bonds listed on Exhibit A, to place it on a parity with the Bonds authorized
hereby. The Issuer may also covenant in the Indenture, in addition to other requirements, that
the Issuer shall use Legally Available Funds, as shall be defined in the Indenture, to pay debt
service on the Bonds in the event the Net Revenues of the System are insufficient therefor.


18

International Common Stock Management for University Endowment
Fund
Regent Power moved, Regent Brown seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved Emerging Markets Investments, L.P., as a vehicle for making

Endowment Advisors is the companion organization to the Common Fund
that organizes investments for educational institutions in assets other than marketable securities, and Fairfield Partners, Inc., is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Endowment Advisors. Fairfield Partners is the general partner of and exercises
policy control over Emerging Markets Investments. Because Vice President

this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contracts (partnership agreement) will be the University of
Michigan and Emerging Markets Investments, L.P.
2.   The duration of the contract with Emerging Markets Investments, L.P., will be

Vice President Farris W. Womack or a University representative will attend
meetings of the boards and related committees, as had been the case prior to Dr.
Womack's service on the boards.
3.  Vice President Womack has no pecuniary interest in these contracts. For
Emerging Markets Investments, L.P., Fairfield Partners will receive no management fee, but will receive a two percent interest in the profits and losses of
the partnership.

Purchasing Contract between the University of Michigan and Rebus
Planning Associates, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved a purchasing contract between the University of Michigan and Rebus Planning Associates, Inc. Because the owner of Rebus Planning
Associates, Inc., Samuel J. Meisels, is also a University employee, this contract
falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the purchase contract will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and Rebus Planning Associates, Inc.
2.  The terms of the contract to support three University of Michigan research

5 participants at Work Sampling Training ($2,000).
3.  Dr. Meisels' pecuniary interest arises from his position as owner of Rebus Planning Associates, Inc..
Purchasing Contract between the University of Michigan and Gini
Associates
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a purchasing contract between the University of


20




July Meeting, 1993


Michigan and Gini Associates. Because John H. Romani, senior associate at Gini
Associates who would be providing the services, is also a University employee,
this contract falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the purchase contract will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and Gini Associates.
2.   The terms of the contract to support the leadership seminar to be held at the

3.   Dr. Romani has no pecuniary interest in Gini Associates. He is employed by
Gini as an independent contractor.
Agreement between the University of Michigan and Process Biotechnology, Inc. (PBI)
Regent Brown moved, Regent Waters seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved an agreement between the University of Michigan and Process
Biotechnology, Inc., for conducting a research project under the direction of
Louis Tsui at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Because the president of
PBI, Henry Yee-Neen Wang, is both a 50 percent shareholder in PBI and a
University employee, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  PBI has provided a letter agreement to the Regents of the University of Michigan authorizing funding for this project.
2.   The agreement will provide $3,000, representing one-half (1/2) month salary

3.   Dr. Wang's stock ownership is his sole pecuniary interest in this project. He will
not be compensated by the University for any activity associated with this project.

1993
Vice President Womack informed the Regents of the sale of $10,480,000
Parking System Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 1993, as described in the
Regents Communication.

and Environment Executive Committee)
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved a change in the Regents' Bylaws regarding the School of
Natural Resources and Environment Executive Committee. The change reduces
the period of ineligibility for reappointment to the executive committee from two


21




July Meeting, 1993

reappointment until after the lapse of one year. The governing faculty is authorized to
arrange for students, not more than two in number, selected in accordance with procedures and for terms approved by the governing faculty, to participate in meetings of the
executive committee in an advisory capacity.
Revision of Regents' Bylaw Sections 11.151, 11.151A, and 11.151B (University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board)
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved revisions to Regents' Bylaw Sections 11.151 and 11.151A
and deletion of Regents' Bylaw Section 11.151B, to make the Regents' Bylaws
consistent with actions taken by the Regents at the meeting of November 1992.
The following is the revised text of Regents' Bylaw Sections 11.151 and 11.151A:

In carrying out the above delegated powers, the executive board of the University
of Michigan Hospitals will submit periodic reports to the president and the Board of
Regents. The executive board shall submit its minutes to members of the Board of
Regents.
Sec. 11.151B.   The University of Michigan Hospitals Public Advisory
Board
(Section 11:151B deleted)
In response to a comment that had been made by a speaker at the previousday's public comment session, Regent Power asked for further information about
how Medical Service Plan rates are set and the impact of this on the Regents'
Bylaws.
Medical Staff Appointments
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Waters, and on the recommendation of the UM      Hospitals Executive Board, the Regents unanimously
approved several appointments to medical staff membership.
Resolution in Honor of Vice President William            Kelly
The president called on Regent Varner, who read the following resolution on
behalf of the Board:
Regents' Resolution.
The Regents of the University happily salute and commend
William C. Kelly, who is concluding an extraordinary career as faculty
member, author, researcher, administrator, problem solver, and finally
as vice president for research at the University of Michigan.
Dr. Kelly received his Ph.D. degree at Columbia University in
1954. After a brief stint in the U.S. Army, he joined the faculty at the
University of Michigan as an instructor in 1956. He quickly rose
through the professorial ranks, carrying a full teaching load while
managing an active research program that resulted in numerous
writings on the geochemistry and mineralogy of economic mineral
deposits around the world, including the well-known          deposits in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. He has served on scores of national


23




July Meeting, 1993


scientific panels and in 1991 was awarded the gold medal of the
International Society of Economic Geologists for his "unusually
original work in the earth sciences."
Bill's University accolades include the Distinguished Service
Award (1961) and the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award
(1985). He was named the C. Scott Turner Distinguished Professor in
Geological Sciences in 1983. His outstanding academic career has been
peppered with administrative chores which he carried off with great
distinction: chair of the Geology Department from 1978-81, interim
director of the Institute of Science and Technology in 1986, associate
vice president (1989), interim vice president (1990), and finally, vice
president for research from September 1990 to the present.
In all of these administrative posts, Bill Kelly had the nose of a
trouble-shooter. He took on the knottiest of problems and engineered
solutions that will serve the University for years to come. And perhaps
his crowning achievement was to see the University's federal research
volume become the largest in the nation.
The Regents acknowledge with deep appreciation the lifetime of
service that this distinguished scientist has given the University. Bill
and his wife Anna have left indelible marks on the life of this University
with their gracious leadership and good humor. The Regents wish them
all the best and thank them for having served so long and so well. The
sign that will hang on Bill Kelly's office door come September 1 tells it
all: "Gone fishin'."
The resolution was adopted by acclamation, and there followed a round of
applause. Vice President Kelly responded that he appreciated the sentiments
expressed in the resolution and thanked the Board for the privilege of serving in
this position. He also thanked the executive officers and his staff for their dedicated service during his tenure.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting will be held on September 23 and 24, 1993. Regents' expenses for the
month of June 1993 totalled $4,240.50.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1993


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, September 23, 1993
The Regents assembled at 9:10 am. in the Regents' Room. Present were
Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters.
Vice President and Secretary Kennedy and Vice Presidents Hartford and
Womack were also present. President Duderstadt, Provost Whitaker, Chancellors
Jones and Renick, and Vice Presidents Cosovich and Neal were absent.
Regent Brown called the meeting to order and called on Regent Deitch, who
made the following motion:
Executive Session Motion
Pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended
by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed
session on September 23, 1993, at 10:00 a.m., for the purpose of
considering a periodic personnel evaluation of a person who has
requested confidentiality. Regent Varner seconded the motion, and it
was approved unanimously, after which the Regents immediately
met in closed session.
Public Comments
At 4:00 p.m., the Regents reassembled in the Anderson Room of the Michigan Union to hear Public Comments. All Regents were present.
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Marlon Ross, Anne Herrmann, Don Herzog, Van Harrison, and Virginia Gordan, faculty members, and Camille Brewer, student, in favor of revising
Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06 to include sexual orientation; James K. Huggins,
Heather Brunsink, Peter Payne, Meredith Uy, and Christine L. Chilimigras, students, against revising Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06 to include sexual orientation; and John Erwin Hunter, Sr., and John Erwin Hunter II, on Law School
admissions.
Friday, September 24, 1993
The Regents met at 9:00 am. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power,
Varner, and Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy,
and Vice Presidents Cosovich, Hartford, Neal, and Womack were also present, as
were Chancellors Jones and Renick.


25




September Meeting, 1993


President Duderstadt welcomed Vice President Neal to his first Regents'
Meeting. He then called on Regent Deitch.
Revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06
Regent Deitch stated that he was going to move revision of Regents' Bylaw
Section 14.06 by replacing it in its entirety, and that Regent McGowan would be
seconding the motion. Regent Varner then would be offering an amendment to
the motion.
Regent Deitch moved that Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06 be revised to read
as follows:
The University of Michigan is committed to a policy of
nondiscrimination and equal opportunity for all persons regardless
of race, sex, color, religion, creed, national origin or ancestry, age,
marital status, sexual orientation, disability, or Vietnam era veteran
status.
Further, he moved that:
"The sexual orientation provision of this policy shall not
prohibit the University from   maintaining relationships with
agencies of the federal government. Nothing in this action request
shall be deemed to limit rights and benefits which are currently
granted. Because the University wishes to study how particular
employment benefits, family housing, financial aid packages, and
student residency status would be affected by the addition of the
sexual orientation provision, that provision shall not apply to those
subjects at this time. Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06 will apply to
those subjects only after the president or his delegate determines,
following that study, how and to what degree the bylaw should
apply to those areas."
Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and Regent Deitch explained that
he and Regent McGowan had decided to cosponsor it for four reasons: 1) failure
of the University to move its institutional commitment to nondiscrimination for
the gay/lesbian community from the level of presidential policy to the Regents'
bylaw level implies that discrimination against these individuals is less significant than discrimination against others enumerated in the bylaw; 2) the issue is
one of campus climate in which students should be taught that people's lives are
private and that "all are welcome here: no ifs, ands, or buts"; 3) a truly serious
commitment to academic excellence means that we must stop devaluing distinguished members of our faculty, today; and 4) the plan, with its undertaking of a
study of how the bylaw will affect other aspects of University life such as staff
benefits and family housing, offers a sound and measured approach to change.
Regent Deitch stated that he was proud to be offering the motion, and following some comments describing his personal commitment to not countenancing discrimination against any group on the basis of status, he yielded the floor
to Regent McGowan. (A copy of Regent Deitch's prepared remarks is on file in
the Office of the Secretary of the University.)


26




September Meeting, 1993


Regent McGowan observed that it is a fact that many students, faculty, and
staff at the University are gay, lesbian, or bisexual. She noted that President
Shapiro had recognized this in 1984 by instituting the presidential policy protecting the gay community from discrimination, and that the Board of Regents had
affirmed that policy in 1988. But she noted that in the eyes of the University
community, it is the Regents who create the atmosphere for its campuses. Therefore, it is time for the Regents to say that its own bylaws protect every member of
its community from discrimination based on who they are, and to extend the protections of the bylaws to all.
Regent McGowan observed that over 150 other American public and private
colleges and universities, including Wayne State and Michigan State Universities, most other Big Ten universities, and many of our peer institutions had already subscribed to such a policy, as had prominent Americans such as Barry
Goldwater and Coretta Scott King. Most important, however, was the fact that
the University's own community had been urging the Regents to "end the pain
of omission of the members of the homosexual community o.. and to express our
commitment to nondiscrimination and equal opportunity," and that she believed
the Board was prepared to do so. She then yielded the floor to Regent Varner.
(The full text of Regent McGowan's remarks is on file in the Office of the Secretary of the University.)
Regent Varner stated that she fully supports the recommendation to change
the bylaw, noting that it had been part of the University's values since President
Shapiro's presidential policy on sexual orientation was proffered in the
mid-1980s. In recognition of the historical struggles at the University for equal
opportunities for minority and women students and faculty, she was offering the
following amendment to the language in Regent Deitch's motion to make it eminently clear that the Board would not be taking away the University's commitment to affirmative action:
"The University is also committed to compliance with all
applicable laws regarding nondiscrimination   and  affirmative
action."
Regent Brown supported the amendment.
President Duderstadt observed that the University had lagged behind many
other educational institutions in prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. Although the University had the presidential policy statement, the
absence of the statement in the Regents' Bylaws put valued members of the University community at some risk and sent a signal that gay, lesbian, and bisexuals
are less valued members of the campus community. He believed that their full
participation in the life of the University must be protected and reaffirmed. He
stated his belief that the change in the bylaw is necessary, is consistent with
Michigan's long tradition of full participation by all groups and individuals, that
it is simply the right thing to do, and that he supported it in the strongest possible terms. He then called on Provost Whitaker.


27




September Meeting, 1993


Provost Whitaker said that this disparity had been a subject of discussion
throughout his 15-year tenure as both dean and provost. A 1991 study of the climate for gays and lesbians at the University, conducted by the Affirmative Action
Office, had raised many important concerns about discrimination among the
deans. At that time, there was unanimous support among the deans that University policy should include nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
He had appointed a subcommittee of deans, chaired by Dean Bollinger of the
Law School, which had made the recommendation that Regents' Bylaw Section
14.06 should be revised to include sexual orientation, and that he fully supported
that recommendation. Furthermore, the deans and the faculty senate have indicated that the faculty also overwhelmingly supports revision of the bylaw.
Dean Bollinger reported that the deans unanimously support amending the
bylaw to include sexual orientation. Vice President Hartford stated that she personally supported the bylaw change, and that she and her staff, in their work
with the gay/lesbian/bisexual student community, have observed first hand the
need for this change. Furthermore, she had met with a wide variety of student
leaders who also all supported the proposed change.
Regent Baker expressed his views by reading from a prepared statement, a
copy of which is on file in the Office of the Secretary of the University. Regent
Baker recounted the history of efforts to include the phrase "sexual orientation"
in Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06, noting that it had been a contentious issue
since the group LaGROC first advocated for this in 1984. That effort had led to
President Shapiro's "Presidential Policy Statement on Sexual Orientation,"
which was reaffirmed by the Regents in 1988.
Regent Baker observed that Regents Deitch and McGowan had initiated discussions with the president and provost, Dean Bollinger, and the University's
general counsel, Elsa Cole, to amend Bylaw 14.06 soon after their election to the
Board in 1992. He himself had not learned of the existence of a July 1993 legal
opinion from a Washington law firm related to making this change until several
days ago. Regent Baker expressed concern that the other Regents were given
only one week's notice by Regents Deitch and McGowan of their intention to propose the bylaw change, which is the minimum time required, and that because
the president had waived the usual practice of publishing the proposed bylaw
change in advance in the University Record, the public was not given notice of
the proposed change until the first day of the Regents' meeting (September 23,
1993). University faculty, students, and staff were thus denied the right to comment on the issue.
Regent Baker stated that the reason that "sexual orientation" hasn't been
included in the bylaws in the past is because discrimination on this basis is different than the other categories of discrimination named in the bylaws. He further
observed that all qualified individuals at the University are treated equally regardless of their sexual orientation.
Regent Baker pointed out that there are many support and advocacy organizations for gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals at the University, and that these
groups have influenced University policy by making it unacceptable and


28




September Meeting, 1993


sometimes punishable to criticize homosexual and lesbian lifestyles at freshman
orientation, in the dormitory system, and in the classroom. He further noted that
University religious groups have expressed concern about the effect of the proposed bylaw change on their constitutional rights to freedom of association, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech. He quoted from a letter to the Regents
from Mr. Steven T. McFarland, director of the Center for Law and Religious
Freedom, which expressed his reservations regarding the proposed bylaw change
and requested that such a revision contain a "religious conscience" exemption.
(The text of the letter is included in Regent Baker's statement.)
Regent Baker argued that because of the strong political pressures that will
be exerted by homosexual and lesbian organizations, the recommendations of the
committee that will be appointed to study the effect of the bylaw change on other
areas of University life will most likely be fully implemented by the University
administration. Regent Baker noted that he has long argued that University policies regarding speech and conduct restrict both freedom of speech and freedom of
religion on the part of non-homosexual/lesbian students.
Regent Baker opined that the real issue is not alleged discrimination, but
rather, the establishment in the bylaws of the concept of "equivalency" of homosexual and lesbian sexual practices and lifestyles as equal to and as acceptable as
heterosexual sexual practices and lifestyles. According to Regent Baker, the future of our society is at risk and the structure of the family is being crushed by all
of the attacks on its historical religious, moral and ethical bases and the destruction of traditional values. The discussion of the bylaw change represents only one
aspect of that decline.
Regent Baker's prepared remarks concluded with a quote from an article by
Mr. Dennis Prager, from a 1990 issue of his journal, Ultimate Issues (copy included in the prepared statement on file) about the importance of family life in
the maintenance of western civilization. In this article, Mr. Prager asserts that
"the acceptance of homosexuality as the equal of heterosexual married love signifies the decline of western civilization..."
Regent Baker observed that two years ago, a student religious group had
been denied recognition by the Michigan Student Assembly because it would not
allow leaders of the group to be homosexual or lesbian, and the administration
had not intervened. Regent Baker asserted that the issues raised by revision of
the bylaw should be studied and debated prior to its being approved, rather than
by a committee to be formed following the revision, as has been proposed in the
motion. Otherwise the committee's recommendations will be "railroaded"
through, according to Regent Baker.
Regent Baker moved that the motion to amend the bylaws be tabled until a
committee can be appointed to study the implications of such an amendment.
This motion was not seconded.
President Duderstadt reported that if the bylaw change is approved, he intended to appoint a broadly representative commission to study the issues raised
by the change at the earliest possible opportunity. He said he would bring any


29




September Meeting, 1993


significant recommendations for changes in policies or practices to the Board for
firther discussion before implementation.
Regent Brown responded to Regent Baker's comments by noting that the
requirements for notice regarding the proposed bylaw change had been met, and
the notice was sufficient for him. He also disputed some of Regent Baker's assertions about freshman orientation, stating that Regent Baker was wrong in stating that individuals tried to change student's views about homosexuality. Regent
Brown praised the speakers at the Public Comments session for their reasoned
arguments. However, he observed that it would not be in the Board's power to
supersede the guarantees of freedom of religion, association, and assembly that
are contained in the Constitution. He further pointed out that the proposed
bylaw amendment is not a statement of approval or disapproval of any lifestyle;
it merely attempts to prohibit discrimination against the various conditions listed
in the bylaw. Thus, he was prepared to support the bylaw amendment.
In response, Regent Baker stated that he had received numerous calls about
the orientation program and the policies with respect to choice of roommate and
noted that the pressure not to speak up about such issues at the University is
tremendous. He cited some examples of instances involving orientation and
roommate selection.
Regent McGowan responded to Regent Baker's comments regarding the
process that had been followed in proposing the bylaw amendment, noting that it
was not done in secret and that the procedures had been followed to the letter.
She stated that the attorney in the Washington law firm referred to by Regent
Baker was a distinguished alumnus of the University. In response to Regent
Baker's assertion that Regent McGowan had been supported by gay rights activists in her campaign for election to the Board, Regent McGowan stated that her
support of the amendment was not being done as a sort of political payback for
the nearly two million citizens who voted for her, and that she was dismayed that
Regent Baker would make such an assertion. Regent Power expressed agreement
with Regent McGowan.
Regent Deitch observed that the reason that the issue had been a contentious one at the University for the past ten years had been because of Regent
Baker and his personal obsession with it. Noting that in his earlier comments he
had credited his Judaism with having framed his value system and that Regent
Baker was active in the Presbyterian church, he said that people's values, even at
a secular institution, are often framed by their religious beliefs. Regent Deitch
observed that New York governor Mario Cuomo, a Catholic, had framed the issue properly in a 1984 speech on abortion in which he stated that as a Catholic
public official he lived by the political truth that "to assure our freedom, we must
allow others the same freedom, even if occasionally it produces conduct by them
which we would hold to be sinful. We know that the problem with seeking to
force our beliefs on others is that they might someday force theirs on us."
Regent Deitch also noted that his election campaign had been endorsed by
gay and lesbian groups, among others, and that he was proud of that fact.


30




September Meeting, 1993


In regard to the ramifications of the proposed amendment, Regent McFee
recounted her personal experiences of having come of age when women were still
discriminated against in the workplace. She also noted that with the signing of a
marriage contract, people give up some of their independence, and that women
have long sought to protect their rights to equal benefits based on the family income. She said she was very concerned that the contractual obligations and responsibilities that are agreed to in the marriage contract be respected and that
any extension of those contractual rights be in the context of similar contracts,
and not be granted without that kind of commitment.
Regent Power called the question on Regent Deitch's motion to amend the
bylaws. Regent Baker moved that an exception to the amendment be provided
for religious organizations. There being no second to Regent Baker's motion, the
vote was taken on Regent Varner's motion to amend Regent Deitch and McGowan's original motion, and it carried on a vote of seven to one, with Regent Baker
opposed. Finally, the vote was taken on the amended motion to amend Regents'
Bylaw Section 14.06, and it carried, with Regents Brown, Deitch, McFee,
McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor and Regent Baker opposed. The
following is the text of the revised bylaw:
Sec. 14.06. Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action
The University of Michigan is committed to a policy of nondiscrimination and
equal opportunity for all persons regardless of race, sex, color, religion, creed, national
origin or ancestry, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, or Vietnam era
veteran status.
The University also is committed to compliance with all applicable laws regarding nondiscrimination and affirmative action.
There followed a ten-minute break, after which the Regents reconvened at
10:22 a.m.
University Annual Financial Statements for 1992-93; Year End Financial Information
Vice President Womack introduced the financial statements by pointing out
that in each instance, the opinion of the independent auditors, Ernst & Young,
was unqualified and contains the following statement
"In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
University of Michigan at June 30, 1993, and the changes in fund
balances and the current funds revenues, expenditures and
transfers for the year then ended are in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles."
Vice President Womack expressed his appreciation to the many members of
the University community who contributed to the University's being in such a
strong financial condition. He then introduced Mr. Chandler Matthews, associate
vice president for finance, and Mr. Robert Moenart, controller and director of financial operations, to present the financial statements.


31




September Meeting, 1993


Mr. Moenart reviewed current funds revenues through a slide presentation.
He pointed out that the current funds consist of the General, Designated, and
Expendable Restricted Funds (which together comprise the Educational and
General Funds), and the Auxiliary Activities Funds, student fees, state appropriations, and total government programs constitute approximately 82 percent of
the educational and general activities in the Current Funds. The General Fund's
primary function is instruction and research; the Designated Fund constitutes
conferences and continuing education; the Expendable Restricted Fund consists
primarily of federal research funding; and the Auxiliary Activities Fund records
the activities of units that generate their own revenues, such as the hospitals and
housing and athletics.
Over the past ten years, state appropriations as a source of revenue in the
Educational and General categories have decreased from 32.0 percent to 25.0
percent of the total, while student fees have increased from 28.0 percent to 31.0
percent and government programs have increased from 23.0 percent to 26.0 percent. Total Educational and General Funds revenues for 1992-93 were $1.173 billion; the growth rate over the past ten years (adjusted for inflation) has been 5.1
percent.
The expenditure categories of the Educational and General portion of the
Current Funds include salaries and wages, staff benefits, scholarships and fellowships, supplies, and equipment and plant. Over the past ten years, total compensation (salaries and wages plus staff benefits) has gone from 63.0 percent of the
total in 1983-84 to 59.0 percent in 1992-93, with staff benefits as a portion of the
expenditures increasing from 11.0 percent to 13.0 percent and salaries and wages
decreasing from 52.0 percent to 46.0 percent of the total. Scholarships and fellowships have grown over this time period, from 7.0 percent of the total to 10.0 percent of the total. Supplies expenditures have remained relatively constant, at
about 21.0 percent of the total. Equipment and plant expenditures have increased from 8.0 percent to 10.0 percent of the total. The total compound real
growth rate for expenditures and transfers in the Educational and General Current Funds has been 5.1 percent since Fiscal Year 1984.
Auxiliary Activities Funds have grown from 39 percent of total revenues in
1983-84 to 46 percent, while General Fund revenues have decreased from 39 percent of the total to 33 percent. Total revenues over this period have grown from
$890 million to $2.162 billion.
Mr. Moenart displayed charts detailing the components of the growth in
staff benefits from $87.1 million in 1983-84 (16 percent of total compensation) to
$238.9 million in 1992-93 (20 percent of total compensation). Health care costs
for retired and active employees have grown from 28 percent of staff benefits
costs to 37 percent.
Mr. Moenart concluded by observing that the University's bond rating remains at AA or above, and the debt service ratio has dropped from 3.0 percent in
1992 to 2.4 percent in 1993, as a result of refinancing over the past year.


32




September Meeting, 1993


Regent Baker moved adoption of the annual financial statements for
1992-93. Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regent Brown was away from the table when the vote was taken.
1993-94 Revenue and Expenditure Budgets
Vice President Womack began the presentation by displaying charts comparing the 1992-93 and 1993-94 current funds budget totals in terms of revenues,
expenditures, state appropriations, and student tuition and fees. Total revenues
in the General, Designated, Auxiliary Activities, and Expendable Restricted
Funds will increase by 7.8 percent in 1993-94, to $2.255 billion, while expenditures will increase by 7.7 percent to a total of $2.143 billion.
Over the past ten years, the University's budget has increased from about
$900 million in 1985 to $2.25 billion for the coming year. In the 1993-94 revenue
budget, Auxiliary Activities-Medical areas account for 40 percent ($904 million);
Auxiliary-Other, 6 percent ($121 million); the General Fund, 33 percent ($748
million); Expendable-Restricted Fund, 18 percent ($411 million); and the Designated Fund, 3 percent ($71 million). Vice President Womack then turned to Provost Whitaker to present the proposed General Fund budget.
Provost Whitaker reported that the 1993-94 General Fund revenue budget
of $748 million would consist of $387 million from tuition and fees (52 percent),
$293 million from state appropriation (39 percent), $56 million from indirect cost
reimbursement (7 percent), and $12 million from other sources (2 percent). Provost Whitaker also reviewed the 1993-94 General Fund budgeted expenditures by
function, by object, by school or college, by vice presidential area, and by unit. He
discussed detailed budgets for the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
the College of Engineering, the Medical School, the School of Social Work, and
the University Library.
Regarding the University of Michigan-Flint budget, Chancellor Jones commented that state appropriation comprises almost 50 percent of the budget,
whereas nine years ago it had been 38 percent. He also explained that the mandatory transfer figure of 5 percent is at the recommended maximum, and that is
due to the debt service required for the new parking deck and the central energy
plant expansion and library. This situation occurred because the Flint campus
was forced to borrow funds for critically needed facilities that it had hoped the
state would have been able to fund.
Vice President Womack took over the presentation at this point and reviewed the Designated Fund revenue budget of $71 million, the Auxiliary Activities budget of $1.025 billion, and the Expendable Restricted Fund budget of $411
million. He pointed out that 88 percent of the Auxiliary Activities revenue budget
comes from Hospital and other medical sources. In the Expendable Restricted
Fund, 67 percent comes from government sponsored programs and 26 percent
comes from private gifts.


33




September Meeting, 1993


Following Vice President Womack's presentation, Regent Baker moved approval of the 1993-94 revenue and expenditure budgets. Regent Varner seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Consent Agenda
The following consent agenda items were submitted to the Regents: the
minutes of the July 1993 meeting, reports of investments, plant extension, litigation, personnel-labor relations, projects established, summaries of a selection of
current research, and voluntary support; personnel actions; personnel reports;
and retirement memoirs.
Regent McGowan noted that she was very pleased with the appointment of
Susan Lipschutz as associate provost for academic affairs and expressed the hope
that more women would be appointed to high level positions in the future. President Duderstadt responded that he shared Regent McGowan's concerns, and
that he was committed to appointing women to leadership positions in the University. Regent Varner recognized the outstanding contributions of Vice President Womack and Jack Weidenbach. Regent Power welcomed Vice President
Homer Neal to the table and congratulated Walt Harrison on his appointment as
vice president for university relations and Provost Whitaker and Vice President
Womack on the change in their titles to executive vice president. Regent Baker
concurred.
Director of Intercollegiate Athletics. President Duderstadt announced
his recommendation for the appointment of Mr. M. Joseph Roberson as athletic
director. He noted that Mr. Roberson is a proven administrator, with strong athletic credentials, but most important, he is first and foremost an educator.
Regent Brown moved the appointment of M. Joseph Roberson as director of
intercollegiate athletics; Regent Waters seconded the motion.
Regent Baker read from a prepared statement in which he expressed his
view that the search process for the position of athletic director was faulted and
resulted in the unfair treatment of Mr. Fritz Seyferth as a candidate for the position. To protest this treatment of Mr. Seyferth, Regent Baker announced that although he would support Mr. Roberson in his new position as athletic director,
he intended to vote against the appointment. (A copy of Regent Baker's remarks
is on file in the Office of the Secretary of the University.)
Regents McFee, Brown, and Power expressed their support for Mr. Roberson and noted that they do not accept Regent Baker's statements as an accurate
depiction of the search process. President Duderstadt asserted that the process
was followed to the letter and that much of the information that had been leaked
to the media during the search was incorrect.
Following further comments, the vote was taken on the motion to approve
M. Joseph Roberson as director of intercollegiate athletics, and it was approved,
with Regents Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters in
favor and Regent Baker opposed.

Retirement Memoirs
Allan R. Beaudoin, professor of anatomy and cell biology, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1993, after a productive and balanced career of
teaching, research, and administration at the University of Michigan.
A native of Connecticut, Professor Beaudoin received his B.S. degree in 1949
and his M.S. degree in 1951 from the University of Connecticut and his Ph.D. degree in 1954 from the State University of Iowa. He was an instructor at Vassar
College from 1954-56 and an instructor and then assistant professor at the University of Florida from 1956-61. He joined the University of Michigan as assistant
professor of anatomy in 1961. He was promoted to associate professor in 1964
and professor in 1969.
During his tenure at the University of Florida, Professor Beaudoin became
associated with some of the pioneer researchers in the field of experimental teratology, and this provided the basis for his scientific career. When he moved to the
University of Michigan, he continued his research in experimental teratology and


69




September Meeting, 1993


taught medical histology and embryology. On several occasions Professor Beaudoin was also called upon to serve in departmental administrative posts, including acting chair of the department (1977-78) and interim chair (1986-89).
Professor Beaudoin's professional contributions have been well recognized
locally and nationally. He has served on many national panels and review groups
and has been elected to many offices of the Teratology Society, including president in 1978-79. His research has been reported in numerous peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated
service by naming Allan R. Beaudoin professor emeritus of anatomy and cell
biology.
LeVerne S. Collet, professor of education, retired from active faculty
status on July 31, 1993, after 25 years of service to the University of Michigan.
Born in Canada, Professor Collet received his B.Ed. and M.Ed. degrees from
the University of Alberta in 1956 and 1964, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree
from the University of Washington in 1968. From 1955-68, he served successively
as a classroom teacher, assistant principal and guidance counselor, and acting
principal at Wilson Junior High School in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. Professor
Collet joined the faculty of the University of Michigan School of Education as an
assistant professor in 1968; he was promoted to associate professor in 1972 and
professor in 1977.
During his years with the School of Education, Professor Collet taught
courses in research design, measurement, and program evaluation. He provided
extensive assistance to students and colleagues in designing research methodologies and conducting empirical research and field evaluations of educational programs. He has also served on the school's Curriculum Committee, Research
Coordinating Committee, and Executive Committee.
Professor Collet has also been very active in professional organizations, including the Association for Supervision and Curriculum and the National Council on Measurement in Education and has regularly presented papers at the
annual meetings of the American Educational Research Association. He has produced program evaluation reports for such groups as the Kennedy Center PreVocational Training Program, the National Kidney Foundation of Michigan's
School Blood Pressure Program, and the Ferndale School District's Program for
Academic Challenge and Enrichment. He has also served as a consultant for
Domino's Pizza, Inc., the Republic Steel Corporation, and the Howell Public
Schools.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming LeVerne S. Collet
professor emeritus of education.
Robert G. Craig, Marcus L. Ward Professor of Dentistry, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1993.
Professor Craig received his B.S. degree in 1944, his M.S. degree in 1951,
and his Ph.D. degree in 1954, all from the University of Michigan. He worked as
a researcher for two companies in New York State before joining the University
of Michigan in 1955 as a research associate in the Engineering Research Institute. He joined the faculty of the School of Dentistry as an assistant professor in


70




September Meeting, 1993


1957 and was promoted to associate professor in 1961 and professor in 1965. He
also served as chair of the Dental Materials Department from 1969-87.
Since coming to the University, Professor Craig has distinguished himself as
a dental scholar, researcher, administrator, and teacher, who has had a direct impact on the practice of dentistry worldwide. He is the editor of Restorative Dental
Materials, 9th edition (1993) and co-author of Dental Materials: Properties and

Whitmore Gray, professor of law, retired from active faculty status on
May 31, 1993, after a distinguished, 33-year career of teaching and research.
Born in Monroe, Michigan, in 1932, Professor Gray received his A.B. degree
from Princpia College in 1954 and his J.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1957. While in law school, he served as editor-in-chief of the Michigan
Law Review. Following graduation, he studied at the University of Paris and
practiced law in New York City. He was awarded his LL.D. degree by Adrian College in 1982.
Professor Gray joined the faculty of the University of Michigan Law School
as an assistant professor in 1960; he was promoted to associate professor in 1963
and professor in 1966. He has held visiting appointments at a number of distinguished law schools on three continents, including the University of Tokyo.
Professor Gray's work as a scholar and teacher has focused on three main
areas: contract law, alternate dispute resolution, and comparative law. He has
compiled extensive sets of teaching materials in all of these fields. Professor Gray
was an early leader in teaching and writing about alternate dispute resolution,
and one of his articles on this subject has been reprinted in at least six sets of dispute resolution materials. His work in comparative law has helped to inform domestic audiences about the law of such countries as Russia, Japan, and China,
and also has helped to inform audiences in many other countries about the law of
the United States. Professor Gray's teaching is noteworthy for the remarkable
opportunities for individual student work and attention to his students that he
has provided. He has also been actively involved in many professional


71

organizations, enriching his own resources as a teacher and scholar and adding
luster to the University's reputation.
The Regents now salute this accomplished scholar and educator by naming
Whitmore Gray professor emeritus of law.
Keith S. Henley, M.D., professor of internal medicine, retired from active
faculty status on June 30, 1993, after a notable career as a teacher, clinician, and
researcher.
Dr. Henley received his M.B.B.S. degree from King's College, University of
Durham, in England in 1948, his M.R.C.P. degree from the Royal College of Physicians in London in 1950, and his M.D. degree from the University of Durham
in 1957. From 1950-54 he trained in hospitals in West Africa and London before
emigrating to the United States and joining the University of Michigan as an instructor in the Department of Internal Medicine in 1954. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1956, associate professor in 1960, and professor in 1968.
Working with the late Dr. Marvin Pollard, Dr. Henley played a key role in
establishing one of the first divisions of gastroenterology in this country. He succeeded Dr. Pollard as chief of the Division of Gastroenterology in 1973. During
his tenure, Dr. Henley revitalized the division, creating a research environment
conducive for the recruitment of promising young investigators and providing
the foundation for the division's emergence as one of the nation's leading GI
programs.
Dr. Henley's pioneering work in the field of clinical enzymology resulted in
the identification of a marker for liver damage that is still widely used in clinical
practice to evaluate hepatocellular injury. Dr. Henley was among the first investigators to successfully isolate parenchymal cells from rat livers, and he performed
important metabolic studies defining the role of fat in the pathogenesis of
ethanol-induced liver injury. His study on the ammoniagenesis in the mitochondria of cirrhotic liver is considered a landmark paper, and his work on the effect
of ethanol on rat liver transaminase has helped elucidate the intracellular biochemical pathway by which ethanol produces damage to the liver. Using a rat
model, Dr. Henley established the association between total liver collagen formation and a serum marker of fibrogenesis, and identified prostaglandins as an inhibitor of collagen formation in experimental fibrogenesis in the rat.
An excellent clinician and inspiring teacher, Dr. Henley has trained many
academic hepatologists, some of whom have themselves gone on to become leaders in the field. He has also pioneered and developed one of the best liver transplant programs in the United States. Over the past three years, Dr. Henley has
single-handedly conducted the largest single-institution drug trial to evaluate the
effectiveness of prostaglandin in the prevention of rejection in liver transplantation; the results of his studies have far-reaching clinical implications in the handling of patients receiving liver transplants.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service by naming Keith S. Henley professor emeritus of internal
medicine.

1955. He then received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in 1958 and 1964, respectively, from Stanford University. He taught at the University of Wisconsin
(1964-65) and Michigan State University (1965-73) before joining the University
of Michigan as professor of economics in 1973. He received the additional appointment of professor of statistics in 1977. Professor Kmenta has been a visiting
professor at the universities of North Carolina, Bonn, Alberta, and the Saarland,
where he was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1989. He also spent a year as a
fellow of the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in 1987-88.
Considered to be one of the foremost econometric theorists in the world,
Professor Kmenta published the definitive textbook on the subject, Elements of
Econometrics, in 1971. The second edition of that text, published in 1986, continues to be widely used in graduate-level courses and to be cited as the authoritative source for econometric methodology. In addition to this text, Professor
Kmenta is the author of numerous articles in the top journals of economics and
the editor of two books. He has an unsurpassed reputation for rigorous thinking
and attention to detail.
Professor Kmenta is best known for his detailed studies of the properties of
various econometric estimators; these include several series of papers reporting
the results of his substantial research on seemingly unrelated regressions, estimation with missing observations, and estimation of production functions. He
has served as associate editor of the Journal of the American Statistical Association and the Review of Economics and Statistics and is a fellow of the American
Statistical Association. Over the years, he has been a frequent participant in professional conferences and meetings all over the world.
The Regents now salute this distinguished economist for his dedicated service by naming Jan Kmenta professor emeritus of economics and professor emeritus of statistics.

Donald J. Portman, professor of atmospheric, oceanic, and space sciences,
retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1993, after serving the University
and the college for almost 40 years.
Professor Portman received his B.S. degree in physics from the University of
Michigan in 1946 and his Ph.D. degree in physical sciences-micrometeorology
from Johns Hopkins University in 1955. Following a period of employment in industry, he returned to the University of Michigan in 1956 as a lecturer at the
Willow Run Laboratories. A founding member of the Department of Meteorology
and Oceanography, he was appointed professor of meteorology in 1962.
Professor Portman established one of the first courses in the then emerging
field of micrometeorology, stressing the need to compare theory with measurement through simple yet sophisticated experiments. Many of today's leaders in
the discipline were students in those early courses. In his weather and climate
course, he introduced many non-science majors in the University to the underlying scientific principles that control the atmosphere, stressing the insight that
can be gained from simple observations. Under his supervision, students in
weather forecasting were invited to prepare and present forecasts to participants
in soaring and hot air balloon meets, and in sailboat races, activities in which
their safety depends on accurate weather information. Professor Portman initiated a program which trained students for the media radio, television, and
newspapers.
Professor Portman's research in micrometeorology has contributed to the
understanding of the exchange of energy and momentum between the atmosphere and the surface of the earth and of the oceans. Professor Portman participated in the Great Plains Turbulence Program, an experimental program that is
still widely cited. Later, he was an investigator in the International Indian Ocean
Expedition and in the Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Expedition.
Closer to home, Professor Portman conducted measurements in the Keweenaw
Peninsula over snow and frozen ground. He is perhaps best known for his studies of turbulence through the optical propagation of a laser beam through the atmosphere. Professor Portman served as a consultant to industry on the dispersal
of pollutants from power plants.
Professor Portman's service included membership in SACUA for three years
on the Research Policies Committee, which he chaired for one year. He has also
served in the Senate Assembly for two three-year terms. In addition, he served
with distinction on many college and department committees.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Donald J. Portman
professor emeritus of atmospheric, oceanic, and space sciences.

September Meeting, 1993


Astrophysical Observatory, where he was in charge of tracking the first American
artificial satellite in 1958.
Professor Teske came to the University of Michigan in 1960 as an instructor
in astronomy. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1962, associate professor in 1967, and professor in 1977. In 1962, at the University's McMath-Hulbert
solar observatory, Professor Teske was principal investigator for a solar x-ray detector flown on the Third Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO III), one of the earliest space experiments to be launched by an American university. The OSO III
x-ray experiment provided the first comprehensive details and statistical data
about soft x-ray emission from solar flares, and the results were incorporated
into many publications and two doctoral theses, thus exposing many graduate
students to space research at an early point in its history.
After making strong contributions to solar and coronal physics, Professor
Teske switched to the study of supernova remnants in 1984, where he drew upon
his knowledge of coronal x-rays to make original contributions to research on the
physics of these objects. From 1987-92, he was interim director and then director
of the Michigan-Dartmouth-M.I.T. Observatory, a facility located on Kitt Peak in
Arizona and operated jointly by the three institutions.

northeast Ann Arbor that would enable the Medical Center to expand its services. He called on Dr. Zuidema, who observed that the trend in patient care, both
nationally and locally, was toward the ambulatory environment, rather than the
inpatient environment. The proposed site would be ideal for expanding ambulatory care services, with easy access for patients, students, and faculty. It would


82




September Meeting, 1993


also provide improved educational opportunities for students and faculty, and
would permit improved efficiency and economy of scale.
Vice President Womack explained that the terms of the proposal provide for
purchasing one 37.5-acre parcel of the Ann Arbor Technology Park and a 97.18
acre parcel from Comshare now, with a one-year option to acquire a second,
51.5-acre parcel, and a one-year right of first refusal to acquire the remaining
204.1 acres of the Ann Arbor Technology Park, according to the terms described
in the Regents Communication. Regent Baker stated that because he had served
as a receiver for the property one and one-half years ago, he would therefore neither comment on nor vote on this proposal.
Regent Brown moved that the University purchase parcel R of the Ann Arbor Technology Park (AATP) and the Comshare property as described in the Regents Communication, and further, that the University enter into an option
agreement for parcel S and a right of first refusal for the remaining AATP parcels. If it is determined that the additional acreage is needed, the University will
proceed with the acquisition of the properties at the terms outlined in the Regents Communication. Regent Waters seconded the motion. Following some discussion about why this particular site location, as opposed to property already
owned by the University, was deemed most appropriate for the Medical Center's
needs, the vote was taken and the motion was approved, with Regents Brown,
Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor and Regent Baker
abstaining.
Presidential Salary
Regent Brown noted that the Board usually sets the salary of the president
at its September meeting. He observed that because of the University of Michigan's ranking as among the best in the nation, its overall policy is to compensate
its president at a level commensurate with the top public universities in the
country. He also noted that recent financial constraints have led to the fact that
the president's compensation has fallen behind that of other peer institutions.
The Regents intend to provide President Duderstadt with a merit salary increase as well as a program of equity adjustment that would bring his compensation in line with the University's compensation policy. The equity adjustment
program would be phased in over a three-year period, and would be fimded from
the Auxiliary Activities Fund, rather than from the General Fund. The Regents
would continue to review annually both the president's performance in office and
the extent to which the equity adjustment program has caught up with compensation with peer institutions.
Regent Brown moved that the president receive a 5 percent merit salary increase of $9,019 on his current base salary of $180,385, and an equity adjustment
of $16,666, bringing his total compensation to $206,070 for the 1994 fiscal year.
In addition, he proposed that the president receive an appropriate term life
insurance policy, which would be in effect so long as he serves as president.


83




September Meeting, 1993


Presidential Retirement Security Program
In accordance with retirement security provisions that have been made
available for past presidents after they end their service as president, Regent
Brown moved adoption of the following program for President Duderstadt:
Terms: This program takes effect upon retirement as president
or upon taking a leave of absence from the University, pursuant to
the regular rules in effect for faculty for that purpose, but not upon
resignation to take a position at another institution or if terminated
for malfeasance. The program ends at the age of 70, at which point
the ordinary faculty retirement program becomes effective.
Title: University professor of science and engineering (with
tenure) and president emeritus.
Duties: Teach and conduct research in any school or college
(following discussions with the provost and appropriate deans).
Reporting Line: To the provost.
Salary: A twelve-month appointment at a salary equal to the
average of the three top faculty salaries in the College of
Engineering at the time the program begins, and adjusted thereafter
on a yearly basis.
Support:  Similar to that of an endowed chair; e.g., office,
secretary, personal computer, travel funds, and supplies.
Transition:  A one-year sabbatical leave at the presidential
compensation rate at the end of his career as president, and prior to
resuming his role as a faculty member.
Regent Waters seconded the motion. Regent Baker stated that he would
vote against the motion based on the structure of the package, and that this vote
should not be interpreted as a lack of support for the president's tenure in office.
Regent Brown pointed out that the Regents had provided President Shapiro with
a similar package.
Regent Power pointed out that the equity adjustment portion of the package
would be funded through the Auxiliary Activities Fund, so that money would not
be taken away from the General Fund to bring the president's salary in line with
that of peer institutions. Regents Varner and McFee emphasized that the
Regents are committed to bringing about equity in the president's salary in the
face of widespread funding constraints in higher education, which is why the equity portion must be phased in.
The vote was then taken, and the motion carried, with Regents Brown,
Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor and Regent Baker
opposed.


84




September Meeting, 1993


There being no further discussion, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting will be held on October 21 and 22, 1993. Regents' expenses for the
months of July and August, 1993, totalled $366.18 and 371.27, respectively.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery under the Master Indenture of hospital revenue bonds of the Issuer (herein called the "Hospital Bonds") in one or
more series to be designated as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer (but which designation shall include the words "HOSPITAL REVENUE BONDS" or if appropriate, "HOSPITAL
REVENUE AND REFUNDING BONDS") with appropriate series designations, in the aggregate
original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but not to exceed the principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of $65,000,000 (but the total aggregate principal
amount of the Hospital Bonds and the MSP Bonds shall not exceed $165,000,000), to be dated as
of the date or dates established by an Authorized Officer, for the purpose of providing funds
which, together with other available funds, may be used to pay all or a portion of the costs of the
Projects and to pay costs incidental to the issuance of the Hospital Bonds, including capitalized
interest for such period, if any, as an Authorized Officer may deem appropriate. The Hospital
Bonds shall be serial bonds, or term bonds, which may be subject to redemption requirements, or
both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first maturity shall be not earlier
than December 1, 1993 and the last maturity shall be no later than December 1, 2027. The Hospital Bonds may bear no interest or may bear interest at stated fixed rates for the respective maturities thereof as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the highest fixed rate of
interest for any maturity shall not exceed 7% per annum, and the Bonds may be issued in whole
or in part as capital appreciation bonds, which for their term or any part thereof bear no interest
but appreciate in principal amount over time at compounded rate (not in excess of 7% per annum) to be determined by an Authorized Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Hospital Bonds
may bear interest at a variable rate of interest for all or a portion of their term, and the variable
rate of interest shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by law. In addition, all or part of
the Bonds may be issued in related series, one of which bears interest at a variable rate and one
of which bears interest at a residual rate determined by subtracting the variable rate from the
fixed rate paid by the Issuer, but the combined rate on such Hospital Bonds, taking the two related series together, which shall be determined by an Authorized Officer, shall not exceed 7%
per annum The Hospital Bonds may be subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the times and prices and in the manner as shall be established by an Authorized Officer.
The maximum annual principal and interest requirements on the Hospital Bonds, taking into account any swap or other arrangements described below, and assuming the variable rate on any
Hospital Bonds not also subject to a swap or other arrangement, and not issued as part of related
series as described above, is equal to 7% per annum, shall not exceed $10,000,000. Interest on the
Hospital Bonds shall be payable at the times as shall be specified by an Authorized Officer. The

discount, shall not exceed 0.8% of the principal amount thereof) plus accrued interest, if any,
from the dated date of the Hospital Bonds to the date of delivery thereof. In connection with the
issuance of the Hospital Bonds, either of the Authorized Officers may, on behalf of and as the act


88




September Meeting, 1993 - Appendix A

the Authorized Officer. Such Hospital Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the
Issuer and the counter-party related to interest on the Hospital Bonds or indexed or market established rates. The effective interest rates on the Hospital Bonds, taking into account the effect
of the Hospital Swap Agreement, shall be within the limitations set forth herein.
The Hospital Bonds may be issued as part of a single issue or series with the hospital revenue bonds authorized by the May 7 Resolution, in which event the designation of those bonds
may be as provided herein for the Hospital Bonds. The limitations as to the Hospital Bonds, and
the bonds authorized by the May 7 Resolution, contained herein and the May 7 Resolution, respectively, shall be applied separately to the Hospital Bonds and the bonds authorized by the
May 7 Resolution, even if all such bonds are issued as part of a single series.

plan revenue bonds of the Issuer (herein called the 'MSP Bonds") in one or more series to be
designated as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer (but which designation shall include

Refunded Bonds; and to pay costs incidental to the refunding and to the issuance of the MSP
Bonds, including capitalized interest for such period if any, as an Authorized Officer may deem
appropriate. The MSP Bonds shall be serial bonds, or term bonds, which may be subject to redemption requirements, or both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first
maturity shall be not earlier than December 1, 1993 and the last maturity shall be no later than
December 1, 2027. The MSP Bonds may bear no interest or may bear interest at stated fixed
rates for the respective maturities thereof as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but
the highest fixed rate of interest for any maturity shall not exceed 7% per annum, and the MSP
Bonds may be issued in whole or in part as capital appreciation bonds, which for their term or
any part thereof bear no interest but appreciate in principal amount over time at compounded
rate (not in excess of 7% per annum) to be determined by an Authorized Officer. Alternatively,

variable rate on any MSP Bonds not also subject to a swap or other arrangement, and not issued
as part of related series as described above, is equal to 7% per annum, shall not exceed
$9,000,000. Interest on the MSP Bonds shall be payable at the times as shall be specified by an
Authorized Officer. The MSP Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form in denominations,
shall be payable as to principal and interest in the manner, shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be executed and authenticated, all as shall be provided in the MSP Indenture.
The MSP Bonds shall be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement for
a price to be established by an Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of
original issue discount, shall not exceed 0.8% of the principal amount thereof) plus accrued interest, if any, from the dated date of the MSP Bonds to the date of delivery thereof. In connection
with the issuance of the MSP Bonds, either of the Authorized Officers may, on behalf of and as
the act of the Issuer enter into an interest rate swap, cap or similar agreement or agreements
(collectively, the '"M~P Swap Agreement") with a counter-party or counter-parties to be selected
by the Authorized Officer. Such MSP Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the
Issuer and the counter-party related to interest on the MSP Bonds or indexed or market established rates. The effective interest rates on the MSP Bonds, taking into account the effect of the
MSP Swap Agreement, shall be within the limitations set forth herein.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1993


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, October 21, 1993
The Regents assembled at 10:00 am. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan,
Power, and Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy,
and Vice President Harrison were also present. Executive Vice President
Womack, Vice Presidents Cosovich, Hartford, and Neal, and Chancellors Jones
and Renick were absent. Regent Varner arrived shortly after the start of the
meeting.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Regent
Deitch, who made the following motion:
Executive Session Motion
Pursuant to Sections 8(a), 8(e), and 8(h) of the Open Meetings
Act, as amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents
meet in closed session on October 21, 1993, for the following
purposes: 1) to consider a periodic personnel evaluation of a person
who has requested confidentiality [Sec. 8(a)]; 2) to consult with our
attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection with
specific pending litigation [Sec. 8(e)]; and 3) to consider material
exempt from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of
Information Act [Sec. 8(h)]. Such exempt material consists of a
written opinion from the Board's legal counsel.
Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously,
after which the Regents immediately met in closed session.
A Thoughtful Discussion of Political Correctness and Academic Values
The Regents reconvened at 1:00 p.m. in the East Conference Room of the
Horace H. Rackham Building and participated in a panel discussion about political correctness and academic values. Panelists included Professors Elizabeth Anderson, Lee Bollinger, James Jackson, Rebecca Scott, and James Turner. Audio
and video tapes of the discussion are on file in the Office of the Secretary of the
University.
Friday, October 22, 1993
The Regents met at 9:20 am. in the Harding Mott University Center on the
campus of the University of Michigan-Flint. Present were President Duderstadt


93




October Meeting, 1993


and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, Varner, and
Waters. Vice President and Secretary Kennedy was also present, as were Provost
Whitaker, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents Cosovich, Harrison, Hartford, and Neal, and Chancellors Jones and Renick
Ernst & Young Management Report and Responses
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order, and called on Executive
Vice President Womack to introduce the external auditor's report. Executive Vice
President Womack introduced Messrs. Robert Emde and Harold Miller, of Ernst
& Young, and George Johnson, a certified public accountant who assisted in the
audit.
Mr. Emde noted that Ernst & Young's opinion on the financial statements,
submitted in September, had been a "clean, unqualified opinion," which present
fairly the financial position of the University, as well as each of its constituent organizations (the Hospitals, Dental Faculty Associates, M-Care, Veritas) and
closely aligned organizations (the Alumni Association, the University Musical Society, and the William Davidson Institute).
Regarding the report on procedures and controls, Mr. Emde stated that
these were found to be working very efficiently, with no material weaknesses. He
noted that the University concurs with each of the recommendations in the management letter and has taken steps to implement them.
Mr. Emde observed that his firm continues to receive excellent cooperation
in performing its audit. He then responded to questions from the Regents and
noted that Ernst & Young would not hesitate to bring to the attention of the Regents any matters that would be of concern.
1994-95 State Budget Request
Ann Arbor Campus. President Duderstadt called on Provost Whitaker to
present the budget request for the Ann Arbor campus. Provost Whitaker observed that there had been no increase in the state appropriation for the past two
years, which had led to an increasing reliance on tuition to make up the General
Fund budget. The state appropriation currently comprises 37 percent of this
budget, while tuition makes up 52 percent. Provost Whitaker pointed out that as
tuition increases, the cost of maintaining access also rises; therefore, increased
state support is essential to the University's ability to maintain access.
Given the state's financial situation, only a modest increase in state appropriation is proposed, consisting of $10.1 million as an inflation component (3.7
percent), $1.7 million for operating costs of facilities openings for FY95; and $3.5
million for maintenance improvement, for a total requested increase of $15.3
million.
UM-Flint Campus, Chancellor Jones observed that the UM-Flint budget
was derived from two revenue streams: state appropriation and tuition and fees.
The continuing decline in state support has led to increased reliance on tuition
and fees, and the difficulty this creates for students is of great concern.


94




October Meeting, 1993


Enrollment growth has stabilized because of lack of funds for hiring more filltime faculty to teach more class sections.
The incremental budget request of 6.7 percent ($2,250,000) over the 1993-94
appropriation includes, in order of priority, $500,000 for facilities openings; a 3.7
percent inflationary increase for both salaries and operating expenses
($1,250,000); and $500,000 for various program initiatives.
UM-Dearbon. Following some discussion, President Duderstadt called on
Chancellor Renick to present the 1994-95 UM-Dearbor budget request. Chancellor Renick stated that the funding situation at UM-Dearborn is similar to that
of the other two campuses. The 1994-95 incremental budget request of
$1,684,000 reflects two priorities: an inflation component of 3.7 percent for
maintenance of quality educational programming, and $1,000,000 for the Center
for Environmental Education.
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved the 1994-95 state budget requests for all three campuses.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Consideration of the minutes of the September 1993 meeting was
deferred until the following month.
Reports. The following reports were submitted to the Regents: reports of
investments, plant extension, litigation, personnel-labor relations, noncompetitive purchases over $2,000 from single sources, projects established, and summaries of a selection of current research.
Executive Vice President Womack observed that treasury bond interest
rates are currently at record-low levels and described the implications of that on
the economy and the University's investment portfolio. He also reported that the
University's equity managers have exceeded performance guidelines for one-year
and three-year periods. He commented on the University's strategy for diversification of investments and the effects of the strategy on performance and
volatility.
Executive Vice President Womack also announced that in the near future he
would be presenting the Regents with a proposal designed to enhance investment
returns of the investment pool through longer term investments of the core portion of the pool.
Investments in South Africa. Following some discussion of the investment report, Regent Power observed that negotiations toward racial power sharing now taking place in South Africa had led to a request by Mr. Nelson Mandela
for an end to the economic boycott of South Africa, and that President Clinton
had recently issued an executive order changing American policy. Regent Power
stated that it may be time for the University of Michigan, prudently and deliberately, to consider its options with regard to its current investment policy of avoiding investing in corporations which do business in South Africa. He moved that
the administration report back to the Board of Regents its recommendations as

October Meeting, 1993


to this policy and other policies directed toward investments in corporations conducting business activities in South Africa. Regent Varner seconded the motion.
Regent Baker observed that there was a state law prohibiting the University from   changing its current investment policy in South Africa. Regent Power
reported that legislation recently had been proposed in the state legislature to
change the state's position on investing in South Africa and also pointed out that
this was an autonomy issue that should be considered independent of the state's
position on the issue.
Regent Baker commented that the University had prevailed in the Court of
Appeals on the autonomy issue, and that although he thought the motion tended
toward grandstanding, he was in favor of it.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Consent Agenda, continued
Investment Report. Regent Baker asked for a report on the endowment
which would disclose gifts and transfers as well as appreciation. The Regents
complimented Executive Vice President Womack and his staff on their competent management of the University's endowment find.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Cosovich presented the report of voluntary support.

Retirement Memoirs. Provost Whitaker submitted the following retirement memoirs:
Jesse E. Gordon, professor of social work in the School of Social Work and
professor of psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired
from active faculty status on May 31, 1993, after 34 years of service to the University of Michigan.
Professor Gordon obtained his B.S. degree from New York University in
1950, his M.A degree from New York University in 1951, and his Ph.D. degree in
psychology from Pennsylvania State University in 1956. After applying his psychology education in a variety of arenas, he joined the faculty of the Department
of Psychology in 1959 as an assistant professor. In 1964, he was appointed associate professor of social work and associate professor of psychology; he was promoted to professor of social work and professor of psychology in 1966.
One of the school's leading instructors in the area of research, Professor
Gordon played a major role in the integration of research and clinical practice.
His expertise was shared with the U.S. Department of Labor for many years, first
in establishing selection, assessment, and training procedures for the Youth
Opportunity Program, and then as head of a social service organization in which
social science knowledge was to be applied to the development of training materials for employment agency personnel. While at the University and School of Social Work, Professor Gordon served on numerous committees to which he was
elected by his colleagues. His knowledge of funding sources and grantmanship
led to securing research grants and contracts for the University community.
Included in Professor Gordon's extensive publication record is the college-level
text Personality and Behavior. His retirement marks the departure of an
outstanding member of the faculty of the School of Social Work and leader of the
University community.


107




October Meeting, 1993


The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Jesse E. Gordon
professor emeritus of social work and professor emeritus of psychology.
E. Lawrence McMahon, associate professor of electrical engineering and
computer science, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1993, after 34
years of service.
Professor McMahon earned his B.S. degree (electrical engineering) from
Fournier Institute in Lamont, Illinois, in 1952, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
from the University of Illinois in 1953 and 1955, respectively. After graduation,
Professor McMahon served as a research engineer at Hughes Aircraft Corporation from 1955-56 and as an assistant professor at Michigan State University
from 1956-59. He joined the University of Michigan as an assistant professor in
the Department of Electrical Engineering in 1959 and was promoted to associate
professor in 1963.
From the time he joined the University of Michigan faculty, Professor
McMahon was highly dedicated to students. From 1965-69, he administered the
department's graduate fellowship program. He then assisted in the coordination
of the graduate admissions program. Professor McMahon has made many contributions to the department's instructional programs, both in teaching and in new
course development. These contributions were recognized in 1982 when he received the Eta Kappa Nu Faculty Award for outstanding performance in teaching and student-faculty relations. Professor McMahon has served on both
departmental and College of Engineering curriculum committees. He has also
been active in advising both graduate and undergraduate students and has provided invaluable service as a counselor for undergraduate electrical engineering
students.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his many years of service
by naming E. Lawrence McMahon associate professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science.
Bernard Van't Hul, associate professor of English language and literature, will retire from active faculty status on October 31, 1993, following 23 years
of service.
A native of Rock Valley, Iowa, Professor Van't Hul attended Calvin College
in Grand Rapids from which he received his B.A degree in 1959. Dutch was the
language of his home, and his military service in Europe honed his fluency in
German. As an undergraduate, he deepened his knowledge of languages, particularly those bearing on medieval Europe. He continued his studies at Northwestern University where he received his M.A degree in 1961 and his Ph.D. degree in
1971. While completing his doctoral work, he held a faculty position at Calvin
College and, in 1969, he joined the University of Michigan faculty with a joint appointment in the Department of English and the Middle English Dictionary. He
was promoted to associate professor in 1972.
Lexicography requires the exacting attention to detail which has been a hallmark of Professor Van't Hul's teaching and scholarship, and his contributions to
the Middle English Dictionary added to the excellence of this monumental work.
At the same time, he was drawn to public service through a concern for the
teaching of English in Michigan schools. One of the founding activists in the


108




October Meeting, 1993


creation of the English Composition Board, he led workshops and in-service programs for teachers in more than 300 Michigan schools. With his colleague, Jay L.
Robinson, he created a set of middle school textbooks designed to introduce students to the study of the English language. In recent years, his undergraduate
teaching has pioneered the use of computer conferencing to engage each student
in the minute study of literary texts.
Professor Van't Hul has been recognized for excellence throughout his academic career. At the beginning of his graduate studies, he was a Woodrow Wilson
Fellow; at Calvin College, he was named to a Danforth Fellowship; and, in 1981,
he received the Faculty Recognition Award at the University of Michigan.
The Regents now honor this faculty member by naming Bernard Van't Hul
associate professor emeritus of English language and literature.
Memorials. No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees. There were no actions with respect to degrees this month.
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved the remainder of the consent agenda as listed above.
University of Michigan Financial Report and Audited Financial Statements for the Alumni Association for the Year Ended June 30, 1993
Executive Vice President Womack submitted the University of Michigan Financial Report and Audited Financial Statements for the Alumni Association for
the Year Ended June 30, 1993.
Easement at 1327 Geddes
Executive Vice President Womack noted that the Regents Communication
responds to the Regents' previous question about the use the property owner
intended to make of the property. Regent Baker commented that if the owner of
the property, Mr. Stegeman, ever abandons the idea of building a house on the
property, it would be in the University's interest to obtain the property. He also
noted that the site is currently used as a storage area for trash and is rather
unsightly.
Regent Power moved authorization for the execution of an agreement with
John C. Stegeman and Lois U. Stegeman stating that the University will vacate
the common driveway easement at 1327 Geddes, as described in the Regents
Communication. Regent McGowan said that she would abstain from voting on
this item due to a conflict of interest. The vote was then taken, and the motion
was approved, with Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, Power, Varner, and
Waters in favor, and Regent McGowan abstaining.
Agreement between the University of Michigan and Global Rivers
Environmental Education Network (GREEN)
Regent Waters moved, Regent Varner seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, an agreement between the University of Michigan and the
Global Rivers Environmental Education Network (GREEN), a non-profit


109




October Meeting, 1993


corporation. Because two members of the board of directors of GREEN, William
Stapp and Orin Gelderloos, are also University employees, this agreement falls
under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Global Rivers Environmental Education Network (GREEN).
2.   At the request of General Motors, the University will transfer $110,000 to
GREEN from its General Motors Foundation grant. The University expects to
issue subcontracts to GREEN under two federally-funded projects: National
Consortium for Environmental Education and Training, about $25,000 for one
year, and National Science Foundation, about $440,000 over two years. Terms
of these agreements will be consistent with University policy and with the requirements of the prime funding agencies.
3.   Neither Dr. Stapp nor Dr. Gelderloos have a proprietary interest in GREEN.
Dr. Stapp will receive nominal compensation of up to $5,000 from GREEN for
his role as honorary director. Dr. Gelderloos will receive no compensation from
GREEN.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and
a Partnership owned in part by University Employees (Koren, Levine,
and Bell)
Regent Waters moved, Regent Power seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved the University's entering into a license agreement with a partnership owned in part by University employees Yoram Koren, Simon Levine,
and David Bell. These employees, along with Lon Bell, a person not employed at
the University, have developed a technology known as "Human Disturbance
Modeling for Adaptive Control of Human-Machine Systems" (the "Technology"),
and have also formed a partnership with the goal of developing products and
services which use the Technology. Because Messrs. Koren, Levine, and David
Bell are University employees and also have ownership interest in the partnership, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and a partnership,
owned in part by Messrs. Koren, Levine, and David Bell.
2.   Terms of the contract include: a duration of the term of the last to expire of
any patents, and consideration to the University consisting of the payment of
royalties, including modest minimum annual requirements, on products covered by patents on the Technology; a share of sublicensing revenues received by
the partnership; and reimbursement of future University patent filing and
prosecution costs for the Technology, if applicable. The partnership will pay the
University royalties at a rate of 2.0 percent for products sold. The partnership
will also pay the University 15.0 percent of any sublicensing revenues the partnership receives. Minimum royalties shall commence in 1994 at $500 for the
first year, $1,000 for the second year, $3,000 for the third year, and $6,000 for
each year thereafter. The University retains ownership of all Technology. The
University retains the right to use the Technology for research, teaching and
other educationally-related purposes. The partnership shall diligently pursue
the commercial development and exploitation of the Technology covered by the
proposed license agreement. There is no use of facilities or services of the University included in the contract and no assignment of University employees for
fulfillment of the contract.


110




October Meeting, 1993


3.   The pecuniary interest of David Bell and Professors Koren and Levine in the
contract arises from their ownership of interests in the partnership. This equity
interest (as well as the equity interest of Lon Bell) will be in lieu of participation
in the sharing of royalties received by the University, in accordance with standard University policy.
Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities
Vice President Hartford submitted the second quarterly report of the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities.
Revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 13.04 (University of Michigan
Alumni Association)
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
unanimously approved revisions to Regents' Bylaw Section 13.04, regarding the
University of Michigan Alumni Association. The following is the text of the revised bylaw:
Sec. 13.04. University of Michigan Alumni Association
The Alumni Association of the University of Michigan shall be an independent
and self-governing body governed by a board of directors to be selected in accordance
with the bylaws of the association. Between meetings of the board of directors, the affairs of the association shall be in the charge of an executive committee which shall
consist of the president of the association and at least four other members of the board
of directors, to be elected annually by the board of directors. The executive committee
shall exercise the powers of the board of directors while the board is not in session, and
shall exercise such other powers as are herein conferred upon it, or may from time to
time be delegated by the board of directors.
The Business and Financial Affairs Committee shall consist of the president of
the Alumni Association, ex officio; the treasurer of the association, ex officio; the president of the University, ex officio; the vice president for development and communication, ex officio; the vice president and chief financial officer, ex officio; two directors of
the association; one member of the administrative staff of the University and two members of the faculty of the University, these last three of whom shall be alumni, to be
elected by the board of directors annually, subject to confirmation of the Regents. The
Business and Financial Affairs Committee shall approve the budget of the association
and thereby authorize expenditures and shall secure an audit of the books and the accounts of the association.
The treasurer of the association shall be elected by the board of directors for a
term of two years and shall be an alumnus of the University. The treasurer shall supervise the accounts of the association and control its monies or funds held in trust by it
and shall make such reports showing the financial condition of the association as may
be required by the board of directors or the Business and Financial Affairs Committee.
The treasurer shall exercise the usual powers of the office of treasurer, shall furnish
adequate bond, and shall perform such other duties as may be delegated to the treasurer by the Business and Financial Affairs Committee.
Academic Calendar Revision for University of Michigan-Flint
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved a revision of the academic calendar for UM-Flint for the
winter 1994 term.


111




October Meeting, 1993


Horace H. Rackham Memorial Building in Detroit
Executive Vice President Womack called on Professor Harold Johnson to describe the actions requested with respect to the Horace H. Rackham Memorial
Building. Professor Johnson reported that a committee of active members of the
community had been formed to guide the University as to how the building related to the University's mission in Detroit. The consensus was that because the
building was not suited to the University's activities and people were not making
use of it, it should not be considered as a factor in shaping future University activities in the community. The committee recommended that whatever actions
were taken be done in cooperation with the Engineering Society of Detroit, and
that whatever was done ought to enhance the cultural area.
As described in the Regents Communication, the building needs to be
brought into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which will cost
between $1-2 million, and to be made functional, at a cost of $5-6 million. Professor Johnson stated that Wayne State University is extremely interested in the facility and has the resources to make the improvements that would be necessary
to utilize it. The University has invited the Engineering Society to convey its
share of the building to the University, which would in turn lease the entire facility to Wayne State. At the end of the proposed 25-year lease period, the University would retain control over the entire facility if it decided to use it for some
other purpose.
Regent Varner expressed the hope that if the proposed arrangement is consummated, some priority be given on the use of the funds for the University's
programmatic initiatives in Detroit. She also recommended that the University
increase its public relations efforts to inform people in that community of the
University's activities. Professor Johnson responded that a report of University
activities in the Detroit area was scheduled to be issued in the near future.
Regent Deitch stated that he supports the arrangement, but that this support is predicated on the University's retaining control of the property at the end
of the 25-year period.
In response to a question from Regent Baker, Professor Johnson stated that
the parcel of land that may be conveyed or leased to the Engineering Society, as
described in the Regents Communication, would probably be in the Ann Arbor
area. He also responded to a question from Regent Baker about the Engineering
Society trust fund; Regent Baker pointed out that the Engineering Society has an
ongoing obligation with respect to the trust fund.
Vice President Harrison reiterated that he and Professor Johnson had been
charged with developing a direction in which to proceed for the use of this building, and that once that has been approved, Executive Vice President Womack's
staff would be in charge of working out the details.
In response to a comment from Regent Power, Chancellor Renick stated
that this action will have no effect at all on the Dearborn campus's programming
in Detroit. He recommended that UM-Dearborn's role in the region be considered as the University makes plans for increasing its presence in Detroit.


112




October Meeting, 1993


Following further discussion, Regent Waters moved authorization to negotiate a lease of the Horace H. Rackham Educational Memorial Building and the
parking structure to Wayne State University in consideration of Wayne State
University's assumption of both the responsibilities concerning the educational
activities taking place and the renovation costs necessary to meet the deferred
maintenance requirements and the Americans with Disabilities Act and other required code upgrades within the leased space, with such lease to occur after
Michigan attorney general and judicial approval are obtained. Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
There followed a 30-minute break, from 10:30 to 11:00 am.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Marcia Federbush, citizen, on the men's
gymnastics program, and Tim Retzloff, UM-Flint staff member and student, in
support of the recent amendment to Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06. They also
heard comments from the following individuals in praise of Chancellor Jones'
service at UM-Flint: Allen D. Arnold, president of Mott Community College;
Sixto C. Olivo, member of the UM-Flint Citizens Advisory Committee; Roberto
Quiroz, director of bilingual education for the Flint Public Schools and board
member of the Spanish Speaking Information Center; Bobbie Ewing, president
of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Flint Alumnae Chapter; Representative Floyd
Clack; James B. Franklin III, president of the Black Panhellenic Council of Flint;
Olive R. Beasley, citizen; and David Ready, Flint city administrator, on behalf of
the mayor of Flint.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:40 a.m.
The next meeting will be held on November 18 and 19, 1993. Regents' expenses
for the month of September 1993 totalled $169.20.

Executive Session Motion
Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended
by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed
session on November 18, 1993, in the Regents' Room, immediately
following Public Comments, for the purpose of consulting with our
attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection with
specific pending litigation.
Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following people, on the topics
indicated: Mike Milidonis, assistant coach of the men's gymnastic team, Robert
K. Darden II, head coach, Richard Dopp and Seth Rubin, team members, and
Robert MacDonald, parent of team member, all on the decision to drop the men's
gymnastics program; Scott Greenwood, political science student, on the decision
not to grant tenure to Jill Crystal; John Humphrey, faculty member, on administrative salary increases; Benjamin Bolger, student, on quality and accessibility of
undergraduate education; and Loretta Lee, student, on the Campus Sexual
Assault Victim's Bill of Rights.
Following Public Comments, at 4:55 p.m., the Regents met in closed session
in the Regents' Room.
Friday, November 19, 1993

November Meeting, 1993


Executive Vice President Womack, and Vice Presidents Cosovich, Harrison, and
Neal were also present, as was Chancellor Renick Vice President Hartford and
Chancellor Jones were absent; Provost Wong attended in the place of Chancellor
Jones.
Consent Agenda
September 1993 minutes. President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called for a motion to approve the minutes of the September 1993 meeting. Regent Power moved approval of the minutes of the original draft of the
minutes of the meeting of September 23-24, 1993, and Regent Waters seconded
the motion. Regent Power noted that the original version of the minutes was an
accurate summary of the discussion that occurred at that meeting. Regent Baker
disagreed, suggesting that not including a more complete version of his comments reflected inappropriate judgments with regard to freedom of speech and
freedom of discussion. Regent Brown pointed out that the Regents' policy is to
include sunmaries of people's statements, and that Regents' verbatim statements are included in a permanent file in the secretary's office. Following further
discussion, the vote was taken and the original version of the minutes of the
September 1993 meeting was approved, with Regents Brown, Deitch, McFee,
McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor and Regent Baker opposed.
October 1993 minutes. Regent Brown moved approval of the minutes of
the meeting of October 21-22, 1993. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it
was approved unanimously.
Regent Baker requested that his negative vote at the September meeting on
the recommendation of M. Joseph Roberson as athletic director be changed to an
affirmative vote. Following some discussion, it was determined that a vote cannot
be changed once it has been made and recorded.
Report of Senate      Advisory   Committee    on  University   Affairs
(SACUA)
President Duderstadt introduced Professor Henry Griffin, chair of SACUA,
to present the report. Professor Griffin reported that SACUA's three major
concerns for the current year are grievance procedures, considerations of faculty
governance (a self-examination), and the diversity of faculty contributions to the
University's teaching and research functions. He described how faculty governance is structured, and then called on Jayne Thorson, executive assistant to
SACUA, who described the structure, function, and activities of the faculty senate office.
Professor Griffin then reported on SACUA's progress with respect to the
evaluation of the offices of the executive officers and deans, and in providing a
means for informal dispute resolution for faculty members. He also noted that
SACUA intends to undertake a study of the effectiveness of faculty governance.

November Meeting, 1993


Compliance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)
Judith Nowack, assistant vice president for research, and John O'Shea, professor of anthropology and director of the Museum of Anthropology, presented a
report describing the University's efforts to comply with the Native American
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). NAGPRA is a law requiring
universities and museums that receive federal funds to first summarize or inventory, then return to Native American groups, upon request, human remains and
certain cultural objects shown to be affiliated with each Native American group.
Professor O'Shea reported that 324 objects in the Museum of Anthropology
came under the purview of NAGPRA, and that each tribe associated with each
object has been notified of its existence. At this time, no objects have been repatriated; nor have any claims been received. The action requested gives the University the freedom to negotiate with Native American groups, on an individual
basis, about possible long-term curation or other disposition of their materials.
The goal is to maintain the future accessibility of these materials for study.
Regent McGowan moved to authorize University officials to pursue negotiations with relevant Native American groups and ultimately to repatriate any of
those items and human remains which are both shown by its inquiries to be
"affiliated" and, at the end of the negotiation, requested by the Native American
group with which the affiliation exists. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it
was approved unanimously.
There followed some comments by the Regents, after which they returned
to the regular agenda.
Consent Agenda, continued
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted the following consent agenda items to the Regents: reports of investments, plant extension,
litigation, and personnel-labor relations. Vice President Neal submitted reports
of projects established and summaries of a selection of current research.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Cosovich submitted the report of voluntary support.

Retirement Memoirs. Provost Whitaker submitted the following retirement memoirs:
Mara Julius, assistant research scientist in the Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1993,
after 23 years of service.


125




November Meeting, 1993


Dr. Julius earned her B.A degree in 1953, her M.S. degree in 1977, and her
Sc.D. degree in 1979, all from the University of Zagreb in Yugoslavia She first
came to the University of Michigan in 1960 as a visiting scholar at the Institute
for Social Research. From 1964-68, she was a teaching fellow and research assistant in the Department of Psychology. She joined the Department of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health in 1970 and held positions as research
associate, lecturer, and research investigator until 1986, when she was promoted
to the position of assistant research scientist.
In the Department of Epidemiology, Dr. Julius was responsible for the
psychosocial program for the Tecumseh Community Health Study, lectures in
the field of social epidemiology, research in areas of gender and ethnic differences
in health, and the impact of social support on the physical health in the elderly.
Her publications reflect a deep and continuing interest in the psychosocial risk
factors that influence the health of the elderly and their health behavior, the
family environment, and temporality in late life. Recently, her research has
centered around life events, suppressed anger, blood pressure as predictors of
mortality, and blood gluthathione as an indication of health status. Dr. Julius
served on various departmental committees, participated fully in departmental
and school affairs, and belonged to at least six professional organizations whose
activities were integral to her research and service interests.
Dr. Julius' career has been characterized by dedication to the social causes
she espoused, by psychobiological research aimed at improving the health of the
elderly, and by exemplary adherence to the highest ethical standards. The products of her research always exceeded the expectations of whatever multidisciplinary groups she worked with. Throughout her career, she earned the respect and
affection of her colleagues and students.
The Regents now salute this scientist for her dedicated service by naming
Mara Julius assistant research scientist emerita.
Dorothy A. Lee, professor of English and comparative literature at the
University of Michigan-Dearborn, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1993.
Professor Lee received her B.A and M.A degrees from Wayne State University in 1945 and 1947, respectively. She then pursued graduate studies at
Radcliffe College, where she received a second M.A degree in 1948. She received
her Ph.D. degree from Radcliffe College and Harvard University in 1955. After
teaching at Wayne State University and Henry Ford Community College, Professor Lee joined the University of Michigan-Dearborn as an assistant professor of
comparative literature in 1972. She was promoted to associate professor in 1974
and to professor in 1978.
A very active faculty member who has contributed to all aspects of university life, Professor Lee is held in very high esteem by her faculty colleagues. She
was instrumental in establishing the Dearborn campus' comparative literature
program and developed and taught a wide variety of courses ranging from
African-American literature to Western world literature. She is perhaps best
known, however, for her course on myth and motif in literature. Through the
years, the outstanding student evaluations for this course have attested to
Professor Lee's reputation as an excellent instructor.


126




November Meeting, 1993


In addition to her excellence as a teacher, Professor Lee has also established
herself as a scholar. She has given numerous presentations at conferences in her
field and has authored publications on figures and topics as varied as James
Baldwin, African-American drama, Miguel de Unamuno, Harriet Arnow, and
Toni Morrison. In recognition of her outstanding attributes as a faculty member,
Professor Lee was awarded the University of Michigan-Dearborn's Distinguished
Teaching Award and Women's Commission Susan B. Anthony Award in 1985,
and the Michigan Association of Governing Boards of Colleges and Universities'
Distinguished Faculty Award in 1987.
The Regents now salute this teacher-scholar for her dedicated service by
naming Dorothy A Lee professor emerita of English and comparative literature.
Theophilus S. Lynch, professor of Spanish and comparative literature at
the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on May 31,
1993, after a most productive career as a teacher, advisor, and department leader.
Professor Lynch received his B.A degree from Williams College in 1947,
following distinguished service in the Pacific theater of action during World War
II. He then went on to receive his M.A and Ph.D. degrees from the University of
Pennsylvania in 1951 and 1959, respectively. Professor Lynch taught at Rutgers
University and Ohio University prior to joining UM-Flint in 1966 as an associate
professor without tenure. He was awarded tenure in 1968 and was promoted to
fill professor in 1972.
A knowledgeable and caring teacher, Professor Lynch has had a following of
devoted students throughout his long career at the University. At the time of his
arrival on the Flint campus, the foreign language department had no faculty in
Spanish. Professor Lynch was responsible for founding the campus' program in
Spanish, which is currently the most popular language program at UM-Flint.
This popularity is in no small measure attributable to his wisdom, dedication,
and skill. After founding the Spanish program, Professor Lynch demonstrated an
astonishing versatility by offering classes in Portuguese and Latin. A respected
scholar in Spanish and Portuguese literature, Professor Lynch has always carried
his learning and his dedication into the classroom, along with a characteristic
touch of humor. He has been an inspiration to his students and a source of
strength to his colleagues in the college.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Theophilus S. Lynch professor emeritus of Spanish and
comparative literature.
Henryk Skolimowski, professor of humanities in the College of Engineering, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1993.
Born in Poland, Professor Skolimowski attended the Warsaw College of
Music from 1948-52. He received his M.Sc. degree from the Warsaw Institute of
Technology in 1956, his M.A degree from the University of Warsaw in 1959, and
his Ph.D. degree from Oxford University in 1964. From 1964-70, Professor Skolimowski taught at the University of Southern California. He joined the University
of Michigan as a visiting associate professor in the College of Engineering's Department of Humanities in 1970. He was promoted to professor in 1972 and
achieved tenure in 1974.


127




November Meeting, 1993


Throughout his tenure at the University of Michigan, Professor Skolimowski has pursued his study of ecological humanism and eco-philosophy. He
has also held visiting professorships at Madras University in India; the California
Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco; and the University of Warsaw in
Poland.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his many years of dedicated
service by naming Henry Skolimowski professor emeritus of humanities.
Memorials. No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees. Provost Whitaker also submitted the December 1993 Horace H.
Rackham School of Graduate Studies Doctoral Degree list; the May 1993 Law
School final degree list; the August 1993 final degree lists for various school, colleges, divisions, and branch campuses; and changes in previously approved degree lists. A copy of each degree list is on file in the Office of the Secretary of the
University.
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved the remainder of the consent agenda as listed above.
Executive officer salaries. Regent Baker commented that he disagreed
with the salary levels of some of the executive officers; he pointed out that these
salaries are not set by the Regents. Regent Deitch responded that he believes the
salary levels set for the executive officers are appropriate, and that it was injurious to the officers to state that he disagreed with some of the salaries for particular officers.
Henry Russel Lecturer
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
approved the appointment of Elizabeth M. Douvan, Catherine Neafie Kellogg
Professor of Psychology and Women's Studies, as the Henry Russel Lecturer for
1994.
University of Michigan 1993 Financial Report Supplemental Schedules
for Year Ended June 30, 1993
Executive Vice President Womack submitted the 1993 Financial Report
Supplemental Schedules for the Year Ended June 30, 1993.
Six Month Report on University Audits
Executive Vice President Womack submitted the Six Month Report on
University Audits for the period April 1, 1993, through September 30, 1993.
University Real Estate
Executive Vice President Womack submitted a proposed policy regarding
acceptance of gifts of real estate. The policy would require a phase I
environmental assessment. The acceptance of a gift of real estate would then be
subject to: the donor's indemnifying the University for any liability arising out of
violation or noncompliance with environmental law or the presence of


128




November Meeting, 1993


environmental contamination, and providing a confession of judgment stating
that if the donor breaches any of the warranties in the indemnification agreement the donor would have authorized the University to enter a judgment
against the donor to rescind the transfer so that the University is removed from
the chain of title. The Regents Communication also requests certain amendments to Regents' Bylaw Section 3.07.
Executive Vice President Womack described the recent history of properties
that have been donated to the University, noting that the average holding period
of properties that have been sold is nine years, with an average holding period for
all unsold properties of twelve years. The properties that have been sold have
totalled $1 million, with expenses for holding those properties being $350,000.
Sixty percent of the total amount of property sold was derived from four
properties.
Executive Vice President Womack stated that the University did not intend
to dissuade donors from giving valuable properties to the institution. However, it
is often the case that real estate donated to the University is not very valuable.
The proposed policy yields maximum protection to the University.
Vice President Cosovich said that the development office had helped develop
the proposed policy and was in support of it. He noted that the University does
not actively seek gifts of real estate, and such gifts do not constitute a large
component of development activity.
In the discussion that followed, the Regents expressed concern over the
attempt to protect the University from liability versus creating a disincentive for
people to donate real estate. Particular concern was directed toward the "confession of judgment" provision, with Regents Power, Deitch, and Brown noting that
this could be viewed as a "donor-unfriendly" requirement that would constitute a
disincentive to donate. Regent Deitch suggested as an alternative that a deed be
placed in escrow at the time a gift is made.
Executive Vice President Womack responded that this would not solve the
problem of removing the University from the chain of title. Regent McFee stated
that the intent of the proposal, to protect the University from liability, was of
critical importance. Regent Brown expressed support for Regent Deitch's suggestion of placing a deed in escrow back to the donor, but also expressed doubt that
either a confession of judgment or a deed in escrow would totally protect the
University from liability for environmental contamination.
In response to other comments, Executive Vice President Womack pointed
out that most of the real estate donated to the University consists of vacant lots
and some residences, and the University must expend resources to cary that
property until it is sold. He also noted that the proposed policy specifically
exempts property considered for academic and research programs of the
University.
President Duderstadt suggested that the Regents consider moving forward
with the phase I environmental assessment provisions, with the understanding


129




November Meeting, 1993


that University officials exercise judgment in enforcing the confession of judgment provision.
Regent Deitch stated that the discussion had convinced him that there is
nothing wrong with the University's saying that there are certain types of gifts
that it really doesn't want. The confession of judgment makes the indemnity
stronger and helps to discourage this type of giving. He moved that the policy be
adopted with the understanding that if, in a particular circumstance, it is felt
that there is good cause for a waiver, that can be recommended to the Board.
Regent Brown seconded the motion, but suggested that language of exception be written into the policy. Regent Deitch expressed agreement with that
suggestion; Executive Vice President Womack suggested the motion be voted on
with the understanding that such language would thereafter be drafted that
would accommodate the discussion.
In response to a question from Regent Baker about the tax consequences for
the donor when a gift is accepted conditionally, Executive Vice President
Womack stated that this issue would be considered in the additional language to
be drafted.
There being no further discussion, the vote was taken, and the following
motion was approved unanimously, with the understanding that the additional
language outlined in the discussion will be incorporated and brought back to the
Regents, and that the bylaw revision will be subject to the normal bylaw revision
procedures:
Modifications to Real Estate Policy
Prior to accepting a gift of real estate, the University will require the
donor to provide a Phase I environmental assessment;
*   If the property is environmentally acceptable, the donor will be
required to execute an Agreement to Indemnify and a Confession of
Judgment, except for residential properties, in which case the
University may, under appropriate circumstances, decide not to
require a Confession of Judgment;
The donor will agree to pay all expenses associated with the land
including taxes and assessments until the property is sold. (Property
in the state of Michigan will be removed from the tax rolls in the
year following the gift.)
Bylaw Sec. 3.07, subsections la. and lb., as revised (additions underlined)
a.  All sales of donated or bequeathed real estate located outside the Ann Arbor,
Dearborn, or Flint campus areas regardless of the sales price; real estate that
funds a Unitrust for any amount or location; and bequeathed or devised real
property requiring action by an estate executor, personal representative or trustee
may be approved and authorized by the executive vice president and chief financial officer.dllfThe resulting land contracts and deeds will be executed by both


130




November Meeting, 1993


the president and the executive vice president and chief financial officer. These
transactions will be reported to the Regents in an item for information.
b.   Any sale authorized by the executive vice president and chief financial officer
must equal or exceed the appraised value except for fractional interest estate
1Qproperties. For those properties held in an estate in which the University's interest is fractional, the University will cooperate with the estate's legally appointed representative regarding terms and appraisal requirements to
accomplish a sale.
Donor Pooled Income Fund
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
voted unanimously to adopt the following resolution, which authorizes changes
in the trusteeship and investment management of the Donor Pooled Income
Fund and appointment of a custodian of the Donor Pooled Income Fund's assets.
RESOLUTION TO CHANGE THE SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE AND
INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE DONOR POOLED INCOME FUND
AND TO AMEND THE DECLARATION OF TRUST
OF THE DONOR POOLED INCOME FUND
WHEREAS, NBD Bank, NA was appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan
as successor trustee of the Donor Pooled Income Fund upon its creation in 1975, and now wishes
to resign as successor trustee;
WHEREAS, under the Declaration of Trust of the Donor Pooled Income Fund, the
Regents of the University of Michigan have retained authority to remove and appoint a
replacement successor trustee;
WHEREAS, subject to confirmation by the Probate Court of the resignation of NBD
Bank, NA and the University's acceptance of the bank's resignation; and,
WHEREAS, subject to confirmation by the Probate Court of the Regents' exercise of their
reserved power to appoint a replacement successor trustee;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby authorize, approve, and direct the following:
1.   Acceptance of the resignation of NBD Bank, NA, as successor trustee;
2.   Appointment of the Regents of the University of Michigan to be successor
trustee, in exercise of their authority reserved in Article 2.1 of the Declaration
of Trust of the Donor Pooled Income Fund;
3.   Appointment of NBD Bank, NA as investment manager of the Donor Pooled
Income Fund;
4.   All actions necessary by the appropriate University executive officers to make
and execute amendments of the Declaration of Trust to appoint a custodian of
the Donor Pooled Income Fund.
Estate of Helen F. Weber-Real Estate
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved acceptance of the offer of St. John Real Estate Company
to purchase the NE 1/4 of the SW 1/4, the N 1/2 of the SE 1/4, and the SE 1/4 of


131




November Meeting, 1993


the SE 1/4, Section 34, T41N, R25W, Harris Township, Menominee County at a
price of $34,500, subject to the retention of the mineral rights by the University.
State Funded Capital Projects
This is a request for authorization to finance initial construction cash flow
requirements for two major projects to be financed by the State Building Authority (SBA)-the Integrated Technology Instruction Center (ITIC) and Central
Campus Renovations-through the issuance of bond anticipation notes secured
by a pledge of student fees.
Regent Brown moved the following: that the cash flow requirements, for up
to $12.0 million, be financed through the issuance of bond anticipation notes
which will mature no later than June 30, 1994. The bond anticipation notes will
ultimately be reimbursed from the SBA bond or note sale proceeds. The University believes that the SBA will be in a position to retire the University's bond
anticipation notes on a timely basis. In the unlikely event that the State/SBA are
not in a position to either retire the notes or provide for the balance of the
construction cash flow requirements, we will be obliged to return to the Regents
with an alternative financing plan which could include the issuance of renewed
notes or Student Fee Bonds which would be amortized over a period of up to
thirty years. As a final source of payment the University will covenant to use legally available funds to pay the principal and interest on the Notes. It is anticipated that the sale of the tax-exempt bond anticipation notes will be through a
public competitive bid process whereby the University will prepare and circulate
a preliminary official statement and a notice of sale requesting bids.
Regent Brown further moved adoption of a resolution (see Appendix A, page
137) that authorizes the executive vice president and chief financial officer to:
1. develop the terms and legal documentation for the Bond
Anticipation Notes, and to prepare, circulate and execute
preliminary and final official statements describing the Bond
Anticipation Notes, the University and its affairs; and
2.  apply for and obtain from   Moody's Investors Service and
Standard & Poor's Corporation their ratings on the Bond
Anticipation Notes; and
3.  publish a notice of sale, receive bids, award the Bond
Anticipation Notes to the winning bidder, execute an order
establishing the terms of notes, and execute and deliver the
notes.
Regent Varner seconded the motion. Regent Baker expressed concern that
the state will be able to follow through on its commitment to finance the projects.
In response, Vice President Kennedy stated that the State Building Authority
has given all necessary approvals; this action will merely use the University's
funds, rather than state ftinds, as cash flow to finance the early part of construction. It is anticipated that these funimds will be reimbursed by the SBA within the


132




November Meeting, 1993


first six months of 1994. Regent Baker observed that there is a high risk that the
state will not be able to follow through on this commitment.
Following further discussion, the vote was taken and the motion was
approved, with Regents Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, Varner, and
Waters in favor and Regent Baker opposed.
North Campus Bell Tower
Executive Vice President Womack reported that a potential donor has
expressed a strong interest in the construction of a bell tower to be sited
somewhere in the vicinity of the future North Campus diag.
In response to a comment from Regent Power, Executive Vice President
Womack stated that the Regents would have an opportunity to review the plans
for the structure before its construction. In response to a question from Regent
Deitch, Provost Whitaker reported that a bell tower was part of a much larger
gift and that the idea of a bell tower was very important to the donor.
Regent Baker asked for clarification as to whether the project was a carillon
or a bell tower. Provost Whitaker responded that it involves both the structure
(the bell tower) and the bells within the structure (the carillon). Regent Deitch
moved approval of initiating the design of a bell tower for North Campus and selecting Moore/Andersson Architects in conjunction with Hobbs + Black Associates, Inc., as the design architect. Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
Renovation/Construction Projects
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
unanimously approved replacement of the air handling unit at the University
Hospital Med Inn Building and construction of a Radrick Farms recreation
facility.
University of Michigan Hospitals Radiology Angiographic Equipment
Replacement and Renovations
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved purchase of three angiographic imaging systems and
completion of renovations for equipment installation in the Radiology
Department at University of Michigan Hospitals.
University of Michigan Hospitals Radiation Oncology Linear Accelerator Replacement
Regent Waters moved, Regent Power seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved submission of a Certificate of Need to the Michigan Department of Public Health for $2,266,800 to replace one of the linear accelerator
treatment machines in the Radiation Oncology Department.


133




November Meeting, 1993


University of Michigan Hospitals Supplemental Certificate of Need for
Patient Care Information System
Regent Deitch moved approval for submission of a supplemental Certificate
of Need to the Michigan Department of Public Health for a patient care information system, increasing the budget limit from $7 million to $30 million. Regent
Waters seconded the motion, and following some discussion about the specific
features of the technology, it was approved unanimously.
Restriction on Equity Investments in Companies Operating in
South Africa
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved adoption of the following resolution:
RESOLUTION REGARDING UNIVERSITY INVESTMENTS
IN ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING IN THE
REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
WHEREAS the Regents have expressed repeatedly their conviction that the system of
apartheid and the oppressive practices of the government of the Republic of South Africa related
thereto are immoral and unconscionable; and
WHEREAS in March 1983 the Regents, acting in support of anti-apartheid efforts,
directed the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to take prudent action to divest equity
investments in any organizations operating in the Republic of South Africa and to make no
further equity investments in such companies; and
WHEREAS Nelson Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress, in an address to
the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid on September 4, 1993, called for an
end to economic sanctions, declaring, "To strengthen the forces of democratic change, and to
help create the necessary conditions for stability and social progress, we believe that the time has
come when the international community should lift all economic sanctions against South
Africa"; and
WHEREAS Mr. Mandela called for help in "halting the slide to a socioeconomic disaster in
South Africa," noting that millions of South Africans "have no food, no jobs, no homes"; and
WHEREAS Mr. Mandela made his statement the day after the Parliament of the Republic
of South Africa adopted a package of laws intended to provide Black citizens with a voice in the
government of their nation; and
WHEREAS President Clinton eliminated remaining U.S. trade sanctions and indicated
that his administration will encourage investment in South Africa, stating, "This call from this
courageous man who has been one of the principal victims of apartheid means that the leading
groups in South Africa now oppose the maintenance of economic sanctions on their country";
IT IS THEREFORE RESOLVED that the Board removes the investment restrictions
placed in resolutions adopted in March 1983 as modified in September 1985 and October 1988,
and directs the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to take prudent action to
effect the change in investment policy.
Reassignment of University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual Property (Michael L. Boninger, M.D.)
Regent Brown moved, Regent Waters seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved a modified standard assignment agreement with Michael L.


134




November Meeting, 1993


Boninger, M.D., for the intellectual property "Fall Prevention Sock" (UM   File
No. 781). Because Dr. Boninger is both a party to the agreement and a University employee, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Contract. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to the assignment agreement(s) will be the University of Michigan and
Michael L. Boninger, M.D.
2.   Terms of the contract include: standard terms in accordance with those previously disclosed to and approved by the Regents on July 16, 1987, with the
following exceptions:
The first sentence of Paragraph 2c requiring the inventor to use due diligence
in pursuing a patent has been deleted. The inventor hopes to pursue a patent
and commercialize the invention through the University of Pittsburgh (see below) but cannot insure it.
The first sentence of paragraph 2d requiring the inventor to submit annual
reports of patenting and commercialization activity has also been deleted.
Pursuant to section 12, approval has been given to the inventor to assign his
interests in the invention to the University of Pittsburgh where he is now
employed.
3.   The pecuniary interests were previously disclosed to and approved by the
Regents on July 16, 1987, and are hereby incorporated by reference in this
action request.
Change in Name of Physics/Engineering Science Department at
UM-Flint
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved changing the name of the Physics/Engineering Science
Department at UM-Flint to the Physics and Engineering Science Department.
Revision of Regents' Bylaws Concerning Titles of Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer
Regent Deitch moved that all affected sections of the Regents' Bylaws in
which the titles "provost and vice president for academic affairs" and "vice president and chief financial officer" appear be amended to read "provost and executive vice president for academic affairs" and "executive vice president and chief
financial officer," respectively. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
Recommendations for Appointment to Medical Staff Membership
On the recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals executive
board Regent Brown moved, Regent Waters seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved several appointments to medical staff membership.

APPENDIX A
RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF BOND ANTICIPATION
NOTES IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOT TO EXCEED $12,000,000
TO TEMPORARILY FINANCE PART OF THE COST OF ACQUISITION
CONSTRUCTION, RENOVATION AND EQUIPPING OF CERTAIN PROJECTS
AND RELATED COSTS, AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE
NOTES AND OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO.
WHEREAS, in the exercise of their constitutional duties and in order to properly serve the
needs of students attending The University of Michigan (the "University"), the Regents of the
University of Michigan (the "Issuer") has authorized the acquisition, construction and equipping

149




December Meeting, 1993


One of 32 students nationwide chosen to receive a Rhodes scholarship, Leah is the first woman from the University of Michigan and
the first UM student since 1980 to be selected for this most prestigious honor.
Leah Niederstadt has taken full advantage of the wealth of opportunities available at the University, and the University in turn
has been enriched by her presence. With a dual major in political
science and Afroamerican and African studies, she has not only received numerous academic honors, but has been captain of the
women's rugby team, held leadership positions in her sorority, and
served as a volunteer for student, Greek, and community groups, all
while completely financing her education through employment in
various positions both within the University and elsewhere. Described by her professors as "a student of extraordinary talent and
ability," Leah plans to use her Rhodes scholarship to pursue a
master's degree in social anthropology at Oxford University.
It is with great pride that the Regents commend this outstanding young woman of Michigan for her remarkable achievement in
being named a 1994 Rhodes Scholar.
Ms. Niederstadt came forward to receive her resolution. There followed a
round of applause, and the motion was adopted by acclamation. Ms. Niederstadt
expressed her gratitude at the educational opportunities that the University had
provided her.
Resolution in Honor of 1994 British Marshall Scholar
President Duderstadt called on Regent Power, a former Marshall Scholar
from the University of Michigan, who read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend Michael K.
Weiss on his selection as a 1994 British Marshall Scholar.
A native of West Bloomfield, Michigan, Michael is an honors
student with a triple major in math, physics, and English and a
nearly perfect grade point average. He is the University's first
Marshall Scholar since 1987.
Described by one of his professors as "one of the most brilliant
students I have ever encountered in my 27-year career at Michigan,"
Michael Weiss is a multifaceted young man who also excels in creative writing and participates in community theater. He plans to use
his British Marshall scholarship to study mathematics at Cambridge
University in England.
The Regents take great pride in adding Michael K. Weiss to the
roster of the University of Michigan's "leaders and best."
The motion was approved by acclamation; Ms. Niederstadt accepted the
resolution on behalf of Mr. Weiss, who was not present.

December Meeting, 1993


CESF Report, Ann Arbor Campus
President Duderstadt called on Professor John Tropman, chair of the
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty, to present the CESF Report.
Professor Tropman expressed appreciation for the 1993 salary program and
urged that consideration be given to expanding and enhancing it. He noted that
SACUA had asked CESF to transmit its request for a 10 percent salary program
in 1994-95, but pointed out that CESF was not recommending a specific percentage increase. Professor Tropman observed that among faculty, there is a perception that there is a greater difference between academic and administrative
compensation than is actually the case.
Professor Tropman also noted that CESF is working with the administration to explore innovative compensation practices. CESF is also evaluating the
experimental program of one-time salary increases that are not added to base
pay. In addition, CESF has also been involved in the process of developing a flexible benefits program.
President Duderstadt stated that the advice and counsel of CESF has been
very important in the development of a flexible benefits program. He then gave a
presentation on the current faculty and executive officer compensation strategy,
the details of which are on file in the Office of the Secretary of the University.
Professor Tropman commented on various aspects of the compensation policy and gave suggestions as to how compensation issues might be further
explored.
Regents Power and Deitch commented about the usefulness of such discussions about compensation policy and about the importance of having a policy in
place and publicly articulated.
Campus Safety
Regent McGowan observed that a woman had been raped in a University
parking lot outside of a residence hall at the end of November. She noted that the
president had written a letter to the community and had asked Vice Presidents
Hartford and Womack to report on what could be done to minimize the chances
of this occurring again.
President Duderstadt stated that he was horrified by the incident and called
on Vice President Hartford to comment on the current situation. Vice President
Hartford reported on the activities of staff from the Department of Public Safety,
the Dean of Students' Office, the Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Center (SAPAC), the University Planner's Office, and other areas with regard to
dealing with this situation. She reported that three action steps were being taken
immediately: an assessment of lighting, both on campus and in nearby areas;
education about safety for both men and women to be provided by a variety of
methods, including self-defense classes; and an assessment of safety issues associated with the medical campus. The Department of Public Safety was also going
to increase the number of staff on the streets and in the parking structures.


151




December Meeting, 1993


Following further discussion, the president noted that he is personally
involved in studying these issues, and that they would receive fill attention at
the highest levels of the administration.
Annual Report on Research for 1993
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Neal to present the annual
report on research. Vice President Neal stated that the four goals of the Office of
the Vice President for Research (OVPR) are to 1) promote research, scholarship,
and creative activities; 2) help set national research priorities; 3) assure that
conduct of research is consistent with the University's mission and principles;
and 4) facilitate the transfer of knowledge. He then reviewed progress towards
those goals by reporting that the University ranks number one in total research
and development expenditures among the top twenty public universities and
colleges and number two in expenditures among all universities and colleges,
with total research expenditures of $373.7 million in FY 1993. Federal research
expenditures have increased over the past ten years, while non-federal and
university expenditures have remained flat.
Vice President Neal then reviewed the factors influencing both the national
and local environments for research support and the challenges these factors
pose for the future of the U.S. research university. The OVPR is currently focusing its efforts on developing policies and an agenda regarding research integrity
issues; assessing internal research funding needs; advancing new research initiatives; developing a long-range research plan for the campus; influencing the
national research agenda; developing the local campus infrastructure; and promoting economic development.
Vice President Neal concluded by reviewing several specific initiatives being
undertaken by his office in the area of academic integrity and internal funding
issues. Following some discussion, the Regents turned to consideration of the
regular agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Deitch, the
Regents unanimously approved the minutes for the November 1993 meeting.
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports of investments, plant extension, litigation, and personnel-labor relations and Vice President Neal submitted reports of projects established and summaries of a selection
of current research.

December Meeting, 1993


Professor Bartell's research involves the use of electron diffraction to examine the structure of molecules in the gas and, more recently, the structure of matter in the condensed phases. He has published over 261 journal articles and 10
textbook chapters. His pioneering efforts have extended the precision of the electron diffraction technique and revealed many new areas in which to apply it. The
first photographs of single atoms and molecules were produced by Professor Bartell's ingenious holographic method, based on the combination of electron
diffraction and laser illumination. He has also made significant contributions
towards understanding the basic quantum mechanical paradoxes raised by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.
Professor Bartell has been a leader in the field of molecular mechanics to
describe molecular structure and conformational changes. He has consistently
upheld the highest standards of scholarly performance and teaching excellence,
and has contributed broadly in many areas of both the Department of Chemistry
and the University of Michigan.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physical chemist by naming
Lawrence S. Bartell the Philip J. Elving Professor Emeritus of Chemistry.

named an Outstanding Educator of America in 1975. In addition to his teaching,
research, and honors, he has been involved with the student accounting fraternity, Beta Alpha Psi. Professor Chastain has been an avid researcher through the
years and continues to write and publish in many leading journals.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated service
by naming Clark E. Chastain professor emeritus of accounting.
Walter HL Clark, Jr., associate professor of English language and literature, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1993, after a productive career as a writer and teacher.
A native of Massachusetts, Professor Clark received his B.A degree from
Swarthmore College (1954) and his Ph.D. degree from Harvard University
(1965). He came to the University of Michigan as an assistant professor in 1965
and was promoted to associate professor in 1970. Professor Clark received the

the National Council of Teachers of English and on various editorial boards and
was a Fulbright lecturer at the University of Graz in Australia in 1971-72.
Professor Clark has published numerous articles on education and on such
writers as Robert Frost and J. F. Powers and, more recently, on teaching environmental literature. His poetry has appeared widely in Harvard Magazine, The
New York Times, The Iowa Review, and The Michigan Quarterly Review, among
other places. A book of his poetry, View From Mount Paugus (1976), was nominated for the Lamont Award.
In the course of an outstanding teaching career at Michigan, Professor
Clark has taught courses ranging from introductory composition to problems in
critical theory. He has been particularly active in preparing students for teaching
English at the secondary level. In 1975, Professor Clark, with the help of a colleague, founded the New England Literature Program offered in New Hampshire during the spring half-term and devoted to reading New England authors
in the setting in which they wrote. The program continues in vigorous health
today and is regarded by many students who have participated in it as the


163




December Meeting, 1993


highlight of their undergraduate experiencee The New England Literature Program is recognized nationally as a model of environmentally based education

nurturing and publicizing this innovative educational experiment.
The Regents now salute this distinguished writer and teacher by naming
Walter H. Clark, Jr., associate professor emeritus of English language and
literature.
Sylvia S. Hacker, associate professor of community health nursing in the
School of Nursing and associate professor of population planning and international health in the School of Public Health, will retire from active faculty status
on December 31, 1993.
A native of New York City, Professor Hacker completed her B.A degree in
1946 at Brooklyn College, her M.S. degree in 1966 at the State University of New
York at Cortland, and her Ph.D. degree in 1977 at the University of Michigan.
Since joining the University of Michigan faculty in 1975, Professor Hacker
has become widely known within the University, the state, and the nation for her
expertise in the area of human sexuality and her skill in communicating this
expertise to others. She has published extensively, both in professional journals
and lay magazines, and her new book, What Teenagers REALLY Want to Know
About Sex, co-authored with her daughter, has just been published. She was
certified as a sex educator in 1988 by the American Association of Sex Educators,
Counselors, and Therapists.
Professor Hacker is well known and respected for her forthrightness and
ability to stimulate and manage constructive dialogue in the often controversial
area of human sexuality in secondary schools, colleges and universities, and
community organizations. She engages and challenges her audience, with humor,
to identify and examine their values and positions on sensitive social and political
issues and to continuously pursue credible evidence in forming their positions.
Professor Hacker has shown remarkable personal and professional courage in
the face of provocation and conflict and has made effective use of the mass media
in doing so. She hosts a community access call-in television program, "Sexy
Minutes;" has been interviewed on numerous radio and television shows, including "The Phil Donahue Show"; and has been cited in many national publications.
She also serves as a consultant to the teen magazine, Sassy.
Professor Hacker has received awards from the Michigan Department of
Public Health, Mensa, and lesbian and gay male civil rights groups. At the University, she received the Mae Edna Doyle Teacher of the Year Award from the
School of Nursing in May 1993. Evaluations of her teaching skills indicate that
she challenges people's values, stimulates their thinking, and helps them develop,
articulate, and defend their positions in the area of human sexuality.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Sylvia S. Hacker
associate professor emerita of community health nursing and associate professor
emerita of population planning and international health.
Regent Deitch noted the retirement of Professor Bernard Klein, and

1992-93.
As a teacher-scholar, Professor Klein introduced into the curriculum such
new areas of study as urban politics, public administration, and public sector
labor relations. Professor Klein resisted becoming a full-time administrator in order to return to his first love, teaching. He received the UM-Dearborn's Distinguished Teaching Award, tenured category, in 1990 and the Distinguished
Faculty Award- from the Michigan Association of Governing Boards of State
Universities in 1991. Professor Klein authored and co-authored a number of

committees. Dr. McPhee's professional affiliations include membership and
offices in the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Crown and
Bridge Prosthodontics, the American and the International Associations for
Dental Research, and the Inter-Society Color Council. He has been on the
executive council of the American Association of Dental Schools and served on
the executive committee and as president of the Francis B. Vedder Society of
Crown and Bridge.
Known for his dedication to teaching, Dr. McPhee was chosen by secondyear dental students as Instructor of the Year in both 1984 and 1985. His
research has focused on porcelain, ceramo-metal, and ceramic restorations and
techniques, and the results of his studies have been published as journal articles,
manuals, and chapters in texts. Dr. McPhee has also developed nearly 20 television teaching tapes, primarily in restorative materials and procedures.
In support of his promotion to professor, Dr. McPhee was repeatedly characterized as a "devoted worker" and a "dedicated teacher," who endeavored to
"improve teaching and advance his profession through research." Another of his
colleagues pointed out that his background in engineering added a new dimension in "helping solve departmental problems, research, and dentistry in
general."
The Regents now salute this distinguished health sciences educator by
naming E. Richard McPhee professor emeritus of dentistry.
Ilene T. Olken, professor of Italian, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 1993, following 33 years as a teacher and scholar of Italian,
French, and comparative literature in the Department of Romance Languages
and Literatures.
Professor Olken completed four degrees at the University of Michigan,
including an AB. degree in 1950, an AM. degree in English and education in
1952, a second AM. degree in French in 1955, and a Ph.D. degree in French and
Italian in 1959. She joined the faculty in 1960 as an instructor in French; she was

book, With Pleated Eye and Garnet Wing: Symmetries of Italo Calvino (1984),
two textbooks, several editions of Italian works for use in the classroom, and a
number of articles on French and Italian literature.
She will be remembered by her many former students for her affectionate
concern for their welfare, her insistence that they measure themselves against
the highest intellectual standards, and above all for the passion with which she
defended the idea of a humanistically conceived, rather than a technically or
theoretically oriented mode of criticism.


166




December Meeting, 1993


The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and scholar and recognize her many years of devoted service to the University by naming Ilene T.
Olken professor emerita of Italian.
Memorials. Provost Whitaker submitted the following memorial
statement:
The Regents of the University acknowledge with profound sadness the
death on November 26, 1993, of Marshall H. Becker, professor of health
behavior and health education in the School of Public Health and professor of
health behavior, Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, in the
Medical School.
Professor Becker was born in New York City in 1940. He received his B.S.
degree from City University of New York in 1962. He received his M.S. degree in
public health in 1964 and his Ph.D. degree in medical sociology in 1968, both
from the University of Michigan. He began his teaching and research career at
The John Hopkins University in 1969 and joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1977.
Professor Becker's research and writing about compliance with medical regimens and factors influencing preventive and disease management actions placed
him in the forefront of health behavior research. He authored or co-authored 120
articles on these subjects. He was editor of the Health Education Quarterly from
1979-86 and served on the editorial boards of six other scholarly journals. He
chaired the Department of Health Behavior and Health Education from 1983-87
and served as associate dean for academic affairs in the School of Public Health
from 1987-93. Professor Becker was a consummate teacher whose courses consistently attracted hundreds of registrants from throughout the campus. He was
frequently honored for his accomplishments: he received the Distinguished Fellow Award from the Society for Public Health Education in 1981, the Mayhew
Derryberry Award from the Public Health Education Section of the American
Public Health Association in 1982, and the Distinguished Faculty Achievement
Award from the University of Michigan in 1988. In 1987, he was elected to the
Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences.
Notwithstanding these achievements, Marshall Becker will be remembered
as well for his extraordinary wit and humanity. His sense of humor was brilliant,
his concern for students unmatched, and his pursuit of academic excellence relentless. In addition to these gifts, the astonishing courage and steadfastness he
showed in the face of intractable illness was an inspiration to all who knew him.
As we mourn his death, our condolences go to his wife Felicia, son David, and
daughter Ruth.
Regent Brown read the following memorial statement in honor of Regent
Emeritus Eugene Power:
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with great sadness
the death of their friend and colleague, Eugene B. Power.
An ingenious businessman, "Gene" Power pioneered the application of
microfilm to the storage and reproduction of scholarly materials. The company


167




December Meeting, 1993


he founded, University Microfilms, became so successful it merged with the
Xerox Corporation, and both have since prospered.
Gene Power's contributions to education and the arts were legendary. He
was both a Regent of the University and president of the National Association of
College Governing Boards. He served on the board of the National Foundation
for the Arts and was the driving force behind the now firmly established Ann
Arbor Summer Festival. His philanthropies, too numerous to recount in their
entirety, included the enabling grant for the University's Power Center for the
Performing Arts and Power Exchange Scholarships, and the Power Island
Nature Conservancy in his old home town of Traverse City. He was also a man of
boundless energy, as all will attest who ventured into the water polo competition
that was a part of his weekly regimen.
Gene Power's legacy extends broadly and deeply:  to the industry he
founded, to the university he loved, to the community he served, and to the
family he shared. The Regents extend to that family, and especially to Gene's son
Philip, who so ably serves as a Regent himself, their heartfelt sympathy and condolences at this most difficult loss.
President Duderstadt called for a moment of silence in memory of Regent
Emeritus Power. He then noted the death of Charles Moore, the architect who
designed the North Campus Engineering Center.
Degrees. There were no actions with respect to degrees this month.
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regents Waters, the Regents

Estate of Helen F. Weber-Real Estate
The Regents were informed of the sale of a parcel of land in Republic Township, Marquette County (the N /2 of the NE 1/4 and the SW 1/4 of the NE /4,
Section 18, T47N, R30W), at a price of $22,500.
International Equity Investments
Regent Deitch moved, Regent Power seconded, and all seven Regents
present unanimously approved an increase in the allowable range for
international equity investments from 0 - 15 percent to 0 25 percent of the University Endowment Fund and participation in The Common Fund International
Equity Fund and The Common Fund Global Equity Fund. Because Norman
Herbert, the university treasurer, is both a University employee and a trustee of
The Common Fund, this arrangement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict
of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and The Common
Fund.
2.  The duration of the contract with The Common Fund will be open-ended. The
partnership will invest University Endowment Fund assets, and Norman
Herbert will attend meetings of the boards and related committees.

UM-Dearborn General Campus Renovation Project, Phase II; UMDearborn Campus Support Services Facility
Chancellor Renick reported that state funding had been approved for Phase
II of the University of Michigan-Dearborn General Campus Renovation Project.
The project will be divided into two components: the Center for Engineering
Education and Practice/Professional and Continuing Education component, and
the School of Management/Lecture Halls component. Mr. Fred Mayer, university
planner, described the proposed site and site plan, with the aid of maps and schematic drawings.
Mr. Mayer then described a proposed facility to house campus support services, to be finded from UM-Dearborn ftmds.
Following Mr. Mayer's presentation, Regent Waters moved approval of the
proposed sites for both the Center for Engineering Education Practice/Professional and Continuing Education segment and the School of Management/Lecture Halls segment of the UM-Dearborn's General Campus Renovation
Project Phase II. He also moved approval of the UM-Dearborn Campus Support
Services project and site and appointment of the firm of Ghafari Associates, Inc.,
as architect. Regent Power seconded the motions, and they were approved
unanimously.
Angell/Haven Hall Connector
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Douglas Hanna, university
architect, to describe the proposed design for this project. Mr. Hanna described
the proposed site plan and design, with the aid of maps, schematic drawings, and
an architectural model. Following his presentation, several Regents expressed a
number of concerns about various aspects of the proposed design, including issues of safety, concern that the "tunnel" portion of the space would attract graffiti, and the shape and footprint of the building.
Following extensive discussion, it was decided to have the design group reconsider the proposed design, taking into account the concerns brought forward
during the discussion. President Duderstadt suggested that the designers present


169




December Meeting, 1993


several other conceptual design options of how to use the space, with arguments
for and against each option.
University of Michigan Visitors Center Project and Student Activities
Building Improvements
Executive Vice President Womack described this proposal to construct an
addition to the Student Activities Building (SAB) to serve as a visitors center,
and to make certain renovations and improvements to the Student Activities
Building in conjunction with this project. The new facility will be used as a
central point of arrival for visitors to the campus. On a motion by Regent Brown,
seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents unanimously approved the Visitors
Center project and site, the SAB window replacement project, and the appointment of Fry Associates, Inc., as the architect.
Diag Renovation
Mr. Fred Mayer gave a presentation describing a plan for the renovation of
the Diag that has been prepared by the University's planning consultants, Johnson Johnson & Roy/inc. The project would be completed in phases as sites and
funding become available. Following some discussion, Regent Deitch moved
approval of the design concept for the renovation of the Central Diag and
authorization for its implementation on a phased basis as sites and funding
become available. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects: 1) Medical Science II
Phases II-V remodeling for the Department of Microbiology and Immunology; 2)
North Ingalls Building courtyard infill for the Department of Surgery; 3) UMDearborn Student Services Center renovations; 4) Replacement of utility service

On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved an agreement between the University of Michigan and
Medox Electro-Optics, Inc., involving a project to investigate better methods of
optical switching in laser systems. Because the project director, Gerard Mourou,
is both an employee of the University and a shareholder in Medox Electro-Optics,
Inc., this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.
The   following   information    is  provided   in  compliance    with   statutory
requirements:
1.   The parties to the agreement will be the Regents of the University of Michigan
and Medox Electro-Optics, Inc.
2.   The agreement will provide support for one graduate student research assistant
for twelve months and indirect cost at 56 percent. Dr. Mourou will directly
advise and assist the graduate student but will receive no salary from this
contract. The agreement will be consistent with standard University research
policies.
3.   In addition to Dr. Mourou's stock ownership he receives compensation as a
consultant to the company, reimbursement for attendance at meetings and
participates in profit-sharing. He will not be compensated outside of his University salary for services related specifically to this project.
Agreement between the University of Michigan and Science and Environmental Education - NORTH (SEE-NORTH)
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved an agreement between the University of Michigan and
Science and Environmental Education - NORTH (SEE-NORTH) to conduct a
joint research project. Because the project director, Mary J. Whitmore, is both a
University of Michigan employee and executive director of SEE-NORTH, this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Science and Environmental Education -NORTH (SEE-NORTH).
2.   The agreement will be a standard Michigan subcontract for one year in the
amount of $34,726. The prime award from the Michigan Department of Education is for one year in the amount of $60,259. The proposed subcontract will

December Meeting, 1993


Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and
Skills, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a license agreement between the University of Michigan
and Skills, Inc. ("Skills"). Because Carl Rinne, the developer of the technology for
which Skills intends to develop products and services (the "Technology"), is both
a shareholder in Skills and a University employee, this agreement falls under the
state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Skills, a corporation owned in part by Professor Carl Rinne.
2.   Terms of the contract include: a non-exclusive license of unlimited duration;
consideration to the University consisting of the payment of royalties, including
modest minimum annual requirements, on products incorporating the Technology, and a share of sublicensing revenues received by Skills. Skills will pay the
University royalties at a rate of 8 percent for products sold during the first five
years and 4 percent for products sold during the second five years (considered
paid up at the end of ten years). Skills will also pay the University 25 percent of
any sublicensing revenues Skills receives. Minimum royalties shall be $100 in
1994, $200 in 1995, and $300 each year thereafter. The University retains ownership of all Technology. The University retains the right to use the Technology
for research, teaching, and other educationally-related purposes and may
license it to other parties (since this is a non-exclusive license to Sldlls). Skills
shall use reasonable efforts to effectively pursue the commercial development
and exploitation of the Technology covered by the proposed license agreement.
There is no use of facilities or services of the University included in the contract
and no assignment of University employees for fulfillment of the contract.
3.   The pecuniary interest of Professor Rinne in the contract arises from his
ownership of shares of Skdlls. This equity interest will be in lieu of participation
in the sharing of royalties received by the University, in accordance with
standard University policy.

Resolution in Honor of Clinton B. Jones
In honor of the retirement of Chancellor Clinton B. Jones, Regent McFee
offered the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan are pleased to salute
and commend Clinton B. Jones as he concludes his term as chancellor of the University of Michigan-Flint.
Clinton Jones came to Flint in 1984 following his service as vice
chancellor for academic affairs at the University of HoustonDowntown. He has been the fourth and longest-serving chief


173




December Meeting, 1993


executive officer of this thriving young campus, his term having extended for more than nine years. Those nine years have been marked
by unprecedented growth and development, not only in the campus'
physical facilities, but in its programs and enrollment as well. The
physical plant has more than doubled in size, and with the completion of the new library facility it will provide the Flint community
with a total campus environment of unmatched beauty and
functionality.
But most important of all has been Clinton Jones' ability to
build bridges to the community, so that the campus has become not
only a focal point of community pride, but a powerful resource for
individual growth and learning that has inspired and challenged
young and old alike to become all that they can be. Throughout his
tenure, Chancellor Jones has been cited repeatedly by community
organizations for his dedication to the city of Flint. Fortunately, that
dedicated effort will continue, as he will continue to serve in his
faculty capacity as professor of political science.
In recognition of his exemplary service, and with deep appreciation and warm best wishes, the Regents now name Clinton B. Jones
chancellor emeritus of the University of Michigan-Flint.
The motion was adopted by acclamation.
There being no firther business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting will be held on January 20 and 21, 1994. Regents' expenses for the
month of November 1993 totalled $1,659.71.

Sang-Ln Han, Assistant Professor of Marketing, August 11, 1993
Retirement Memoirs. Provost Whitaker submitted the following retirement memoirs:
Jerome M. Clubb, professor of history in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and research scientist in the Center for Political Studies, Institute for Social Research, retired from active faculty status on January 15, 1994.
A native of Washington, Professor Clubb received his B.A, M.A, and Ph.D.
degrees from the University of Washington in 1955, 1957, and 1963, respectively.
He was a faculty member at Bowling Green State University from 1961-66. He
joined the Center for Political Studies as a research associate in 1966 and was
promoted to program director in 1970 and research scientist in 1973. He was
named lecturer in history in 1968 and was promoted to associate professor in
1971 and professor in 1973. Professor Clubb also served as executive director of
the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) from
1975-91.
Professor Clubb was a pioneer in introducing quantitative techniques of
analysis to history. Through his extensive research and publications, he demonstrated that quantitative data adds precision to historical interpretations and often yields findings that are contrary to conventional wisdom. He showed that
partisan realignment followed rather than preceded critical elections in American
history, and that political elites played a crucial role in initiating realignments by
leading, rather than responding to, shifts in voter attitudes. His championing of
quantitative techniques of analysis has had an important impact on historical
studies.
As executive director of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, Professor Clubb shaped the social sciences globally. He expanded
the disciplinary scope of ICPSR, adding history, sociology, and social work as full
partners with political science, the consortium's founding discipline. He greatly
expanded the services that ICPSR provides to support research. During his tenure as executive director, the consortium's membership greatly increased, and its
budget grew from $1.1 million to more than $3.6 million.
Professor Clubb served on numerous national and international social science advisory boards and was a founder and president of the Social Science History Association. In 1992, he was honored by being appointed to the University's
Senior Research Scientist Lectureship.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Jerome M. Clubb
professor emeritus of history and research scientist emeritus.
Eugene E. Dekker, professor of biological chemistry in the Medical
School, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1993, after a most productive career as a teacher and researcher.
A native of Indiana, Professor Dekker received his AB. degree from Calvin
College in 1949 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in 1951 and 1954, respectively,
from the University of Illinois. From 1954-56, he was an instructor in the
Department of Biological Chemistry at the University of Louisville Medical


188




January Meeting, 1994


School Professor Dekker came to the University of Michigan in 1956 as an
instructor of biological chemistry. He was promoted to assistant professor in
1958, associate professor in 1965, and professor in 1970.
Over the years, Professor Dekker has been an invaluable faculty member in
the Department of Biological Chemistry. An excellent teacher, he served as
director of several departmental courses and in 1978 was awarded the Amoco
Good Teaching Award. From 1975-88, Professor Dekker served as assistant, then
associate chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry. He also provided valuable leadership as acting chair of the department in both 1978 and 1985.
Professor Dekker has had thirty-three consecutive years of research support
by the National Institutes of Health for mammalian and bacterial studies on the
chemistry, metabolism, and enzymology of amino acids, the characterization of
new   enzymes,   and   establishing  enzyme  structure/function/regulation
interrelations. He also received ten years of support from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and five years from the National Science Foundation for studies on
nitrogen assimilation by, unusual amino acid metabolism in, and characterization of novel enzymes from plants. Professor Dekker was also awarded three
separate National Institutes of Health special research fellowships for sabbatical
leaves.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated
service by naming Eugene E. Dekker professor emeritus of biological chemistry.
Edwin J. Thomas, Fedele F. Fauri Professor of Social Work in the School
of Social Work and professor of psychology in the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1993, after 40
years of service to the University of Michigan.
A native of Flint, Professor Thomas obtained his A.B. and M.S.W. degrees in
1951 and 1953, respectively, from Wayne University, and his Ph.D. degree in social psychology from the University of Michigan in 1956. After serving as a research assistant at the Research Center for Group Dynamics from 1953-56, he
joined the faculty in 1956 as assistant professor of social work in the School of
Social Work and assistant professor of psychology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts. Professor Thomas was promoted to associate professor in
both disciplines in 1959 and to professor in 1963 and was named the Fedele F.
Fauri Professor of Social Work in 1986.
Professor Thomas is recognized as a leading scholar in the areas of behavior
modification and intervention research, with particular emphasis on role theory
and group behavior. His recent research has focused on unilateral therapy with
the spouses and families of alcohol abusers. He has published an impressive body
of articles and books, many of which have been translated into foreign languages.
He has been a visiting professor at the University of Bradford in England and
LaTrobe University in Australia.
In the School of Social Work, Professor Thomas served as head of the doctoral program in social work and social science, chair of the supervising committee for the doctoral program, and for many years as head of the human behavior
and social environment area of the school's curriculum. He also was primarily responsible for the introduction and integration of social science knowledge into
the master's program in social work Professor Thomas' retirement marks the


189




January Meeting, 1994


departure of an esteemed member of the faculty of the School of Social Work who
was devoted to the development and refinement of intervention theories and
techniques, empirically based practice, and assessments.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Edwin J. Thomas
the Fedele F. Fauri Professor Emeritus of Social Work and professor emeritus of
psychology.

discussion, the Regents took the following action with respect to investment of
the University Endowment Fund:
Alternative Fixed Income Investments

unanimously approved commitment of $15 million of the University Endowment
Fund to Summit Subordinated Debt Fund, L.P., pending the general counsel's
review of the partnership documents for legal acceptability.
Real Estate Investment
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents

February Meeting, 1994


President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and noted that Vice President Kennedy's absence was due to surgery he had had the previous day, and
that his recovery was going very well.
Regent Baker stated he had recently been a patient in the University Hospitals for a serious illness. He noted that, as one who had been involved in the
original hospitals' planning and subsequent hospitals' policy-making over several
years, there was a great difference between being a patient and being a policy
maker. Regent Baker expressed his thanks to all of the employees of the University of Michigan Hospitals who make it the wonderful institution that it is, from
those who sweep the floors, to the administrators, and to the medical staffe
1994-95 Residence Hall and Family Housing Rates
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Hartford to present the recommendation for 1994-95 residence hall and family housing rates. Vice President
Hartford reported that both the residence hall and family housing student-staff
rate committees had met and recommended rate increases of 3&95 percent for
residence halls and 3.30 percent for family housing apartments.
In response to a question from Regent McFee, it was noted that the residence hall occupancy rate is currently at 98.30 percent. Then, there being no further discussion, Regent McGowan moved approval of a rate increase of 3.95
percent for residence halls and 3.30 percent for family housing apartments for
1994-95. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regent Brown was away from the table when the vote was taken.

six months, conducted by Mr. Frank Williams, director of strategic planning in
the Office of University Relations; Mr. Jim Beck, director of marketing communications; and Mr. Joel Seguine, station manager of WUOM. Vice President Harrison, Mr. Williams, and Mr. Seguine then gave a presentation on the results of the
review.
Vice President Harrison stated that the reasons for the review were recurring budget deficits and concern about the slow growth in listener contributions
over the last five years, and increasing competition from both commercial and
other public radio stations for market share. Mr. Williams and Mr. Seguine presented the major findings of the review as well as the next steps that will be undertaken to ensure a robust future for Michigan Radio. Vice President Harrison
announced that WUOM will resume coverage of Michigan football beginning in
the fall of 1994.
Vice President Harrison, Mr. Seguine, and Mr. Williams responded to questions and comments from   the Regents about the report. Following some

Retirement Memoir. Provost Whitaker submitted the following retirement memoir:
Larry Selinker, professor of linguistics, retired from active faculty status
on December 31, 1993, following a sixteen-year career at the University of
Michigan.
Professor Selinker received his B.A degree in Near Eastern Studies from
Brandeis University in 1959 and his M.A. degree in linguistics from The American University in 1960. He completed his Ph.D. degree in languages and linguistics at Georgetown University in 1966. From 1966-75, he was assistant professor
of linguistics and director of English for foreign students at the University of
Washington. He served as a Fulbright scholar at Hebrew University from
1975-76 and was on the faculty of San Jose State University from 1976-77. Professor Selinker came to the University of Michigan in 1977 as professor of linguistics with tenure and director of the English Language Institute. He served in
the latter position until 1982.
Professor Selinker was awarded his first Fulbright professorship at the Uniersity of Edinburgh in 1968-69, where he focused on psycholinguistics related to
second language learnng. In 1975-76, he was a Fulbright professor in English
Linguistics at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where he specialized in advanced
reading in a second language for professional needs. In 1991, he received a Faculty Recognition Fund Award from the Graduate School, and that same year he
also served as a visiting professor of moder languages at Carnegie Mellon University. In 1992, Professor Selinker completed his third Fulbright professorship
at Gesamthochschule Kassel Universitaet in Germany.
Although his primary appointment was in the English Language Institute,
Professor Selinker was also on the faculty of the Department of Linguistics,
where he specialized in second language acquisition and interlanguage theory. In
recent years, he taught a popular undergraduate course, "The Good and Bad
Language Learner."
Professor Selinker is well known for his paper, "Language Transfer," which
first appeared in General Linguistics in 1969 and has since been reprinted in a
number of other journals and collections. His most recent books include Rediscovering Interlanguage (1992) and, with Susan Gass, a revised edition of Language Transfer in Language Learning (1992).
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Larry Selinker professor emeritus of linguistics.

February Meeting, 1994


Memorial Statement. Provost Whitaker submitted the following memorial statement:
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness the death on January 27, 1994, of Daniel Thoburn Snyder, professor of
dentistry.
Dr. Snyder was born in Indiana, Pennsylvania, on April 5, 1931. He received
his DoD.S. degree in 1962 and his M.S. degree in restorative dentistry in 1967,
both from the University of Michigan. He joined the faculty at the University of
Michigan School of Dentistry as a clinical instructor in 1962 and proceeded
through the ranks to reach full professor in 1974. Dr. Snyder also served as interim assistant dean for clinical affairs from 1988-91.
A devoted member of the dental profession, Dr. Snyder served as practitioner, clinician, lecturer, author, editor, and administrator. He was a mentor
and friend to many, having served for several years as a sponsor of the Christian
Medical/Dental Society. He also had been an active member of the Hemophilia
Foundation of Michigan since 1966. Dr. Snyder's memberships in professional
societies included the executive board of the American Board of Operative Den~
tistry, Omicron Kappa Upsilon, and the Society of Sigma Xi.
Daniel Snyder left an enduring mark on his students and colleagues, both
through his professional accomplishments and his personal qualities of modesty,
dedication, and quiet dignity. We mourn the loss of this distinguished scholar
and teacher and our condolences go to his wife Shirley, his three children, Stephen, Mark, and Bethel, and five grandchildren, Skylar, Kelsey, Stephanie,
Amanda, and Jennifer.

Resolution in Honor of Jack Weidenbach
Regent McFee read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan gratefully
acknowledge the dedication and service of Jack Weidenbach as he
concludes a 28-year career at the University.
Jack first came to the University in 1966 and for 22 years held
an impressive array of positions, all of which were critical to the
University's daily operation and the development of its physical
plant. From his initial appointment as manager of Willow Run
Airport, he advanced to director of plant extension (1968), director of
physical properties (1971), and finally to director of business
operations (1977). In the latter position, he oversaw the building and
maintenance of the University's physical plant and the related areas
of purchasing, public safety, and occupational safety and
environmental health.
A quiet, self-effacing man, Jack directed the explosive growth of
the campus through some of the most turbulent periods in the
University's history while never missing a step-a gentle giant to be
sure.
And then in June of 1988, at a time when he could have been
looking ahead to a quiet life of retirement, Jack was instead thrust
into the spotlight of intercollegiate athletics when he assumed the
post of associate athletic director. Jack's accomplishments in that
post and in his subsequent positions as interim director (1990), then


212




February Meeting, 1994


director (1991) of athletics have had a phenomenal impact on both
the programs and the physical facilities of the athletic department.
He has worked tirelessly to improve academic support programs for
student athletes and to strengthen women's intercollegiate athletics
to the point where true equal opportunity is now within reach. By not
only maintaining, but enhancing the tradition of Michigan athletics,
Jack proved to be a worthy successor to his illustrious predecessors.
Under his stewardship, the athletic program achieved new heights of
excellence and national recognition in many areas.
Few people have had as broad an impact on the University as
has Jack Weidenbach. In recognition of his distinguished
contributions to the University, to the athletic department, and to the
lives of its faculty, staff, and students, the Regents now name John
P. (Jack) Weidenbach Director Emeritus of Athletics.
The motion was approved by acclamation.
Naming of the Athletic Administration Building
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved naming the newly renovated athletic administration
building John P. Weidenbach Hall.
2460 Glazier Way Property
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
voted unanimously to authorize granting of a temporary construction easement
on the University's property at 2460 Glazier Way to Merlyn Contractors, Inc.
Angell Hall Renovation Project and Bid Information
Regent Deitch moved, Regent McFee seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved the expenditure of $1 million for additional renovation work on
the Angell Hall Renovation Project, as described in the Regents Communication.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the following projects: 1) Parking Services 1994 annual
maintenance program; 2) Phase IV of the Michigan Stadium renovation; and 3)
annual classroom renovations.
Joint Venture with Foote Memorial Hospital in a Radiation Oncology
Program
Executive Vice President Womack observed that this opportunity, for the
University to establish a radiation oncology service in Jackson, will be beneficial
both to Foote Memorial Hospital and the University. It represents the kind of
networking that will be the model for such activities in the future, and more such
arrangements are anticipated with other hospitals.


213




February Meeting, 1994


Regent Deitch expressed enthusiastic support for the proposal and moved
approval of the capital investment and participation by the University through
the University of Michigan Medical Center in the Foote-University Radiation Oncology joint venture under the terms and conditions described in the Regents
Communication. Regent McGowan seconded the motion. A discussion followed,
during which Regent Power observed he shared Regent Deitch's enthusiasm for
this and other similar proposals and Executive Vice President Womack responded to questions. Regent Baker asked that the Regents be allowed to review
the final agreement before it is signed. The vote was taken and the motion was
approved unanimously.
Agreements between the University of Michigan and the William
Davidson Institute at the School of Business Administration
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved a lease agreement and an administrative services agreement between the University of Michigan and the William Davidson Institute.
Because B. Joseph White, who will execute the agreements, is both president of
the William Davidson Institute and dean of the School of Business Administration, this arrangement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statuteo The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to both the Lease Agreement and the Administrative Services Agreement will be the University of Michigan and the William Davidson Institute at
the University of Michigan School of Business Administration.
2.   Terms of the Lease Agreement: Rental of 1607 sq. ft. on the ninth floor of the
School of Business Administration plus classroom and other meeting spaces at
the School assigned by the dean's office or other delegated offices of the school
at a rate of $18.00/sq. ft. or $28,927.00 annually, payable in two equal installments on September 1 and March 1 of each year. The duration of the Lease
Agreement will be three years commencing on September 1, 1993, and terminating on August 31, 1996.
The University will provide for housekeeping and custodial services and other
interior maintenance of the leased premises through its normal custodial and
service employees with appropriate recharges.

February Meeting, 1994


3.   B. Joseph White has no pecuniary interest arising from his position as the
president of the William Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan
School of Business Administration or by virtue of the above agreements.
Proposed Research Contract.between the University of Michigan and
Therapeutic Systems Research Laboratories, Inc. (TSRL)
Regent Varner moved, Regent Waters seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved a research contract between the University of Michigan and
Therapeutic Systems Research Laboratories, Inc. (TSRL, Inc.). Because the
president of TSRL, Inc., Gordon L. Amidon, is also a University employee, this
arrangement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and
TSRL, Inc.
2.   The contract to be signed is the University's standard research contract. The
University will be paid $168,150 in direct costs and $67,407 in indirect costs for
a two year project. The indirect cost amount reflects the University's full indirect cost rate.
3.   Professor Amidon's financial interest arises from his ownership of TSRL.
Proposed Subcontract between the University of Michigan and COSMic Co.
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved a subcontract between the University of Michigan and
COSMic Co. Because the owner of COSMic Co., Alfred L. Nuttall, is also a University employee, this arrangement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement will be COSMic Co. ("Company") and the Regents of
the University of Michigan.
2.   The proposed agreement is a standard University research contract. There are
no restrictions on publication or openness of the research.
The subcontract will cover partial salary costs for a research associate, instrument maker, and graduate student and equipment charges, all totaling $16,814
over a six-month period. Dr. Nuttall will supervise the project and act as project
director. Dr. Nuttall will not be reimbursed by the Company for his time on the
project as a University employee. No indirect cost will be charged since this is
an SBIR Phase I project.
3.   Dr. Nuttall is the president of the Company, serves without compensation, and
owns 100 percent of the Company.
Proposed Research Subcontract between the University of Michigan
and the Technical University in Munich, an Educational Institution in
Germany
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents approved a research subcontract between the University of Michigan and the


215




February Meeting, 1994


Technical University in Munich to complete a portion of a project fimded by a
grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute entitled "Evaluation of
Cardiac Autonomic Innervations by Positron Emission Tomography (PET)". Regent Baker abstained from voting due to a conflict of interest.
The original principal investigator of the project, Markus Schwaiger, has
since left the University of Michigan to accept a position with the Technical University in Munich. However, he remains a key collaborator and plans to continue
his participation through a subcontract issued by the National Institute of Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute. Because Dr. Schwaiger is an adjunct professor, without remuneration, at the University of Michigan, this arrangement falls under
the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the subcontract will be the Technical University in Munich and the
Regents of the University of Michigan.
2.  The subcontract will obligate the Technical University in Munich to complete a
portion of the research project. The subcontract will cover work from June 1,
1993, through January 31, 1995, and will be in the amount of $110,687. It is expected that the agreement will be continued for an additional two years, at comparable funding levels, subject to continued funding from the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute. The specific scope of work and detailed budget will
be set forth in the subcontract.
3.  Professor Schwaiger does not and will not receive a salary or other pecuniary
benefit from the University of Michigan during the life of the project.
Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities Report of Judicial
Activity
The Regents received a report of judicial activity under the Statement of
Student Rights and Responsibilities for the period January 1, 1993, to February
1, 1994.
Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities
Vice President Hartford reported that a good deal of interest had been expressed in changing the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities, and
the statement is difficult to amend. Because of her desire to work with the interested parties in amending some of the language in the statement, she was changing her original recommendation that the Regents approve the Statement of
Student Rights and Responsibilities as a permanent policy. She now was recommending that the policy be continued as an interim University policy until April
1995. Because the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities is a new policy, it is expected that amendments to change it will be proposed in the future.
Regents McGowan expressed her appreciation to Vice President Hartford
for her flexibility in accommodating the desires of students and others to retain
the policy as an interim policy for the time being. Regent McFee agreed that this
would allow an additional opportunity for the student body to have more input
into the amendment process, and she commended the constructive, supportive
manner in which students have sought to make modifications.


216




February Meeting, 1994


Regent Baker stated that he would vote against extending the policy as an
interim policy, as his position has not changed.
Regent Power moved to extend the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities as an interim policy until April 1995, during which time modifications will be sought and proposed. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it
was approved, with Regents Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, Varner,
and Waters in favor and Regent Baker opposed.
Implementation of the Regents' Policy on Research Grants, Contracts,
and Agreements, FY 1993
Vice President Neal submitted a report of the implementation of the Regents' Policy on Research Grants, Contracts, and Agreements for Fiscal Year
1993.
Changes in Bylaws, Rules and Regulations of the Medical Staff
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved recommendations by the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board for changes in the Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules, and
Regulations.
Medical Staff Appointments
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Brown, and on the recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board, the Regents unanimously approved certain specified appointments to medical staff
membership.
Sale of $12,000,000 Regents of the University of Michigan Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 1993
The Regents were informed of the sale of $12,000,000 Regents of the University of Michigan Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 1993 to Chemical Securities
Inc.
Executive Session Motion
Regent McGowan made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended
by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed
session on February 18, 1994, in the Regents' Room, immediately
following the end of this meeting, for the purpose of consulting with
our attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection with
specific pending litigation.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was adopted unanimously.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 10:55 am.,
after which the meeting continued in executive session. The next meeting will be


217




February Meeting, 1994


held on March 10 and 11, 1994. Regents' expenses for the month of January
1994 totalled $687.99.

MARCH MEETING, 1994


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, March 10, 1994
The Regents met at 1:30 p.m. in the Music Room of the Henry Ford EstateFair Lane. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown,
McFee, McGowan, Power, and Varner. Vice President and Secretary Kennedy
was also present, as were Executive Vice President Womak, Vice Presidents
Cosovich, Harrison, Hartford, and Neal, Interim Chancellor Kugler, and Chancellor Renick. Regent Waters and Provost Whitaker were absent; Associate Vice
President Holbrook attended in the place of Provost Whitaker. Regent Deitch arrived at about 2:25 p.m.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and thanked Chancellor
Renick for hosting the Regents' Meeting on the Dearborn campus. He also welcomed back Vice President Kennedy. He then recognized Regent Brown, who
made the following motion:
Executive Session Motion
Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended
by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed
session on March 11, 1994, at 9:00 a.m., in the Regents' Room, for
the purpose of consulting with our attorney regarding trial or
settlement strategy in connection with specific pending litigation.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Annual Report on Investments
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Norman Herbert, university treasurer and investment officer, Ms. Elizabeth Hokada, associate investment officer, and Ms. Maggie Blakelock, of Cambridge Associates, Inc., to present
the report on investments as of December 31, 1993. Executive Vice President
Womack observed that 1993 had been an outstanding year for the University's
Endowment Fund, with a 17.5 percent rate of return.
Mr. Herbert observed that all of the University's funds in 1993 had exceeded
the benchmarks that had been identified, and he gave details of the returns and
individual strategies that had been used for each of the funds. Mr. Herbert
observed that the long term goal for the endowment fund is to protect both the
purchasing power of the endowment principal as well as the stream of distributions that is provided for by the gift itself. In 1993, ten percentage points of real
value had been added to the portfolios of the various accounts in the endowment
fund, and on a ten-year basis, 2.4 percent per annum of value had been added to
each of the participating endowment accounts. He described the importance of
this result to the individual units with investments in the endowment fund.


219




March Meeting, 1994


Mr. Herbert acknowledged the contributions of both the Investment Advisory Committee and Cambridge Associates to the strong performance of the
Endowment Fund. He then introduced Ms. Blakelock, of Cambridge Associates,
Inc., to review the endowment strategy and performance and to introduce
proposed changes in the investment strategy for the University Investment Pool.
Ms. Blakelock referred to separately bound discussion materials from Cambridge Associates, Inc., in reviewing the endowment's strategy and performance.
She reviewed the University's current investment strategy and reported that the
University had achieved a number of its strategic goals with regard to asset allocation, common stock management, and fixed income management strategies.
She then outlined changes that would occur as the University pursued the next
steps in this strategy. Ms. Blakelock observed that the value of the endowment of
$911.8 million as of December 31, 1993 was up $227.5 million from December 31,
1992, and described specific asset allocation and performance factors associated
with that increase in value. She also presented data that compared the University's asset allocation and investment performance with that of other educational
institutions and reviewed a chart that showed trends in the University's investment performance over the past four years.
Ms. Blakelock, Mr. Herbert, and Executive Vice President Womack responded to questions and comments from the Regents about details of the report.
In response to a question from Regent Baker about the University's equity investments, Ms. Blakelock stated that the University intends to maintain its goal
of 70 percent in equity investments, but that the composition of the 70 percent
will change over time so as to have a more diversified portfolio. She and Mr.
Herbert explained that the strategy is to move towards a goal of 50 percent of the
equity investment in stocks and the balance in alternative assets, such as real
estate, oil and gas, and venture capital.
Regent Power commented on the historical significance of the fact that the
performance of all of the University's invested funds had exceeded their targets
for the calendar year 1993. He extended his compliments to Executive Vice President Womack, his staff, and Cambridge Associate, Inc., for this remarkable
performance.
University Investment Pool: Internal Bank Concept
Ms. Blakelock stated that she would be introducing the concept of the
"internal bank" to lay the framework for the specific investment proposal that
was being presented to the Regents as a discussion item. Referring to the handout from Cambridge Associates, Inc., Ms. Blakelock described the concept of the
internal bank, which invests residual cash from an institution's operating finds,
and makes distributions to "depositors" (departments) based on short-term
rates. The University would retain the difference between the actual total return
and the short-term rates paid to the depositors as a reserve to guarantee the
"depositors" no principal loss.
There followed extensive discussion about the internal bank concept. Mr.
Herbert observed that the intent is to implement the policy over a period of 5-10


220




March Meeting, 1994


years in order to be able to build a reserve so that participants in the University
Investment Pool can be assured that they will be able to take a dollar out for
every dollar deposited. Executive Vice President Womack pointed out that
another reason to implement the policy gradually is to dollar-cost average into
the various investment vehicles. This approach will help avoid a possibly negative
impact on the endowment fund.
In response to a question from Regent Power, the discussion shifted to the
distribution rate for the endowment fund. Executive Vice President Womack
pointed out that this topic is related to, but not a part of, the internal bank
concept. He stated that discussions have been held among his staff about the
need to reduce the payout rate for the endowment to less than the current 5.5
percent that was set in 1987. He and Mr. Herbert reported that the notion would
be to reduce the distribution rate over time, but emphasized that that decision is
unrelated to the internal bank decision and will be made at a later time.
Executive Vice President Womack responded to further questions firom the
Regents and noted that he intended to recommend adoption of the new investment strategy and distribution policy for the University Investment Pool at the
next meeting.
Regent Baker asked to receive information about historic rates of return on
various asset classes over the past 70-year period.
Executive Vice President Womack recognized the contributions of all of the
Regents who had attended meetings on investment strategy and worked diligently to exercise their oversight finction with regard to investments.
Real Estate Investment (Acacia Housing Fund III)
Executive Vice President Womack asked Ms. Blakelock to describe Acacia
Housing Fund III. She reported that this fund provides capital to home builders
to help them finance their finished lot inventory, and it provides historically high
rates of return for investors. She and Mr. Herbert then responded to questions
from the Regents. After learning that he represents one of the home builders
who participates in the fund, Regent Deitch disqualified himself from the
discussion.
Regent Power moved that $10 million of the University Endowment Fund
be committed to Acacia Housing Fund III, pending the general counsel's review
of the partnership agreement for legal acceptability. Regent Brown seconded the
motion. Regent Baker stated that he would be abstaining from the vote because
he was not persuaded at this time. The vote was then taken, and the motion was
approved, with Regents Brown, McFee, McGowan, Power, and Varner in favor,
and Regents Baker and Deitch abstaining.
Unversity of Michigan Hospitals Comparative Statistic Report
President Duderstadt next called on Mr. John Forsyth, executive director of
University of Michigan Hospitals, to present the UM Hospitals Comparative
Statistic Report for the fiscal year 1992-93. Mr. Forsyth gave a slide presentation


221




March Meeting, 1994


illustrating the Hospitals' financial performance compared to other hospitals, its
own five-year average, and the national average in terms of profitability, liquidity, capital structure, and patient activity, for both 1992-93 and the period
1988-1993.
The presentation demonstrated that the Hospitals' overall financial performance has been very favorable. Mr. Forsyth pointed out that the improvement in financial performance has occurred not because of increases in
admissions or clinic visits or room    rates; rather it is the result of costeffectiveness and management efficiency within the institution. He noted that
there are fewer full-time-equivalent employees now than there were several years
ago, and that the proportion of care-givers has increased in the face of a dramatic
decrease in the number and percentage of management appointments.
Mr. Forsyth reported that in a recent study the UM Hospitals had been
named one of the top one-hundred in the country and one of the top ten
academic health centers. These ratings, as well as a comparison of the Hospitals'
risk adjusted mortality ratio to that of the top ten academic hospitals in the country, are indicators of the quality of the institution.
Following some discussion, Regent Baker complimented the Hospitals management and staff on the excellent job they have done. He also raised the issue of
whether the UM Hospitals and other teaching hospitals have had a role in the
development of the national health care plan. Mr. Forsyth responded that this is
a major concern and is being addressed by leaders of these institutions.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Consideration of the minutes of the February 1993 meeting was
deferred until next month.
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports of investments, plant extension, litigation, and personnel-labor relations. Vice President
Neal submitted reports of projects established and summaries of a selection of
current research.
President Duderstadt reported on a proposal in Washington for a one-year
pause in indirect cost reimbursement for fiscal year 1995, which would mean
that institutions that receive additional federal government sponsored research
support for that year would not receive overhead support for those awards. He
and Vice President Neal reported on their efforts to educate the administration
on the importance of indirect cost reimbursement.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Cosovich submitted the report of
voluntary support.

March Meeting, 1994


Retirement Memoirs. Associate Vice President Holbrook submitted the
following retirement memoir:
Vern Carroll, professor of anthropology, retired from active faculty status
on December 31, 1993, after a most productive career as a teacher and
researcher.
Professor Carroll earned a B.A degree from Yale University in 1959, a second B.A degree from Cambridge University in 1961, M.A. degrees from Yale in
1962 and Cambridge in 1966, and a Ph.D. degree from the University of Chicago
in 1966. He served on the faculty of the University of Washington from 1966-72,
and came to the University of Michigan in 1972 as an associate professor of anthropology. At that time, he had an international reputation, both as a leading
comparativist of the languages, societies, cultures, and populations of the South
Pacific, and as an innovator in anthropological fieldwork methodologies. He was
promoted to professor of anthropology in 1975.
Within the Department of Anthropology, Professor Carroll helped to extend
the range of the department's upper-division undergraduate course offerings into
emerging areas of anthropological endeavor, especially the anthropology of the
mind, and methods of cultural analysis. He was instrumental in developing a
broad spectrum of research seminars for advanced undergraduates and an
award-winning honors program in cultural anthropology, and played a major
role in undergraduate counseling and the development of the upper-division
writing program. Undergraduate students also benefited from Professor Carroll's
six years of service (five as chair) on the LSA joint Student Faculty Policy Committee, and his participation in such interdisciplinary programs as South and
Southeast Asian Studies, American culture, the English Composition Board, and
comparative literature. In all of these activities, he brought anthropological perspectives to a large cross-section of our most able students in diverse departments, many of whom continue to express appreciation for his efforts.
In 1967, Professor Carroll founded, and thereafter served in each of the officer positions of, the Association for Social Anthropology in Oceania, now the major professional organization for anthropology in Oceania He also authored and
edited a number of publications and supervised coordinated research and comparative studies in this area.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated service
by naming Vern Carroll professor emeritus of anthropology.

Executive Session Motion
Pursuant to Sections 8(d), 8(f), and 8(h) of the Open Meetings
Act, as amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents

April Meeting, 1994


Friday, April 15, 1994
The Regents met at 9:15 am. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, and
Waters. Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, Provost Whitaker, and Executive Vice President Womack were also present, as were Vice Presidents Cosovich,
Harrison, Hartford, and Neal, Interim  Chancellor Kugler, and Chancellor
Renick. Regent Varner was absent.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Provost
Whitaker to present the first item of business.
Reorganization of Academic/Instructional Departments Within the
School of Public Health
Provost Whitaker reported that he had appointed a School of Public Health
review committee that had been charged with a) examining the mission of the
school and recommending revisions of the mission if any were indicated by the
examination; b) identifying salient issues in the field of public health and evaluating the school's strengths and limitations in addressing those issues; c) assessing the productivity of the school relative to that of other top-ranked schools of
public health and to other schools and colleges within the University; and d) developing principles and criteria for changes that would enhance the school's ability to achieve its mission.
Provost Whitaker described the makeup of the committee and the process
the committee had undergone in carrying out its work. He reported that the committee had recommended consolidating the school's eight departments into five.
He introduced Richard Cornell, interim dean of the School of Public Health, and
Ken Warner and Noreen Clark, co-chairs of the review committee and chairs of
departments in the School of Public Health.
Regent McFee complimented the committee and Provost Whitaker about
how the review was conducted, noting that the process that had been followed
made her very comfortable in being able to support the reorganization. Regent
Power expressed agreement with Regent McFee's sentiments,
Professors Cornell, Clark, and Warner commented on the review process
and observed that the review provided an opportunity for the school to meet the
challenges posed by the national debate on health care reform. They also reported that the review had been a good experience for all involved, and that there
is a mandate for change at the School of Public Health. The reorganization would
result in a consolidation of eight units into five, with only one of the current departments remaining untouched.
Following the discussion, Regent McFee moved that the School of Public
Health faculty be consolidated into the five core departments of biostatistics, environmental and industrial health, epidemiology, health behavior and health education, and health management and policy. Regent Power seconded the motion,
and it was approved unanimously.

April Meeting, 1994


North Campus Bell Tower
Provost Whitaker announced that Ann Lurie, widow of UM alumnus Robert
H. Lurie, was the person who had donated $12 million for construction of a bell
tower on North Campus in memory of her late husband, and that this was the
second largest gift in the history of the University. He described Mr. Lurie's career as a student at the University and later as a successful entrepreneur, and
President Duderstadt recalled having had the privilege of working with Mr. Lurie
when he was serving as dean of the College of Engineering. Regent Deitch complimented Provost Whitaker and others who had been involved in developing this
gift.
Provost Whitaker called on Mr. Fred Mayer, university planner, to describe
the project. Mr. Mayer noted that the bell tower had been designed by noted architect and University of Michigan alumnus Charles Moore, and that this project
represents the last architectural commission he completed before he died earlier
this year. Mr. Mayer described the site for the building and reported that it had
been chosen in consultation with the University's planning consultants, Johnson
Johnson & Roy/inc. He then displayed an architectural model of the proposed
bell tower and showed renderings illustrating how it would look from various locations on the North Campus. It was noted that the project was scheduled to be
completed late in 1995, and Ms. Margo Halsted, university carillonneur, who was
in the audience, commented that an original composition would be commissioned
to commemorate the occasion.
Following the presentation, Regent McGowan moved approval of the site
and design for the North Campus bell tower. Regent Power seconded the motion,
and it was approved unanimously.

Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports of investments, plant extension, litigation, personnel-labor relations, and noncompetitive
purchases over $2,000 from single sources. He commented on the significant correction that had occurred in the market over the past two months. Regent Baker
expressed concerns about the University's portfolios with respect to the current
volatility of the market and noted that the risks might be more substantial than
anticipated. Executive Vice President Womack expressed his belief that the University's risks are less substantial now because of its more diversified exposure as
well as the strong state of the economy.
Vice President Neal submitted reports on projects established and summaries of a selection of current research.

Retirement Memoirs. Provost Whitaker submitted the following retirement memoir:
Joseph A. Walton, Jr., M.D., assistant professor of internal medicine, retired from active faculty status on April 30, 1993, after a productive career as a
teacher, clinician, and researcher.
A native of Florida, Dr. Walton received his B.S. and M.D. degrees in 1956
and 1960, respectively, from the University of Florida at Gainesville. He did his
initial training in internal medicine at University Hospital at Gainesville before
coming to the University of Michigan in 1964. He finished his internal medicine
training here and then completed a cardiology fellowship before joining the faculty in 1966 as an instructor. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1969.
Dr. Walton played a key role in the development of the cardiac catheterization program  at the University of Michigan Hospitals. He directed the
catheterization laboratory for 17 years and saw the evolution of invasive cardiology from a research tool to a commonly performed procedure that has become an
integral part of our diagnostic and treatment armamentarium. He has written 50
papers focusing on the use of angioplasty and thrombolytic agents in the
treatment of acute coronary disease and was part of the pioneering group here
that dramatically changed the management of patients with acute myocardial
infarction.
Dr. Walton will be best remembered as a quiet gentleman who influenced
the careers of several generations of trainees by exposing them to the joys of
clinical patient care. He was one of the unique clinicians who could go from the
bedside to the diagnostic laboratory and back to the bedside and be able to teach
students while providing a very high level of kind, compassionate patient care.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physician for his dedicated service by naming Joseph A Walton, Jr., assistant professor emeritus of internal
medicine.
Memorials. No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees. Provost Whitaker submitted the May 1994 Doctoral Degree List,
the December 1993 Law School Final Degree List, and changes to previously approved degree lists.
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the remainder of the consent agenda as listed above.

April Meeting, 1994


Bond Rating Upgrades
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that Moody's
Investors Service had upgraded the ratings on University of Michigan debt from
Aa to Aal, and that this is the first time that a public university had ever
received a Moody's rating of Aal. He observed that this is a significant
achievement and is an honor to be shared by everyone in the institution. He
recognized Provost Whitaker, Vice President Kennedy, and Associate Vice
President Frederick Neidhardt for their participation in the presentation that
resulted in the rating. He also recognized Norman Herbert, university treasurer,
and Gerald Jernigan, assistant investment officer, for their efforts in preparing
for and directing the presentation.
President Duderstadt credited the Regents for their leadership and guidance
over the years, citing the comment in Moody's Credit Report that "The University ranks as the strongest public university rated by Moody's in several key indicators of financial strength."
Historical Investment Performance of Major Asset Classes
Executive Vice President Womack noted that in response to a question
raised at the March meeting, the executive summary of a report by Cambridge
Associates, Inc., entitled "Historical Capital Market Returns," had been included
with the agendas.
University Investment Pool
Executive Vice President Womack reviewed the proposal for changing the
investment strategy and distribution policy for the University Investment Pool,
illustrating the discussion with flip charts and a handout that had been prepared
by the treasurer's office. He stated that the proposed "internal bank" represents
conservative, sound financial practice typical of that of the best institutions, and
that it is expected to enhance the investment performance of the University's
working capital.
In response to a question from Regent Baker about the use of derivatives,
Executive Vice President Womack stated that the proper use of derivatives has a
place in the market, but some of the riskier strategies employed by particular
hedge funds described in the media that may generate enormous returns for investors would likely be inappropriate for use by the University. However, he emphasized that the use of financial futures, through the tactical asset allocation
strategy, conservatively managed, has been beneficial for the University.
Following finurther discussion, Regent Power moved that:
1.  a unitized Long-Term Portfolio be established as an investment vehicle for the
University's long-term capital: the University Endowment Fund and the "permanent core" assets of the University Investment Pool;
2.  the "permanent core" assets of UIP be gradually moved into the Long-Term
Portfolio over a three- to five-year period unless a significant market decline
provides the opportunity to move assets more quickly. Financial futures and
other derivatives would be used, as appropriate, to facilitate the transition;


248




April Meeting, 1994


3.  the investment objective for the University Investment Pool will be to maximize total return, not just yield. Accordingly, UIP's investment performance
will be measured on a total return basis; and
4.  a University Investment Pool distribution policy be adopted which will pay all
participants the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill rate on a quarterly basis, based on
their average daily balances.
Regent Baker seconded the motion, noting that he had asked the question
about derivatives because it had been mentioned in item 2 of the recommendation, and that his question had been adequately answered. Executive Vice President Womack pointed out that the words "as appropriate" in regard to the use of
financial futures and other derivatives are key to the intent of the
recommendation.
There being no further discussion, the vote was then taken, and the motion
was approved unanimously.
Venture Capital Investments
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of up to $5 million of the University Endowment Fund to Battery Ventures III, L.P.
Environmental Research Institute of Michigan Clean Room Space
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that the University
has entered into an agreement with the Environmental Research Institute of
Michigan (ERIM) for the lease of clean room space for the College of Engineering's Center for Display Technology & Manufacturing, according to the terms described in the Regents Communication.
Refinancing of Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 1993
Executive Vice President Womack explained that in the event that the State
Building Authority (SBA) would be unable to provide the fiuds necessary to pay
off the Series 1993 Bond Anticipation Notes by June 30, 1994, he was seeking approval for the issuance of $30 million of Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 1994 to
pay off the Series 1993 Bonds and to provide for the construction cash flow requirements for the Integrated Technology Instruction Center (ITIC), Engineering Center, and C.C. Little and Angell Hall Renovation Projects through
December 1994.
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved adoption of a resolution (see Appendix A, page 257) that
authorizes the executive vice president and chief financial officer to:
1.  develop the terms and legal documentation for the Bond Anticipation Notes,
and to prepare, circulate and execute preliminary and final official statements
describing the Bond Anticipation Notes, the University, and its affairs; and
2.  apply for and obtain from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's
Corporation their ratings on the Bond Anticipation Notes; and


249




April Meeting, 1994


3.  publish a notice of sale, receive bids, award the Bond Anticipation Notes to the
winning bidder (or alternatively select an underwriter and execute a note purchase agreement with the underwriter), execute an order establishing the terms
of notes, and execute and deliver the notes.
Angell/Haven Hall Connector Project
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Douglas Hanna, university
architect, to present a revised budget and design for the Angell/Haven Hall Connector Project. Mr. Hanna reported that the design for this project had been revised in response to concerns raised when the project was initially presented at
the December 1993 Regents' Meeting. He reviewed each of the concerns that had
been raised and showed renderings depicting four alternative design suggestions
that had been made at the December meeting, noting the pros and cons associated with each design.
Mr. Hanna then presented a revised design solution that is responsive to the
Regents' concerns but still within the available budget. He displayed a site plan,
floor plans, a rendering of the entire building, and an architectural model, and
pointed out how the revised design responds to the concerns that had been expressed by the Regents.
Following Mr. Hanna's presentation, the Regents expressed enthusiastic
support for the revised design. On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents unanimously approved the revised budget and design
for the Angell/Haven Hall Connector Project, and authorized issuing the project
for bids and awarding a construction contract, providing the project is within
budget.
CeC. Little Building Projects
Executive Vice President Womack reported that a construction contract for
the C.C. Little Renovation Project had been awarded to the lowest bidder, EllisDon Michigan, Inc. He and Provost Whitaker also described additional renovations being proposed by the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and the
College of Pharmacy.
Following some discussion, Regent Deitch moved approval of an increase in
the budget for the functional renovations in the C.C. Little Building from the
previously approved $3,000,000 to $4,750,000 and authorization for award of a
construction contract for the first phase of this work ($921,500) to Ellis-Don
Michigan, Inc. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Engineering Center Project
Executive Vice President Womack described the details of the funding for
the previously approved Integrated Technology Instruction Center (ITIC)/ Engineering Center Project, for which $57 million of the total project budget of $58.35
million is to be funded by the State Building Authority. Due to the fact that bids
received for the Engineering Center component came in over the architect's


250




April Meeting, 1994


estimate, he is requesting an adjustment in the budget for that component. This
can be accomplished within the original total project budget, because the ITIC
component came in under the architect's estimate. Vice President Kennedy reported that the State Building Authority is in agreement with this proposal, and
Executive Vice President Womack said that the construction accounting will
clearly identify the two projects.
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved internal adjustments within the $57 million budget of the
ITIC/Engineering Center Project to reflect an increase in the budget for the Engineering Center component and a decrease in the budget of the ITIC component. They also approved award of a construction contract for the Engineering
Center component to Sorensen Gross Construction Co., Inc.
Hubbard/Beal Intersection Reconstruction
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that reconstruction
of the Hubbard Road/Beal Avenue intersection on the North Campus will begin
in May 1994.
Regent Baker requested that there be a discussion at a future meeting about
access to the University from the northeast and the east.
University of Michigan Visitors Center Project
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Douglas Hanna, university
architect, to describe the proposed design of this project, which is intended to
serve as a central arrival point for visitors to the campus. The project involves an
addition to the Student Activities Building and renovations to the existing Student Activities Building.
Mr. Hanna displayed a site plan, schematic drawings of each floor, a drawing of the whole building, and an architectural model of the project. Several Regents expressed concerns about the facade and the windows for the project,
noting that the existing Student Activities Building is particularly unattractive in
these two areas. Mr. Hanna pointed out that the project includes replacement of
the louvered windows in the Student Activities Building, which will greatly enhance the building's appearance. He said that he would bring to the meeting next
month a rendering of how the facade will look with the replacement windows.
Following further discussion, President Duderstadt suggested that the Regents approve the project but be presented next month with a choice of different
exterior treatments before committing to a particular facade. Regent Power
moved provisional approval of the design and authorization for completion of
working drawings and bid documents, pending a discussion of the relationship of
the exterior improvements of the Student Activities Building to the proposed exterior treatment of the addition. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.


251




April Meeting, 1994


Reassignment of University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual Property (Walter J. Loesche)
Regent Power complimented Vice President Neal for the improved format
and language of the Regents Communications having to do with intellectual
property.
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Waters, all seven Regents present unanimously approved an assignment agreement with Walter J.
Loesche, D.M.D., Ph.D. for the following intellectual properties: "Improved System for Diagnosing Periodontal Disease," "Diagnostic Test Procedure for Detection of Oral Pathologenic Bacteria," and "Solid-Phase Test for the Detection of
Periodontal Disease in Subgingival Plaque." Because Dr. Loesche is a University
employee as well as inventor of the intellectual properties, this arrangement falls
under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Walter J. Loesche,
DM.D., Ph.D.
2.   The agreement is being executed according to the standard terms approved by
the Regents on July 16, 1987, modified as follows: contract terms include payment to the University of 15 percent of total consideration received by Dr.
Loesche; no use of University facilities or services; Dr. Loesch assumes all University responsibility towards the Bern Group with respect to royalty distribution; and the University agrees to discuss with Dr. Loesche's licensee access to
the parent technology "System for Diagnosing Periodontal Disease," Walter J.
Loesche, Salam A. Syed, and Barbara E. Laughton, inventors.
3.   Dr. Loesche's pecuniary interest arises from his right to receive royalties when
this technology is licensed. This is in lieu of participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University in accordance with University policy.
Regent Power left the meeting at this point (11:15 a.m.).
Tennis Center
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved proceeding with the Tennis Center Project on a phased
basis, as described in the Regents Communication.
UM    Medical Center North        Entrance    Parking    Structure   (NEPS)
Project
Regarding the North Entrance Parking Structure Project, Regent McFee
moved approval of the budget; submission of a Certificate of Need (CoN) amendment to the Michigan Department of Public Health; and soliciting bids and
awarding of a construction contract, provided the contract value is within the approved budget and a CoN amendment approval is received. Regent Waters seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.


252




April Meeting, 1994


Renovations
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects: 1) Baits Housing domestic hot water system upgrade; 2) Northwood II and III utilities distribution
system replacement; 3) Herbarium renovation; 4) Central Power Plant controls
retrofit study; 5) the addition of free cooling capacity to the central chilled water
plant (energy conservation project); 6) Medical Science I and II air quality improvement; 7) renovation of the Civil Engineering Materials Lab in the G.G.
Brown Building, 8) expansion and renovations of the MedSport facility at Domino's Farms; and 9) expansion of space at the UM Primary Care Network Health

Executive Vice President Womack submitted supplemental information to
the certified audited financial report of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics of the University of Michigan for the year ended June 30, 1993.
1125-1137 East Huron and 1122-1126 East Ann, Ann Arbor
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the purchase of a 0.94 acre site located at 1125-1137 East
Huron and 1122-1126 East Ann Street in Ann Arbor at a price of $1.2 million.
Approval of Academic Calendars for the Ann Arbor Campus for
1995-96 and 1996-97
Provost Whitaker described how the proposed calendars differ from those of
previous years. Following some discussion, Regent Deitch moved approval of the
academic calendars for the Ann Arbor campus for 1995-96 and 1996-97, as shown
in the Regents Communication. Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
Ann Arbor Summer Festival
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved revisions to the bylaws of the Ann Arbor Summer Festival, Inc., as documented in the Regents Communication.
Master of Science in Computer and Information Science and Master of
Science in Engineering (Computer Engineering) Degree Programs at
the University of Michigan-Dearborn
Regent Baker moved approval of two new degree programs at the University
of Michigan-Dearborn: "Master of Science in Computer and Information Science," to be offered by the Department of Computer and Information Science;
and "Master of Science in Engineering (Computer Engineering)," to be offered
by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Both programs will


253




April Meeting, 1994


operate under the auspices of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
News and Information Services
Vice President Harrison introduced Ms. Julie Peterson, who recently assumed the position of director of news and information services.
Comments by Regent Baker
Regent Baker read from prepared remarks in which he commented about
the use of restroom toilet stalls in University buildings for homosexual acts. A
copy of the statement is on file in the Office of the Secretary of the University. He
noted that the Michigan Daily had published a report by J.B. Akins in its April
11, 1994 issue about the use of restrooms in Mason Hall for homosexual sexual
acts.
Regent Baker quoted from the article, which reported that unsuspecting
custodians and students have witnessed "everything from oral and anal sex to
public or group masturbation" in the restrooms and that the Department of Public Safety stated that these encounters take place in these restrooms on a daily
basis. He also noted that custodians who work in Mason and Angell Halls have
filed a grievance objecting to the unsanitary conditions in the restrooms and to
having to clean up the bodily fluids.
Regent Baker observed that for a decade, he had been attempting to "convince University administrators to take strong action against such criminal acts,
some of which are felonies under Michigan law," and that the Regents had an obligation to provide a safe environment for students, faculty, and staff. He stated
his belief that the "climate of political correctness... has silenced nearly all critical comment on homosexual/lesbian conduct," and that University administrators have been reluctant to offend homosexual individuals even when their
conduct is against the law or "discomforts... embarrasses... or threatens members of the University community."
Regent Baker concluded his remarks by requesting "that President Duderstadt develop and put into place an aggressive policy to reduce or eliminate the
acts of gross indecency and sexually related acts on the University campus." The
policy would direct the Department of Public Safety to arrest people who violate
sections 338 and 339 of the state criminal code by their actions on University
property.
Regent Brown responded that while he agreed that the activities described
by Regent Baker are not appropriate on University property, it was incorrect to
imply that past administrations and the current administration have not tried to
correct the situation.
Regent McGowan stated that Regent Baker should not have the last word
on this issue by suggesting that the alleged behavior of a few is reflective of the


254




April Meeting, 1994


agenda of the gay and lesbian community at the University. She said that the
meeting should not end with this inappropriate impression.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting will be held on May 19 and 20, 1994. Regents' expenses for the month of
March 1994 totaled $912.77.

Friday, May 20, 1994
The Regents met at 8:15 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power,
Varner, and Waters. Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, Provost Whitaker,
and Executive Vice President Womack were also present, as were Vice Presidents
Cosovich, Harrison, Hartford, and Neal, Interim Chancellor Kugler, and Chancellor Renick.
Chancellor of University of Michigan-Flint
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and announced that the
first order of business would be a recommendation for the appointment of
Charlie Nelms as chancellor of the University of Michigan-Flint. The president
commented on Dr. Nelms' background and qualifications and said that he will
provide the vision and direction needed to continue the remarkable progress of
the UM-Flint campus.
Regent Varner moved the appointment of Charlie Nelms as chancellor of
the University of Michigan-Flint, effective August 1, 1994. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.


261




May Meeting, 1994


President Duderstadt introduced Dr. Nelms and his wife, Jeanetta, both of
whom were in attendance, and invited Dr. Nelms to comment on his appointment. Dr. Nelms expressed his appreciation and excitement for his appointment
as chancellor and commented on his leadership philosophy. Following Dr. Nelms'
remarks, President Duderstadt expressed his appreciation to Dr. Kugler for his
service as interim chancellor and to Professor Harriet Wall, chair of the search
committee, and the other search committee members for their excellent work
that culminated in the selection of Charlie Nelms as chancellor.
Final Report of the Bylaw 14.06 Task Force
President Duderstadt commented that when the Regents voted in September 1993 to amend Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06 to add the phrase "sexual orientation," they assigned the president and his administration the responsibility for
implementing the policy they had approved. To fulfill this responsibility, he had
appointed a committee, chaired by Bernard Machen, dean of the School of
Dentistry, to advise him on how the policy could best be implemented. The report
had been adopted unanimously and submitted to the president and was now being submitted to the Regents as an information item. The president observed
that the Board's responsibility is to approve the general policy, while not being
directly involved with the implementation of that policy.
He thanked Dean Machen and the committee for their work and stated that
the administration intended to take the committee's advice into careful consideration as it moved forward to implement the policy that the Regents had
approved. He advised the Board that he would keep them fully informed as the
administration addressed these issues. President Duderstadt observed that there
were a number of complex issues involved in implementation of the policy and
noted that the administration would be able to draw on the experience of other
higher education institutions that had already addressed these issues. He reiterated that his administration does intend to move ahead with implementation of
the general policy that the Regents had approved last September, and that he
would keep the Regents informed of their progress as they did so.
Regent Baker asked Dean Machen whether the committee had agreed to a
definition of sexual orientation, and whether pedophilia, man-boy love, and bestiality would be included in that definition. Dean Machen responded that he did
not understand how those terms relate to sexual orientation; Regent Baker
stated that if someone is oriented to those practices, they could claim that that
was their orientation. In response to Dean Baker's next question, Dean Machen
stated that the committee had been apprised of numerous instances of
discrimination against homosexuals and lesbians on campus. Regarding Regent
Baker's question of whether the University would be abrogating its responsibility
of deciding who would get benefits by relying on the City of Ann Arbor, Dean
Machen stated that the task force did not specifically define the process the
University would use. They had made suggestions that the University could
consider, but the responsibility for deciding such matters rests with the
administration.


262




May Meeting, 1994


Regent Baker observed that elected officials take an oath to uphold the state
constitution, and given that "some of the acts... which some of those people [in
the homosexual community] do are illegal under the law", questioned how the
Regents could reconcile their duty to uphold the law with codifying the recommendations of the task force. Dean Machen responded that he was unaware that
any of the recommendations of the task force would be illegal in the state of
Michigan. Regent Baker observed that such questions ought to be considered.
Regent Baker moved that the report of the Bylaw 14.06 Task Force dated
March 29, 1994, be rejected by the Regents and further that the phrase "sexual
orientation" be removed from Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06. President Duderstadt called for a second for the first motion calling for rejection of the task force
report; there being no second, the motion failed. He then called for a second on
the motion to remove the phrase "sexual orientation" from Regents' Bylaw
Section 14.06. That motion failed for lack of a second.
Comments by Regent Baker on Bylaw 14.06 Task Force Report
Regent Baker read from a prepared statement, a copy of which is on file in
the Office of the Secretary of the University. He stated that the Regents' decision
to include the term "sexual orientation" in Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06 on September 24, 1993, and the present discussion of the task force report represented a
"defining moment" in the history of the University of Michigan that would have
a long-term impact on the lives of people associated with it.
Regent Baker observed that by adding the term "sexual orientation" to
Bylaw Section 14.06, the Regents were accepting the premise that homosexual
and lesbian sexual practices are equivalent to heterosexual practices, which is
contrary to the beliefs of a majority of Michigan's electorate. This "false premise"
is the basis for the task force recommendation to extend to same sex committed
partners the same university benefits now offered to heterosexual spouses.
Regent Baker observed that many Michigan residents consider the revised
bylaw and the task force report to be a direct attack on the American family because it undermines the family structure from a moral and religious perspective.
He observed that a statewide movement had been mobilized seeking to negate
the Regents' actions, which had generated more than 250 letters and nearly 4000
petition signatures; the largest reaction to any issue considered by the Regents in
his experience.
Regent Baker quoted from four letters from citizens and from a letter from
the Michigan House of Representatives Republican Task Force on Higher Education expressing their opposition to the use of tax money to equate homosexual
status with that of minorities, to "promote the homosexual agenda," and to "support homosexual legal rights and benefits." The letter from the Republican task
force warned that many of the recommendations may be in conflict with state
and federal rights and statutes. (The full text of the quotes is contained in the
statement on file.)


263




May Meeting, 1994


Regent Baker observed that members of the homosexual/lesbian community
have been successftil in advancing their political goals in Ann Arbor, both on and
off campus, and noted that the University supports a Lesbian, Gay Male, Bisexual Programs Office (LGMBPO). He reported that during freshmen orientation,
new students' views of homosexuality are challenged by lesbian and homosexual
group leaders. He quoted from a letter he'd received from a current student
describing the student's experience at freshmen orientation, in which the student
stated he or she had been ridiculed by the group's lesbian leader for the student's
"inability to have an open mind," and that the leader had "attacked [the student's] views" and lectured the student "in defense of her lifestyle."
Regent Baker stated his belief that "no criticism of homosexual/lesbian conduct is permitted in the classroom, the dormitory, or elsewhere on campus," or
by employees, and that the University does not permit "objection to having a homosexual or lesbian roommate" as sufficient mason for changing roommates. He
continued that "political correctness" has made faculty, staff, and students fearful of speaking out on issues.
Regent Baker stated that the opinions expressed by people in the state in
their letters and petitions to the Regents indicate their opposition to the bylaw
change and task force report as "an attack on the family, a wrongful expenditure
of taxpayer money, an attempt at thought control over... students, an overreaching into the responsibilities of the state legislature, an improper classification of
preference in sexual conduct as equal to racial discrimination, and... bad public
policy." Therefore, he concluded that the term "sexual orientation" should be
removed from Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06 and that the Report of the Bylaw
14.06 Task Force should be rejected.
President Duderstadt noted that Regent Baker's statement represents his
own personal beliefs, and that in the view of the University administration, it
contains a "very significant number of mischaracterizations and misunderstandings," which would be corrected and would accompany the statement in the
record, rather than go unchallenged. (A copy of that statement, prepared by the
vice president for student affairs, is on file in the Office of the Secretary of the
University.)
Regent McFee thanked the members of the task force for the thoughtful
consideration they had given to all of the issues. She observed that she had also
received large numbers of letters on both sides of the issue. She noted that the
task force report is not meant to be accepted or rejected by the Regents; rather it
is meant to help guide the president in his implementation of the bylaw change
that the Regents had approved. Regent McFee noted that the Regents had
recently received a similar type of report on the issue of flexible benefits and
pointed out that, as in the case of the bylaw 14.06 report, there was definitely not
unanimous agreement on all of its recommendations.
Both task force reports, she observed, deal with the question of benefits and
their applicability to dependents. She noted that staff benefits now comprise a
significant portion of overall compensation, and that the staff employed by the
University has changed so that it now includes all possible combinations of


264




May Meeting, 1994


married and single people with or without dependents, some of whom may or
may not be employed at the University or elsewhere. Regent McFee observed
that the goal of the University's benefits package has been to alleviate the financial difficulties of providing for one's dependents. To that end, the task force
report should be reviewed in concert with the flexible benefits program and the
changing environment within the benefits arena
Regent McFee then posed the question of what the University could do to
alleviate the vulnerability of homosexuals, so they are not subject to harassment
because of their lifestyle. She recounted a telephone call she had received from a
woman who, as a Christian fundamentalist, is morally offended by homosexual
lifestyles, but who also is the mother of a homosexual college student and wanted
him to be able to live in an environment that would allow him to develop without
experiencing a life of constant harassment.
Regent McFee also reported that the Supreme Court had recently ruled that
a school board that for years had allowed a student to be ridiculed for allegations
about her sex life was responsible for allowing the harassment to continue
unabated. She urged that this type of ridicule not be allowed to take place at the
University, nor interfere with the development of students and employees.
Regent McGowan thanked the president for stating his intention to implement nondiscrimination and equal opportunity guarantees to the University's
gay and lesbian community as they pertain to employment benefits, financial aid
packages, residency requirements, and University housing, pursuant to the
Regents' action of September 24, 1993. She observed that it was the
responsibility of the president and executive officers to determine how to achieve
those policy goals, and that the president had done so by appointing a task force
to study these issues and advise him. She noted that the Board's decision had
been reinforced when Regent Baker had failed, through his motions earlier in the
meeting, to move any member of the Board.
With regard to assertions made earlier by Regent Baker, Regent Power
asked Dean Machen whether the task force had "concluded, wrongly, that 'committed same-sex' relationships (homosexual, bisexual and lesbian) are equivalent
to married spousal relationship[s] (heterosexual)." Dean Machen responded that
this statement is accurate from the perspective only of rewarding benefits.
Regent Power then asked Vice President Hartford whether Regent Baker's
assertions are true that "after school begins, no criticism of homosexual/lesbian
conduct is permitted in the classroom, the dormitory or elsewhere on the campus" and that "under University rules a student's objection to having a homosexual or lesbian roommate is not sufficient reason to allow a change of
roommates." Vice President Hartford responded that the first assertion would
be proven to be inaccurate merely upon asking any gay or lesbian student
whether criticism of them has been permitted once they arrive on campus. Regarding the second assertion, she stated that students in residence halls have a
choice of whom they live with. If a student decides he or she does not want to live
in a certain room, the housing office tries to accommodate a move, within the


265




May Meeting, 1994


limits imposed by high occupancy levels. The philosophy is that students are
adults and have a right to decide who they want to live with.
Regent Deitch observed that Regent McGowan had correctly articulated the
nature of the discussion. He stated that the purpose of the bylaw change was to
achieve equity and to make "a reality out of our commitment to diversity." He
said that he was comfortable with the process and with the task force's recommendations being in the hands of the president for further study and, he hoped,
implementation.
Regent Deitch quoted Regent Baker's comment that "Many Michigan citizens consider the Regents' action in September 1993 adding 'sexual orientation'
to Regents' Bylaw Section 14.06 and the present report of the 14.06 task force to
be a direct attack on the American family-their families-because it undermines the family structure in moral and other terms." He said that he resented
that statement and that it would be wrong to leave that impression with the
public.
Regent Deitch quoted from the remarks of Pamela Home, a University staff
member who had spoken at the public comments session in support of the recommendations of the task force. Ms. Home had noted that she was a local resident
who had been married for 20 years, was a mother of two daughters, and was an
active and practicing Christian. She had stated,
"Given my personal characteristics, it may not appear as if I
have a stake in these issues. But I do have a stake, as does every
citizen of Michigan. Whether we know it or not, we all have
colleagues, friends, and relatives who are gay and lesbian. These are
real persons of worth and dignity, but who are discriminated against
not only by individuals, but by the institutions of our society. Let us
not have the University of Michigan continue to be an institution
which contributes to intolerance and exclusion, but rather one which
leads in its commitment to respect, inclusion, and fair treatment.
Yes, I do have a stake-injustice to any one of us is injustice to us
all."
Regent Deitch concluded that he spoke in support of the recommendations
as a family person himself, who had been married for 25 years, had three children, aging parents, and other accouterments typical of American families. He
believes that "families come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and that what we judge in
people is their character, and their values.... We need to be able to say that we
respect people and that we welcome them into our community."
Regent Deitch expressed confidence that under President Duderstadt's leadership, the recommendations would be dealt with in an appropriate fashion, and
expressed hope that the University of Michigan would join a number of peer
institutions in adopting, in one form or another, the recommendations of the
task force.
Regent McFee observed that many citizens had expressed in their letters the
notion that they would be watching the outcome of this meeting. She said she


266




May Meeting, 1994


welcomed that observance and hoped that they would continue observing the
Board as it dealt with other issues in the future.
Regent Baker stated that citizens' view of the Board's actions as an attack
on the family is a legitimate one, since society today is "in shreds" in many
respects. He believes people are desperate to find ways to hold the family
together and to exemplify some of the traits described by Regent Deitch. He
stated the Board would be doing an injustice to the state's citizens if it "ignores
the hopes and aspirations of this society toward the family." This particular issue is but one manifestation, he believes, of what people view as the disintegration of the family.
Regent Baker observed that it was not easy to raise these issues, and that
when he talked about difficult issues, he tried to do it in a thoughtful, easily
understood, manner. He noted that the Board's policies change over time
according to the makeup of the Board, so that in a few years the vote could be the
opposite of what it is today. He continued that in spite of his views on this issue
or disagreement with particular policies, he loves this institution and the opportunities it provides people. He noted his long-standing involvement with civil
rights, from his military service in the early 1940s to his work with the Urban
League in Detroit. He hoped that the exchange of ideas that had occurred that
day were done in good spirit and with an understanding that there are differences in opinion, that ideas have consequences, and that they should be
discussed.
Regent McGowan pointed out that in the mid-1800s there had been a bitter
debate about whether to admit women to the University that did not conclude
until 1870, when women were admitted. As that was a good decision, today's
action will also be a good decision for the University.
President Duderstadt observed that the University of Michigan had been
"the epitome of the Jeffersonian ideal of an institution that aspires to excellence
but to provide that excellence to all of that society that creates, supports, and sustains us." He recalled a recent speech at the University by the Dalai Lama, in
which he referred to a "family of humankind" to which we all belong and which
we serve. He stated that he accepts the responsibility for implementing the
Regents' policy and will address the various issues surrounding that. He
expressed appreciation for the input of Dean Machen and the task force and the
input of the Regents, and said he would keep the Regents apprised as the administration moves to implement the policy.
There followed a short recess, after which the meeting reconvened at 9:30
a.m. Regents Brown and Waters were not present for the remainder of the
meeting.
Proposed FY 1995 University of Michigan Hospitals' Operating Budget
Executive Vice President Womack introduced Mr. John Forsyth, executive
director of University of Michigan Hospitals, to present the proposed fiscal year
1995 Hospitals' Operating Budget. Mr. Forsyth stated that the budget is based


267




May Meeting, 1994


on the Hospitals' mission, vision, values, and critical success factors, and gave a
slide presentation illustrating these concepts.
For its mission, the Hospitals' strive for excellence and leadership in terms
of patient care and service, education, and research. The vision statement is
based on assessment of the institution's strengths, and encompasses being the
first place people think of when they think of health care, being preeminent in
teaching, research and advancing medical science, and being the employer of
choice. The Hospitals are guided by the values of respect, compassion, integrity,
efficiency, and leadership. Critical success factors include several measures of
success in the clinical arena, customer satisfaction, partnership with the community, educational and research excellence, creativity and innovation, cost effectiveness, and financial viability.
Mr. Forsyth displayed a number of graphs and charts that illustrate the
Hospitals' financial viability in terms of assets, equity, FY 1994 results, cash balances, and debt capacity, noting that all measures are favorable for the current
fiscal year. He then enumerated weaknesses that had been identified in 1993,
noting that substantial progress had been made in improving many of them,
including alignment of educational and clinical strategies, making a significant
commitment toward improving aging research facilities, and moving toward
expanding the primary care network. The latter effort will be addressed in large
part by the new medical campus planned for northeast Ann Arbor. Efforts have
also been made to strengthen two other weaknesses that had been identified in
1993, including establishing joint ventures and affiliations with other institutions
and improving cost structure and utilization.
Mr. Forsyth reviewed options for the Medical Center in the marketplace and
health care reform environment, with possible roles as a supplier to multiple
HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations)/AHPs (Allied Health Plans), a partner in a delivery system, or a combination of all of these options. He listed a
number of "key imperatives for UMMC financial success."
The FY 1995 budget assumptions include a cost effectiveness program,
enhanced academic support, relatively flat admissions/visits/length of stay,
self-funded competitive salary program, and maintaining the cost effectiveness
program with an emphasis on cost per case. The proposed budget includes a 5.7
percent reduction in the private/semi-private room rate and no increase in the
intensive care unit room rate and ancillary rates.
Mr. Forsyth concluded his presentation with a discussion of planning
assumptions for FY 1996 and FY 1997 budgets. Following some discussion,
Regent Power moved adoption of the proposed FY 1995 University of Michigan
Hospitals' operating budget, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent
McFee seconded the motion, and it was improved unanimously.
Family Practice Building in Chelsea
This is a proposal for the University of Michigan Medical Center to purchase
a new family practice clinic facility on the Chelsea Community Hospital (CCH)


268




May Meeting, 1994


campus for the Department of Family Practice. On a motion by Regent Varner,
seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents approved the purchase of the family
practice clinic facility on the CCH campus, which will include a long term lease
for the land, according to the terms described in the Regents Communication.
CESF Report-Ann Arbor Campus
The president called on Professor John Tropman, chair of the Committee on
the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) for the Ann Arbor campus, to present the committee's report. Professor Tropman distributed handouts of the
committee's report. He stated that the committee was recommending a salary
improvement program this year and had expressed support for a flexible benefits
package and a one-time salary supplement pilot program. Other recommendations include development of a faculty and staff compensation policy; development of a compensation analysis task force to outline and oversee the regular
development and report of compensation numbers to the University community;
exploring the possibility of developing unbiased programs to educate faculty and
staff in the allocation of their retirement assets; and review of the report of the
New Pay Committee.
The president complimented Professor Tropman and the committee for
their spirit of cooperation in working with the administration and noted that
they had addressed issues that are very important to the institution. A discussion
followed regarding flexible benefits, the retirement program, and other points
raised in the report.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Regarding the April minutes, Regent Baker stated that Regent
McGowan's assumption that he had deliberately chosen to speak about a controversial issue at the end of a meeting is incorrect. He reported that he had advised
the other Regents and the president before the meeting that he was going to be
raising the issue and had given them copies of his remarks. He had asked the
president to be able to speak early in the meeting, but the president had
requested that he speak at the end, so he had accommodated that request.
It was decided to delay consideration of the minutes until the following
meeting.
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports of investments, plant extension, litigation, and personnel-labor relations. Vice President
Neal submitted reports of projects established and summaries of a selection of
current research.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Cosovich submitted the report of
voluntary support.

Personnel Actions. Provost Whitaker submitted personnel actions, pointing out the recommendation for the appointment of Jeffrey Sean Lehman as
dean of the Law School.
Recommended promotions. Provost Whitaker observed that the faculty
promotion and tenure process is one of the most important things undertaken at
the University, and that it is done as carefully and as seriously as possible
because these decisions affect the reputation and future directions of the
University for many years to come. He reviewed the promotion and tenure process, noting that the criteria are determined by the faculty, who make recommendations to the dean and school or college executive committee, who in turn make
recommendations to the provost and president, with final approval being given
by the Regents. When women and minority candidates are turned down for tenure or promotion, written statements indicating where each person failed to meet
the criteria are forwarded to the Affirmative Action Office for review.
Provost Whitaker distributed a handout indicating progress towards retaining women and minority faculty. This year, 26.4 percent of the people recommended for promotion or tenure were women, a significant improvement over

May Meeting, 1994


the past several years. Minorities comprised 15.7 percent of the total recommended for promotion or tenure. Provost Whitaker observed that efforts to
recruit and retain faculty of color and women are beginning to pay off. He then
reviewed the materials for five individuals who were being recommended for promotion or tenure.
Chancellor Renick presented the promotion and tenure recommendations
for the Dearborn campus and Chancellor Kugler presented the recommendations
for the Flint campus.
Following some discussion, Regent Deitch moved approval of the appointment of Jeffrey Sean Lehman as dean of the Law School. Regent Power seconded
the motion, and it was adopted.

Retirement Memoirs. Provost Whitaker submitted retirement memoirs
for 17 faculty members.
Keith W. Bryan, professor of music (flute), will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 1994.


285




May Meeting, 1994


Professor Bryan received his B.Mus. degree with performer's certificate
from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, in 1953. Following
graduation, he was a member of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C., from 1953-55, after which he served with the Seventh Army Symphony
Orchestra in Europe (1955-57). He then returned to the National Symphony Orchestra for four additional years (1957-61). During most of this period, Professor
Bryan was also concertizing as a partner in the "Bryan and Keys Duo" with his
wife, Karen Keys, pianist. Beginning with the 1961-62 concert season, the Bryan
and Keys Duo devoted full time to recitals, which included performances in
Belgium, England, France, Germany, and Switzerland, and tours throughout the
United States. Professor Bryan joined the University of Michigan in 1964 as a
guest lecturer in music. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1965, associate professor in 1968, and professor in 1972.
Throughout his tenure at the University, Professor Biyan remained active
as a performer. His recording of Twentieth Century Sonatas for Flute and Piano
was an especially conspicuous highlight of such activities, as was the Bryan and
Keys five-week tour and residency in China during 1985, and Professor Bryan's
premiere performance of a new flute concerto by John La Montaine at the
National Gallery of Art in 1981. In addition to his artistry as a performer,
Professor Bryan is also a sensitive and devoted teacher of flute.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Keith W. Bryan
professor emeritus of music (flute).
0. Lynn Deniston, associate professor of public health policy and administration in the School of Public Health, will retire from active faculty status on
May 31, 1994.
A native of Ohio, Professor Deniston received his B.S. degree from The Ohio
State University in 1954, his M.P.H. degree from the University of California at
Berkeley in 1962, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1975.
Professor Deniston began his career as a public health professional by working as
a sanitarian for the Ohio Department of Public Health from 1957-63. He came to
the University of Michigan as a research associate in the School of Public Health
in 1964. He received the additional appointment of lecturer in 1966 and was
named associate professor in the Department of Health Planning and Administration (now known as Public Health Policy and Administration) in 1976.
Within the School of Public Health, Professor Deniston concentrated both
his research and teaching in the area of program evaluation, emphasizing the
measurement of health status and quality of life. In the 1970s and '80s, Professor
Deniston was responsible for coordinating the core course for the school's MPH
degree program. Later, he taught the school's course on the history and philosophy of public health. Professor Deniston exhibited a ready willingness to assist
the school in a wide array of endeavors, as reflected in his serving as secretary of
the faculty, coordinator of the blood donor program, and school representative to
the University's recycling office.
Over a quarter of a century's worth of SPH students found Professor Deniston to be an unusually accessible and helpful academic advisor and mentor. He
was revered for an "open-door policy" that found him eager to devote long hours
to working with individual students. He also made significant efforts to keep in


286




May Meeting, 1994


touch with alumni, efforts eased by the fact that alumni often sought him out,
whether it be for career counseling or simply to sustain highly-valued friendships. His dedication to working with public health practitioners extended into
Professor Deniston's many contributions to state and local health departments,
particularly in the area of his greatest expertise, program evaluation.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming 0. Lynn Deniston
associate professor emeritus of public health policy and administration.
Thomas M. Donahue, Edward H. White II Distinguished University Professor of Planetary Science, Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space
Sciences in the College of Engineering, and professor of physics in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31,
1994.
Professor Donahue received his AB. degree from Rockhurst College in 1942
and his Ph.D. degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1947. He held positions
at Johns Hopkins until 1951, when he joined the faculty of the University of
Pittsburgh. There he organized a program in atomic physics and atmospheric science that led to studies of the upper atmosphere with instruments flown on
sounding rockets and spacecraft. At Pittsburgh, he became associate professor in
1953 and served as director of both the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space
Sciences and the Space Coordination Center.
In 1974, Professor Donahue joined the University of Michigan as professor
and chair of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences; he served as
chair until 1980 and was appointed professor of physics in 1989. Professor Donahue has participated in the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory, Voyager, Pioneer
Venus, Galileo, and Cassini spacecraft missions and is the author of more than
150 publications. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the
International Academy of Astronautics and is a fellow of the American Geophysical Union and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His
honors include the Arctowski Medal of the National Academy of Sciences, the
John Adam Fleming Medal of the American Geophysical Union, the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, and the Space Science Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. At the University of Michigan, he
was the Henry Russel Lecturer in 1986 and received the Stephen S. Attwood
Award for Excellence in Engineering in 1994.
Professor Donahue knows as much about the planets, especially Venus, as
anyone in the world today. His brilliance is legendary, both as an experimentalist
and as a theoretician. He has served on numerous national advisory boards and
has held visiting titles at major institutions. Professor Donahue has also served
on countless University committees and programs, including the Project for the
Integrated Study of Global Change.
The Regents now salute this member of the faculty for his outstanding
career by naming Thomas M. Donahue the Edward H. White II Distinguished
University Professor Emeritus of Planetary Science and professor emeritus of
physics.
Peter W. Ferran, associate professor of theatre, will retire from active
faculty status on May 31, 1994.


287




May Meeting, 1994


Professor Ferran received his AB. degree from the College of the Holy Cross
in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1960. He served in the U.S. Army from 1962-64,
then taught at The American School in Switzerland (Lugano) from 1964-66. He
then enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he received his M.A. degree in
1967 and his Ph.D. degree in 1972, with considerable emphasis on the work of
Bertolt Brecht-an interest that he pursued throughout his academic career. Following three years of service as a teaching fellow concurrent with his graduate
studies, Professor Ferran began a long and significant association with the University's Residential College as lecturer in drama (1970-73), assistant professor of
English (1973-79), and associate professor of theatre and drama (1979-1985). He
spent the academic year 1983-84 as visiting professor of literature and drama at
Franklin College in Lugano, Switzerland. In 1975, he received the University's
Distinguished Service Award.
Professor Ferran's teaching has included fundamentals of d rama  tic
theory and criticism, play writing, arts and ideas, and intensive German, in addition to the practically ever-present emphasis on Brecht. He was a founding member of the Residential College Brecht Company in which he involved himself as
actor, director, and-as an avocational musician of considerable prowess-performer and composer. He is author of several published articles and reviews and
has lectured repeatedly at the Oregon Shakespearean Festival and Modem Languages Association meetings.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Peter W. Ferran
associate professor emeritus of theatre.
Bernard A. Galler, professor of electrical engineering and computer
science, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1994, following 38 years
of service.
Professor Galler received two bachelor's degrees, in 1946 and 1947, from the
University of Chicago, a master's degree in 1949 from the University of California at Los Angeles, and a Ph.D. degree in 1955 from the University of Chicago.
He joined the University of Michigan Department of Mathematics in 1955 as an
instructor, he was promoted to assistant professor in 1959, associate professor in
1962, and professor in 1966.
As a pioneer in the field of computer science, Professor Galler helped shape
this discipline at the University. In the early 1960s, he was active in the development of the new Communication Sciences Program, and in 1966, he became associate director of the Computing Center. His association with the Computing
Center continued through 1991, during a period of tremendous growth and
change in the areas of computer science and computing services. He became a
charter member of the new Department of Computer and Communication
Sciences (CCS) in 1966 and served as chair of the department from 1973-75. In
1984, Professor Galler was instrumental in negotiating the merger of the CCS
Department and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science.
The Department of Computer and Communication Sciences was one of the
first of its kind in the country, so it is not surprising that Professor Galler was
influential in the development of the software and mathematics curriculum for
computer science. Professor Galler has also provided vital service to the wider


288




May Meeting, 1994


University community, serving as associate dean for long-range planning in the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts from 1975-79, and on many
University-wide committees and task forces over the years. Despite all of his
administrative responsibilities, he has served as undergraduate counselor for the
computer science degree program for many years.
On the national level, Professor Galler served as an officer of the Association
for Computing Machinery (ACM) from its earliest days, including the presidency
from 1968-70; in 1980, the ACM awarded him its Distinguished Service Award
for his contributions to the field. He has served on many other national boards
and committees and has been recognized by his peers with numerous awards and
honors. In recent years, he has been instrumental in developing a national record
of the history of computing.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Bernard A Galler professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer
science.
Arinando A. Ghitalla, professor of music (trumpet), will retire from active
faculty status on May 31, 1994.
Professor Ghitalla received his B.S. degree from the Juilliard School of
Music in 1950, after which he embarked on a highly distinguished career as
trumpet performer. Following service as principal trumpet in the New York City
Opera Orchestra and then in the Houston Symphony Orchestra, Professor
Ghitalla became principal trumpet in the Boston Symphony Orchestra-a post
he occupied with elan for 28 years (1951-79). While principally engaged in
orchestral performance, Professor Ghitalla also taught part-time at the Tanglewood Music Center (summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra), Boston
University, and the New England Conservatory of Music. He came to the
University of Michigan in 1979 as professor of music (trumpet).
At the University of Michigan, Professor Ghitalla gave a decade and a half of
dedicated, expert, gentle, yet demanding instruction to aspiring young trumpeters. In 1991, he was given the Harold Haugh Award for excellence in studio
instruction, in recognition of his outstanding effectiveness in teaching. A noteworthy characteristic of his relationship with students is that it did not begin and
end at his office door: an enthusiastic and dashing cook, Professor Ghitalla furnished many an impecunious student with gourmet cuisine otherwise unavailable to them, regaling them with music "war stories" and arming them with
valuable practical information about American orchestral life.
During his tenure at Michigan, Professor Ghitalla was a frequent guest
recitalist and visiting teacher throughout the United States. In 1980, he made a
tour of Italy performing concerts, and in 1982 he visited Japan, giving an
extended series of recitals. With typical kindness and generosity, Professor
Ghitalla capped his career on the Michigan faculty by donating 23 valuable trumpets to the Steams Collection of Musical Instruments, and his life-long collection
of materials and music associated with trumpet performance to the music

Franken established a pioneering program in atomic physics. He was promoted
to associate professor in 1960 and professor in 1965, and has been associated
with the Biophysics Research Division since its inception in 1964.
Professor Sands is a renowned spectroscopist who has pioneered the applications of spectroscopy to studies of proteins. In 1959, with Helmut Beinert, he
made the first electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements on a protein involved in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. During the course of his
career, he has developed or initiated a number of techniques, including highpower electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), wide-band electron-electron
double resonance (ELDOR), and multi-frequency EPR spectroscopy. For the past
20 years, his laboratory has been one of the leaders in applications of Mossbauer
spectroscopy to the study of metalloproteins. One of Professor Sands' outstanding achievements was the elucidation of the structure of the active center of the
two-iron ferredoxins by spectroscopic analyses-an effort that combined information from magnetic susceptibility, EPR, ENDOR, Mossbauer, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to give an accurate picture of the atomic and
electronic structure of [2Fe-2S] centers. Professor Sands has also made crucial
contributions to the knowledge of molecular structure and function in several
other subclasses of redox proteins, including the cytochromes and flavoproteins.
In addition to his research activities, Professor Sands served as chair of the
Department of Physics from 1977-82 and provided a variety of service for the
graduate school, University-wide committees, the Program in Biophysics, and

JUNE MEETING, 1994


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, June 16, 1994
Public Comments
The Regents met at 4:00 p.m. in the Anderson Room of the Michigan Union.
Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee,
McGowan, Power, and Waters. Vice President and Secretary Kennedy was also
present, as were Provost Whitaker, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Harrison, Hartford, and Neal, Interim Chancellor Kugler,
and Chancellor Renick. Regent Varner was absent.
The Regents heard comments from the following people, on the topics indicated: Mike Christie, Jr., a student and member of Michigan Student Assembly,
on textbook prices; Wayne A Wolbert, student, on a United Farm Workers boycott of California grapes; and Marcia Federbush, citizen, on inequities between
men's and women's gymnastics.
Following the completion of the public comments session at 4:20 p.m., the
meeting recessed until the following day.
Friday, June 17, 1994
The Regents met at 9:00 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power,
Varner, and Waters. Vice President and Secretary Kennedy was also present, as
were Provost Whitaker, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents Cosovich, Harrison, Hartford, and Neal, Interim Chancellor Kugler, and Chancellor
Renick.
Internal Audit of Department of Communications            Endowment
Accounts
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and observed that a routine, internal audit of Department of Communications endowment accounts had
raised questions about whether certain expenditures that had been charged to
that account were consistent with the stated intent of the endowments. He emphasized that the issue was not whether the expenditures themselves were inappropriate, but whether they had been charged to the proper accounts.
After receiving the audit, the University had immediately removed the
charges in question and had made the endowment accounts whole. He noted that
the matter had received unusual attention by the local media.


303




June Meeting, 1994


The fiundamental issue, he noted, is the University's stewardship over gifts
contributed to support its activities. He stated that the University accepts full responsibility for ensuring that all funds contributed are spent for the purposes intended by the donors. This is accomplished by certification, which means making
certain that those who have authority to spend resources from endowment accounts certify that they understand the purpose of those endowments and that to
the best of their knowledge the expenditures they authorize are consistent with
those purposes. If it is found that questions are raised about charges to the accounts, the departments are required to make restitution by transferring funds
from other sources to the endowment accounts. He said he believes that the dual
approach of certification and restitution provides an effective method to ensure
that all funds contributed to the University are utilized for the purpose intended
by the donor.
President Duderstadt noted that there are 3,000 endowment or fundsfunctioning-as-endowment accounts, and each has an authorized signer who
bears primary responsibility for complying with the wishes of a donor. However,
a memorandum is to be sent to all deans, directors, and department heads to reemphasize their responsibility for assuring that all expenditures are in accordance both with University policies and with restrictions placed by the donors.
Each dean has been asked to review the guidelines for endowment expenditures,
and to certify that guidelines do exist for each endowment or restricted account
and that authorized signers are knowledgeable about these guidelines. The same
memorandum will be sent with account statements to project directors of such
funds. Further, all documents requesting or authorizing expenditures against
donor-restricted accounts will contain a certification that will ensure that the requested expenditure is consistent with the donor's wishes and contributions.
Each academic unit will be required to submit annually to the provost a brief
written description of the activity supported by the endowment or the fund, and
to certify that all expenditures against each endowment were consistent with the
purposes of the gift. Where such expenditures are found to be inconsistent, the
units will be required to make restitution.
Executive Vice President Womack expressed agreement that this was the
proper approach to take. Regent Brown observed that this matter was extremely
important to the Regents as well as to the University, and that it is essential that
alumni, donors, and prospective donors have complete confidence that gifts will
be used in accordance with the donor's designation. Regent Baker pointed out
that the process already in place had worked, as the expenditures that had been
charged improperly to the endowment accounts had been discovered through an
internal audit.
Regent Deitch pointed out that the more vague the goals of a particular endowment, the easier it is to charge expenditures against it improperly. He suggested that there be a central office that would consider whether the donor's
intent was being followed. He also suggested considering the idea of personal responsibility, rather than departmental responsibility, for improperly charged
expenditures.


304




June Meeting, 1994


Provost Whitaker observed that the current practice is to have endowment
gifts reviewed by an attorney in the development office, which results in more
clarity about the purposes of the gifts than what used to be the case. Executive
Vice President Womack pointed out that the best type of gifts are unrestricted
gifts, which place in the dean's hands the ability to determine the most appropriate use for them. He stated that the responsibility for determining which expenditures are in keeping with the donor's restrictions should lie not with a central
office, but with those who are responsible for the school or department. A preaudit would not constitute a sufficient control over the expenditures of these
funds. According to Executive Vice President Womack, restrictions on spending
are best applied by the individual authorized by the institution to sign for
expenditures.
Regent Power noted that there are problems with restricted endowments
created by the passage of time, and that the new guidelines would help clarify instances where such problems exist. He also pointed out that this whole episode is
an indication that the system works as it is intended to work An internal audit
had discovered instances in which money had been spent legally, but not in accordance with the purposes of the endowments. The findings had been aired; a
remedy, restitution, had been implemented; and the incident had triggered the
University's clarifying its policies with respect to these matters.
Report of the UM-Dearborn Faculty Senate Budget and Finance Committee
President Duderstadt called on Professor Seth Hirshorn, chair of the UMDearborn faculty senate, to present the report of the Senate Budget and Finance
Committee. Professor Hirshorn stated that the committee embraces the administration's goals in the following areas: 1) improving the quality of undergraduate
and graduate education; 2) limiting tuition increases; 3) improving the research
environment to enable the faculty to make its contribution to improving society
through research and development; and 4) increasing faculty salaries.
Professor Hirshorn observed that the branch campuses provide quality undergraduate education to a substantial portion of instate students. He also noted
that the Dearborn campus had recently educated its 1000th graduate student,
which is a landmark in the maturation of the campus and indicates that many
faculty members are engaged in graduate, as well as undergraduate education.
The campus has also reached a milestone of $1 million in contracted research activities, which is significant, given the fact that most faculty are so heavily involved in teaching activities. The chancellor has set a goal of $10 million in
contracted research over the next few years, which means that the Dearborn
campus will have to strengthen faculty relations with the Ann Arbor campus in
attaining that goal.
In the area of faculty salaries, Professor Hirshorn pointed out that the Dearborn faculty have consistently lagged behind peer institutions, and that longterm faculty, who have committed their adult lives to the institution, are the ones
who are least rewarded, especially when compared to newly-hired faculty. This
causes a morale problem. President Duderstadt responded that the Regents and


305




June Meeting, 1994


administration are very sensitive to the problems Professor Hirshorn described,
and that he was hopeful that the legislature was beginning to address these
issues.
CESF Report, University of Michigan-Flint
Chancellor Kugler introduced Professor Doug Miller, chair of the UM-Flint
faculty council, to present the report of the Committee on the Economic Status of
the Faculty at the UM-Flint. Professor Miller observed that the upcoming inauguration of Charlie Nelms as the fourth chancellor of the UM-Flint and the opening of the new library on the Flint campus provide an opportunity to
acknowledge the link between the Board of Regents and the UM-Flint faculty as
the cornerstone on which the success of the campus has been built. He reviewed
the history of the Flint campus and described some of the recent initiatives that
have been undertaken there. Professor Miller observed that the UM-Flint has become a home for the nontraditional student.
Regarding the CESF Report, Professor Miller stated that faculty salaries at
all ranks are above the median for peer institutions, but that faculty are concerned about salary differences among schools within the UM-Flint. Finally, he
indicated that Flint faculty are generally in favor of flexible benefits proposals.
Regent Baker expressed the Regents' appreciation to the Flint faculty for
their steadfastness in pursuing the development of the Flint campus. He noted
that this campus had gone well beyond the original expectations of the Board in
its physical plant, the breadth of its educational mission, and its success in bringing a particular dimension of education to Flint.
Regent McFee observed that both the Flint and Dearborn campuses serve
large numbers of nontraditional students and commented that the University's
ability to fulfill the needs of these students is a real service to the state's
population.
Regent Power noted that both regional campuses have the opportunity to
set forth a strategic role and mission which "adds value" to the University of
Michigan and the state's citizens, without necessarily replicating what is provided in Ann Arbor.
Michigan Student Assembly Financial Matters (Audit Report); 1994
Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly and School/College
Governments
Vice President Hartford introduced Ms. Julie Neenan and Mr. Jacob Stern,
president and executive vice president, respectively, of Michigan Student Assembly (MSA). Ms. Neenan stated that MSA is requesting a fee assessment of $2.69
per student per term for MSA and $1.00 per student per term for school and college governments for the 1994-95 year. These requests represent no increase over
the previous year's fee assessments.
Regarding the audit report, Regent Power expressed enthusiasm about the
mostly benign and complimentary management letter and the clean audit.


306




June Meeting, 1994


Executive Vice President Womack and Mr. Carl Smith, director of university
audits, concurred with Regent Power's assessment, and said that MSA should be
congratulated for it. Vice President Hartford expressed pride in the quality of
student leadership of MSA and noted that the $2.69 per student per term fee is
one of the smallest of any student government for any major American
university.
Regent Varner expressed support for the plans to transfer the supervision of
Student Legal Services from MSA to the Law School. Vice President Hartford
stated that she was optimistic that the new Law School dean would be receptive
to the proposal. Regent Baker observed that the whole concept of Student Legal
Services should be discussed more broadly prior to considering its transfer to the
Law School.
Regent Power moved approval of a fee assessment of $2.69 per student per
term for MSA and $1.00 per student per term for school/college governments. Regent McFee seconded the motion.
Regent Baker reported that he had not received the MSA auditor's statement and financial report until that day and questioned why this report, which
was dated April 29, 1994, should have been delayed nearly two months. Mr.
Rodger Wolf, assistant to the vice president for student affairs for finance, responded that the date on an audit report represents the last date of the field
work for the audit. The time between that date and when the report is presented
is spent in writing the report and management letter and in holding conferences
with the client. The other Regents noted that they had received their reports
with their agenda packets the previous week.
Ms. Neenan and Mr. Stern responded to questions from Regent Baker about
specific aspects of the report. The question was then called, and Regent Power's
motion to approve the MSA and school/college government fee request was approved unanimously. Regent Brown was away from the table when the vote was
taken.
1994-95 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Hartford reported that the recommended Health Service fee
increase of 4.89 percent ($4.50 per student term) was below the medical care cost
index, as it had been for a number of years. Following some discussion, Regent
Deitch moved approval for an increase in the University Health Service Fee of
$4.50 per student per term, to bring the total to $96.50 per student per term. Regent Waters seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. Regent
Brown was away from the table when the vote was taken.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the
Regents unanimously approved the minutes of the meeting of April 1994. It was
decided to withhold consideration of the May 1994 minutes until the following
month.


307




June Meeting, 1994


Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports on investment, plant extension, litigation, and personnel-labor relations, and responded to
questions from Regent Baker about endowments and about the University's relationship with the Industrial Technology Institute.
Vice President Neal submitted reports of projects established and sumnmaries of a selection of current research.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Cosovich submitted the report of voluntaty support for the month of June 1993, noting that cash gifts were coming in
at a record-setting pace, and that gifts from             individuals were 26 percent ahead of
the rate in the same period last year.

Retirement Memoirs. Provost Whitaker submitted retirement memoirs
for six faculty members.
John R. Bassett, professor of forestry, will retire from active faculty status
on June 30, 1994, following a distinguished career as an administrator, teacher,
and researcher.
Professor Bassett earned his AB. degree in 1949, his B.S. degree in 1965, his
M.F. degree in 1952, and his Ph.D. degree in 1961, all from the University of
Michigan. Following service in the U.S. Navy from 1952-56, he was employed by
the U.S. Forest Service from 1956-67. He joined the University of Michigan as an
assistant professor of forestry in 1967; he was promoted to associate professor in
1968 and professor of forestry in 1976.
Within the School of Natural Resources and Environment, Professor Bassett served as director of Camp Filibert Roth in the Upper Peninsula from
1967-76 and chaired the Fisheries, Forestry, and Wildlife Program from 1975-80.
He was director of undergraduate programs from 1980-83 and associate dean for
academic affairs from 1983-92.


325




June Meeting, 1994


A respected member of his profession, Professor Bassett has been a consultant to state and federal governments, private law firms, and landowners on matters concerning diverse management goals of forest lands and has held
leadership positions in the Michigan Chapter of the Society of American Foresters, the Michigan Forestry Association, the Michigan Tree Farm Committee, and
the Society of American Forestry Silviculture Working Group. These experiences
have enhanced his teaching, allowing him to show students both the practical
and theoretical sides of resource management issues.
Professor Bassett's teaching has ranged from general interest courses for
non-majors to highly specialized courses. Well over 100 students per semester
have enrolled in his class, "Forests for People." At the same time, he has taught
courses in biological management, forest biology, and his particular area of interest, silviculture or vegetation management. Professor Bassett's teaching is noteworthy for its combination of science and theory of management with practical
application in the field. Students in his classes could count on theory being translated into application by visiting research sites and management units.
Professor Bassett is perhaps best known for his research on computerized
urban tree inventories. His 1978 paper on this topic was the benchmark upon
which his sponsored research and practice developed. Recently, Professor Bassett
and his students have been pursing research of interest to the state of Michigan,
namely the reproduction of oaks on dry sites in the northern part of the lower
peninsula.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming John R. Bassett professor emeritus of forestry.
Douglas G. Dickson, professor of mathematics, retired from active faculty
status on May 31, 1994, after a productive career as a teacher and researcher.
A native of Montclair, New Jersey, Professor Dickson received his B.A
degree from Wesleyan University in 1947 and his AM. degree from Harvard
University in 1949. He taught at Dartmouth College, Hunter College, Columbia
University, and Barnard College from 1948-57 and completed his Ph.D. degree at
Columbia University in 1958. He joined the University of Michigan as assistant
professor of mathematics in 1958 and was promoted to associate professor in
1964 and professor in 1974. He visited the University of Paris on several
sabbaticals.
Professor Dickson's area of research was in complex analysis, with an emphasis on exponential sums. From 1973-75, Professor Dickson served as associate
chair for undergraduate education in the Department of Mathematics. He also
served on many departmental committees and was always a very conscientious
teacher, who was highly respected by his students. He directed four doctoral theses. From 1988-94, Professor Dickson served as editor for the Michigan Mathematical Journal, a period where the journal grew both in size and in the quality
of its publications.
The Regents now salute this mathematician for his dedicated teaching and
service by naming Douglas G. Dickson professor emeritus of mathematics.

June Meeting, 1994


Robert C. Kelsch, M.D., professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases in the Medical School, will retire from active faculty status on August 31,
1994.
Dr. Kelsch received his B.A degree from St. John University in Minnesota
in 1950 and his M.D. degree from St. Louis University in 1954. He served in the
U.S. Army from 1954-57 and then joined the University of Michigan medical staff
as an assistant resident in pediatrics from 1957-59. From 1959-62, he was an instructor in the Department of Pediatrics and a post-doctoral research trainee in
biochemistry, and from 1962-65 he served as assistant director of pediatrics at
Wayne County General Hospital. Dr. Kelsch was appointed assistant professor of
pediatrics in 1966 and was promoted to associate professor in 1969 and professor
in 1973.
Early in his career, Dr. Kelsch developed a keen interest in the field of renal
diseases of childhood, and he is considered to be a pioneer in the development of
the subspecialty of pediatric nephrology. Under his leadership, the Department of
Pediatrics developed one of the most outstanding programs for the care of children afflicted with renal disease. When pediatric nephrology was approved as a
subspecialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties in the early 1970s, Dr.
Kelsch was among the first cohort of successful examinees for certification in this
subspecialty when the first qualifying exam was given in 1974. Dr. Kelsch has
been elected to membership in numerous professional associations and has received the most prestigious teaching awards in the Medical Center, including the
Kaiser Permanente Award for Excellence in Teaching in the Clinical Sciences

He was highly successful in fluencing students, due to his dedication to teaching and his rapport with students.
The recipient of two Rackham Research Grants (1973-75 and 1980-83), Professor Kersten's research was directed at advertising in the environment. The
first grant, "Signs at the Marketplace," culminated in an exhibit dealing primarily with on-premise advertising. The second grant, "Ad Sites as Planned Elements in the Environment," focused on urban and highway off-premise
advertising and generated a proposal for more effective and visually pleasing outdoor advertising.
Professor Kersten's professional activities include architectural delineation,
illustration, product design, and identity programs for Detroit and Ann Arbor
firms; chancel design and furnishings for Ann Arbor churches; and collaboration
on signage programs for Detroit hospital centers. Most recently, he was curator
for "One Man's Vision - The Robert L. Sutton Commemorative Exhibit" in the
Slusser Gallery of the University of Michigan School of Art. Professor Kersten is

Professor Leonard served on many departmental committees and twice
served as acting chair of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures.
His publications include Umlaut in Romance (1978), as well as several articles on
comparative romance linguistics published in leading North American and European journals.
Professor Leonard will be remembered by his former graduate students for
the breadth of his knowledge and for the enthusiasm with which he introduced
them to the method and practice of comparative reconstruction. He gave many
University of Michigan undergraduates their first exposure to the field of romance linguistics and to the study of the history of the French language.
The Regents now salute this dedicated teacher and scholar for his devoted
service to the University by naming Clifford S. Leonard, Jr., associate professor
emeritus of romance linguistics.

Narrative in French Fiction from Zola to Robbe-Grillet (1989), as well as three
textbooks and a number of articles on French literature and film.
Generations of students remember Professor Nelson as an exceptionally
dedicated and outstanding undergraduate teacher. He introduced the study of
French film into Michigan's curriculum and directed the Honors Program in
French for 15 years prior to his retirement. His devotion to students and success
in teaching were recognized by his having received the Ruth Sinclair Award for
Honors Counseling and, in 1992, the Amoco Foundation Good Teaching Award.

Resolution in Honor of George D. Zuidema
Regent McFee read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend their deep
appreciation and warm regards to George D. Zuidema, M.D., as he
begins his retirement furlough on July 1, 1994.
For more than ten years, Dr. Zuidema has served as vice provost
for medical affairs and professor of surgery and has been the
guiding hand in overseeing the transformation of the University
Medical Center into one of the nation's foremost concentrations of
people devoted to human health training, research, and clinical care.
During his tenure, the University has seen the opening of the new
University Hospital, the A Alfred Taubman Health Care Center,
and a whole spate of treatment and research facilities that are the
envy of medical centers everywhere.
George Zuidema came to the University of Michigan from The
Johns Hopkins University, where he had been serving as professor
and director of the Department of Surgery and surgeon-in-chief at
The Johns Hopkins Hospital. In some respects, this was a bit of a
homecoming, since he had been born in Holland, Michigan, had
attended Hope College, and had served as assistant and associate
professor of surgery at the University of Michigan from 1960-64. He
received his own medical training at The Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, and completed his internship and residency at
Massachusetts General Hospital.
Dr. Zuidema's steady hand and watchful attention to the
pitfalls that surround health care training and health care delivery
have brought the medical center to a very strong leadership position
at it prepares to move into the 21st Century. The Regents now
commend him for his articulate direction of the medical center
during a period of remarkable growth and burgeoning complexity by
naming George D. Zuidema vice provost emeritus for medical
affairs.
There followed a round of applause, after which Dr. Zuidema thanked the
Regents for the resolution and everyone present for their understanding, cooperation, and goodwill over the years.
Resolution in Honor of Richard L. Kennedy
Regent Varner read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend Richard LE
Kennedy as he completes 38 years of outstanding service and


333




June Meeting, 1994


leadership to the University community. The longest serving
executive officer in the history of the University, Richard Kennedy
has served with 19 different regents, five presidents, and 27 vice
presidents. In his 24 years as secretary of the university, his
signature has appeared on over 227,000 diplomas, a record which
may never be duplicated at this or any other university.
A Michigan native, Richard Kennedy graduated from the
University of Michigan in 1954. In 1955, he married Ann Marie
Moran, his college sweetheart, who became his career partner and
mother of their five children. He began his distinguished career at
the University in 1956 as a field representative with the Development
Council, where he developed the initial concept for the President's
Club, which to this day serves as the cornerstone of the University's
highly successful major gifts and capital campaign effort. In 1961,
he was recruited to serve as director of alumni relations at Duquesne
University in Pittsburgh, but returned to the University of Michigan
in 1962 as special assistant in the Office of University Relations.
From 1963-67, Dick served as executive director of the University's
Sesquicentennial Celebration, with overall responsibility for
planning and executing the year-long program commemorating the
University's 150th anniversary. He served as director of state and
community relations from 1968-70 and became secretary of the
university and assistant to the president in 1970. In 1974, he was
appointed vice president for state relations, and in 1984 his title was
changed to vice president for government relations to reflect his
broadened leadership role in state, community, and federal relations.
Under his guidance, the University established two major outreach
offices, in Washington, D.C. and in Lansing.
The long-time "dean of community affairs" at the University,
Dick has served on the boards of scores of University and community
organizations, including those governing M-Care, University
Hospitals, and Intercollegiate Athletics, as well as the Ann Arbor
Chamber of Commerce, Washtenaw United Way, University Musical
Society, and the Ann Arbor Summer Festival. His many roles in the
Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) over
the years led to his being acclaimed as a pioneer and innovator, and
in his being recruited to author a chapter on effective government
relations in the second edition of Handbook of Institutional
Advancement (1986)% Dick's unique skills and multiple talents have
also been recognized by the Big Ten Government Relations Officers
group, where he is known as "Big Ten lobbyist and chief piano
player."
Every large, complex, bureaucratic organization needs to have
one person who is so universally respected and admired that he is
understood to be the one who can be counted on for advice or
assistance when all else fails. Dick Kennedy has been that person at
the University of Michigan for more than 30 years. A man of
exceptional wisdom, insight, modesty, and unfailing good humor,
Dick has served as advisor, friend, and confidant to University and


334




June Meeting, 1994


community leaders, students, and many others from all walks of life.
The Regents now express their profound gratitude to Dick and Ann
Kennedy for their lifelong devotion and leadership and proudly
name Richard L. Kennedy secretary emeritus of the university.
There followed a round of applause, after which President Duderstadt called
on Regent Waters, who made the following motion:
Renaming of Union Drive
Regent Waters stated that "in further recognition of Dick's unparalleled
leadership, commitment, and service to the University community and to the Regents in his dual roles as vice president and secretary of the university, I move
that we rename Union Drive, Richard L. Kennedy Drive." He observed that this
would be a most fitting tribute to Vice President Kennedy, as due to his long tenure, he has probably spent more time in the Fleming Building than anyone else,
and that his office overlooks the street to be renamed.
Regent Baker seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
There followed a round of applause.
Vice President Kennedy expressed his gratefilness for the Regents' actions.
He observed that he owed much to all the people he had been associated with
over the years. The University is a "magnificent place", with a "magnificent set
of officers", and an "unmatched set of Regents". He expressed his enormous
pride at having been able to serve the University.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting will be held on July 14 and 15, 1994. Regents' expenses for the month of
May 1994 totaled $1902.35.

ADDENDUM


The following item was approved at the meeting of April 1993, but was
omitted from the July 1992-June 1993 volume of the Proceedings of the Board of
Regents:
Proposed Research Contract between the University of Michigan and
Therapeutic Systems Research Laboratories, Inc. (TSRL)
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent McFee, all six
Regents present unanimously approved a research contract between the
University of Michigan and Therapeutic Systems Research Laboratories, Inc.
(TSRL). Because the president of TSRL, Gordon L. Amidon, and principal investigator of the project for TSRL, Hye J. Lee, are also a University employees, this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and
TSRL, Inc.;
2.   The contract to be signed is the University's standard research contract. The
University will be paid $20,548 in direct costs and $9,452 in indirect costs for a
one-year project. The indirect cost amount reflects the University's full indirect
cost rate.
3.   Professor Amidon's financial interst arises from his ownership of TSRL. Dr.
Lee will be paid solely by the University for her work on the proposed project.
She will, of course, continue to receive compensation from TSRL for her work
as a TSRL employee.

JULY MEETING, 2003


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, July 17, 2003
The Regents convened at 1:05 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Interim Executive Vice
President Greenfield, Vice President Harper, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little,
Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice
President Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and
Vice President Wilbanks.
President Coleman called the meeting to order and announced that Public
Comments would be divided into two sessions. The first session, covering topics
related to the budget, would be the next order of business, and the second session would
be held following the budget discussion and vote.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following people, on the topics indicated:
Aaron Klein, alumnus, Martin Farnham and Miroslav Kummel, students, and Phil Roe,
faculty member, on the closure of the student woodshop; Holly Burmeister, student and
vice president of the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO), on health care for
members of GEO; and Adele Smaill, student and member of the GEO, on issues regarding
residence hall libraries.
Following a 5-minute break, President Coleman turned to the next item of
business.
Introductory Comments - 2003-2004 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
President Coleman commented that this had been an extremely difficult year
financially, with a significant downturn in the economy in the state and nation. To meet
this challenge, the University had looked extremely hard at the budgets of all three
campuses and had reduced costs as much as possible to become more efficient. She
thanked all of the executive officers and Regents for their work in this area and noted that
it had been a thoughtful, productive process. She called on Executive Vice President
Slottow.
Mr. Slottow noted that the responsibilities of the executive vice president and
chief financial officer are to effectively track and manage financial performance, protect
and strengthen the balance sheet, evaluate the operating budgets to ensure they maintain
the University's overall financial health, and to identify long-term financial challenges
and strategies for meeting them. Another responsibility that has become increasingly
important is to continue to focus on financial controls and compliance.
In the area of financial controls and compliance, Executive Vice President Slottow
noted that the University continues to receive unqualified audit opinions and has also


1




July Meeting, 2003


received sound advice from the Regents' Finance, Audit and Investment Committee in
this area. He reported that the Financial Controls Task Force has revamped nearly all of
the University's financial controls, policies, and practices, including travel and hosting
reimbursement, purchasing practices, and such areas as cash management and property
disposition, among others. Work has also been done to simplify sponsored research
administration and increase financial controls in this area.
He reported that the University has continued to make it easier for parents,
students, and faculty to conduct business with the University via the web, including
applications, registration, bill payment, and many other areas.  Supply chain
management has also improved, with new prime vendor contracts having been
negotiated and more procurement being done electronically.
Regarding the balance sheet, Executive Vice President Slottow commented that
his office manages $8.5 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion in physical properties,
$5.5 billion in investments, and $0.6 billion in other assets. He displayed a graph
illustrating the University's investments in physical plant renewal, which shows that
more funds continue to be invested in renovation than in new buildings and that the
University continues to invest more in renovation than depreciation, thus illustrating the
University's sustained commitment to renovation and infrastructure renewal. He
pointed out that there are multi-year renewal plans in a number of areas and that
deferred maintenance needs are always addressed concurrent with programmatic
renovation investments.  Savings have been realized by subjecting construction
expenses to a much more rigorous focus on requirements, which increases competition
and lowers costs and has saved millions of dollars in new building construction.
Executive Vice President Slottow listed strategies being used to aggressively
manage balance sheet assets and liabilities and noted that these have resulted in
significant cost savings. He said that the University has a healthy ratio of assets to
liabilities and of debt to financial assets, but he pointed out that liabilities do not include
the liability for future health benefits for retirees and that the majority of financial assets
are in endowment or have restrictions as to their use.
It is important, he noted, that the University continue to adhere to core financial
principles, including focusing on financial controls, adhering to a prudent debt policy,
enforcing the endowment spending rule and long-term investment strategy, and
maintaining a commitment to infrastructure renewal and to a disciplined operating
budget strategy.
He concluded that the annual operating budget is only one indicator of the
University's financial condition, and that the proposed budget is consistent with
maintaining the University's overall financial health.  Quoting from  a Moody's
Investors Service press release of February 2003, he stated that the University's
financial health is due to a "disciplined budget process, appropriate expense controls...
powerful market draw [due to] selective undergraduate and graduate programs...
well-diversified revenue base... manageable plans for additional borrowing... [and a]
capable management team."
President Coleman stated that the 2003-2004 Operating Budgets for all campuses
would be presented next.

July Meeting, 2003


2003-2004 Ann Arbor Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student
Tuition and Fee Rates
Provost Courant reported that the proposed operating budget calls for total revenues
of $4.239 billion and total expenditures of $4.268 billion. The deficit has to do with funds
that the Medical School had been accruing over several years for specific purposes and
which will be spent in fiscal year 2004.
He then gave a presentation about the proposed General Fund budget, which, he
noted, was derived under the most severe fiscal challenges the University has faced in
over a generation. He described the organizing principles on which the budget is based.
First, to preserve access to the highest quality education despite a 10% cut in state
appropriations, the University is increasing central financial aid for undergraduates and
limiting the tuition increase to 6.5%, which is the lowest in the state and among the
lowest in the Big Ten. Second, every unit is bearing some of the effect of budget cuts,
with administrative units and activities bearing a disproportionately larger share.
Lastly, the University will continue to focus on the long-term quality of the institution
while managing short-term budgetary difficulties.
Provost Courant noted that the reduction in state appropriation combined with a
reduction in interest income, cost increases, and commitments and essential initiatives,
yield a total budget challenge of $81.8 million. To partially meet this challenge,
expenditures have been reduced by $37.5 million. He displayed charts illustrating the
annual percentage changes in General Fund revenues from state appropriation and
tuition and noted that the growth in the FY 2004 proposed budget is negative. He
pointed out that in the face of a 10% cut in state appropriation, the University's
proposed resident tuition increase is substantially less than it was for FY 2003, when
there was a zero percent increase in state appropriation.
Provost Courant commented that the fact that the University's proposed tuition
increase is 4th lowest among Big Ten institutions and the lowest of any Michigan
public institution can be attributed to the success of ongoing efforts to cut costs and to
respond to specific challenges faced for FY 2004. He enumerated specific areas of
centralized and non-centralized cost reductions, cost containment, and expenditure
reductions, both in centralized and non-centralized operations.
He noted that a major initiative is underway to reduce health care benefits costs
both for the upcoming year and in the future. Beginning in January 2004, most
employees will share in the cost of health insurance premiums, and a committee of
faculty and staff has been working to examine the best ways to determine University
and employee contribution formulas on an ongoing basis. Their report will be issued in
September, and policy decisions based on this report will be implemented in January
2005.
He also described the multitude of cost-containment and expenditure reduction
actions that have occurred in decentralized units across the campus, which have totaled
$26 million in academic programs and $11 million in administrative areas. He stated
that the reductions in academic areas do not put the essentials of a Michigan education
at risk, although some of them may be difficult to sustain and their consequences will
be monitored.

July Meeting, 2003


Provost Courant pointed out that even after making cuts in activities and costs,
most of the academic units will receive modest budget increases, most accounted for by
tuition generated by increased numbers of students and increased volume of indirect
cost recovery from sponsored research. General fund budgets for administrative units
will be reduced.
Provost Courant concluded that although this budget is tighter than those of the
recent past, the priorities--maintaining excellence and access--are unchanged, including
meeting the demonstrated financial needs of all resident undergraduate students. He
noted that financial aid resources have increased beyond the rise in tuition in the FY
2004 budget and that administrative budgets are declining while academic budgets are
rising. Faculty and staff quality, and the breadth and depth of academic offerings, will
be maintained.
2003-2004 Dearborn Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student
Tuition and Fee Rates
Chancellor Little noted that the campus has experienced unavoidable cost increases,
combined with a 10% reduction in state appropriation. He described the collaborative,
principle-driven process that has guided development of the budget, with the highest
principle being to preserve and enhance the academic quality of educational offerings at
the University of Michigan-Dearborn. He noted that the Dearborn campus takes full
advantage of all of the cost-savings systems developed on the Ann Arbor campus.
Chancellor Little noted that the 10% cut in state appropriations amounted to $2.8
million for the Dearborn campus. The first action was to mandate a 2% budget
reallocation across the campus, which yielded $1 million. To ensure accessibility,
additional funds were added to the financial aid budget above the amount necessary to
match the tuition increases.  The recommended budget also involves a 1.5%
merit-based salary program. Chancellor Little noted that enrollment growth has
allowed for an increase of $1 million in the base budget from additional tuition
revenues. The recommended tuition increase is 9.5%, or $232 per semester.
2003-2004 Flint Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and
Fee Rates
Chancellor Mestas commented that a combination of factors has led to a particularly
challenging situation for the Flint campus.  These include the 10%  cut in state
appropriation, a 10% increase in fixed costs, and a projected 4% drop in enrollment,
which is unique to the Flint campus. To meet these challenges, he said the FY 2004
budget includes no faculty or staff salary increases, an 11% increase in tuition and fees, a
corresponding 11% increase in student financial aid, and a total budget cut of $4.0
million. He described how the budget reductions would be achieved and noted that
teaching and other instructional activities are being protected as much as possible.
Despite the tuition increase, Chancellor Mestas observed that the University of
Michigan-Flint is moving from the fifth most affordable institution in the state to the
fourth most affordable, making it one of the best values in higher education.

July Meeting, 2003


2003-2004 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Harper noted that the University Health Service is a comprehensive,
full-service outpatient facility that has 70,000 patient visits per year. The health service
fee allows students to receive primary health care services without additional
out-of-pocket expenses and supports an extensive, campus-wide, educational program in
addition to providing other health-related services. The proposed 2003-2004 fee increase
for University Health Service is 5%, or $6.20, yielding a total fee of $130.35 per student
per term.
2003-04 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
Vice President Harper noted that the proposed fees for fiscal year 2003-04 for MSA,
SLS, and school/college governments are the same as for 2002-03: $6.69 per student per
term for MSA; $5.50 per student per term for SLS; and $1.50 per student per term for
school and college governments.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) Proposed FY 2004
Operating Budget
Interim Executive Vice President Greenfield commented that the UMHHC met its
targeted FY 2003 operating margin of 2% and that the target margin for FY 2004 is 3%.
The major risks in achieving this margin are assumptions that market demand will remain
strong and that physician and nurse capacity and plant capacity will be sufficient to meet
the demand. Government responses to the economic market, sustainability of the payer
mix, and the ability to continue to manage budgeted expenses constitute the other major
risks of the proposed budget.
Dr. Greenfield displayed a chart giving activity assumptions for the 2002 (actual),
2003 (projected), and 2004 (proposed) budgets. Inpatient discharges, inpatient days,
and onsite operating room cases are projected to increase above historical levels, while
clinic visits are expected to increase at historical levels. It is projected that offsite
operating room cases will remain flat, following an increase of more than 50% between
FY 2002 and FY 2003. The average discharge length of stay will also remain relatively
flat.
Dr. Greenfield noted that operating room capacity has been and will continue to be
increased and that there will be increased recruiting of surgical faculty and nursing to
support this increase. The major drivers of the FY 2004 operating budget are a
significant increase in surgical procedures, productivity improvements and supply
management initiatives, and a competitive salary program. The budget calls for
operating revenue of $1.161 billion, (9.1% increase); operating expenses of $1.116
(7.0% increase), total expenses of 1.126 billion (8.0% increase); and an operating
margin of $34.8 million (3.0% increase).
FY 2004 University of Michigan Athletic Department Operating Budget
President Coleman called on Mr. Bill Martin, athletic director. Mr. Martin reviewed
the financial principles of the Athletic Department and noted that it is a self-supporting,
auxiliary unit that funds all varsity sports to achieve success. The department strives to
fulfill its gender equity goals, pursues limited commercialization, seeks a balanced budget


5




July Meeting, 2003


over the long term, and strives to maintain the athletic campus consistent with available
resources.
Regarding current budget realities, Mr. Martin noted that the department relies
heavily on football attendance revenues and that the scheduling of a seventh home
football game in 2002 and 2003 has had a beneficial effect on the budget by providing
an additional $4 million in revenues for each of those two years. The department's
annual fundraising efforts continue to lag behind its peers, and expenses throughout
intercollegiate athletics continue to accelerate.
Mr. Martin reported that for FY 2003, the Athletic Department will have a
projected operating surplus of over $5 million. He said that fewer student season
football tickets had been sold than budgeted, which was a significant positive factor in
projected revenues. Mr. Martin reviewed expenses for FY 2003 and noted that there
were significant increases in both facilities expenses and in operating and
administrative expenses over budget.  These were due to facilities repairs and
repayment of funds to the NCAA as a result of basketball program infractions that had
occurred a decade ago.
The FY 2004 Athletic Department budget includes projections of $58.9 million in
revenue (5.1% increase), $57.2 million in expenses (5.6% increase), and an operating
budget surplus of 1.6 million. It is based on modest increases in football ticket prices
and conservative budgets for student ticket sales, licensing revenues, and annual fund
giving. Expenses include a deferred maintenance fund transfer of $2.25 million and a
7% increase in financial aid costs, a 7% market-rate increase in compensation, and a 7%
increase in team and game expenses.
Mr. Martin reviewed planned capital projects, the most high priority of which is
the planned Academic Success Center. He said that $2.1 million in signed pledges has
been received and commitments have been made for $6.4 million. Other future projects
include a new fieldhouse, baseball and softball stadiums, and a basketball and wrestling
practice facility.
Regarding the balance sheet, Mr. Martin noted that a deferred maintenance fund
was established in the current fiscal year with initial funding of $2.25 million, and an
additional allocation of $2.25 million is planned for FY 04. The department enjoys a
relatively modest debt level of $8.0 million. The market value of the scholarship
endowment is $20 million, and the market value of the quasi-endowment is $15 million.
There was a projected operating reserve of approximately $5 million in June 2003.
The work plan for FY 2004 includes creating a stabilized economic model that
includes study and implementation of priority seating; beginning construction of the
academic success center; continued fundraising efforts for other capital projects;
continued study and analysis of press box renovation; and finally, continuing to work
on cost control initiatives.
Discussion of Proposed FY 2004 Budgets
Regarding the proposed Ann Arbor campus General Fund Budget, Regent Newman
stated that the idea of raising costs at a time when families find it difficult to afford a
Michigan education is difficult. She is concerned about rising costs, increasing financial
aid, and affordability and had hoped and believed that more could be done. However, in


6




July Meeting, 2003


support of the other board members and the administration, she had decided to vote in
favor of the tuition increases because of the unprecedented scope of the budgetary
challenge and because of the major effort that had been expended to pare the increase to
the current figures. She predicted that the coming year would be equally difficult and
noted that the institution had to find ways "to do more with less."
Regent Deitch complimented President Coleman and her management team on
their hard work in achieving the current budget recommendation. He noted that
responsible budgets could have been achieved at either slightly higher or slightly lower
levels of increase, but that on balance, the proposed budget "represents a Herculean
effort" and good faith. He observed that the Board and administration have an ongoing
commitment to the breadth, depth, and quality of a Michigan education. However,
preserving access is always a concern. Although commitment to financial aid is strong,
this is a complicated matter as the amount of financial aid represents both an increase
and a shifting of dollars from the full-rate payers to others. He stated that he remains
concerned about tuition and that the University needs to continue to focus on families
who do not qualify for financial aid but find it difficult to afford tuition payments in the
face of other familial obligations. He concluded that this challenge has been met with
this budget proposal. He commended Regent Newman for the continuing concern she
has expressed over the years about exercising restraint over tuition increases.
Regent Brandon stated that as chair of the Finance, Audit, and Investment
Committee, he is proud to report that he is in full support of the budget. He said that the
committee has learned more about this budget than any previous budget, and he noted
that the process has been transparent and open. The questions asked and responses
received from senior administrators were important in achieving the final budget
proposal. He commended the executive officers and staff for their openness, candor,
and communication flow that was instrumental in reaching this point.
Regent McGowan noted that she had been skeptical when the Board had
established the committee system over a year ago. Since that time, she has come to the
conclusion that under the guidance of Regent Brandon as chair and the participation of
fellow Finance, Audit, and Investment Committee member Regent Taylor, along with
the rest of the Board and with the assistance of the executive officers, the committee
had functioned "remarkably well and responsively and responsibly." She thanked
Regent Brandon for his leadership.
Regent Maynard commented that "this is probably one of the more painful budgets
that I've experienced." However, she said that "it has also been the best vetted budget
process that I've been through since I've been a Regent." Speaking as one who is not a
member of the Finance, Audit, and Investment Committee, she complimented that
committee for their work in ensuring that all of the Regents were thoroughly informed
about all aspects of the budget process. She complimented President Coleman, Provost
Courant, and Executive Vice President Slottow for all of their efforts in developing the
budget recommendations. Regent Maynard observed that in light of the much larger
tuition increases at other institutions, combined with the University of Michigan's
strong commitment to a commensurate increase in financial aid, she feels good about
the budget being put forth at this meeting.

July Mleeting, 200 3


Regent White applauded the administration's commitment to meeting the
demonstrated financial aid needs of resident undergraduate students.
Regent Richner commented that as a state legislator prior to being elected to the
Board, he had looked forward to having an opportunity to limit annual tuition rate
increases. However, since joining the Board, he realized that his preconceptions had
been unrealistic and that in light of the 10% cut in state appropriations the University,
had developed "the most reasonable budget we could possibly come up with." He
noted that it is significant that the percentage of tuition increase is at a lower level than
the state budget cut, indicating that serious efforts had been made to reduce costs and
improve efficiencies in the budget. He applauded the administration for having taken
this course.
2003-2004 Revenue and fExpenditure Operating Budgets; Proposed Ann Arbor FY
2003-04 General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Regent Taylor moved approval of the 2003-2004 Revenue and Expenditure
Operating Budgets, the proposed Ann Arbor FY 2003-04 General Fund Operating
Budget, and the proposed Ann Arbor FY 2003-04 student tuition and fee rates, as
described in the Regents Communications. Regent Brandon seconded the motion and it
was approved unanimously.
President Coleman commented that the financial situations on the Dearborn and
Flint campuses are very different from those on the Ann Arbor campus, so that the Ann
Arbor campus has a much better ability to withstand state budget cuts. She stated that
the Regents and executive officers fully recognize this and understand that the branch
campuses have worked just as hard as the Ann Arbor campus to cope with the economic
situation. She also expressed the hope that the state will begin increasing its support of
higher education once the economy improves. She thanked the executive officers for
their willingness to forego any salary increases for the 2003-2004 fiscal year.
Proposed Dearborn Campus FY 2003-04 General Fund Operating Budget and
Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Regent Brandon moved approval of the proposed Dearborn Campus FY 2003-04
General Fund Operating Budget and student tuition and fee rates, as described in the
Regents Communication. Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Proposed Flint Campus FY 2003-04 General Fund Operating Budget and Student
Tuition and Fee Rates
Regent Maynard moved approval of the proposed Flint Campus FY 2003-04
General Fund Operating Budget and student tuition and fee rates, as described in the
Regents Communications. Regent White seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
2003-2004 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved fee assessments of $6.69 per student per term for MSA, $5.50 per


8




July Meeting, 2003


student per term for SLS, and $1.50 per student per term for school and college
governments. All of these rates are unchanged from those for 2002-2003.
2003-2004 University Health Service Fee
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved a 5.0% increase ($6.20 per student per term) in the University
Health Service fee for 2003-2004. The new fee will be $130.35 per student per term.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) Proposed FY
2004 Operating Budget
President Coleman commended UMHHC           officials for their excellent work in
managing the UMHHC and preparing the operating budget. Regent Brandon observed
that the Hospitals and Health Centers were one of the first units examined by the Regents'
Finance, Audit, and Investment Committee. The current 2% operating margin and the 3%
operating margin in the 2004 budget is a real accomplishment, he noted. It makes a
statement about the UMHHC leadership and illustrates the high degree of competence of
everyone involved. Regent Deitch agreed and noted that he "can't imagine that there is a
better hospital administrator in this country than Mr. Warren" and the other health system
leaders.
President Coleman suggested that this would be an appropriate time to recognize
the accomplishments of Dr. Greenfield in leading the health system during this past
year as interim executive vice president for medical affairs. She called on Regent
Newman.
Regent Newman recalled an encounter she had had as a patient of Dr. Greenfield,
and she noted that he had been kind and caring, and although a surgeon, he had
recommended an alternative course of treatment other than surgery. These traits, of
being kind, caring, and thorough, had carried through during his service as interim
executive vice president, and she said the Regents would miss him. She then read the
following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University ofMichigan commend Lazar J. Greenfield as he
completes his term as interim executive vice president for medical affairs.
During his year of service as executive vice president, Dr. Greenfield,
professor of surgery and former F.A. Coller Professor of Surgery and chair of the
Department of Surgery, oversaw the operations of the Medical School, the University
of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers, M-CARE, and the Michigan Health
Corporation. In a time of great turmoil in the health-care industry, Dr. Greenfield
maintained the fiscal vitality of the Health System by directing it through simultaneous
cost containment efforts and expansion in capacity, and by shepherding development of
major capital projects. The Regents relied on his incisive vision when considering
approval of the Cardiovascular Centelr, which soon will stand as a new jewel in the
crown of the University o(f Michigan Health System.. He was also instrumental in the
significant advancement of other capital projects, including the Depression Center,
operating room expansion, and the Biomedical Science Research Building. He
initiated development of the highly regarded website, "Genetics: The Symphony of
Life, " a multidisciplinary tour of both the beauty and vital nature of genetics research
at the University of Michigan.  Dr. Greenfield guided the Health System's


9




July Meeting, 2003


comprehensive effort to meet both the letter and spirit of the new Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act requirements, and he was instrumental in achieving
full preparedness to meet emerging pblic health concerns, such as SARS and Wlest
Nile virus.
The Regents now express their deepest appreciation to Lazar J. Greenfield for
his exemplary service as interim executive vicevi president fir medical affairs and wish
him 'well as he returns to his role as a distinguished faculty member in the Department?f Surge;y.
A standing ovation followed. Dr. Greenfield thanked the Regents and noted "what
a privilege and pleasure it's been to work with you." He also commented about how
much the Health System appreciates the Regents' endorsement and support.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMH:HC) Proposed FY
2004 Operating Budget
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the proposed FY 2004 University of Michigan Hospitals and
Health Centers' Operating Budget.
A ten-minute break followed, beginning at 3:00 p.m. Regent McGowan left the
meeting at 3:00.
Public Comments
The Regents reconvened at 3:10 p.m. and heard comments from the following
speakers, on the topics indicated: Chetly Zarko, alumnus, on transparency in creating a
new admissions process; Jim Mogensen, citizen, on the town-gown relationship for the
handicapped; David Noel, citizen and member of V.O.I.C.E., on trespassing by the poor
and homeless; Emily Russell and Chelsea Stroh, students and members of Anti-War
Action!, on the Army Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies.
Comments Regarding Supreme Court Admissions Cases
President Coleman commented that this is the first meeting since the announcement
of the Supreme Court decision on June 23, 2003. She made the following statement:
I certainly believe that this is a watershed time fbr our country.  The
University of Michigan, and I was so proud of the University, has helped lead the
nation in a critical dialog and in a poweirful recommitment to the value of diversity.
The Supreme Court recognized what we as educators have long known, the educational
benefits of diversity in the classroom are vast. They have a ripple efect on every part
of American society, from corporations to our national defense. This year it's been a
real privilege for me to take the cases across the finish line. But my contribution is a
very small part of the monumental effort during the course of the litigation, including
Jim 3Duderstadt, Lee Bollinger, Nancy Canto;r Jeff Lehman, socia scientist Pat Gurin
and her faculty colleagues. Of course, I'mi reminded that this university's commitment
to di'versity has been long and deep, with many tireless leaders in the effort over
decades building the foundation on w hich we stand today.
Today I'd like to recognize the contriibutions of som e of the people who played
a role in that effort. Our general counsel, Marvin Krislov, led a spectacular legal team
with outside counsels John Payton and Maureen Mahoney. He was the architect of the
defense. The University committed to a vigorous public awareness effbrt as well, and
that was handled in-house by our communications team, and I've received so many


10




July Meeting, 2003


positive comments nationally about the skill and the expertise of that whole
communications team. Our alumni and our current students provided important
support. They shared their own voices as well as their personal experiences about
what makes a Michigan education so valuable. But above all, today, I want to
acknowledge the long-standing support of the University's Board of Regents, past and
present. That support has been unwavering, and without it we couldn't have led one of
the most important national debates of our lifetime.
There is much to do now. We've had a little time of celebration and that 's
been great, but we're already hard at work. We know the challenges are there. The
Supreme Court provided us with guidance about how to consider race as one of many,factors in selective admissions processes. And as a result, we're in the process now of
redesigning our undergraduate admissions program to comply with that ruling. We
will be ready for students who wish to apply to the University this autumn.
She then invited comments from the Regents.
Regent Deitch commented that "those of us who were in the Supreme Court that
day found it an incredible experience as Americans, to think that difficult, contentious
issues are resolved through thoughtful debate and interaction." He noted that President
Coleman had skillfully assumed leadership of the cause upon her arrival. He expressed
confidence that the University "will meet [coming] challenges wherever they'll be, and
I'm very proud to be associated with it."
Regent Maynard associated herself with Regent Deitch's comments. She thanked
President Coleman for her "articulate and strong leadership" as well as everyone else
who contributed to the case's success. She stated that she was particularly appreciative
of all of the amicus briefs that had been filed, which spoke to the national impact of the
cases. She agreed with Regent Deitch that this is a marker in a long process, with much
remaining to be done before racial inclusion is achieved. She paraphrased a report
about the case that had appeared in a recent issue of the Chronicle for Higher
Education, which stated that there is a need to embrace an expanded role for higher
education so that it works in partnership with primary and secondary educators to
improve the quality of education for poor children and children of color. It calls on
institutions to "redouble our efforts to ensure that everyone who enrolls in this
university experiences a rigorous, horizon-expanding and intellectually challenging
education and to make sure that every student learns about the struggles for full
inclusion in our democracy that have been a crucial part in our nation's history."
Regent Maynard said that "it is my hope and it is certainly my commitment that
everybody at the University is committed to taking on these challenges, because there is
much work to be done."
Regent White agreed with the remarks of Regents Deitch and Maynard. She noted
that in the preface of the book, The Shape of the River, by Derok Bok and William
Bowen, the authors compare Mark Twain's image of the Mississippi River as central to
the progress of our country, to the image of the flow of talent moving through the
higher education system, particularly that of underrepresented minorities. The image is
often compared to a pipeline, but rather than being straight, it bends and curves like the
shape of the Mississippi River. They note that the college admissions process and
educational experience are complex in a similar fashion to the shape of the Mississippi
River. "Surely," Regent White said, "We are looking to do more than just predict first


11




July Meeting, 2003


year grades and even graduation rates when we are looking to admit people to this
institution. It is the contributions that individuals make through their lives and the
broader impact of higher education on society as a whole that is finally most relevant."
Regent Taylor congratulated all members of the team who had brought this matter
to a successful conclusion and noted that former president Bollinger had "done a
magnificent job" in assembling the legal team and the amicus briefs. He expressed
pride at how successful the University had been in this effort.
Regent McGowan had pointed out in comments prepared prior to having left the
meeting that moments after the announcement of the decision an observation had been
made that the country was fortunate that the defense of the use of race as a contributing
factor in admissions to colleges and universities had fallen to the University of
Michigan, due to the University's commitment, achievements, resources, and will to
sustain and succeed in this effort. She thanked everyone involved for the broad array of
research, skills, and personal commitment brought to this effort, concluding that "It has
been a long and remarkable road--and I am proud to have been a part of it." The
complete text of these comments is on file in the Office of the Vice President and
Secretary of the University.
Vice President Krislov acknowledged the contributions of University staff and
outside counsel who had been involved in the litigation throughout the process. He also
thanked the Regents for their steadfast support.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit, and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and received information on three topics: the economic
impact of the Supreme Court decision; M-Care financial performance; and recent internal
audits.
Compensation and Personnel Committee.       Regent Maynard noted that
following last month's executive session, the committee had concluded its evaluation of
President Coleman which had resulted in a very positive appraisal of her first year in
office. She said that the committee would be meeting with President Coleman in
September to set the agenda for the coming academic year.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of June 19, 2003.

Plant Extension Report; the Regents Quarterly Report on Non-Competitive Purchases
over $5,000 from Single Sources, March 16-June 15, 2003; and the Human Resources
and Affirmative Action Report. He noted that for the first time in three years,
marketable securities have shown a positive trend. He also pointed out that there were

CANCELLATION OF PREVIOUSLY APPROVED
REGENTS COMMUNICATION
Gough, Maria E., Associate Professor of the History of Art, with tenure, College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, September 1, 2003 (approved February 2003)
Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for 6 retiring
faculty members. She noted that one of the retirees, Professor William Drake, had died
less than two weeks after retiring.
Provost Courant called attention to the retirement of Professor Carl Berger, former
dean of the School of Education.
Anita K. Barry, Ph.D., professor of linguistics in the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on May
31, 2003.
Professor Barry received her B.A. degree from Queen's College in 1965, her M.A.
degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1966, and her Ph.D. degree from the
University of Minnesota in 1973. She joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty
as an assistant professor in 1975, and was promoted to associate professor in 1978 and
professor in 1987.
By developing a full range of undergraduate and graduate linguistics courses and a
linguistics minor, Professor Barry led the way in moving the English department from a
purely literary approach to a more comprehensive program.        She was an active
researcher who combined her scholarly expertise and classroom experience in two
highly regarded texts. From the proceeds of the first she funded the English Grammar
Book Award, which is given every semester to the top five students in each section of
the "Structure of English" course. She was also active in the Linguistic Society of
America, the American Dialect Association, and the Language and Law Association.
Professor Barry was very active in the University community. She served multiple
terms on the College of Arts and Sciences Executive Committee, led the department's
first self-study, codified department policies, and was appointed department chair. In
addition, she headed the College of Arts and Sciences Task Force on Teaching, served
as director of the Law and Society Program, and participated in the development of the
master's degree program in education. Professor Barry instituted and directed the
College of Arts and Sciences' faculty colloquium series, edited the University of
Michigan-Flint Faculty Forum, and served on numerous advisory committees.
The Regents now salute this distinguished linguistic educator for her dedicated
service by naming Anita K. Barry professor emerita of linguistics.

July Meeting, 2003


Carl F. Berger, Ed.D., professor of education in the School of Education and
director of advanced technologies in the Collaboratory for Advanced Research and
Academic Technologies, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2003.
Professor Berger received his B.A. degree from the University of Denver in 1958,
his M.A. degree from Sacramento State College in 1966, and his Ed.D. degree from the
University of California-Berkeley in 1971. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an associate professor in 1972 and was promoted to professor in 1976.
Professor Berger's research has focused on the use of technology as a tool for
learning and for gathering and interpreting educational data. This research included
investigating how people learn with technology, using technology to make complex
subjects accessible, and implementing assessment tools to evaluate faculty and student
technology use. Professor Berger was co-principal investigator on the Visible Human
Project, which is a detailed, digital anatomical database of the human body that helped
usher in the use of virtual anatomical tools. He taught many courses, including science
teaching methods, technological capabilities, research methods in cognition and
technology, and educational software design and authoring. He also held a number of
administrative positions, including associate dean for research in the School of Education
(1979-82), dean of the School of Education (1983-88), director of instructional technology
in the Information Technology Division (1989-99), and director and academic liaison in
the Office of the Chief Information Officer from 1999-01. In 2000, he was appointed
director of advanced academic technologies in the Collaboratory for Advanced Research
and Academic Technologies.
In 1979, Professor Berger was named "Michigan Science Educator of the Year" by
the National Association for Research in Science Teaching. He also received the
Distinguished Contributions to Science Education through Research Award in 1996 and

Coleman and Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Provost Courant, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice
President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,

33




September Meeting, 2003


attention to a three-month long, University-wide event, "Celebrating St. Petersburg,"
being held in observance of the tri-centennial of St. Petersburg, Russia.
Parking and Transportation Update
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that parking is one of the most
strategic investments made at the University, and this requires comprehensive, long-term
planning. He had asked Associate Vice President Henry Baier to present the strategic
parking and transportation plan.
Mr. Baier noted that about 4,000 faculty and staff members have been added to the
University since 1998, which has a significant impact on parking and transportation
programs. Fortunately, each person does not equate to a parking space since some
people use alternative transportation, some are in off-campus leased facilities, and some
work different shifts. In 1998 the parking and transportation departments were
combined, in recognition of a significant need for more remote parking and enhanced
transportation options. Incentives have been created for the remote parking options and
for encouraging busing and van pooling from home, as the University recognizes that it
cannot provide "at-the-door" parking for everyone.
Mr. Baier reviewed some of the more than 30 initiatives that have been put into
place since 1998, which include free van pools, increased bus services, and additional
leased parking spaces in outlying lots. These initiatives have resulted in 1,300 net new
"Blue" spaces and 1,300 net new remote spaces added in the previous 5 years. He
noted that the University bus system transports 4.5 million passengers per year and
described additional services available to employees who park in remote lots. In
partnership with the Ann Arbor Transportation Authority (AATA), free "Park and
Ride" lots are provided, which have been very successful in reducing the number of
vehicles coming onto campus. AATA provides bus transportation from these lots. In
addition, the University provides free AATA bus passes for employees who do not
purchase parking permits.
Other initiatives include "crunch" lots with free taxi service for "Blue" or "Gold"
permit holders who can't find parking spaces and subsidized van pools that are free to
users. As an additional incentive, free, 24-hour emergency cab service is provided for
those who use buses, van pools, or remote parking. The number of daytime spaces has
increased by providing off-site parking for contractors and free after-hours permits to
retirees.
Mr. Baier then turned to plans being made to increase the number of parking
spaces in the future. He noted that between 1998 and 2002, 1,300 net spaces were
added on the central and medical campuses. Between 2003-2007, there will be a
decrease of 1,030 spaces but an increase of 2,260, assuming future approval of two
proposed major new projects, one on Ann Street that would yield 500 spaces by 2005,
and another on Thompson Street, which would add about 440 spaces by 2007.
Mr. Baier reviewed annual rates for each of the four categories of permits. The
employee contribution for these permits ranges from $1,000 to $57, as opposed to
$1,260 charged by the City of Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority for its
parking spaces. He noted that several options are being considered for funding of the
new Ann Street and Thompson Street parking decks, including increased employee


34




September Meeting, 2003


contributions and a review of the relationship between departmental and employee
contributions.
Mr. Baier noted that planning has also begun for possible parking options
beginning in 2008 and beyond. Items under consideration include building new parking
structures in as yet unidentified locations on North Campus, South Campus, and Wall
Street.
Although there continues to be a shortage of parking spaces, the parking crunch
should improve somewhat in 2004, and if the proposed new Ann Street and Thompson
Street structures are approved, 2,500 new "Blue" spaces will have been created between
1998 and 2007. Incentives will continue to be offered to increase participation in
remote parking options and alternative transportation programs.
Regent Newman asked if the plan presented today included visitor parking, and
Mr. Baier responded that the presentation data included only faculty and staff parking
spaces.
Executive Vice President Slottow introduced Pat Cunningham, director of Parking
and Transportation Services, who is retiring after having done an extraordinary job in
managing the unit's transition to a more system-wide focus on these issues.
Committee Reports
Finance, udit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning with Erik Lundberg to receive information regarding the
University's investment portfolio and with PricewaterhouseCoopers for a review of the
recently completed audit. They also held a discussion about the Sarbanes-Oxley
legislation and what other universities across the country are doing in response.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard commented that the
committee had set its schedule for the year and is currently reviewing information on
various models that could be used for presidential evaluation.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of July 17, 2003.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report and
noted that the annual investment report and performance would be discussed next
month. He also submitted the Plant Extension Report and commented that the Life
Sciences Institute had opened, on time and on budget, on September 15, and he
submitted the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report. Regent McGowan
commented that the Life Sciences Institute is "fantastic" and complimented everyone
involved in its planning and construction, with a special note of thanks to Marina
Roelofs, Director of Plant Extension, for her leadership on this effort.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established, July 1 - August 31, 2003. He then announced that in 2003 the University's


35




September Meeting, 2003


total research expenditures amounted to $749 million, an increase of more than 14%
($94 million) over the previous year, and the highest ever total dollar increase. He
noted that half of the total increase is in the biomedical or life sciences area. He gave
brief descriptions of four of the largest research projects and reported on the activities
of a student research project under the auspices of the Undergraduate Research
Opportunity Program (UROP). Vice President Ulaby also reported that for the first
time, the University of Michigan is among the top ten institutions nation-wide in the
impact of technology transfer in the life sciences.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Kelch said
that he is pleased to be attending the meeting with his new colleagues and looked
forward to the time ahead.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper reported that "Welcome
Week" and move in had been very successful, with 9,500 students having moved into
the residence halls. She described several events done in conjunction with Welcome
Week:   "Artscapade," "Escapade," "Community Plunge," and "Festifall."  She
introduced Susan Wilson, director of the Student Activities Leadership Program, and
Eric Aronson, an alumnus and former MSA president who has been providing in-kind
services and funding for the leadership program.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little reported that the highlight
of the start of the school year had been the newly-established first-year incoming
student convocation. About 350 first-year students, 400 parents, and more than 80
faculty members participated. He also commented that enrollment on the Dearborn
campus increased 3.4% over the previous year to about 9,000 students and that a large
portion of the increase was in graduate programs. He noted that the purchase of the
Fairlane Training and Development Center had been concluded and that renovations are
underway.
University Residence Halls. Regent Newman inquired when the report on
residence halls would be presented. Vice President Harper responded that she was
hoping to be able to present it in November 2003 and that the report would include
options for renovations and additional halls, along with financial models. It was noted
that a consultant had been hired and that the November report would include a
discussion of the consultant's findings. The review has taken a long time because of the

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for 11 retiring
faculty members and called attention to the memoir for Giles Bole, dean emeritus of the
Medical School. Dr. Kelch noted that Dr. Bole had made outstanding contributions
during his tenure as dean and had focused on changing the way in which physicians are
educated, which has had a major impact on medical education.
Anthony R. Aguirre, librarian in the University Library, retired from active
faculty status on August 29, 2003, after ten years of distinguished service.
A native of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Mr. Aguirre received his B.A. degree from
the University of Washington in 1960, his M.S. degree from San Diego State University
in 1966, and his M.L.S. degree from the University of Washington in 1972. From
1966-71 he pursued a career as a scientist at the University of Colorado Medical Center
and the University of California, Los Angeles. His career as a librarian began with his
appointment as assistant director of public services at the University of Colorado
Medical Center (1974-77).   Subsequently, he served as associate director of the
University of Connecticut Health Center Library (1977-81), director of the Library of the
College of Physicians in Philadelphia (1981-89), and project leader of the Integrated
Academic Information Management System at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center
(1989-93). Mr. Aguirre joined the University of Michigan faculty as a librarian in 1993,

renovation of the Taubman Medical Library, completed in 2002. He contributed
significantly to innovations in service, instruction, and outreach for the health sciences
libraries, and made thoughtful, solid contributions in numerous other administrative roles.
Mr. Aguirre served as a consultant, reviewer, and councilor for the National Library of
Medicine and in varied and significant roles within the Medical Library Association since
1976. He was a member of the board of directors of the University of Michigan Historical
Center for the Health Sciences and a member of the CIC board of directors for
HealthWeb.

care students. He was a leader in the college's conversion from a B.S. degree program to the
Pharm.D. professional degree program, which is now the national standard. Professor Boyd
was also involved in minority student recruitment and retention efforts and helped secure
federal funding to support a program that was the foundation of the college's continual,
successful efforts to create a diverse student body.
Though his research focused on a variety of issues, Professor Boyd was particularly
interested in the use of alternative medicines among African Americans. This research and
67




September Meeting, 2003


other projects related to self-care led to the creation of a popular, required course on
nonprescription drug therapeutics for pharmacy students. His latest research efforts focus on
the use of oxyetazoline as a lower-risk alternative to epinephrine when used to control gum
bleeding during oral surgery.
Professor Boyd was an active member of the Michigan Board of Pharmacy for many
years and was influential in resolving pharmacy law issues within Michigan. He used this
experience to teach pharmacy law and to serve as a resource to community pharmacy
practitioners. He was recently honored with a Career Service Award by the Association of

faculty status on August 31, 2003.
Professor McLoyd received her B.A. degree from Talladega College in 1971 and
her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1973 and 1975,
respectively. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in
1978 and was promoted to associate professor in 1984 and professor in 1988. She was
also affiliated with the Center for Human Growth and Development as associate
research scientist (1988-91), research scientist (1991-98), and senior research scientist
(1998-2002).
Professor McLoyd's scholarship helped shape the field of developmental
psychology as her interests evolved from traditional developmental psychology to a
more expansive and creative view of the field. Focusing on how a child develops
socially and how social interactions influence cognitive development, Professor
McLoyd came to recognize the ways in which the environment and social context,
especially race, ethnicity, and poverty, influence development. Her work has helped
change the perspective of the field and has led to a widespread recognition of how
socio-environmental factors influence the health, well-being, and developmental
experiences of children, adolescents, and their families.
Most notable among the many honors Professor McLoyd has received is a
MacArthur Fellowship, which was awarded in 1996. She has also received the Reuben
Hill Award from the National Council on Family Relations, a Faculty Scholar Award in
Child Mental Health from the William T. Grant Foundation, and a minority-group
scholar fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation. Other scholarly activities include
participation in the MacArthur Network on Transition to Adulthood, the Council of the
Foundation of Child Development, and the Advisory Board of the National Center for
Children in Poverty.

September Meeting, 2003


William G. Weissert, Ph.D., professor of health management and policy and chair
of the Department of Health Management and Policy in the School of Public Health and
senior research scientist in the Institute of Gerontology, retired from active faculty status
on July 31, 2003.
Professor Weissert received his B.S. degree from Portland State University (1967), his
M.S. degree from Northwestern University (1968), and his Ph.D. degree from the Claremont
Graduate School (1972). He served in senior staff and administrative roles at the TransCentury
Corporation (1971-76), the National Center for Health Services Research (1976-81), and the
Urban Institute Health Policy Center (1981-83), and was director of the University of North
Carolina's Program on Aging from 1983-89. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as
a professor and research scientist in 1989 and was promoted to senior research scientist and
appointed department chair in 1997.
Early in his career, Professor Weissert and colleagues used a number of data sources
to document current patterns of long-term care utilization. Prevalence estimates of the
long-term care population were used by state and federal agencies as the basis of resource
allocation decisions.  In addition, Professor Weissert evaluated the limitations of
long-term care insurance and the potential for using home equity to pay for it, and his
descriptions of two models of adult day care provided the basic taxonomy for that
newly-developing care venue. His best-known work addressed the cost-effectiveness of
home care services and recommended payment methods to improve efficiency and
effectiveness. He also showed that in nursing homes, incentive payments can extend
patients' lives and shorten length of stay. Professor Weissert is recognized as one of the
top researchers in long-term care and aging. He is an outstanding scholar, an excellent
teacher, a highly-capable administrator, and an important contributor to health services
delivery systems in Michigan.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming William G. Weissert
professor emeritus of health management and policy and senior research scientist
emeritus.

OCTOBER MEETING, 2003
The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, October 16, 2003
The Regents convened at 1:50 p.m. in the Michigan Rooms, Harding Mott
University Center, at the University of Michigan-Flint.  Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Richner, and White.
Also present were Provost Courant, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President
Kelch, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President
Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice
President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Newman, Regent Taylor, and
Vice President Krislov were absent.
President Coleman called the meeting to order and announced that Public
Comments would be the first order of business.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from David Boyle, alumnus, on "erasing hazing."
Comments from President Coleman
President Coleman thanked Chancellor Mestas and the Flint campus community for
hosting the meeting. She called attention to the Flint Public School Improvement
Initiative, whose goal is to improve the academic performance of Flint Public School
children, and to "Project Export", a $1.3 million grant awarded to the School of Health
Professions and Studies by the National Institutes of Health to decrease health disparities
in the greater Flint community.
President Coleman also noted that the Intramural Sports Building ("IM Building")
on the Ann Arbor campus is celebrating its 75th anniversary. This was the first
university-owned intramural athletics building in the country and was constructed under
the direction of Elmer Dayton Mitchell, the first director of the University's intramural
athletic program, which was the nation's first intramural athletic program. She also
announced that the 100-year-old Samuel T. Dana Building, which houses the School of
Natural Resources and Environment, was being rededicated on October 17.
Ann Arbor Central Campus Ilannin    sses, President Coleman noted that the
meeting agenda included a request for appointment of an architect for expansion and
renovation of the Museum of Art. She noted that this project is a precursor to the next
step in master planning for the Ann Arbor campus, which will provide for continued
work on core central campus academic programs and addressing of faculty needs. She
then made the following comments about her academic vision for central campus and
the future of the academic programs and facilities that now occupy central campus
space.
I think -we have a tremendous opportunity to encourage acadenmic links among
units on the Central, Vfedical, and North Campuses. I want our planning efforts to


85




October Meeting, 2003


build on existing programmatic connections and create exciting new links. At the same
time, we need to address facility issues that are vital to a number of academic
programs and to prepare us for growth opportunities. Fortunately, we have excellent
faculty and sound ormganization structures already in place and ready to provide the
necessary leadership.
Somee of the fcility needs, like the condition of the Frieze Building, are well
known and simply must be attended to. But I do not see merit in addressing these
issues one-by-one without considering how they can work together as an integrated
whole. We have very good ideas in development that have to be woven together with
our academic priorities clearly in mind.
I have asked our leadership team   to outline the components of a
comprehensive planning effort to address the next set of central campus issues and
opportunities including the following:
"* We have talked about my expectations that we continue to enhance life sciences
programming and linkages. I want our approach to life sciences to be quite broad
with many departments and disciplines involved. Our two biology departments
will be key to the foundation and successful integration of life sciences more
broadly across the campus. LS&A Dean Terry McDonald will play an important
role in this development.
"* We have several strong programs in the neurosciences, and we will need to build
on these strengths in ways that also reinforce Michigan's broader role in the life
sciences. I have asked Terry McDonald, Allen Lichter, Paul Courant, and Bob
Kelch to identify the University's capabilities and a plan for future growth,
includingfaculty and facilities.
"* As we look at the Frieze Building, we know it will require either replacement or
renovation in the relatively near future. It houses quite a bit of classroom space,
along with humanities programs and the Department of Theater and Drama.
We're hopeful that this department will be able to move into North Campus as part
of the Walgreen Drama Center planning--and of course, there will be the practical
consideration of swing space when Frieze is off-line.
"* Finding the right links between North Campus and Central Campus are also
important considerations. As one example, the School of Information space is
currently split between Central and North Campus. We need to consider how best
to accommodate future growth for programs such as the School of Information
and others now occupying Central Campus space.
The University 's academic priorities and needs will drive the next steps in our
Central Campus planning effort.  The plan needs to accommodate growth and
emerging strengths, and it must design improved space for the next generation of our
academic programs, which    we know   will be very   cross-disciplinary  and
technology-dependent.
I am engaged in a discussion with Paul, Tim, Bob, and Terry McDonald to
continue developing this in much greater detail. And we will work with our colleagues
on campus with a goal of bringing a more detailed outline to you sometime later this
year. We expect this to be a complex planning effort that will likely take up to two
years to fully complete, but we should be able to plan on holding substantive
discussions about priorities and needs very soon.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee.          Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and received the following reports:


86




October Meeting, 2003


Annual Report of Investments. Regent Brandon noted that the agenda had
included a meeting with Erik Lundberg, chief investment officer, who is responsible for
oversight of the University's $5.4 billion in financial assets. Mr. Lundberg presented
the annual investment report as of June 30, 2003. He noted that two-thirds of the
financial assets are in the Long Term Portfolio, and the remaining portion is in
shorter-term, cash management accounts. Mr. Lundberg reported that the Long Term
Portfolio investment return for the one-year period ending June 30, 2003 was a positive
5.4%, which is noteworthy considering the difficulties of the financial markets over the
past several years. Over a five-year time period, the Long Term Portfolio outperformed
every benchmark in every asset class and had a total return of 9.2%, which also
outperformed its benchmarks. Measuring the five-year returns versus those of the
endowment universe, the University is in the top portion of the top quartile. Regent
Brandon praised the outstanding short-term, near-term, and long-term results achieved
by Mr. Lundberg and his team. He noted that the annual investment report is on file in
the Office of the Vice President and Secretary of the University.
External Audit Report. Regent Brandon reported that the committee had met
with Darryl Burks and Bill Stulginski of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) for a final
review of the audit results for the year ending June 30, 2003. They had also met with
University officials who work with the auditing firm, including Tim Slottow, executive
vice president and chief financial officer; Cheryl Soper, controller; and Russ Fleming,
manager of financial reporting. Regent Brandon announced that the results of the audit
of the University of Michigan financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2003
were found to be in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Furthermore, the scope was consistent with previous discussions with the committee,
which was to obtain reasonable but not absolute assurance about whether the financial
statements were free from material misstatements. PricewaterhouseCoopers reported
that it had received complete access to all necessary records, documents, and
information, and that it had received full cooperation from University employees. In
addition, no material weaknesses were found in any internal controls. There were no
management comments resulting from the audit that would require communication to
the Regents, and PWC planned to issue an unqualified opinion of the 2003 financial
statements. The entire audit report is on file in the Office of the Vice President and
Secretary of the University.
Regent Brandon noted that the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee had met
privately with the PWC auditors to learn whether they had any concerns or whether there
were irregularities in the way the audit was conducted or in the interaction with management.
The auditors reported that there were no irregularities and they had no concerns.
Information Technology Security. Regent Brandon reported that the committee
had met with staff members with responsibility for information technology security:
Laura Patterson, associate vice president for administration information systems, and
Paul Howell, senior systems research programmer, who is a computer security expert.
Items discussed included all of the challenges involved with information technology
security in higher education and an update on the status of the University's disaster
recovery plans. Regent Brandon stated that as a result of the meeting, the Regents have
a great deal of confidence in the attention being paid to these areas, although it is an
area that will continue to require a good deal of attention.


87




October Meeting, 2003


Internal Audit Report. The committee met with Robert Moenart, executive
director of University audits, and received an update on all internal audits that occurred
in the period July 3, 2003 through September 30, 2003. They also met with him alone
to determine whether there are any irregularities or problems in support received from
management, and none were reported.
Compensation and Personnel Com ittee Regent Maynard commented that the
committee had met and is reviewing reference materials on the evaluation process. It
also established a meeting schedule and agenda topics through June 2004.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes, Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of September 18, 2003.
Reports, Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Plant Extension Report,
the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report, and the Regents' Report on
Non-Competitive Purchases over $5,000 from Single Sources, July 16, 2003 through
September 15, 2003.
Litigation Report. The Regents received the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established, September 1 - September 3, 2003.
University of Michigan Health System.   Executive Vice President Kelch
commented that on October 6 and 7, 90 quality improvement teams had presented their
work at University Hospitals, with very impressive accomplishments and ideas. He
also noted that construction of the steel infrastructure of the Biomedical Sciences
Research Building was almost complete and that site preparation work had begun on the
Cardiovascular Center. He called attention to the recommended appointment of Dr.
James Carpenter as chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr. Kelch also
reported that the first quarter financial report for the Hospitals and Health Centers are
very positive, at $4 million above budget.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper had no additional report.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little reported on the self-study
process that had culminated in a visit to campus from the accreditation team. The
informal feedback from the team was extremely positive, especially with regard to
support for the campus by external constituent groups; excellent facilities; and
establishing and maintaining relationships with regional constituents.  He also
commented on the impact of the campus's engineering programs on the automotive and
manufacturing sectors in southeast Michigan. He called attention to the recommended
appointment of Tom Baird as vice chancellor for institutional advancement.
University  of Michigan-Flint.  Chancellor Mestas introduced Dr. Kristen
Skivington, director of university outreach, who moderated a panel of students and
faculty highlighting academic service learning activities and experiences on the Flint
campus and how they had changed the lives of those participating in these activities.

Alphonse R. Burdi, Ph.D., professor of cell and developmental biology and
director of the Inteflex Program in the Medical School and research scientist in the
Center for Human Growth and Development, retired from active faculty status on
August 31, 2003.
Professor Burdi received a B.S.Ed. degree from Northern Illinois University in
1957, an M.S. degree (physiology) from the University of Illinois-Urbana in 1959, and
102




"etober Meeting, 2003


M.S. and Ph.D. degrees (both in anatomy) from the University of Michigan in 1961 and
1963, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an instructor in
1962 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1965, associate professor in 1969, and
professor in 1974. He was appointed research scientist in 1973. He directed the Inteflex
program (integrated premedical-medical degrees program) from 1982-2003 and was
director of student biomedical research from 1993-97.
Professor Burdi's seminal research on population patterns of human prenatal
development substantially advanced the critical understanding of the causes,
recognition, and treatment of birth defects. He authored more than 235 scientific papers,
books, and chapters and played key roles in various committees across the campus.
Professor Burdi taught many innovative courses at all levels and guided more than 45
research projects for UROP ("Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program") and
graduate students. Professor Burdi's academic and life skills mentoring brought him
much joy and recognition, including honorary membership in Michigan's Womens'
Athletic Association and an award of a varsity "M" letter by the Athletic Department's
M Club in 2001. Other honors include the AMOCO Outstanding Teaching Award
(1981), an honorary doctor of science degree from the University of Athens, Greece
(2000), and the Distinguished Faculty Governance Award (2002).
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty leader for his dedicated service
by naming Alphonse R. Burdi professor emeritus of cell and developmental biology and
research scientist emeritus.
Adye Bel Evans, associate librarian in the University Library, retired from active
faculty status on June 30, 2003, after thirty-one years of distinguished service.
Born and raised in Texas, Adye Bel Evans received her B.A. degree in social
sciences and philosophy from Spelman College in 1963 and her M.A.L.S. degree from
Rosary College, in Illinois, in 1967. Ms. Evans was a technical information specialist at
the National Safety Council from 1967-69, a reference and departmental librarian at the
University of Manitoba from 1969-70, and a cataloger and indexer at the Mitre
Corporation from 1970-71. Ms. Evans joined the University of Michigan faculty in
1972 as a librarian in the Institute for Social Research. In 1973, the title of this position
was reclassified as assistant librarian. She was promoted to associate librarian in 1974.
In 1998, after more than twenty years of service in the Institute for Social
Research, Ms. Evans accepted a position as readers' services librarian and curator of the
graphics collection in the Special Collections Library. In this capacity she was a
welcoming presence to the scholars from the University and beyond who come to use
the archives, manuscripts, rare books, and other resources of the University Library.
Ms. Evans has served with distinction as a member of several campus groups,
including a term as president of the Association of Black Professionals, Administrators,
Faculty, and Staff. She was also the representative from the Michigan League Board of
Governors to SACUA and a member of the University Women's Commission. Her
contributions extended to the Ann Arbor community, where she has served on the
advisory boards of the Ann Arbor Public Schools Department of Continuing Education
and the Ann Arbor Public Library.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Adye Bel
Evans associate librarian emerita.

October Meeting, 2003


University of Michigan-Dearborn Engineering Laboratory Building Expansion
and Renovation Phase Two of the Science and Engineering Expansion and
Renovation Project
Executive Vice President Slottow introduced Terry Sargent of the firm Lord, Aeck
& Sargent to present the schematic design for phase two of the Science and Engineering
Expansion and Renovation Project. Mr. Sargent displayed a map and photographs of the
existing campus buildings that the new structure will tie into and a site plan for the new
building. He described the interior floor plan and showed schematics and illustrations of
the building's interior and exterior. Chancellor Little commented that the design has been
very carefully considered and has been well received by the engineering faculty. It was
noted that state funding will cover 750o of the cost of this project.
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Richner, the Regents
unanimously approved the schematic design for the University of Michigan-Dearborn
Engineering Building Expansion and Renovation, Phase Two of the Science and
Engineering Expansion and Renovation Project, as presented at the meeting.
Alumni Memorial Hall Museum of Art Addition and Renovation
President Coleman commented about how important the Art Museum is to the
University's academic mission, the campus community, and the region. She pointed out
that the expansion and renovation of the Art Museum is one of the priorities of the
upcoming capital campaign and will be funded primarily through private gifts. President
Coleman noted that the museum's collections and programs have grown far beyond its
capacity; current space is not nearly adequate for properly exhibiting, archiving, and
caring for the bulk of the collections. She pointed out that the new and renovated space
will also benefit the central campus by providing additional classroom space for
undergraduate education.
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that extensive due diligence has been
conducted in the recommendation for the appointment of Allied Works Architecture for
design of the project. He noted that James Steward, director of the Art Museum, would
soon be announcing several leadership gifts for this project.
Regent Brandon moved approval of the Alumni Memorial Hall Museum of Art
Addition and Renovation Project as described and authorized commissioning Allied
Works Architecture for its design. Regent Deitch seconded the motion and it was
approved unanimously.

of which requires 6 votes for approval. She said that these would be considered together
as a block, in one vote, unless any Regent requests individual consideration of, or recusal
from voting on, a particular item. Regent Richner asked for clarification of the lease
agreement with Altarum. Executive Vice President Slottow responded that the conflict of
interest occurs in this agreement because Vice President Ulaby is on the board of directors
of Altarum. In addition, a unit of the University is leasing space from a facility that is
part-owned by Altarum, and the Office of the Vice President for Research is paying a
portion of that lease. It was noted that Altarum is a non-profit company in Ann Arbor
formerly known as ERIM, which many years ago had been part of the University.
There being no requests for individual consideration or recusal, on a motion by
Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent White, the Regents unanimously approved each of
the following items.

back to the Regents.
MSA President Angela Galardi reported on the accomplishments of Michigan
Student Assembly since the start of the Fall semester.
Regents' Bylaws 5.01, 5.24, and 11.13
Provost Courant commented that this proposal would change the title of the senior
research scientist track to the research professor track and would add a new title of
research assistant professor. It would also make these titles available on the Flint and
Dearborn campuses. He noted these researchers are on a par with tenure-track faculty
members except for the teaching responsibilities, and the new titles would make clearer
the independent scholarly work they pursue and the University's expectations of them as
scholars. The establishment of the research professor track would enhance recruiting
efforts and would clarify the status of these individuals in the eyes of funding agencies.


111




October Meetinrg, 2003


Vice President Ulaby noted that this proposal has the support of the faculty, deans,
and other constituent groups. It would initially affect about 65 people, or about 10% of
the individuals currently in either the research scientist or senior research scientist track,
who are not part of the tenure-track faculty but whose scholarship and accomplishments
are on a par with those faculty. The addition of the "research assistant professor" title
completes the proposal, making the entire track parallel to that of the tenure track
faculty.
President Coleman expressed her strong endorsement of this proposal.

Comments from President Coleman
President Coleman commented on notable achievements of faculty and others at the
University during the past month.
Naming of the Media Union
President Coleman invited President Emeritus James J. Duderstadt and his wife,
Anne Duderstadt, to the table and noted that the Regents would be acting on a request to
name the Media Union in their honor. She commented that during his tenure as president,
James Duderstadt had been a visionary leader who had embraced change and had
"welcomed the opportunity to chart new directions and embrace the challenge of new
demands." She noted that he had initiated innovative programs for diversity and equality
in higher education--the Michigan Mandate and the Agenda for Women--and that under
his leadership, the University's endowment had increased five-fold, and it had become the
first public university to earn an Aal credit rating from Moody's Investors Services. The
University had also become the nation's leading research university and had embarked on
a $1.5 billion program for rebuilding, renovating, and updating the campus.
115




November Meeting, 2003


President Coleman also commented on the invaluable and dedicated service of
Anne Duderstadt, who "worked tirelessly to promote an awareness of the University's
history and to preserve its historic and artistic treasures." President Coleman noted that
President Duderstadt continues to serve the University as a "teacher, leader, and
visionary" and expressed her thanks for his "effective articulation of the issues
challenging higher education today and those that loom large in our future."
President Coleman noted that the Media Union, constructed seven years ago, with
its comprehensive library, art gallery, common spaces, studios, and laboratories,
epitomizes the "vigorous, cutting edge spirit" of Jim and Anne Duderstadt. A
campus-wide celebration and formal dedication is planned for early Spring 2004.
President Coleman turned to Regent White, who commented that she had known
Jim and Anne Duderstadt for most of her life, and they have demonstrated an
unwavering commitment to the University of Michigan over a period of more than 30
years. Regent White noted that the Media Union is a unique teaching, learning, and
research facility that emerged from the vision of James J. Duderstadt, who has served
the University as dean, provost, president, and in his current role as University
professor of science and engineering. She noted that President Duderstadt's true legacy
goes beyond bricks and mortar and is reflected in the diversity and interdisciplinary
focus inherent in the University today, in its "institutional commitment to a diverse
community of scholars, its dedication to tearing down the intellectual walls that divide
academic disciplines, and its concentrated efforts to harness the awesome capacity of
technology in service of knowledge-seeking," and in the solid financial footing he built
as president.
Regent White commented that as the University of Michigan develops its 21st
century vision of a diverse and vigorous academic community, "many rightly look to
Jim's Michigan Mandate and the Michigan Agenda for Women for guidance," with
their model that introduced the systematic measurement of the standing of these groups,
broad community participation in the debate, and clear and measurable standards.
Regent White noted that Anne Duderstadt's legacy is "rooted into the legacy of the
University of Michigan as a whole," and in her "tireless service" she sought to restore a
sense of the University's history and traditions. Among her accomplishments were
establishing the History and Traditions Committee, providing pivotal leadership for
renovations at the President's House and Inglis House, championing the restoration of
and spearheading the fundraising effort for the Detroit Observatory, and providing key
service in the "Campaign for Michigan," which raised $1 billion.
Regent White noted that Anne Duderstadt's current efforts include a series of
pictorial histories of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the first of which will
coincide with the upcoming 150th anniversary of engineering education at Michigan,
and the second of which, concentrating on the central campus, will be published in the
fall of 2004. She is also working on a comprehensive, web-based history of the
University. Regent White pointed out that President Emeritus Duderstadt continues as a
national leader on the future of higher education as head of the Millenium Project, a
research center concerned with the impact of societal, economic, and technological
changes on the research, teaching, and service activities of universities. He has


116




November Meeting, 2003


published a number of award-winning articles and books on the future of research
universities, public higher education, and intercollegiate athletics in America.
Regent White commented that as one of the largest multi-media centers in the
nation, open 7 days a week and 24 hours a day, the Media Union is the focal point of
the activities of thousands of students. "The naming of this building is uniquely fitting
as a tribute to the Duderstadts, who have worked around the clock, 24/7, on our behalf,"
she noted. "They are the ultimate leaders of the past, the present, and the future of the
University of Michigan." She thanked them for their service.
A round of applause followed, and President Emeritus Duderstadt responded:
Anne and Ifeel very honored by this action, and we want to thank the Regents and
President Coleman jbr your recognition.
This November 'will ma;rk our 35th year at the bUniversit of M&ichigan, and over these
many years it has been our great privilege to serve this remarkable institution in manyc ways ---on
itsifaculty, as a members of the University community, and through leadership assignments as
dean, provost, and president.
I remember a fjrmer dean once remarking that there were very/few social institutions
worthv of the commitment of an entire career, and Michigan was clearly one of these. (Actually
I don't remember just who said this-probably someone like Harold Shapiro, Billy Frye, or
Chuck Vest, long since departedbfr another university.)
Of course as you all are well aware, this is not the easiest place to setrve,
Or to lead,
Or to govern 1!!!
But as Regents and as executive (officers, each of you view your role as a higher
calling, deserving of the personal commitment and sacrifice you each dedicate so unselfishly to
the University, just as did Anne and I during our years in the presidency.
During the past several months I participated in two meetings that vividly illustrate the
importance (f these commitments to Michigan:
The first was in Montreux, Switzerland this past.June where I co-chaired a joint
meeting of universityv presidentsf tom the Uniited States and Europe, sharing visions of thefuture
of the university,. Then this October at UC-Santa Cruz, Iparticipated in a meeting with the
leadership of the University of Califobrnia to explore the future of that institution.
In both events I was struck by how many people approached me to learn more about
what they referred to as "the Michigan model. "Now, of course, this "model" meant quite
diferent things to different people.
To some it was your courageous defense of diversity in higher education. In a sense,
Mdichigan carried the water for the rest of higher education all the -way to the Supreme Court,
something that others not only depended upon Michigan to do, but actually  pecte us to do as
a part of our long tradition to provide "'an uncommon education for the common man ".
To others the Michigan model means our capacity not only to sustain but enhance our
quality even as our tax support declines. Clark Kerr used to call Michigan "the mother of public
universities" because of this iunusual ability to achieve high quality as a public institution. Many
other public universities with far more generous state support such as the Universities?of
California, North Carolina, and Virginia now look to our model to learn how to sustain quality
during tough budget times.
To some the Michigan model arisesfrom the 'free and open spirit " of our students and
faculty, a phrase used to describe Michigan by a Harpers magazine article in the 1920s.
Still others see the Michigan model as innovation and risk taking, for example, when
Michigan developed the quantitative social sciences in the 1950s through its Institute for Social
Research or its role in building the Internet in the 1980s.


117




November Meeting, 2003


For Michigan, quality by itself was never quite enough. Instead we have always sought
leadership, perhaps best captured by the phrase "the leaders and best" in our fight song, the
Victors.
Anne and I are privileged to be a part of this tradition, and we are deeply grateful to
the Regents for this action that links us even more tightly to this remarkable institution.
Another round of applause followed. Mrs. Duderstadt thanked the Regents for
this honor.
Regent White moved that the Media Union be named the James and Anne
Duderstadt Center. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and had received information on several issues. They
were briefed by Bill Martin, athletic director, and Judy Van Horn, associate athletic
director for compliance services, about the University's efforts in complying with NCAA
rules and regulations. They also met with Mr. Martin and colleagues for an information
update on progress toward overcoming projected operating budget shortfalls. The third
item was a discussion with Provost Courant and Vice President Wilbanks regarding the
current state budget crisis and its impact on current and future operating budgets. The
committee also reviewed a draft of a committee meeting schedule for 2004 and reviewed
a report about the financial performance of the University of Michigan Hospitals and
Health System, which reported an impressive positive variance through the end of
September.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard commented that the
committee met with the president and discussed her vision for the University. This
discussion leads to the development of goals and objectives by which future evaluations
can be made in 2004.
Annual Report of Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA)
Professor Charles Koopmann, Jr., delivered the annual report of SACUA. He
highlighted some of the issues that SACUA either has already addressed or plans to
address in the current year, including a revision of the "Teaching Document," which
highlights the importance of teaching at the University of Michigan, development of a
"Tenure Guidelines" document, establishment of a task force on child care for students,
faculty, and staff, and approval for creation of a central faculty ombuds position.
Professor Koopmann also pointed to some challenges facing University leadership
that SACUA has identified. These include the growth in non-tenure track faculty;
benefits for active and retired faculty and staff; the practice of paying exorbitant
amounts to hire "star" faculty; the fear of speaking openly and freely on controversial
topics; the need for improvements in some athletics facilities for some varsity sports
and for recreational sports for faculty and staff; the necessity for replacing the existing
women's and children's hospitals; the need to increase the influence of college
presidents and faculty on intercollegiate athletics; and the need for more faculty
involvement in refinement of admissions criteria.


118




November Meeting, 2003


He thanked the Regents for giving SACUA an opportunity to address the board
and noted that it has been an honor and pleasure to work with the president, members of
the administration, faculty, and others.
Annual Operating Request to the State
Ann Arbor Campus. Provost Courant commented that the Ann Arbor campus is
requesting only a continuation of the current level of appropriations, or $327 million, an
amount that is 10% less than the state appropriation for fiscal year 2002. He noted that
further cuts will pose significant threats to the University and described some of the risks.
Provost Courant noted that the cuts in base funding already absorbed amount to
almost $1,000 per student, and if the preliminary recommendation for an additional 6%
cut comes to pass, the reduction in revenues would equal almost $1,500 per student. He
noted that the University has cut costs deeply over the past two years and has
eliminated over 300 jobs and open positions. Schools and colleges have had to
eliminate course sections and increase class sizes, and no executive officer accepted a
salary increase this year. Although the proposed cost-sharing model for health care
premiums will trim $6 million in the General Fund and $20 million overall from the
University's health care contribution for 2005 and more in coming years, health benefits
costs continue to increase.
Provost Courant described the effect that some of the cuts in academic programs
already have had, with some courses previously designed as senior seminars for 25
students turned into a lecture course for 250 students, and half of the seats in small,
advanced seminars with senior faculty being eliminated. Further reductions will cut
into core academic activities and could include scaling back of freshman seminars and
curtailing living-learning programs and community outreach programs.
Provost Courant pointed out that the rate of return on investments in education is
among the highest reliable returns on investment available in the economy. He noted
that expenditure of $1.00 at the University increases state income by a total of about
$2.50 and that the University brings hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the state.
Provost Courant said that there are only two ways to increase revenue--private
giving and increases in tuition. The upcoming capital campaign, although critical to the
University's future stability and leadership, will never replace fundamental state
support. He expressed the hope that in the face of continued budget cuts, the University
will not be forced to choose further reductions that will compromise the extraordinary
quality and nature of the institution. Because tuition revenue does not cover the full
costs of students' education, other sources of income, including state appropriation and
philanthropy, must be relied upon. He noted that any increase in tuition will be
matched with corresponding increases in financial aid.
Detailed options and plans will be presented in the coming months, as the
University's costs and the state's economic and fiscal situation become clearer. The
current funding situation, he said, represents a substantial threat to academic excellence
and student access, and the University will work with the state's leaders to plan for
long-term stability that will preserve the University's ability to serve the state's
residents in the future.


119




November Mleeting, 2003


Dearborn Campus. Chancellor Little commented that the Dearborn campus is
well aware that they will most likely be facing a decrease in state support for the
coming year. The campus's strategic priorities include expanding and strengthening
undergraduate education, expanding and extending graduate and professional education
to meet the needs of working professionals in southeast Michigan, continuing to
incorporate technology into the curriculum, and enhancing and deepening the campus's
traditional commitment to community engagement. He described some of the specific
initiatives being planned in each of these areas.
Chancellor Little noted that last year's state appropriation has already been
reduced by $2.6 million, and the proposed additional 6% cut would equal $1.0 million.
Until now, the cuts have been absorbed by reducing costs and increasing revenues
through increased enrollment and higher tuition. He noted that higher education can
play a critical role for the state in enhancing the economic recovery and that it deserves
the support of the state even in difficult times. To that end, the University of
Michigan-Dearborn has requested $1 million in new base funding, while recognizing
that this request is unlikely to be accommodated. The request is meant to highlight the
fact that the University has continuing needs and is working very hard to make a
contribution to the communities it serves.
Flint Campus. Chancellor Mestas observed that attempting to construct a budget
request that addresses the needs and aspirations of the campus in the face of the current
state budget reality was a most difficult undertaking. He noted that the request is based
on trying to restore some of the components of the academic experience that were
eliminated during the last round of budget cuts. The top academic priority is to
maintain the full academic experience for the students, and the second priority is to
continue to recognize the important responsibility that the University has to maintain its
relationship with the community. The budget request, as detailed in the action request,
maintains those priorities and realities.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of October 16, 2003.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report,
Plant Extension Report, and Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established, October 1 - October 31, 2003. He noted that the University received 201
new awards this year, including a $13.6 million, 5-year project on translational research
in acute lung injuries.
University of Michigan Health System.    Executive Vice President Kelch
commented that the Health System is preparing for anticipated reductions in
government-supported payments for medical care. He also noted that all three
components of the Health System (M-Care, the Medical School, and Hospital) are
undergoing a reaccreditation process simultaneously.


120




November Meeting, 2003


Division of Student Affairs. Noting that the annual Michigan vs. Ohio State
University football game would be taking place that weekend, Vice President Harper
announced that a significant effort has been made to encourage all fans to behave in a
manner that is respectful to the University of Michigan and the Ann Arbor community.
Student groups and Greek groups have participated fully in this endeavor, and the
University's Department of Public Safety and government relations officials have been
working with the Ann Arbor Police Department and others to ensure safety.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little noted that the campus had
held a very successful opening of the newly-renovated University Center. The building
is being heavily used and is a tremendous success and a huge enhancement to the
quality of student life on campus.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas commented that much of the
attention on campus has been focused on adjusting to the painful consequences of the
last round of budget cuts, while preparing for anticipated future budget cuts. Many
students are sending letters to state legislators regarding the effect of these cuts and
their fear that the cumulative effect of these cuts will diminish the quality of their
education.
Chancellor Mestas reported that the campus has focused on trying to improve and
control things that are within its reach. To that end, an Enrollment Management Task
Force has been created, charged with making recommendations to improve the
recruitment and retention of students.  He introduced a UM-Flint student, Patrice
Campbell, an international student from Jamaica who has been featured as one of ABC
Television's "Top Five Under 35." She was selected for the exceptional leadership
qualities she has displayed as a student leader on the Flint campus through her work in
recruiting students from around the world to attend the University of Michigan-Flint.
He noted how proud the University is of her accomplishments.
Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman noted that the agenda includes 12 conflict of interest items
(numbers 9-20), each of which requires 6 votes for approval. However, item #12, "Option
Agreement between the University of Michigan and Innovative Biotherapies, Inc.," is
being removed from consideration until the December meeting. She said that the
remaining 11 items would be considered together as a block, in one vote, unless any
Regent requests individual consideration of, or recusal from voting on, a particular item.
There being no requests for individual consideration or recusal, on a motion by
Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent White, with Regent Newman participating by
telephone, the Regents unanimously approved each of the following items:
Approval of Payment for Ann Arbor IT Zone

November Meeting, 2003


Early in his career, Dr. Agranoff demonstrated a requirement for protein synthesis
in the goldfish brain for the formation of long-term memory, a major advance in
neuroscience.  His research extended to optic nerve regeneration and led to
identification of molecular markers of neuroplasticity. Basic Neurochemistry, a book
he co-edited, is considered to be the authoritative treatise on neurochemistry. His
former students and fellows are now tenured investigators throughout the world,
including six at the professorial rank at the University of Michigan.
Dr. Agranoff has received the University's most prestigious honors, including the
Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award (1984), the Distinguished Faculty
Lectureship in Biomedical Research (1986), and the Henry Russel Lectureship (1988).
He is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, has
served as Fogarty Scholar-in-Residence at the National Institutes of Health, and is a
fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Bernard W. Agranoff
professor emeritus of biological chemistry and senior research scientist emeritus.
Allan C. Brown, M.B., Ch.B., associate professor of anesthesiology and associate
professor of anesthesiology in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, retired from
active faculty status on September 9, 2003.
A native of Suffolk, England, Professor Brown received his M.B. and Ch.B.
degrees from the University of Birmingham, England, in 1967. He completed a
fellowship at the University of Colorado in 1974 and was appointed assistant professor
there from 1974-76. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
professor in 1976, was promoted to associate professor in 1982, and received a joint
appointment as associate professor of anesthesiology  in the Department of
Otohinolaryngology in 1991.
A substantial contributor in clinical care, teaching, research, and administration,
Professor Brown was director of the operating rooms at the Medical Center from
1976-86, and he developed courses on applying fiberoptic techniques to the
management of the difficult airway. He was one of the first physicians to recognize the
importance of the diagnosis of a difficult airway and to develop appropriate
management techniques for patients with this condition. In 1987, Professor Brown
co-founded the Difficult Airway Clinic, which received a commendation for health care
innovations from the American College of Physicians in 1992.
Professor Brown's publications include a textbook, Atlas of the Difficult Airway,
14 book chapters, and over 40 other publications. He has held several editorial posts
and has served in numerous leadership roles in local, state, and national professional
organizations. He is a founding member of the Society of Management of the Airway
and the American Association for Medical Systems and Informatics.
The Regents now salute this distinguished medical educator for his dedicated
service by naming Allan C. Brown associate professor emeritus of anesthesiology and
associate  professor  emeritus  of  anesthesiology  in  the  Department   of
Otorhinolaryngology.

California-Berkeley in 1965 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of
136




November Meeting, 2003


Colorado in 1968 and 1969, respectively. While at the University of Colorado, he was a
National Institutes of Health research fellow and a National Institute of Mental Health
research trainee in social psychology. Professor Frank joined the University of
Michigan-Flint faculty in 1969 as an assistant professor and was promoted to associate
professor in 1973 and professor in 1987. He received a joint appointment as associate
professor of earth and resource science (formerly resource and community science) in
1983.
His teaching spanned the areas of social psychology, psychology, and ecology,
theories of personality, and statistics, but the focus of Professor Frank's research was on
animal behavior, specifically that of dogs and wolves. One of the byproducts of
Professor Frank's research was the organization of the First International Captive Wolf
Research Conference. As chair of this conference, he worked to bring wolf experts
together to share their research and ideas. Other contributions included numerous
articles, a book on wolf behavior, and two statistics texts.
Professor Frank served as chair of the psychology department and chair of the
faculty council, and he was the author of a handbook on student outcomes assessment. In
1988, he received the University of Michigan-Flint Faculty Award for Scholarly and
Creative Achievement.
The Regents now salute this distinguished psychology educator for his dedicated

DECEMBER MEETING, 2003
The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, December 18, 2003
The Regents convened at 2:15 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Vice President Harper,
Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President
Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice
President Wilbanks.
President Coleman called the meeting to order and announced that Public
Comments would be the first order of business.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following people, on the topics indicated:
Jim Mogensen, citizen, on the town-gown relationship; Daniel Rose, student and member
of the All-Campus Labor Council, on health benefits; David Boyle, alumnus, on the
Solomon Amendment; Cheryl McCreary, citizen and Council 25 Representative of
AFSCME Local 1583, on health benefits; Patrick Anderson, alumnus, on urban high
school academies; and Laura Rubin, president of the Huron River Watershed Council, on
the Miller's Creek Plan.
A five-minute break followed, and the meeting reconvened at 2:50 p.m.
Comments from President Coleman
President Coleman commented on the state's continuing budget crisis and the second
round of cuts to public higher education being made in the current fiscal year. She noted
that the continued cuts threaten academic quality, as well as the long-standing covenant
that exists among all of the state's public universities and state residents and that the
University needs to continue to speak out about the value that public higher education
contributes to the state.
President Coleman observed that the recent cuts in state funding to higher
education, comprising  15 percent ($250 million) in one calendar year, are
unprecedented. For all three University of Michigan campuses, this amounts to $60
million in reduced funding this current year, or $1,400 less per student on the Ann
Arbor campus. She commented that the effect of the funding drop is "an unarticulated
legislative policy that students and families will bear more of the burden of their
education."
President Coleman observed that in 1970, state appropriations made up 70 percent
of the University's general fund whereas they currently comprise less than 27 percent of
the general fund, and the balance must be paid by tuition. She said that higher
education does not have the ability to cut costs as businesses do, as it is an intrinsically


141




December Meeting, 2003


labor intensive endeavor. The demand for higher education continues to grow, with
commensurate demands for more services, technology, and modern facilities
infrastructure.
President Coleman commented that public higher education returns as much as
$26 to the state for every dollar invested in it and that each citizen benefits from the
high-quality, educated workforce and the economic benefits derived from research
discoveries. She pointed out that the state increasingly depends on the research and
progress created by higher education as it works to move from a manufacturing to a
knowledge-based economy.
President Coleman noted that the University will continue to cut costs as much as
possible and will monitor and reduce cost increases where possible. However, even
though millions of dollars have been saved with cost-cutting measures, the magnitude
of the current reductions from the state are so great that universities must now be on
guard against an erosion of quality that will not be possible to recover once it is lost.
Regent Deitch commented on how lucky the University is to have the leadership
of President Coleman and pointed out that early on in the budget crisis she had decided
to forego a salary increase for 2003-04, and the executive officers had followed suit.
Noting the importance of private philanthropy in alleviating the budget situation, he
thanked President Coleman and her husband for their "extraordinary" pledge to the
capital campaign. Regent Deitch commented that "we're all in this together" and that
the University " is very precious and we cannot allow it to be hurt in any way." He
stated that the goal is to maintain the University of Michigan's unique quality, built up
over a period of 150 years.
Regent Deitch observed that "the nation's great public universities, of which the
University of Michigan is the leader, are in my opinion the key differentiator between
our society and almost every other society in terms of creating opportunities for
people." He noted that "we cannot allow a momentary problem to create an erosion in
quality that was built up over 150 years." He challenged everyone associated with the
University to "unite and create a better understanding for the people of Michigan of
what's at stake," by talking about it "insistently,...loudly,... to every member of the
legislature,... to alumni, and... to the governor, and let people know that if we allow a
deterioration of this precious legacy, this unique quality that exists at this university, we
will have failed the challenge that's in front of us." He stated to President Coleman,
that "we're with you, and we do not intend to see that happen."
Regent Newman commented that "the University community is obviously going to
see cuts and obviously going to see changes. But what you will not see is a
compromise on quality because we're not going to allow that. We will continue to
pursue excellence, and we will not compromise the quality of this institution."
Regent Taylor observed that advocacy efforts should focus on the impression that
the value of higher education generally has been missed in Lansing, not only with
respect to the University of Michigan but for all schools and colleges. It is important to
convey that all of the public higher education institutions are an important asset to the
state as it seeks to retain manufacturing jobs and its economic base.


142




IDecember Meeting, 2003


Regent Maynard commented that "I know all of us are with you in terms of all of
the things that have been said, in terms of the essential nature of public education for
the state and nation" and the fact that "quality is essential to what we are as a public
institution."
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and had received information updates on several issues.
These included the six-month report on University Audits (included also in the meeting
agenda), about which Robert Moenart, executive director of University Audits, had
reported that the level of support was outstanding and that President Coleman had set a
strong ethical tone.
The committee also met with candidates for external auditor and was updated on
the implications of the most recently announced cuts in state appropriations. Regent
Brandon commented that both the committee and the board as a whole are more
engaged with the efforts being undertaken by the administration to cut costs, curb cost
increases, and deal with the current budget environment than it has been in the past. He
cautioned that the state needs to be mindful of the aspects of its operations that are
doing well, which include higher education, and expressed concern that the state will
fail to understand the return on investments made in this sector. He noted that even
though the state is in a difficult financial situation, the University remains in a very
thriving, competitive environment, and he expressed the hope that the state can be made
to understand this and to continue to invest in it.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard reported that the
Compensation and Personnel Committee did not meet this month.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.

143




December Meeting, 2003


this area. He noted that proposed changes in health insurance premiums contributions
have been discussed broadly on the Dearborn campus. Finally, he reported that units
should be moving into the former Fairlane Training and Development Center facility by
the end of the month, and classes will be held there beginning in January.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas commented that proposed
health benefit changes have also been widely discussed on the Flint campus. He noted
that Professor Fredric Jameson, from Duke University, would be serving as the Myron
and Margaret Winegarden Visiting Professor on the Flint campus during the winter
term.
Michigan Student Assembly Report.              Ms. Monique Perry, vice president of
Michigan Student Assembly, presented an end of semester report and described a
number of ongoing and new programs that are being pursued by MSA during the
current academic year. Among these are sponsoring programs related to the upcoming
theme semester on the Brown v Board of Education Supreme Court decision.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May described a bequest that had been made
by alumna Anne L. Welch as an example of the importance of bequest intentions in
capital campaigns. He noted that this would be a focus of the upcoming campaign.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for nine
retiring faculty members.
Harold J. Borkin, professor of architecture in the A. Alfred Taubman College of
Architecture and Urban Planning, will retire on December 31, 2003.
Professor Borkin received his B.Arch. (1957) and M.Arch. (1959) degrees from
the University of Michigan, where he also was awarded the Albert Kahn Fellowship in
Architecture (1957). He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1961
and was promoted to assistant professor in 1963, associate professor in 1968, and
professor in 1973. He served as chair of the doctoral program in architecture from
1978-81 and from 1985-87.
Focusing on design early in his career, Professor Borkin entered and won a
number of competitions, including the Elmwood Housing Project with Green and Savin
in 1964, the first stage of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Competition with
Wehrer and Johnson in 1960-61, and the first stage of the Toronto city hall and civic
square competition with Hayward and Wehrer in 1959.     After co-founding the
Architecture and Planning Research Lab, Professor Borkin's interests shifted to the
development of computer-aided architectural design with an emphasis on integrated
design systems, geometric modeling, building representation, simulation, and design
evaluation.  He brought the University to the forefront of architectural programs
offering CAD curricula, and he fostered curricular and research innovation by using a
multi-disciplinary approach to architectural graduate studies. In 2000, Professor Borkin
was inducted into the Permanent Research Collection on Information Technology at the
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History for his work on
architectural design tools.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Harold J.
Borkin professor emeritus of architecture.
David L. Chambers, III, LL.B., Wade H. McCree, Jr., Collegiate Professor of
Law and professor of law in the Law School, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 2003, after an extraordinary career of teaching, administration, and
research.
Professor Chambers received his A.B. degree from Princeton University in 1962
and his LL.B. degree from Harvard University in 1965. He worked in private practice
(1965-67), served as special assistant to the executive director of the National Advisory
Commission on Civil Disorders (1967-68), and was counsel to the Cabinet Committee
on Price Stability in the Council of Economic Advisors (1968-69). Professor Chambers
joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1969 and was
promoted to associate professor in 1972 and professor in 1974. He was appointed the
Wade H. McCree, Jr., Collegiate Professor of Law in 1990.
A leader in studying the legal profession and the area of legal education, Professor
Chambers placed a particular emphasis on the provision of legal services to the poor
and working class. His contributions to legal scholarship and education, the legal


155




December Meeting, 2003


profession, and to society are many. Professor Chambers served as chair of the board of
Michigan Legal Services, president and member of the board of the Society of
American Law Teachers, and chair of the administrative committee of the UAW-Ford
Legal Services Plan. He was also a member of the planning committee for the
Association of American Law Schools (AALS) Conference on New Ideas in Legal
Education, a member of the AALS executive committee, and chair of the AALS
Commission on Pro Bono and Public Service. Within the Law School, he developed
and served as director of the South Africa Externship Program. Professor Chambers'
scholarship includes Making Fathers Pay: The Enforcement of Child Support, a
pioneering book and important example of the use of empirical techniques in addressing
legal problems. His recent work on AIDS and same-sex marriage and his surveys of the
work and professional life of Law School graduates have been widely influential.
The Regents now salute this accomplished scholar and educator for his long and
dedicated service by naming David L. Chambers, III, professor emeritus of law.
Stephen S. Easter, Jr., Ph.D., professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental
biology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active
faculty status on December 31, 2003.
Professor Easter received his B.S. degree from Yale University in 1960 and his
Ph.D. degree from The Johns Hopkins University in 1967. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1970 and was promoted to associate
professor in 1974 and professor in 1980. In July 1998, he was awarded the Mathew
Alpern Collegiate Professorship in Biology, a title he held through June 2003.
Professor Easter's major research accomplishments are in the area of visual
neuroscience. His early work dealt with the basic physiological mechanisms by which
light impinging on the retina gives rise to neural signals and with how the brain moves
the eyes so that an object stays in view when either the object or the viewer is in
motion. For the last twenty years, his research has concentrated on issues related to
developmental neurobiology. He recognized that the visual system of fish offered
considerable experimental advantages for analyzing how growing axons find their
targets, and his work on the development of the projection of axons from the retina to
the optic tectum led to great international recognition.
In both large introductory courses and small graduate seminars, Professor Easter
was recognized as an outstanding teacher. He was committed to helping his students
express their ideas clearly, both orally and in writing. Professor Easter trained an
impressive array of students and post-doctoral fellows, who have gone on to hold
faculty positions at prestigious universities throughout the United States and abroad.
He also gave generously of his time for University service, including membership on
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts Executive Committee and service as
associate chair of the Department of Biology.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service by naming Stephen S. Easter, Jr., professor emeritus of molecular,
cellular, and developmental biology.
Robert D. Fogel, Ph.D., the Lewis E. Wehmeyer and Elaine Prince Wehmeyer
Professor in Fungal Taxonomy, professor of biology, and curator of fungi in the


156




IDecember Meeting, 2003


Herbarium in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active
faculty status on December 31, 2003.
Professor Fogel received his B.S. (1969) and Ph.D. (1978) degrees from Oregon
State University and his M.A. degree from the University of Colorado (1970). He joined
the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor and assistant curator in 1978
and was promoted to associate professor and associate curator in 1984 and professor and
curator in 1995. From 1989-91, he also held an appointment as associate professor of
natural resources. He was named the Lewis E. Wehmeyer and Elaine Prince Wehmeyer
Professor in Fungal Taxonomy in 2001.
An expert on hypogeous fungi, Professor Fogel focused on the hypogeous
mycoflora of the Great Basin and adjacent Cordilleras in the western United States. He
also researched the role of mycorrhizal fungi in ecosystem processes and led the
construction of a biotron for studying soil ecology at the Biological Station. As curator
of fungi, Professor Fogel nurtured the growth of one of the world's major fungal
herbaria, and he created an on-line database of fungus collection specimens, complete
with linked DNA sequences, images, and distribution maps.
Professor Fogel taught courses on mycology and on microbial ecology, both on the
Ann Arbor campus and at the Biological Station and has received the Class of 1923
Award for Undergraduate Teaching. He also served on 20 dissertation committees and
numerous undergraduate honors thesis committees, and he authored and maintains the
award-winning outreach website, Fun Facts about Fungi.
Professor Fogel is a member of the British Mycological Society, the Mycological
Society of America, and the North American Mycological Association. An active
member of Sigma Xi, he served as president of the University's chapter (2001-03) and
received a National Program Award for the forum, "Internet Education and the
Research University" (2001).
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Robert D. Fogel professor
emeritus of biology and curator emeritus.
Robert E. Lewis, Ph.D., professor of English language and literature in the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and executive director and research scientist
of the Middle English Dictionary, will retire from active faculty status on December 31,
2003.
Professor Lewis received his B.A. degree from Princeton University in 1959 and
his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from The University of Pennsylvania in 1962 and 1964,
respectively. He was appointed to the faculty of Indiana University in 1963 and rose to
the rank of professor in 1975. Professor Lewis joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1982 as professor and co-editor of the Middle English Dictionary (MED) and
research scientist and was promoted to editor in 1983. He was named executive
director of the MED in 1990.
Begun in 1930, the MED survived the Depression and World War II and is the
most important research project in the humanities to date at the University of Michigan.
Professor Lewis' greatest accomplishments and most enduring contributions are
grounded in his work as the final editor of this project. For nearly two decades,
Professor Lewis worked unremittingly as a fund-raiser, recruiter and trainer of new
sub-editors, and the last gate-keeper of the MED. He was the "meta-editor," the person


157




December Meeting, 2003


solely responsible for the accuracy, consistency, and excellence of the final published
work. In 2001, the printed dictionary arrived at the end of the alphabet, and almost
simultaneously the electronic version came on line completely searchable and available
for supplementation and correction.  With more than 15,000 printed pages, this
reference work is a centerpiece for research in medieval English culture.
Professor Lewis takes pride in all his contributions to medieval studies,
particularly in his essays on Chaucer and The Pricke of Conscience. In addition, he is a
skilled bibliographer and co-editor of the Index of Printed Middle English Prose (1985).
Yet it is as editor of the MED where his fame rests. He sought skilled helpers and
nurtured them; he worked to an exacting schedule; he finished the course. It is for this
work that he most deserves special celebration.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Robert E. Lewis
professor emeritus of English language and literature, executive director emeritus of the
Middle English Dictionary, and research scientist emeritus.
Frank F. Maple, Jr., professor of social work in the School of Social Work, will
retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2003.
Professor Maple received his B.A., M.A., and M.S.W. degrees from the University
of Michigan in 1951, 1953, and 1963, respectively. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1963 and was promoted to associate
professor in 1968 and professor in 1975.
Professor Maple's primary research interests include group and family treatment
and interviewing methods for social work. Based on his work in these areas, he
published Goal Focused Interviewing, a series of eight interactive computer programs
for use in interpersonal practice methods classes. The series included three units on
interviewing, two on group treatment, one on marital therapy, and two on family
therapy. He was also co-author of the book Creating Groups, and published three other
books: Shared Decision   Making, Dynamic Interviewing, and     Goal Focused
Interviewing.
At the W.J. Maxey Boys Training School in Whitmore Lake, Michigan, Professor
Maple developed a combined family therapy and group leader model of treatment that
was implemented in the school's residential setting. He also created interactive videos
designed to train students and professionals to conduct treatment sessions with
individuals, families, and groups. These were field-tested by more than 500 students
and practitioners and received uniformly high evaluations. He served on numerous
University and school committees and was a member of several professional societies
including the National Association of Social Workers and the National Education
Association.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Frank F.
Maple, Jr., professor emeritus of social work.
William J. Meyer, Ph.D., professor of political science in the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 2003.
Professor Meyer received his B.A. degree from St. John Fisher College in 1965 and
his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from The Pennsylvania State University in 1968 and 1973,
respectively. He joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty as a lecturer in 1970


158




IUecember Meeting, 2003


and was promoted to instructor in 1971, assistant professor in 1973, associate professor
in 1977, and professor in 1992.
Professor Meyer taught political theory curriculum in the Department of Political
Science for over thirty years. He published two books, many articles in political theory
and ethics, and numerous professional papers, all of which reflected his primary
intellectual interests in American political thought and democratic political theory. More
recently, his interests involving issues of citizenship and civic action have produced a
number of edited collections. In addition, Professor Meyer was a key contributor to an
oral history archive of the 1936 Flint Sit-Down Strike on its 50th anniversary, and he
helped develop several local public history projects.
A founding member of the college's Master of Liberal Studies in American
Culture Program, Professor Meyer was the program's director from 1981-84. He
chaired the chancellor search committee from 1983-84, served as director of graduate
studies from 1985-89, and was department chair from 1980-81 and 1992-95. He was a
faculty counselor for academic support services from 1991-93, interim vice provost for
academic affairs from 1995-96, and chair of the Faculty Council from 2001-02.
Professor Meyer made outstanding contributions to the field of political theory, to the
liberal arts education of many generations of students, and to the collective memory of the
Flint community. The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming William J. Meyer professor emeritus of political science.
Cornelia P. Porter, Ph.D., associate professor of nursing in the School of Nursing,

her M.N.Ed. degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1966, and her Ph.D. degree
from the University of Arizona in 1985. She specialized in oncology nursing at New
York University from 1959-60, received certification as a pediatric nurse practitioner
from the University of Rochester in 1969, served as an assistant professor and pediatric
nurse practitioner at Yale University and the Yale-New Haven Hospital from 1977-80,
and was a graduate associate in research at the University of Arizona from 1980-85.
Professor Porter joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in
1986, was appointed assistant research scientist in 1992, and was promoted to associate
professor in 1995. She was the first African American to serve as associate professor
with tenure in the School of Nursing.
Professor Porter taught undergraduate and graduate courses on health promotion
and risk reduction programs in which she challenged students to think about health
disparities within the African American community from both clinical and research
perspectives. She had a keen interest in the relationship between social knowledge and
the mental health of ethnic/minority school children and how social knowledge is
interpreted and acted upon.
After being inducted into the American Academy of Nursing in 1983, Professor
Porter received an ethnic/minority clinical nursing fellowship.  She served as an
American Nurses Association ethnic/minority legislative intern in Washington, D.C.,

by Regent Brandon, the Regents unanimously approved each of the following items:
Purchasing Contract with M. W. ProctorGroup LLC
The Regents approved a purchasing contract with M. W. ProctorGroup LLC for
development and preparation of a research proposal. However, because Mary C. Proctor,
an Equal Member of M. W. ProctorGroup LLC, is also a University of Michigan
employee, this purchasing contract falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.  The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.   The parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and its
Department of Emergency Medicine and M. W. ProctorGroup LLC.
2.   The service provided is development and preparation of a research proposal for a time
period of 6 to 9 months, for a total dollar amount of $10,000.
3.   The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Mary C. Proctor, a University of
Michigan employee, is an Equal Member of M. W. ProctorGroup LLC.
Subcontract Agreement between the University of Michigan and Michigan
Aerospace Corporation
The Regents approved a subcontract agreement with Michigan Aerospace
Corporation ("Company") in connection with the project "Phoenix Meteorology (MET)
Experiment." Because Dr. Lennard Fisk, is a partial owner of the Company and a
University of Michigan employee, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Michigan Aerospace

Albert Kahn Associates for its design.
Health Insurance Plan Designs and Premium Structures
Provost Courant commented that the University's share of health insurance
premiums has increased from $85 million to nearly $175 million over the past 5 years. He
noted that throughout the deliberations of the faculty-led committee appointed to make
recommendations regarding the future design of the University's health care insurance
premium structure, the message has been clear that the goal is to curtail the rise in health
care costs without sacrificing high-quality, comprehensive, and competitive health
benefits. He reviewed the premium structure changes that will be put in place for
implementation in January 2005:


164




IUecember Meeting, 2003


* The University will provide a higher share of the cost of coverage for
employees and retirees than for dependents and will provide a higher share
of the cost of coverage in lower-cost plans than for more expensive plans.
* The University contribution to health insurance premiums for employees
will be 95% of the average premium cost for the two lowest-cost
comprehensive plans, and after figuring the average cost of all individuals
covered--including employees, retirees, and their covered dependents--the
aggregate University payment in 2005 will be 85% of the premium cost.
* We will move from a three-tier (single employees, two-person households,
and families of three or more people) to a four-tier (the addition of a
category consisting of one adult with any number of children) structure of
coverage. Since on average, children are less expensive to cover than
adults, this will lower the total cost of coverage from what it otherwise
would have been for the households which fit into the fourth tier.
Although the committee recommended that co-premiums for prescription drugs
and for health insurance be calculated separately, to simplify plan design and
administration they will be calculated together. Another recommendation, that the
University maintain the aggregate University contribution at 85% for three years, may
not be possible to achieve in the current health care environment. However, the
University is committed to providing the community with significant advance notice
before the implementation of any changes to allow for campus discussion and to give
employees the opportunity to plan ahead.
Provost Courant commented on the feedback received from the campus
community about this plan. Many expressed concern that the lowest-paid employees
bear more of a burden when costs are increased. After considerable review and
discussion, the administration agreed with the committee's assessment that trying to
find a solution for different levels of employee income is not feasible and raises issues
of fairness, consistency, and benefits administration. Issues related to the lowest-paid
staff need to be addressed more comprehensively, and the administration will continue
to work to address these challenges.
Provost Courant expressed his appreciation for the work of the health insurance
premium redesign committee and expressed confidence that the changes to be
implemented in January 2005 that are based on the committee's recommendations will
enable the University community to maintain high-quality benefits in the years ahead.
Executive Vice President Kelch observed that escalation in health care costs is not
likely to abate soon and that the committee's recommendations reflect the reality of the
national landscape while upholding the commitment to employees to provide a robust
benefits package, which is essential to recruiting and retaining faculty and staff. He
noted that changes in the premium structure will mean that employees will begin to
consider cost as a factor in their decision, and that should lead in a mitigation of the
total cost for health insurance coverage. Dr. Kelch commented that as both an insurer
and a health care provider, the University of Michigan Health System has a special
responsibility to control costs.


165




IUecember Meeting, 2003


Dr. Kelch pointed out that research shows that encouraging healthier lifestyles and
wellness practices can help to control health care costs. He said the M-Care and M-Fit
units should take leadership roles in helping the University to develop new worksite
health and education programs for University employees.
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that decisions regarding health
insurance premiums will be communicated to the campus community in January 2004.
This will be followed by negotiations with vendors in February, distribution of
descriptive materials in late summer, and open enrollment in October, with the new
rates to be in place beginning January 2005. The new rate structure will also be
incorporated into negotiations with labor unions as their current contracts expire. He
pointed out that insurance premiums are paid with pretax dollars, which lowers the net
cost to employees. He also noted that employees have been encouraged to take
advantage of flexible spending account programs, which use pretax dollars to pay for
out-of-pocket health care costs.
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that the committee had
recommended consideration of an additional portable comprehensive plan other than
Blue Cross/Blue Shield and that this recommendation is being pursued. He stated that
the administration is "absolutely committed" to developing mechanisms for providing
ongoing opportunities for input from the campus community and all key stakeholders
on issues surrounding health benefit design.
Regent Deitch commented that the process outlined by the executive vice
presidents and in the Regents Communication will provide opportunities for thoughtful
discussions and dialog with the constituency before recommendations are made
regarding health insurance plans and premium structures. He moved the following:
That the 1988 Regental action item that has been used to determine health insurance
premium sharing be replaced by a process that will allow the University administration
the authority and flexibility to create each year the best possible approach to the
development of premiums. Annually, the administration will report to the Board on the
major trends and issues surrounding health insurance and the University's offerings and
premium structures for the following benefit year. This discussion will precede the
open enrollment period and will be an occasion for announcing changes to the
University community. Such reports shall be made sufficiently in advance of the
commencement of the open enrollment period to allow Regental action to be taken to
modify the recommendation should that be the decision of the Board of Regents. In the
development of its plans and understanding of the issues, the University would draw
widely upon the expertise, knowledge, and opinions of all segments of the University
community.
Regent McGowan seconded the motion. Regent Maynard commented that she is
pleased that there will be an ongoing study of how health care is handled at the
University, including examination of adding a wellness component.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.

Regent Newman called Dean Stephen Director to the podium and read the
following Regents' Resolution:
Regents' Resolution
One hundred and fifty years ago, the University of Michigan made the
momentous decision to offier a program of instruction in engineering. The first class
session was held on January 20, 1854.
With that single action our predecessors influenced the future profoundly ---
establishing the framework for an educational enterprise destined to improve the
quality of life for each succeeding generation. Through their wisdom and devotion to
the pursuit of knowledge, they opened the way for remarkable breakthroughs in
engineering and in technologies that have fostered prosperity and advancement around
the world.
Today, the University of Michigan College of Engineering occupies a position
of preeminence among the finest schools. In the spheres of education, research, and
service, its achievements are exemplary, its contributions vast, its influence global, and
its prospects for the future endless. Men and women from all nations, on campus and
as alumni, are enhancing lives every day.
The Regents congratulate the College of Engineering on its legacy of
leadership and look forward to continued significant accomplishments during the next
150 years.
Dean Director thanked the Regents for participating in this historic occasion
marking the 150th anniversary of the College of Engineering. He introduced a number
of college stakeholders who were in attendance and reviewed some of the
accomplishments of the college's faculty, students, and alumni since its founding that
had led to its preeminence among the world's colleges of engineering. He thanked the
Regents on behalf of the College of Engineering.
Comments from President Coleman
President Coleman commented on the reopening celebration for Hill Auditorium that
had occurred last week and noted that the event was well-attended and the renovation is
spectacular. She congratulated Associate Vice President Hank Baier and everyone else
who contributed to the project.
Regent Newman observed that credit should also be given to former president Lee
Bollinger, who had promoted the idea of doing a total renovation of the auditorium and
recognized its importance to the community and the University. President Coleman
agreed and noted that it had taken courage to promote the idea of a complete and total
restoration in the face of limited resources.
170




January Meeting, 2004


President Coleman commented on activities surrounding the University's
commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Brown v Board of Education and of the
Martin Luther King, Jr., holiday.
President Coleman concluded by mentioning the death in December 2003 of vice
president and secretary emeritus Richard L. Kennedy.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning. Topics discussed were the University of Michigan
Health System, including review of the quarterly report of performance and an update on
the 10-year capital plan. The other topic covered was an update of the FY 05 General
Fund budget outlook, along with a review of FY 04 progress to date. The committee
received reports on internal audit activities and on plans for insuring adequate controls in
clinical trials.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. The Compensation and Personnel
Committee did not meet this month.
Report on Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity
Vice President Ulaby stated that his report would consist of two parts: a financial
summary for FY 2003, and examples of how the Office of the Vice President for Research
(OVPR) facilitates new research on campus.
He noted that research expenditures over the past five years have increased by
about 53%, with an increase of 14.3% ($94 million) during the last fiscal year. The $94
million in additional expenditure impacts the economy by being responsible for more
than 1,700 University and non-University jobs and more than $7 million in state tax
revenue.
Vice President Ulaby reported that 70.4% of the total research expenditures came
from the federal government and 15.2% from University of Michigan funds, with the
remainder being divided among industry, foundations, state and local governments, and
other funding sources. Among the schools and colleges, 41.7% of external research
expenditures were made by the Medical School, 18.3% by the College of Engineering,
12.3% by the Institute for Social Research, 7.5% by the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, 5.7% by the School of Public Health, with the remainder divided among
the OVPR units and all other units. Total research expenditures in FY 2003 were
$637,404,821.
Vice President Ulaby displayed a chart illustrating that since 1997 total University
of Michigan expenditures from federal sources have increased by approximately 50%
per year over the total amount of available federal research and development funding.
He cautioned that for FY 2004, research funding at the University of Michigan is
estimated to increase by only 4%-5%, compared to 15.9% for FY 2003. This is due
primarily to the fact that the federal budget for research support will be decreasing
significantly in future years.
Vice President Ulaby then gave a presentation describing how the University's
central administration facilitates new research. He described five different ways this is


171




January Meeting, 2004


done, with examples of each. Among the methods by which research is facilitated are
a) faculty-driven initiatives in which the OVPR assists faculty in developing expertise
in emerging areas of research; b) identification of emerging critical research frontiers as
defined by the federal government, which leads to the formal launching of University
initiatives in a particular area (e.g., nanoscience research); c) partnering with industry to
work on specific areas of interest nationally and on campus (e.g., "Hydrogen Fuel
Research Roadmap"); d) connecting research to policy (education-driven) (e.g.,
development of the Science, Technology & Public Policy Program on campus); and e)
planning for the future (e.g., multi-institutional collaboration to establish a leadership
niche in an emerging area of research).
Vice President Ulaby concluded that central administration plays many roles in
fostering research and scholarship, in a cooperative and collegial manner.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted a memoir for one
retiring faculty member.
Gerald T. Gardner, Ph.D., professor of psychology in the College of Arts,
Sciences, and Letters at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 2003.
Professor Gardner received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from the University
of Michigan in 1965, 1967, and 1970, respectively, and he was a postdoctoral fellow at
The   Rockefeller   University  from    1970-71.     He   joined  the   University  of
Michigan-Dearborn faculty as an assistant professor in 1971 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1974 and professor in 1982. He was a lecturer in environmental
studies on the Ann Arbor campus in 1978 and was a visiting fellow and visiting
research scholar at the Yale Institution for Social and Policy Studies from 1979-81.
A nationally-recognized expert in environmental psychology, Professor Gardner
has maintained a superb program of research and is widely published in human
behavior and public policy. Early in his career, he was a consultant to the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington, D.C., and served on the task
force for the Ocean Pollution Research Program. Professor Gardner has also conducted
reviews of publications for a number of organizations, publishing companies, and
professional journals.
Within the University of Michigan-Dearborn, Professor Gardner served on many
committees and chaired the Human Subject Review Committee for 18 years. His
teaching has been inspirational and his mentorship of students extraordinary. Professor
Gardner's retirement marks the departure of an esteemed member of the faculty of the
behavioral sciences department.
The Regents now salute this dedicated and accomplished teacher and scholar by
naming Gerald T. Gardner professor emeritus of psychology.

Michigan-Dearborn. Executive Vice President Slottow pointed out that the additions
for the science and engineering buildings were funded and approved prior to acquisition
of the Ford Training and Development Center, and the budgets for these buildings were
adjusted to provide funding for the Ford Training and Development Center. Chancellor
Little commented that operating costs for the two buildings have already been included
in budget planning.

Lease Agreement with Traverwood III LLC
The Regents approved a lease agreement for property located at 2025 Traverwood to
be leased from Traverwood III LLC, for research programs in the Department of
Psychiatry. Because William C. Martin, a University employee, would be a party to the
lease agreement because he is a member of Traverwood III LLC, this agreement falls
under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  The parties to the lease agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Traverwood III LLC.


210




Februrary Meeting, 2004


2.   The service to be provided is the lease agreement of 27,443 square feet of building
space at 2025 Traverwood for five years, beginning April 1, 2004 through March 31,
2009, beginning at a monthly rate of $48,025 and ending at an estimated monthly rate
of $54,052.  Under the lease agreement, the leasehold improvements will be
constructed directly by the landlord and reimbursed by the University. The leasehold
improvements total $325,000.
3.   The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that William C. Martin, a University of
Michigan employee, is a member of Traverwood III LLC.
Lease Amendment with William           C. Martin (Institutional Review      Board office
space)
The Regents approved a re-negotiated lease agreement for property located at 540 E.
Liberty Street to be leased from William C. Martin, in which the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) offices will be assuming 4,488 square feet of the space currently leased for
the School of Social Work. Because William C. Martin, a University of Michigan
employee, is also the owner of the property, this lease amendment falls under the State of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.      The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   The parties to the lease agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
William C. Martin.
2.   The service to be provided is the lease agreement of a building at 540 E. Liberty for
fifteen years, beginning March 1, 2004 through February 28, 2019, beginning at a
monthly rate of $7,200. This monthly rate will be fixed for the first five years and
increased every March thereafter based upon the Consumer Price Index. Under the
lease, any desired minor leasehold improvements are constructed directly by the
landlord and reimbursed by the University with the exception of paint and carpet.
3.   The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that William C. Martin, a University of
Michigan employee, is the owner of the property.
Lease Amendment with William C. Martin (School of Social Work space)
The Regents approved a lease agreement for property located at 540 E. Liberty
Street to be leased from William C. Martin, involving space to be occupied by the School
of Social Work. Because William C. Martin, a University employee, is also the owner of
the property, this lease amendment falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.   The   following   information   is provided   in  compliance   with   statutory
requirements:
1.   The parties to the lease agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
William C. Martin.
2.   The service to be provided is the lease amendment of a building at 540E. Liberty
Street for eighteen months, beginning March 1, 2004 through August 31, 2005,
beginning at a monthly rate of $2,407 and increased in September 2004 based upon
the Consumer Price Index.    Under the lease, any desired minor leasehold
improvements are constructed directly by the landlord and reimbursed by the
University.
3.   The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that William C. Martin, a University of
Michigan employee, is the owner of the property.
Subcontract Agreement between           the  University   of Michigan     and   NanoBio
Corporation
The Regents approved a subcontract agreement between the University of Michigan
and NanoBio Corporation for a project involving development and testing of
nanoemulsions for various decontamination purposes, with Dr. Kent Johnson, professor of
pathology, as principal investigator for the University. Because the part owner, president,


211




Februrary Meeting, 2004


chief operating officer, chairman of the board, and chief science officer of NanoBio
Corporation, Dr. James R. Baker, Jr., is also a University of Michigan employee, this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements.
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and NanoBio Corporation.
2.   The terms of the proposed agreement conform to University policy. Dr. Kent
Johnson, professor in the Department of Pathology, will be the principal investigator
for the subcontract at the University to be conducted over at least a one-year period at
an estimated cost of $342,000 including indirect costs at full federal indirect cost
(53%). Since research agreements are often amended, the subcontract includes
provisions for changes in time, amount, and scope.  University of Michigan
procedures for approval of these changes will be followed and additional review by
the Conflict of Interest Committee will be done as appropriate.
3.   Dr. Baker's pecuniary interest arises from his capacity as an officer of NanoBio
Corporation.
Option Agreement between the University of Michigan and Ablation Frontiers
The Regents approved an option agreement with Ablation Frontiers to further

Statement on the University Budget
President Coleman made the following remarks:
I want to take a few minutes to discuss the state budget situation and the University's
plans for the months ahead. We face a challenging environment for our core teaching and
research because of unprecedented and continuing reductions in our state appropriation. As
you know, this appropriation is a critical component in providing a high-quality educational
experience for University of Michigan students, especially at the undergraduate level.


215




March Meeting, 2004


I expect to bring a recommendation to you later this spring, asking you to accept the
Fiscal Year 2005 state budget proposal for higher education - under the condition that the
Legislature fulfills the terms outlined in that proposal. I understand the chancellors of the
Dearborn an;d Flint campuses will do the same. By taking this action, we would limit further
cuts to our state appropriations, would receiv  e som   relief on the significant mid-year cut of
2004, and would agree to limit our 2005 tuition increase fbr in-state undergraduate students.
The state's proposal, if it remains substantially intact through the legislative
deliberations, will allow us to mitigate the cumulative reduction in appropriations and be
re-sponsive to the continued erosion of the state ' budget situation.
One of the most important considerations for us is the impact on our annual base
appropriation fior the Ann Arbor campus, which will be $321 million f 'we ac pt the proposal,
but only $301 million if we do not accept it. This funding is critical to our long-term financial
stabilito.
We support the efforts of the Governor and the Legislature to keep public higher
education affordable for Vichigan families. We share that goal, and it was most recently
reflected in our decision to hold the current years' tuition increase well below the average of
statewide tuition increases. But tuition restraint will not be possible over time unless we can
depend upon adequate and predictable appropriation levels.
This year finds us in an especially challenging circumstance. The economic do'wnturn
has not yet abated for our state, and it continues to put pressure on state government, as well as
on.Michigan residents and all of our publicly supported enterprises. We want to partner with
the State of Michigan to do all we can during a time of such economic stress.
But the state's proposal does not alter the reality of nearly $43 million cut from our
base-level state support for the Ann Arbor campus in the last two years, along with almost $20
million in one-time cuts. These finding reductions are unprecedented.
As you know, we have responded to this reduction in our annual appropriations by
cutting our budget deeply, and we have more hard work to do. We estimate we will need to cut
another $20 million from the Ann Arbor budget for the 2005 fiscal year. That is in addition to
the $37 million we cut last year.
By the time the coming year conc.ludes, we will have taken a total of $57 million out of
the budget in order to address these severe revenue constraints. Our Flint and Dearborn
campuses also face additional cuts. The Flint campus anticipates cutting another $800,000 next
yeatr, and in Dearborn the reduction will be $.1 million on top of previous budget cuts.
We have responded responsibly to calls obr the University to examine its expenditures,
and we continue to promote efficiency aggressively in all areas of our institution. But we cannot
minimize the significant impact of these reductions, and we must honestly face the serious
long-term consequences for all three of our campuses.
Preserving the qualitv of core academic activity is our highest priority. We will be
la   ser-c d on protecting our academic quality for the fiture --- if our quality begins to
decline, it will take far longer to rebuild than it will take to lose it.
Our students and families expect and demand the academic excellence that has created
the outstanding reputation of the Universit2 of Michigan. Our alumni, too, have an enormous
stake in the continued strength of their alma mater.
The distinctive quality of our university depends on stable state support and reasonable
tuition revenue. As -we go fo/brward, we must be clear that -we accept the state's proposal only as
a short-term measure. It is not a sustainable, long-term solution. Ultimately, we must be true to
our mission and to our students. We cannot let the focus on cost trump the commitment to
quality.


216




March Meeting, 2004


As I told the Senate higher education subcommittee last month, our public universities
must work with the Governor and the Legislature to find more sustainable models that can
achieve our shared goals of both excellence and affordability. I believe our long-term planning
should incorporate three main elements:
"* More robust and more predictable state support;
"* Moderate tuition increases;
"* And a continued emphasis on financial aid, especially in the form ofgrants.
Financial aid can pave the road to affordability. We have increased financial aid at a
greater rate than tuition over the past several years to meet the fidl financial need of every
in-state undergraduate. We know 'we must do even more, and we will be focusing an
extraordinary effort on scholarships as a central component of our upcoming capital campaign.
In the coming weeks, the Provost will work closely with deans, executive officers, and
unit directors to move through the budgeting process for the year ahead. We have developed a
set of guiding principles to help shape our planning and budget decisions. We know there will
be difficult choices to make, and there will be no easy answers.
Let me say it again: Continued academic quality is our first priority.
In addition, Michigan's public universities must put tremendous effort into creating a
new kind of partnership with our state. I believe that the concept of "partnership" is a two-way
street. We have to ensure that investment in our public universities meets the needs of our state
and reaps robust economic vitality for Michigan. Nowhere is that more evident than in my
determination to bring down barriers and foster greater economic development activity
stemming from our University's research. I welcome this week's announcement from the
Governor announcing the formation of a Blue Ribbon Commission on Higher Education. I look
Jbforward to working with Governor Granholm, Lt. Governor Cherry, and commission members
to improve the state 's economy through higher education.
The University and the State still have many economic challenges to face. I will
continue to make sure that we do not forget the fiuture, as we work together to solve the
problems of the present.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman commented on a number of noteworthy student accomplishments
and honors during the past month.
CommitteeReports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and were updated in three areas: internal audit activity
over the last three months; review of the FY 2004 external audit plan; and information on
the FY 2005 General Fund budget.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard reported that the
committee would be meeting immediately following the Regents' Meeting. She noted
that continuing informal discussions are being held with the president about
establishing a vision for the University.
University of Michigan Undergraduate Research Forum
Vice President Ulaby announced that a new scientific journal has been published on
campus that is written, edited, managed, and published by undergraduate students. He


217




March Meeting, 2004


introduced the faculty advisors for the project: Sandra Gregerman, director of the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), and Cinda-Sue Davis, director
of Women in Science and Engineering (WISE). He then introduced students who have
been involved in creation of the journal, the University of Michigan Undergraduate
Research Forum: Shahzad Zafar (internal relations representative), Wei Gu (editor in
chief), Adam Brzezinski (publicity manager), Shauna Puhl (copy editor), Shailesh
Agarwal (financial manager), and Sanyo Tsai (graphics editor). The students described
how they brought the idea of a peer-reviewed undergraduate journal from concept to
reality and distributed copies of the inaugural issue.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of February 19, 2004.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report,
Plant Extension Report, and the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report
Littigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established, February 1 - February 29, 2004.
University of Michigan Health System. No additional report was submitted.
Division of Student Affairs. There was no additional report.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little noted that a celebration had
recently been held in honor of the 30th anniversary of the Commission for Women on
the Dearborn campus.  He also called attention to the recommendation for the
appointment of Katie Anderson-Levitt as dean of the College of Arts, Sciences and
Letters.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas pointed out that students from
the Flint campus were well represented at the recent Honors Convocation. Of special
note is that of the four students recognized as Angell Scholars for 8 semesters, two were
from the Flint campus.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. President Coleman commented that this
would be the last meeting that Angela Galardi and Monique Perry would be attending
as president and vice president, respectively, of MSA.
Ms. Galardi thanked the Regents and administrators for their support during the
past year and noted that it had been a wonderful experience. She then offered her
observations on the public comments session and noted that she was in full support of
the perspectives that had been raised by the student speakers. She pointed out that
despite budget constraints, it is very important that programs in the area of student
services be maintained as they provide support for students who lack support elsewhere
and allow them to feel comfortable at the University.
Ms. Galardi gave a personal perspective on proposed changes to the Greek system,
and noted that it provided a means for developing leadership skills and networking.
218




March Meeting, 2004


Proposed changes would increase barriers for students to join the Greek system and
would result in a decrease in the numbers of students who would become involved. The
requirement to have resident advisors in each chapter would force many chapters to
close and would further deter students from considering joining the Greek system. Ms.
Galardi commented that the entire Greek community is opposed to the changes being
considered. She stated that students feel strongly that they need to be a part of the
discussions about this issue and other changes to student programs being proposed in
response to budget cutbacks.
Ms. Monique       Perry, vice    president of MSA, thanked           the  Regents    and
administrators for her experience during the past year. She noted that MSA had passed
resolutions expressing full support of all of the issues raised by the students during
public comments, including fully funding the annual Pow Wow, not proceeding with
the restructuring of SAPAC, reporting and recording bias incidents, and fully funding
the Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs. She commented that the deteriorating
condition of the multi-cultural center (William Monroe Trotter House) discourages
prospective minority students from considering coming to Michigan.
Ms. Perry also commented that a policy needs to be put in place for dealing with
hate crimes. She urged the University administration to be responsive to the concerns
expressed by the students.

Professor To is a pioneer in multidisciplinary inquiry in education, having
incorporated physiological science and clinical technology into his research on teaching
and learning and on health and growth. His publications include a three-volume study
on neuroscience and education and several books about the scientific merit of the social
sciences, the philosophy of education, and religion and education. He has had over 150
articles published in a wide variety of professional journals, and a number of his works
have been translated into several languages.
The Regents salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Cho-Yee To

Teshome G. Wagaw, Ph.D., professor of education in the School of Education

Professor Wagaw received his B.A. degree from Pacific Union College in 1958,
his M.A. degree from Andrews University in 1959, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Maryland in 1965. He served at Howard University from 1965-66 and at

A global scholar, Professor Wagaw has been a consultant to the United Nations,
the World Bank, and the Ethiopian and Egyptian governments, and has carried out
unique field studies in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Egypt, and Israel.  He developed the
University's first course on childbearing theory and practices in rural Ethiopia and
completed the first comprehensive study of the Ethiopian education system. He
conducted the first ethnographical investigation of the socialization of the Falasha in
Israel; this research resulted in the publication of several major articles and books.
Professor Wagaw conceived, developed, and taught courses in the areas of ethnicity
and ethnic conflict, race, prejudice, equity in educational opportunity, and educational
outcome prejudice. His expertise includes postsecondary education in developing
nations and comparative postsecondary education. Among his honors are two Fulbright
awards, a German Academic Exchange award, international travel and lecture awards

Regent White, the Regents unanimously approved each of the following items:
Option Agreement between the University of Michigan and Triana, LLC
The Regents unanimously approved an option agreement between the University of
Michigan and Triana, LLC Inc. for commercializing a portfolio of inventions owned by
the University of Michigan, as detailed in the Regents Communication. Because the
partial owners of Triana, LLC, Samir Hanash and Gilbert Omenn, are also University of
Michigan employees, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.  The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements.
1.  Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Triana,
LLC.


230




March Meeting, 2004


2.   Contract terms include use in all fields. Triana will pay an option fee upon execution
of the agreement. The option period is 18 months with right to renew for additional 6
months upon completion of certain performance milestones. Triana is given an
exclusive to patent rights and will pay all ongoing patent costs during the option
period. Specific product, business and capitalization milestones must be met in order
to maintain the rights granted by the option.
The University will retain ownership of the licensed technology and may continue to
further develop it and use it for research and academic purposes.
No use of University services or facilities is obligated under the agreement.
3.   The pecuniary interests of Dr. Hanash and Dr. Omenn arise from their ownership
interest in Triana, LLC. They will waive any personal participation in the sharing of
revenue received by the University from the company.
Subcontract Agreement between          the   University   of Michigan     and   EMAG
Technologies, Inc.
The Regents approved a subcontract agreement with EMAG Technologies, Inc. for
funding of a project in the University of Michigan College of Engineering. Because the
co-founder and co-owner of EMAG Technologies, Dr. Kamal Sarabandi, is also a
University of Michigan employee, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and EMAG
Technologies, Inc.
2.   The terms of the agreement conform to University policy. The period of performance
for the project is six (6) months and the amount of funding support is $23,288. Since
research agreements are often amended, the subcontract includes provisions for
changes in time, amount, and scope. University of Michigan procedures for approval
of these changes will be followed and additional review by the Conflict of Interest
Committee will be done as appropriate.
3.   Dr. Sarabandi's pecuniary interest arises from his ownership of EMAG Technologies.
He is not involved in the project at either the University of Michigan or EMAG
Technologies.
Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and the University
Consortium for Advanced Internet Development (doing business as Internet2)
The Regents approved a research agreement between the University of Michigan
and the University Consortium for Advanced Internet Development (doing business as
Internet2) (hereafter, "Company") to provide funding for a project to be carried out at the
University's Center for Information Technology Integration. Because the president and
chief executive officer of the Company, Douglas Van Houweling, is also a University of
Michigan faculty member, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and the
University Consortium for Advanced Internet Development (doing business as
Internet2) ("Company").
2.   The terms of the proposed agreement conform to University policy. The period of
performance for the project is four (4) months at a total cost of $39,667. Since
research agreements are often amended, the agreement includes provisions for changes
in time, amount, and scope. University of Michigan procedures for approval of these
changes will be followed and additional review by the Conflict of Interest Committee
will be done as appropriate.

3.   Douglas Van Houweling's pecuniary interest arises from his status as president and
chief executive officer of the Company. He has played no role in the negotiation of
the agreement and will play no role in the University's effort under this agreement.
License  Agreement between      the  University  of Michigan     and  NeuroProbe
Technologies, LLC
The Regents approved a license agreement between the University of Michigan and
NeuroProbe Technologies, LLC ("NPT"). NPT wishes to manufacture probes under
contract with the UM Solid State Electronics Laboratory and sell the resultant probes to
third parties. Because Daryl Kipke, David Anderson, and Jamille Hetke are partial
owners of NPT and also are University of Michigan employees, this agreement falls under
the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided
in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
NeuroProbe Technologies, LLC.
2.   License Terms include an xclusive, worldwide grant for the materials. NPT will pay a
royalty on sales of the probes. The University will retain ownership of the licensed
technology and may continue to further develop it and use it for research and
academic purposes. The term of the agreement is for ten years.
3.   The pecuniary interests of Dr. Kipke, Dr. Anderson, and Ms. Hetke arise from their
ownership interest in NPT. The have waived any personal participation in the sharing
of revenue received by the University from the company.
Faculty-Student Relationships Policy
Provost Courant informed the Regents that the University is instituting a new
"Faculty-Student Relationships Policy," which will be incorporated into the Standard
Practice Guide. He noted that although relationships between students and faculty are
discouraged, the policy recognizes that they can occur, and it requires disclosure and
management. If the inherent conflict of interest cannot be removed, the policy requires
termination of either the personal relationship or the classroom relationship. The policy
will be implemented during the summer of 2004.
Bylaws of the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC)
Executive Board
Executive Vice President Kelch submitted for approval proposed changes to the
UMHHC Executive Board. On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent
McGowan, the Regents unanimously approved proposed amendments to the Bylaws of
the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) Executive Board, as
described in the Regents Communication.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 4:30 p.m. The next
meeting will be held April 22, 2004.

April Meeting, 2004


APRIL MEETING, 2004
The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, April 22, 2004
The Regents convened at 2:35 p.m. in the Pendleton Room, Michigan Union.
Present were President Coleman and Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Executive Vice
President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,
Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, Vice
President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent Deitch and Vice President Krislov were absent.
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She welcomed a group of visitors
from Tianjin, China, who were attending the meeting as observers.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Jim Mogensen, citizen, on the town-gown
relationship.
Remarks by President Coleman
President Coleman addressed the Board about her aspirations and initiatives for
future directions for the University. The address is included as an appendix to these
minutes.
Faculty Awards
Provost Courant announced that four faculty members had recently been awarded
Guggenheim Fellowships: Peter Ho Davies, Rebecca Scott, James Lee, and Katherine
Verdery. He also announced that two faculty members, Philip Bucksbaum and Raymond
Kelly, had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and Provost Courant noted
that this is the highest honor in the sciences that is given in the United States.
School of Information Strategic Assessment
Provost Courant commented that until recently there had not been a regular, formal
process of review of the schools and colleges. He and President Coleman decided this
would be a useful exercise, so they have instituted a process of strategic assessments.
About two units will per year will undergo assessments, so that each unit will be on a
cycle of approximately 10 years between assessments. The School of Information is the
first unit to have completed the review, which involves a rigorous process of
self-assessment, followed by assessments by two outside teams, one from the University
of Michigan but external to the unit and one external to the University. The teams were
charged with responding to the question of how the unit could work with other units on
campus to take advantage of the breadth and depth of interdisciplinary opportunities
offered at the University.


233




April Meeting, 2004


Provost Courant noted that the School of Information had formerly been
constituted as the School of Library Science. It now is focusing on the broad area of the
use of information in the information age within the academy. He introduced John
King, who came to the University in January 2000 as dean of the School of Information
following a career at the University of Califomia-Irvine.
Dean King introduced the school's associate deans. He noted that the School of
Information was established in 1996 with a goal of assembling an outstanding faculty
drawn from disciplines that relate to the information age and fusing their collective
wisdom into new curricula and professional training and into new forms of research.
He pointed out that the School of Information was the first of its kind. He described the
history of the school since its founding and then described the process that was used to
conduct the strategic assessment.
Dean King noted that both the internal and external committees agreed with the
school's internal assessment that its initial start-up phase since its founding in 1996 has
been "an enormous success." He gave examples of how the school incorporated a true
interdisciplinary focus into the curriculum and noted that students are required to obtain
a number of credits in "practical engagement."
Dean King reported that concerns expressed by the evaluators involved the
challenge faced by the continuing effort of "intellectual integration" which involves
developing the fundamental intellectual space that pulls together all of the pieces of the
information age. He commented that although the School of Information is one of the
University's smaller schools, it would not be possible for it to achieve its goals if it
were to become larger than its current size, and it has no plans for expansion. He noted
that the most important challenge currently facing the school is clarification of its
business model. He concluded that he is honored by having been given the opportunity
to "join in something that had the potential to be a global leader in something very
important and very new."
Dean King then responded to questions and described efforts underway to
reconfigure the doctoral program.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and was updated in three areas:   the Athletic
Department's five-year operating and capital plan projections; development of the FY
2005 General Fund budget; and the financial performance of the University of Michigan
Hospitals and Health Centers through March 31, 2004.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard reported that the
committee had met and discussed options and possibilities in the area of governance
and self-evaluation for the board.
The Regents then turned to the regular agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the meeting
of March 18, 2004.


234




Ap ril Meeting, 2004


Ieports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report,
Plant Extension Report, the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report, and the
Regents' Report on Non-Competitive Purchases Over $5,000 from Single Sources,
December 1, 2003, through March 15, 2004.
Executive Vice President Slottow recognized Gloria Hage, associate vice president
and deputy general counsel, for the leadership she provided as interim chief human
resources officer.
Litiion Report. The Regents received the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the report of Projects
Established, March 1 - March 31, 2004.
Uni versity of Michigan Health System.  Executive Vice President Kelch
reported that the Hospitals and Health Centers had received a prestigious award, the
"Hospitals for Healthy Environment 2004 Environmental Leadership Award." Only
four hospitals in the country receive this award each year, and the University has
received it twice. He also announced that the University Hospitals has been recognized
by the Department of Health and Human Services as being one of the best in the nation
for directing organ donation. He also called attention to the proposed appointment of
Harry L.T. Mobley as chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper introduced Jason Mironov,
the newly elected president of the Michigan Student Assembly. She also introduced
Carole Henry, who is being recommended for appointment as director of University
Housing and assistant vice president for student affairs.
University of Iichigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little reported that the Dearborn
campus would be participating in the campaign kickoff activities concurrent with the
Ann Arbor campus and called attention to an agenda item recognizing the contributions
of Mr. Henry Patton. He also noted that the two speakers scheduled to speak at the
Dearborn Campus commencement illustrate the depth of the engagement the campus
has with the community.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas commented that the Flint
campus welcomes and supports President Coleman's vision for the University of
Michigan. He also reported that the lieutenant governor of Michigan, an alumnus of the
University of Michigan-Flint, would be the Flint campus' commencement speaker.
Milchtigan Student Assembly Reiport. MSA President Jason Mironov introduced
himself and commented on some of the issues he planned to work on during his term as
president. These include initiatives to improve the off-campus housing situation and to
implement an annual "Spring Fling" event whose purpose would be to develop school
spirit among students. Mr. Mironov noted that the recent MSA election included a
ballot initiative, which passed overwhelmingly, to raise student fees by $1.00 to be used
toward improvement of the Trotter House.
Voluntary Support.  Vice President May submitted the report of voluntary
support. He noted that the formal launch of "The Michigan Difference" campaign is
scheduled for May 12-15, 2004. He called attention to the recent gift from the W.K.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted one retirement memoir.
Paul M. Bronstein, Ph.D., professor of psychology in the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 2003.
Professor Bronstein received his B.A. degree from The City College of New York
in 1965, his M.A. degree from Miami University in 1966, and his Ph.D. degree from
Rutgers University in 1971. He taught at Brooklyn College from 1971-76, Trenton State
College from 1976-81, and Rutgers University from 1980-81. Professor Bronstein
joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty as an assistant professor in 1981 and was
promoted to associate professor in 1983 and professor in 1989.
Professor Bronstein's research interests focused on the areas of behavioral biology
and ecology and comparative and experimental psychology; his recent work involved


245




April Meeting, 2004


studying the conditioning paradigm in the Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens. He
has published extensively, including several papers co-authored with undergraduate
students working under his supervision.  Professor Bomstein served as visiting
researcher at the University College of Swansea, the University of Parma, and the
Laboratory of Animal Behavior in Nouzilly, France. He was elected a fellow of the
American Psychological Association and the International Society for Research on
Aggression, and from 1988-92 he served on the editorial board of the Journal of
Comparative Psychology.
Among the wide range of courses Professor Bronstein taught were introductory
psychology, animal behavior, developmental and     experimental psychology,
neuropsychology, sociobiology, and psychopharmacology. His extensive University
service includes membership and leadership on the Academic Standards Committee, the
Scientific Equipment Committee, the Scholarship and Financial Aid Committee, and the
Research Advisory Committee, among others.
The Regents now salute this distinguished psychology educator for his dedicated
service by naming Paul M. Bronstein professor emeritus of psychology.
Memorials. Vice President Tedesco submitted a memorial statement for Eugene
H. Studier, professor of biology at the University of Michigan-Flint.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death on March 27, 2004, of Eugene H. Studier, professor of biology, College of
Arts and Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint.
Professor Studier was born in Dubuque, Iowa on March 16, 1940. He received his
B.S. degree in biology and chemistry in 1962 from the University of Dubuque and his
Ph.D. degree in zoology and biochemistry in 1965 from the University of Arizona. From
1965-72, he taught at New Mexico Highlands University, where he directed the thesis
work of 17 graduate students. Professor Studier joined the University of Michigan-Flint
faculty as an associate professor in 1972 and was promoted to professor in 1974.
Often referred to fondly as "Doc," Professor Studier was instrumental in developing
the biology curriculum during a period of major growth in the department. He served as
department chair from 1978-85 and from 1994-2000, and he was also the impetus in
creating the Master of Science in Biology degree program in 2000. Professor Studier
served as the director of the degree program and provided the motivating force for its
development. He also contributed his talents to fourteen departmental and university
committees. In recognition of his excellence in teaching, research, and service, Professor
Studier was awarded the David M. French Distinguished Professor Award, which is the
highest honor given to faculty by the University of Michigan-Flint.
Professor Studier's expertise in the study of bats earned him the nickname
"Batman." His research was widely known and focused on all aspects of bat biology.
During his 42 years of academic service he published more than 80 articles in refereed
journals and several book chapters, and he presented at numerous meetings and
conferences.
Professor Studier was dearly loved and respected by all of his students, colleagues,
and friends within the University. His untimely passing has left a cavernous hole in the
fabric of his department and the entire University, and he will be greatly missed. As we
mourn the loss of this great scholar, teacher, and advisor, our condolences go to his
wife, Ann; his children David, Scott, Robb and wife Carrie, and Hollie and husband
John Jacobs; and his grandchildren.

purpose.


247




April Meeting, 2004


On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved acquisition of the property in Barry County, Middleville,
Michigan, at a price of $262,364.
WVGR Radio Tower Project
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved the WVGR Radio Tower Project as described in the Regents
Communication and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding contracts,
providing that bids are within the approved budget.
Athletic Department Academic Center
Executive Vice President Slottow called on Associate Athletic Director Megan
McCallister, who described the intended programmatic uses for the Academic Center.
She noted that several University academic support programs would have satellite offices
in the Academic Center, including the Sweetland Writing Center, the Office of Career
Planning and Placement, and the math laboratory. Classroom space would be provided
for the Division of Kinesiology and for humanities classes and other disciplines as usage
patterns evolve.
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved issuing the Athletic Department Academic Center Project for
bids and awarding construction contracts, providing that bids are within the approved
budget.
Art and Architecture Building 1st and 2nd Floor Renovations
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved the Art and Architecture First and Second Floor Renovations
Project as described and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding construction
contracts, providing that bids are within the approved budget.
North Campus Diag Stormwater Control
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that this project is part of the storm
water management system approved by the Regents in May 2003, and it will expand the
underground piping collection system to collect and manage about 91 acres of storm water
run-off through the new detention basin. Associate Vice President Henry Baier displayed
a map illustrating the area covered by the project and showed the distribution system and
North Campus Chiller Project. Rather than address the storm water management needs
site-by-site, the University has chosen to address it in a more comprehensive fashion that
will allow for future needs as the number of buildings on North Campus increases. The
project is beneficial to the environment, as it provides for collection of sediment, prevents
erosion downstream, and increases the capacity of the overall system in that area. As
compared to individual chillers, this central approach is predicted to reduce costs by
approximately $900,000 in initial capital, and by 2010 there will be approximately
$400,000 in savings annually.
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved the North Campus Diag Stormwater Control Project as

unanimously approved the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Research Scanner Project as
described and authorized commissioning the architectural firm of Ann Arbor Architects
Collaborative for its design and issuing the project for bids and awarding construction

University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) Depression
Center and Ambulatory Psychiatry (Building naming)
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Maynard, and in recognition
of a generous gift from Mr. and Mrs. Edwin E. Meader, the Regents unanimously
approved naming the facility that will house the new Depression Center the Rachel
Upjohn Building.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) Depression
Center and Ambulatory Psychiatry (Schematic Design)
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the originally proposed budget had
been increased from $38 million to $41 million to allow for the addition of 6,000 gross
square feet to the facility. The budget includes $5.5 million for site infrastructure
improvements, which will be used for preservation of the wetland and preservation of a
ridge on the site to allow for future development. The University will replace the existing
sewage system with a gravity system and will work with the county and township to move
the access road. Additional parking spaces are included in the project, and bioswales will
be created within the parking system to aid in the collection of storm water runoff. These
site infrastructure improvements will benefit current and future projects.
Associate Vice President Baier introduced Scott Haywood of Albert Kahn and
Associates to present the schematic design.  Executive Vice President Slottow
recognized that Dr. John Greden, chair of the Department of Psychiatry, who had been
leading fundraising, design, and programming for this project, was present to respond to
questions.
Mr. Haywood commented that the building was envisioned as representing the
antithesis of depression and will be filled with light, an opposite image for what one
might associate with depression. He displayed renderings of the building and noted that
it would have an open and inviting feel and would create a healing environment. The
building was envisioned as one that would reflect the architecture on the existing
campus, that would be responsive to the natural setting, and that would express the
unique purpose of the facility.
He then displayed and described the floor plans for the building and noted that the
first floor would contain the clinic spaces and the second floor would include the
research components. An auditorium and conference center will be located in the
garden level.

April Meeting, 2004


On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents

APRIL MEETING, 2004
APPENDIX
Future Directions: Shaping the Michigan Difference
President Mary Sue Coleman
April 22, 2004
Good afternoon.
I want to welcome the deans, faculty members, staff, and students who have joined
us. Today, I am looking forward to introducing several aspirations and initiatives for
the future direction of our University.
Every university president encounters the need to balance an ongoing agenda with
new priorities that, combined, will shape the future of the institution. In my two
presidencies, I have learned that sometimes the issues choose the president, but at other
times, the president can choose the issues she wants to advance.
When I arrived on campus twenty months ago, we faced some monumental events
that affected not only the University, but the entire nation.
Last year, we dealt with opportunities and challenges that many universities do
not encounter within a single decade, or sometimes, ever.
I have watched the great monuments of our architecture come back to life this
semester, with the reopening of Hill Auditorium and the Rackham Building. We have
launched the ambitious Life Sciences Institute. We overcame the investigation into our
former basketball program with the triumph of the championship at the National
Invitation Tournament. And, we had the great privilege of learning how it feels to win
landmark decisions at the Supreme Court of the United States.
I could not have led this University successfully through the critical final stages of
those achievements without the help of many of you in this room, and I thank you for
your wisdom and your support throughout these months, which have been so
memorable for me and historic for the University.
But now it is time to move forward.
I want to ask our campus community to work with me to focus on the future of the
University. It is now my opportunity to turn our energy to the agenda that we choose as
leaders of this great institution. I will ask our campuses to devote much of the next
academic year to developing the initial blueprint I am sharing with you today.
There are two reasons it is critical to begin this process now.
The first is the budget situation we have been facing. We know how serious the
continued loss of state funding has been, and we established the protection of our core
academic activities as our guiding principle, so that we will emerge with our excellence
intact and even strengthened.
Budgetary constraints do not callfor timid measures, butfor wise action.


253




April Meeting, 2004 - Index


On a second front, we will continue to pursue a host of long-range ambitions as
we launch the public phase of our comprehensive capital campaign next month.
Private giving will animate our vision and goals, in every campus unit and collectively
for the institution.
We will focus on the difference our University will make in the future - as it has
made for almost two centuries - both on the lives of our students and in the world
beyond our campuses. Appropriately, we will title the campaign "The Michigan
Difference."
In conjunction with this campaign, and the future it will help us realize, we are
shaping the guiding direction for the University that will deepen impact of the Michigan
Difference in the next decades and beyond.
Today, I will outline several aspirations and initiatives I am presenting to our
campuses to explore and develop. These ideas have evolved as I have immersed myself
in the extraordinary life of our University.
I am confident that you share my commitment to a rededicated effort to sustain
and elevate the character that makes this institution unique.
Our Aspirations - Defining the Great Public University of the Knowledge Age
Our university, of course, does not operate in isolation, but within a network of
other prestigious research universities, a state that supports us, and a world that
depends on our graduates and our discoveries.
We live in a world characterized by a whirlwind of dynamic change.
We are confronted with a ubiquitous and overwhelming rush of information.
The new economy has shifted the emphasis from manufacturing to knowledge.
Our new global society - social, political, economic and cultural - compels us to
recognize a teeming variety of values and perspectives.
Technology continues to fulfill its astonishing promise - yet becomes increasingly
more challenging.
Our environment is imperiled whenever society avoids accepting responsibility for
global sustainability.
And in the middle of this complexity, we seem to be losing our ethical compass as
we attempt to navigate the swirling rapids of these issues.
Because of these shifts in the social and technological landscape, the frontiers of
knowledge are expanding dramatically. Exciting new spheres of thought are emerging
and new forms of intellectual engagement are made possible by the connectivity of
information technology.
The single laboratory and the solitary scholar are often supplemented by
collaborative endeavors. Academic discoveries will emerge from the intersection of our
disciplines and will be more intertwined with the world we inhabit and serve.


254




April Meeting, 2004 - Index


These are groundbreaking and often breathtaking challenges. The truly great
university of tomorrow will meet them head-on.
It will mobilize its resources to address the constantly changing needs of society -
and to push the boundaries of our understanding. The great strengths of the University
of Michigan prepare it especially well to enhance its academic leadership and to
engage its public mission even more profoundly over the next century.
This University is characterized by world-class programs across a broad range of
disciplines. Our academic reputation blazes across the globe - and even beyond, with
our alumni who have traveled to the Moon.
Dean Robert Dolan described this campus perfectly when he said that we have
nineteen schools and colleges at the top of their game.
In addition to the expertise that has created such outstanding academic units, I
believe our multi-disciplinary approach to scholarship is one of our most distinctive
hallmarks - we possess an academic culture that breaks through traditional
boundaries.
My goal is this:
The University of Michigan will continue to define the great public university of
the world. We will move Michigan to a new level of excellence by building on its
distinctive academic strengths while recognizing new areas of opportunity and societal
need.
We will expand the collaborative innovation that is our signature in a way that
reaches across traditional disciplines, into the classroom, and out into the world
around us.
I want to articulate a set of aspirations that will guide our future work. These are
shaped in part by our past and highlight the promise and commitment of our future.
I will use these guideposts in making decisions and determining the direction of
my administration in every area, from the continued development of our campus master
plan to the creation of special new initiatives.
I will ask each of our units, schools and colleges to use these principles to inform
theirfuture choices as well.
First: We will sustain academic excellence.
Above all else, we are committed to advancing the work and values of a brilliant
academic community. Academic excellence is never negotiable, even when we are
faced with short-term budgetary pressures.
In previous years, our commitment might have been an unspoken compact, but
today, we are dealing with external pressures that require us to assert, with determined
insistence, our pledge to maintain the highest level of academic quality.
We are a university that expects and demands bold intellectual engagement. We
will continue to recruit and retain the very bestfaculty and students.


255




April Meeting, 2004 - Index


And we must maintain the distinctive strength of our extraordinary staff who
provide the highly skilled effort that keeps our intellectual and physical infrastructure
so robust. We will never compromise on excellence.
Next: We will foster active engagement.
Tomorrow's great university certainly will not be an ivory tower. We must be
committed to translating our ideas into communication and action, with each other and
with the larger world -- challenging ourselves to address the vexing issues that our
global and local communities confront. We are called to support our society 's hopes,
development, and enrichment.
Whether we look at our work to develop a nationally prominent Depression Center
or our partnership with the state's life sciences initiatives, we will focus on addressing
societal needs and sparking a greater level of connectivity - inside and outside the
academy.
There are many areas our community can explore as we strive to become a more
actively engaged university. Here are a few examples:
* We must develop the infrastructure - technological and physical - to support
allforms of academic engagement by our faculty and students.
*  We have the opportunity to contribute in new and significant ways to economic
development. I have been speaking to business organizations on this issue,
and we must respond to their eagerness for increased interaction between our
academic units and regional leaders in business and industry.
"* I will ask our University how we might more effectively coordinate the
missions of Ann Arbor, Flint, and Dearborn through a three-campus strategy,
each with its own balance of regional engagement, while contributing to the
institution overall.
"* Also, we can expand our current international involvement in areas such
faculty leadership on global issues, study abroad programs, and on-campus
educational opportunities.
Third: We will build collaborative learning communities.
As we deal with multifaceted social problems, we find they often do not fit into the
discrete disciplines of academia.
In addition, we must prepare young people for the problem-solving, team-based
environment that they will encounter not only in the workplace, but as informed and
entrepreneurial citizens in a diverse democracy.


256




April Meeting, 2004 - Index


President Angell famously described the University of Michigan as providing an
"uncommon education."
I believe that the uncommon education we create in the information age must be
built upon interdisciplinary scholarship and team-based learning opportunities that are
supported with digital tools.
Across our teaching and research endeavors, we have a tremendous opportunity
to deploy our intellectual capital in new ways.
Here are a few of the areas I will ask our campus to explore as we consider how to
build more collaborative learning communities and encourage an even greater level of
scholarship across traditional boundaries:
* Although we have such a tremendous strength in interdisciplinary and
collaborative research, we have not done what we should to bring these
powerful approaches into our classrooms.   It is exciting to imagine
interdisciplinary teaching on a large scale, and Michigan is the place to do it.
* As we develop plans for residence hall renewal, how can we improve the
residential life experience so that ourfuture investments support the concept of
collaborative living and learning environments in a digital age? In order to
continue attracting the best and brightest students, we must have residence
hall renewal. But our decisions about design must go far beyond "wired"
versus "wireless" connectivity. Rather, our plans should address innovative
ways learning can occur and how a student community can best be supported.
* As you know, I believe that our next steps to enhance the life sciences at
Michigan will include expanding our approach and inviting dynamic new
collaborations. There is wide campus enthusiasm for joining the life sciences
more seamlessly to the other natural sciences, engineering, social sciences,
humanities, and the arts. In addition, we want to investigate opportunities that
might be possible by adding neuroscience as a new pillar of the life sciences at
the University.
As we aspire to sustain continued academic excellence, foster more active
engagement, and build collaborative learning communities - there is one more
fundamental commitment we must make if the University of Michigan will define the
great public university of the future:
We will create greater access to Michigan 's academic quality.
We must ensure access to the vast intellectual opportunity and knowledge this
great public university generates for the sake of the societies we serve, and for the
intellectual ecosystem that provides our academic distinction. A public university has
little value for our society if its resources are not accessible.
This will mean asking ourselves some tough questions.
* We need to know if there are financial barriers that place a Michigan
education out of reach for some academically qualified students, and how we
can lower those barriers. This discussion must include a significant study of


257




April Meeting, 2004 - Index


our financial aid programs - along with an emphasis on scholarship support
as a centerpiece of the upcoming capital campaign.
*  We personified the commitment to the principle of diversity in higher
education as we defended our use of affirmative action. Now we have to turn
inward to enhance our efforts in recruiting and retaining a campus community
- students, faculty, and staff - that reflects the full diversity of our nation, and
creates a campus that is truly and completely supportive of that diversity. We
are not there yet.
* As we consider ways to improve access to the University and its resources, I
want to develop ideas that will make the figurative concrete wall around our
academic community more permeable - too often, the public senses that our
walls are rock solid and impenetrable. For instance, I will encourage new
kinds of public arts programs, building on the successful model of the Royal
Shakespeare Company residencies, and I want to find new ways to provide the
business community with access to our many resources.
At our University, an infinite set of possibilities for research and learning will
emerge as we apply our ingenuity to these aspirations.
Presidential Initiatives
In addition to the ideas I will outline next, our Flint and Dearborn campuses will
pursue initiatives appropriate to their own agendas, led by Chancellors Juan Mestas
and Daniel Little.
I intend to engage the campus community broadly throughout the next year to
develop promising ideas, using these guideposts of sustained academic excellence,
active engagement, collaborative learning, and accessibility as a framework.
As a first step, I am introducing four presidential initiatives I will ask this campus
to pursue immediately. These ideas represent opportunities for our great public
university of the world to take on both societal and university challenges that reflect the
aspirations I have related today. These are not the only priorities the University will
explore, but the president's office has the opportunity to identify special programs that
complement the work happening across campus in the schools and colleges as we
sustain our excellence and deepen the Michigan Difference.
First, I want to: Support the development of multi-disciplinary paired courses
and other team-teaching initiatives across departments and colleges.
We will expand the effort to bring our interdisciplinary culture to the classroom
and to our research enterprise. To foster team-teaching, the Provost's office will
establish funds for sustained team-teaching efforts. Pairing together faculty from
divergent disciplines to design courses is an important way to engage our students in
the fresh ideas that are emerging from intersections of scholarly fields.
Our students will learn that each discipline is given to specific formulations of
issues that provide great insight - but that sometimes the deep focus of a discipline does
not always offer the broad insight that can emerge when viewed within the context of


258




April Meeting, 2004 - Index


other fields. Disciplines help us both to see and not to see; interdisciplinary teams help
us to see more widely.
The next two initiatives will carry into action our commitment to actively engage
our best minds in the significant social issues of the day. So, I will ask our campus to:
Explore the creation of a center for the study of ethical issues in the public domain.
In the past few years we have observed an almost cataclysmic decline in ethical
behavior in public life, ranging from corporate malfeasance to egregious acts in
college sports. I will ask a cross-disciplinary team offaculty members to assess faculty
interest and scholarly expertise regarding the examination of ethical issues facing
business, public policy-makers, cultural institutions, the sciences, and the media.
I want to know if we can build important and fresh research opportunities,
curriculum, and public engagement around issues of ethics in the public domain.
Next, we will take on another major social concern as we: Create a University of
Michigan prototype for new approaches to rational and affordable health care.
We enjoy a singular position of having a hospital, health care providers, an
insurance company, and health policy experts. With appropriate joint incentives, we
have the means to mount a broad, collaborative effort to fashion a prototype program,
testing the assumption that it is feasible to promote healthy living, contain health care
expenditures, and define optimal insurance coverage for individuals and families.
We can use those intellectual resources to help the nation in addressing the
growing crisis in health care. There are few current issues on which the University of
Michigan is better positioned to engage public discourse and provide national
leadership.
Also, we must: Renovate, reconnect, and expand residential life on campus,
Comprehensive planning is underway to expand and improve the residential
experience for students. This is an exciting opportunity to build collaborative and
innovative spaces that will employ technology, create better environments for student
living, and promote close connection between academic and residential life. We know
that the physical environment is a critical element that supports the academic
community and its excellence.
We have been engaged with groups of students, faculty, and administrators as we
consider our residential life options, and preliminary plans will be brought to the board
for thorough review and discussion in the fall term. Ongoing student involvement will
be very important as these plans unfold.
Conclusion
Today, I have shared a broad overview of our future direction. I am excited by its
promise, but it is just the first step. We face significant dilemmas in the short term. The
continuing state budget crisis, the troubling national trend of a 30-year erosion of state
support, and a highly competitive recruiting environment for the best faculty, staff and
students provide real challenges.


259




April Meeting, 2004 - Index


We will need to plan wisely as we prioritize our activities.
But a sound framework for future development will help our university with that
task as it crystallizes priorities and opportunities.
We will work together on how best to make these future aspirations reality.
Certainly, our alumni, friends, and donors want to be part of our success. I will askfor
their support for all the priorities identified by our schools and colleges for the capital
campaign.
Our donors will provide critical funding for student scholarships, for faculty
fellowships and chairs, for new and expanded programs, andfor the next generation of
facilities that will enhance our academic endeavors.
Support for the presidential initiatives will include funds donated to the
president's office for strategic uses along with other sources such as research grants.
And in the case of residence hall renewal, we will bring a funding plan to the Board of
Regents for consideration.
Today 's presentation is the first step into our future. I have laid out general
directions we can pursue - but we have a great deal of work to do as a campus.
I will appoint faculty, staff and students to cross-campus teams to explore all of
these ideas and others that will emerge in the next academic year. In addition, we will
encourage broad campus discussion of all these areas throughout the year. And we will
introduce a Website that will track our activities as we move ahead.
As I told you at the outset, sometimes issues choose a president, and sometimes a
president can choose her own issues. Every university must be ready to deal with
unexpected challenges, but today, I am setting this University on a course that will
sustain our tradition of being "leaders and best."
Thankyou.

MAY MEETING, 2004


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thurisday, May 20, 2004
The Regents convened at 1:30 p.m. in the Music Room, Henry Ford Estate - Fair
Lane, on the campus of the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Provost Courant, Vice President Harper,
Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President Slottow, Vice President
and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Vice
President Rudgers was absent.
President Coleman called the meeting to order.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from David Boyle, alumnus, on various University
topics; and Peter Soppelsa and Jennifer Anderson, students and members of Our Voices
Count, on proposed changes to SAPAC. Public comment was continued at the end of the
meeting due to the late arrival of the speaker.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman commented on the recent events marking the kickoff of the
"Michigan Difference" capital campaign and the launching of the Life Sciences Institute.
She also reported on recent accolades received by faculty members and on an upcoming
event on the Dearborn campus.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Health Psychology Program
Chancellor Little introduced Professor Richard Straub, associate professor of
psychology, who had been asked to describe his work in the area of health psychology
and outreach to the health care community in southeast Michigan. He noted that this is
one example among many activities on the Dearborn campus where the intellectual capital
of the campus is being brought to bear on pressing societal problems.
Professor Straub gave a presentation describing the nature and evolution of the
graduate program in health psychology, discussing the campus's emerging role as a
center for medical education and as a site for focusing the health care debate, and
describing some of the research partnerships being developed with local teaching
hospitals and medical residency programs.
2004-05 General Fund Budget Update
Provost Courant summarized the current status of development of the 2004-05
General Fund Budget. He noted that the University will have experienced a base budget
reduction of almost $43 million since the beginning of fiscal year 2003-04, with
additional one-time cuts of $29.1 million. In response to this total budget challenge of
261




$81.8 million, the 2003-04 budget had included expenditure reductions of $36.9 million
and revenue increases of $44.9 million. Expenditure reductions included elimination of
275 regular staff positions and 50 faculty positions, along with other reductions in a
variety of areas. Reductions were also achieved through operating efficiencies in business
processes, energy conservation, and other business and financial operations.
For 2004-05, the governor has recommended a 2% reduction in state
appropriation. This, combined with cost increases for continuing operations and other
commitments and essential initiatives, totals $50 million in additional budget challenges
that will have to be met. Some areas, however, will require additional expenditures,
such as the Admissions Office and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
which will require providing additional class sections to meet the demand. There are
also increased costs associated with compliance with government regulations in the
research enterprise. Provost Courant reported that $20 million in additional base
reductions in General Fund expenditures are being identified, including 120 regular
staff positions, 40 faculty positions, and other personnel cutbacks. Other examples of
expenditure reductions include elimination of the Office of Information Technology
Campus Initiatives and the Periodic Health Appraisal Unit and reduction of overtime
and shift differentials. There will be fewer course sections offered and selective
increases in class size, and the University Library will purchase fewer journal
subscriptions and monographs and will reduce service hours.
Provost Courant observed that historically, philanthropy has been essential to the
University's achieving and maintaining its status as one of the great public universities.
However, philanthropy cannot be expected to cover the essential activities of teaching
and learning and the essential infrastructure of classrooms, computers, wiring, and
wireless networks that are needed for the best quality of undergraduate education. Thus,
maintaining excellence requires both robust philanthropy and robust support from the
state. The goals for the Michigan Difference capital campaign were developed with
both in mind.
Regent Newman inquired about the impact on the budget of previously announced
changes in the staff benefits program and planned reductions in funding for student
services. Provost Courant responded that the benefits changes have been incorporated
into the cuts for the current fiscal year and the coming fiscal year. Although benefits
costs will increase in 2004-05, the previously enacted changes are resulting in savings
of $3 million over what would otherwise would have been spent.
Regarding possible cuts in the student affairs budget, Provost Courant stated that
no final decisions have yet been made in this area. The final budget will adhere to the
operating principle of minimizing the impact on students.  It was noted that the
concerns that recently have been expressed by students relate not to the current fiscal
year, but to anticipated cuts in the Division of Student Affairs that may be enacted for
2004-05. President Coleman emphasized that the magnitude of the budget cuts is such
that almost every unit is being affected in some way. Contractual obligations and
financial aid are the only two areas being held harmless.
Vice President Wilbanks commented that the University is hopeful that the state
will be able to meet its previously stated goals with respect to the University's budget,
but the situation is evolving and will need to be monitored closely.


262




Annual Promotions to the Ranks of Professor and Associate Professor
Provost Courant described the annual promotions review process. He reviewed the
dossiers of four faculty members as representative of the depth and range of promotion
recommendations: Mercedes Pascual, recommended for promotion to associate professor
of ecology and evolutionary biology, with tenure, in the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts; William V. Giannobile, recommended for promotion to professor of
dentistry, with tenure, in the School of Dentistry; Martin A. Philbert, recommended for
promotion to professor of toxicology, with tenure, in the School of Public Health; and
Carol B. Bardenstein, recommended for promotion to associate professor of Arabic
languages and cultures, with tenure, in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
Executive Vice President Kelch commented on extraordinary accomplishments of
faculty in the Medical School and highlighted the promotion recommendations for Dr.
John Park as associate professor of urology, with tenure, and Dr. Karin M. Muraszko as
professor of neurosurgery, with tenure; professor of surgery, without tenure; and
professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases, without tenure.
Chancellor Little noted that the promotions process is the most important element
in improving the quality of the Dearborn campus. He highlighted the promotion
recommendations for Georgina Hickey as associate professor of history, with tenure,
and Pravansu S. Mohanty as associate professor of mechanical engineering, with tenure.
Chancellor Mestas reported that the Flint campus has recommended 11 candidates
for promotion. He highlighted the recommendations of Marva J. Furman for promotion
to professor of English with tenure; Steven F. Myers for promotion to professor of
biology with tenure; Steven M. Ralston for promotion to professor of communication
with tenure; and Kirk Aamot for promotion to associate professor of music with tenure.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning. Members received a regular bimonthly update on audit
activities from Fred White, interim director of University audits, and discussed the FY 05
internal audit plan. He stated that the committee had met privately with Mr. White to
inquire as to the level of cooperation he was receiving from University units and
management, and the committee was pleased by his response that there was a very
receptive environment to the department's internal audit activities.
The committee also was updated on development of the 2004-05 General Fund
budget   and  received  an   analysis  by  University  staff  members  and

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted 20 faculty retirement
memoirs. Provost Courant called attention to the retirements of Richard Crawford,
professor in the School of Music, and Reynolds Farley, professor of sociology.
Richard L. Allen, Ph.D., professor of communication studies in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Originally from Philadelphia, Professor Allen received his B.A. degree from
Cheyney State College in 1970, his M.A. degree from the University of Washington in
1972, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1975. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1980 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1986 and professor in 2000.
During his tenure, Professor Allen researched numerous issues, including
structural and individual influences on the self during difficult times, identity across
ethnicity, the measurement of self, theoretical approaches to the self, the mass media
and self-esteem, intercultural communication, blacks and media, persuasion, and
propaganda analysis. He also completed a comparative analysis of the African self in
the U.S. and in Ghana, and he spent the 1997-98 academic year on a Fulbright
scholarship in Ghana researching media and democratization in Africa. He is the author
of The Concept of Self: A Study in Black Identity and Self-Esteem and has written
several articles on African Americans and the media.
Professor Allen has received numerous awards throughout his academic career,
including a "Teaching Honor Roll" award from ADVICE, a student-run publication, in
1995, the Fulbright Senior Scholar Award in 1997, and a Faculty Recognition Award in
1997. He served on the Office of Minority Affairs Advisory Committee from
1992-2003, the college's Academic Judiciary Committee from 1999-03, and the
Campus Committee for the IIE Fulbright Program from 1999-2003. He has been a
faculty counselor and was a recruiter for the Rackham School of Graduate Studies from
1998-2003. Professor Allen served on the editorial boards of the Howard Journal of
Communication (1991-present) and the Journal of Gerontology (1995-98).
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Richard L. Allen
professor emeritus of communication studies.
Terry J. Bergstrom, M.D., professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences in the
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on April 30, 2004.
Dr. Bergstrom received his B.S. degree from Michigan State University in 1955
and his M.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1965. After completing his
residency at the University of Michigan in 1969, he joined the U.S. Air Force as a staff
ophthalmologist, serving also as director of the residency training program at the medical
center on Lackland AFB (1977-80), and on the faculty at The University of Texas Health
Science Center in San Antonio and the Brooke Army Medical Center. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1980 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1986 and professor in 1994.
Dr. Bergstrom is a skilled physician and outstanding teacher. He has served as
chief of the glaucoma service, chief of the low vision service, and chief of the
comprehensive ophthalmology service. He was director of the department's residency
program from 1991-98 and headed the ophthalmology department at the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center from 1985-95. He lectured nationally on a variety of topics,


282




published numerous articles on the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma, and
participated in national clinical trials.
Teaching is Dr. Bergstrom's legacy. Over the past 24 years he has won 19
teaching awards. His trainees--medical students, residents, and fellows--learned more
from Dr. Bergstrom than the basics of diagnosis, management, and technique; they
learned an attitude and an approach for treating patients, colleagues, and the people they
work with every day.   Throughout his long career, Dr. Bergstrom  consistently
exemplified the attributes that are most revered by the Medical School and the Health
System: fine clinical judgment, an unswerving commitment to his patients, and careful
training of his students.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Terry J.
Bergstrom professor emeritus of ophthalmology and visual sciences.
Morton Brown, Ph.D., professor of mathematics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Brown received his B.S. (1953), M.S. (1955), and Ph.D. (1958) degrees
from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He taught at The Ohio State University in
1957-58 and had a fellowship at the University of Michigan in 1958-59. Professor
Brown joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1959 and
was promoted to professor in 1964.
Early in his career, Professor Brown was a recognized expert in topology. Later,
he became interested in dynamical systems on 2-dimensional manifolds and helped
develop an understandable and acceptable proof of a controversial, fixed-point theorem
conjectured by Poincare and Birkhoff. He has presented papers and lectures on
topology, high dimensional topology, and dynamical systems at universities and
institutes throughout the world.
Within the department, in the late 1980s Professor Brown began implementing the
first major revision of the undergraduate calculus program in nearly 20 years. He
initiated cooperative learning in calculus classes, fitted classrooms with new
technology, implemented a specialized training program for instructors, and oversaw
the adoption of a reform textbook. These reforms served as a model for the national
calculus reform movement, and he was active on numerous national and state calculus
reform committees.
Professor Brown served as associate chair for education, chair of the Doctoral
Committee, and director of the elementary program in the Department of Mathematics
and served on many University-wide committees. His honors include a Sloan
Foundation Fellowship (1964), the Veblen Prize from the American Mathematical
Society (1966), and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts Excellence in
Teaching Award (1992 and 1993). He was named a Thurnau Professor in 1994.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Morton Brown

Texas at Austin from 1967-73 and associate professor of civil and architectural


283




engineering at the University of Colorado from 1973-78. Professor Carr joined the
University of Michigan faculty as a professor in 1978.
Professor Carr's research focused on construction management and on building
and transportation technology. During his tenure, he supervised 13 Ph.D. thesis students
and authored over 100 publications. From 1983-2003, he was director of the Center for
Construction and Engineering Management. In 1985 Professor Carr received the
College of Engineering's Excellence in Teaching Award, and in 1993 he received the
Excellence in Faculty Service Award.    His University service also included
participation on numerous departmental and university-wide committees.
A life member and fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Professor
Carr served on the society's Advisory Committee for Civil Engineering Education and
was vice chair and chair of the executive committee of the Construction Division. He is
a founder and member of the Construction Innovation Forum (CIF) and the
Construction Institute, and he helped develop the CIF's NOVA Awards. He was
honored with the Peurifoy Construction Research Award from the American Society of
Civil Engineers in 1996 and the Nova Award Statue from the CIF in 2003.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Robert I. Carr professor
emeritus of civil engineering.
Mark A. Chesler, Ph.D., professor of sociology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Chesler earned his B.A. degree from Comell University in 1957, his

of Michigan in 1966. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
professor in 1967 and was promoted to associate professor in 1971 and professor in
1984.
Professor Chesler has made significant contributions to the understanding of
power, conflict, inequality, and coping. His work includes critiques of American
pedagogy, pioneering explorations into the psycho-social dynamics of medical self-help
groups for ailing patients, and reflections on the state of contemporary race and gender
relations. His writings in over 200 publications have served as a paradigm of
scholarship that seeks to harness the pursuit of scientific knowledge to solve pressing
social problems. An astute observer and student of organizational processes, he is a
consultant for groups seeking more effective ways of managing organizational conflict.
He also pursued those interests as co-director of the Program in Conflict Management
Alternatives and by participating in the Program on Intergroup Relations.
Like his research, Professor Chesler's teaching aims to educate, empower, and
transform the world. His vision of the classroom as a site for critical inquiry and
self-discovery and his commitment to learning as process has provided his students with
a rich and supportive environment. For over 35 years, he led Project Community,
which places undergraduates in applied social service settings in the community,
providing educational and service opportunities. Professor Chesler's honors include the
Amoco Foundation Good Teaching Award, an Arthur Thumau Professorship, a
Community Service Learning Award for Outstanding Public Service, an Excellence in
Education Award, the Harold Johnson Multicultural Service Award, and the Ernest
Lynton Award for Faculty Professional Service and Outreach.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Mark A. Chesler

William Billings and has written articles on Gershwin, Edward MacDowell, popular
songs of the 19th and 20th centuries, black music, and jazz. With a colleague, he
compiled Jazz Standards on Record: A Core Repertory. He is the author of The
American Musical Landscape and 100 Years of Music at Michigan, wrote numerous
articles for The New Grove Dictionary of Music, and is currently editor-in-chief of
Music of the United States of America. He served as the Ernest Bloch Professor of
Music at the University of California-Berkeley (1985), has been president of the
American Musicological Society (1982-84), and was elected to the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences in 1995.
Professor Crawford received the American Musicological Society's Otto Kinkeldey
Award for William Billings ofBoston, the Sonneck Society's Irving Lowens Award for The
Core Repertory of Early American Psalmody, and the Music Library Association's
Vincent Duckles Award for his work on Early American Sacred Music Imprints,
1698-1810. For his book, America's Musical Life: A History, published in 2001, he

W. Reynolds Farley, Ph.D., professor of sociology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, and research professor in the Institute for Social Research, will
retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Farley earned his A.B. degree (1960) from the University of Notre Dame
and his M.A. (1963) and Ph.D. (1964) degrees from the University of Chicago. From
1964-67 he was an assistant professor at Duke University. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1967 and was promoted to associate
professor in 1969 and professor in 1976. He was appointed research scientist (currently
research professor) in 1979, and was honored with the Otis Dudley Duncan Collegiate
Professorship of Sociology in 1995.
Professor Farley's pioneering research on American race and ethnic relations
established him as one of the top sociologists and social demographers in the country,
and his studies of residential segregation profoundly impacted academic and social
policy circles. Professor Farley's research consistently sets the standards for empirical
accuracy, methodological rigor, and theoretical precision, and he speaks in a
dispassionate yet sympathetic voice that makes his work stand out. He has received
numerous awards, including the Sidney Spivak Fellowship for significant contributions
to intergroup relations, two book awards from the American Sociological Association,


285




and fellowships at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American
Statistical Association. He also served as president of the Population Association of
America.
A highly effective and popular teacher, Professor Farley offered a wide range of
courses to generations of appreciative students, many of whom have built distinguished
careers of their own. Students line up each term to enroll in his mini-course on Detroit,
which is based on his long-standing interest in the city.  Professor Farley was
department chair from 1973-74 and from 1978-81, and was associate director of the
Population Studies Center from 1970-79.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming W. Reynolds Farley
professor emeritus of sociology and research professor emeritus.
Paul G. Federbush, Ph.D., professor of mathematics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Federbush received his B.S. degree (1955) from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and his M.A. (1958) and Ph.D. (1958) degrees from Princeton
University. From 1958-66 he was on the faculty at M.I.T. Professor Federbush joined
the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1966 and was promoted to associate
professor in 1967 and professor in 1971.
A mathematical physicist, Professor Federbush studied the part of field theory that
could be put on a firm mathematical foundation, and the applications of field theoretic
ideas to other areas of mathematics. In 1969, he wrote an influential paper that was an
infinitesimal version of Nelson's hypercontractive inequality in field theory. The
Federbush inequality later became known as the logarithmic Sobolev inequality and is
widely used in the theory of partial differential equations. Another paper, published in
1975, focused on the stability of matter and developed a new proof of a classic result of
Dyson and Lenard that a large neutral system of electrons and nuclei does not collapse.
His approach demonstrated that the technique of phase space localization is central to
the proof. His most impressive result was the proof of "Debye" screening: in a charged,
neutral gas the effects of the long-range electromagnetic interactions are screened out
(1981). More recently, he developed a set of orthogonal phase space localized
functions known as "wavelets," which are divergence free, and applied these wavelets
to the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics.
Professor Federbush taught a wide range of courses in applied mathematics,
mentored eleven doctoral students, and helped develop computer lab materials used
today in the introductory differential equations course. He received a Sloan Foundation
Fellowship in 1965 and a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship in 1975, and
he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Paul G. Federbush
professor emeritus of mathematics.
Ronald Gibala, Ph.D., L. H. and F. E. VanVlack Professor of Materials Science
and Engineering and professor of materials and metallurgical engineering and materials
science and engineering in the College of Engineering, will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 2004.
A native of New Castle, Pennsylvania, Professor Gibala received his B.S. degree
from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1960 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1962 and 1964, respectively.
He served as a faculty member at Case Western Reserve University from 1964-84, a
286




visiting researcher at the Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires de Grenoble from 1973-74, and
the director of the metallurgy program at the National Science Foundation from
1982-83. Professor Gibala joined the University of Michigan in 1984 as professor of
materials and metallurgical engineering and chair of the Department of Materials
Science and Engineering; he held an additional appointment as professor of
macromolecular science and engineering from 1992-01.
Recognized as one of the world's leading materials scientists, Professor Gibala has
published nearly 200 research papers on internal friction, mechanical properties of
refractory metals and intermetallics, defects in crystals, hydrogen embrittlement, and
polymers and semiconductor heterostructures. An outstanding leader in his field, he has
served as president of the Materials Research Society. Professor Gibala also has a
reputation for being among the most effective and inspiring teachers and administrators
in the College of Engineering. In his ten years as department chair, he built the
materials science and engineering program into one of the top programs in the country.
More recently, he served on the College of Engineering Executive Committee and as
director of the Electron Microbeam Analysis Laboratory.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and scientist for his dedicated
service by naming Ronald Gibala the L. H. and F. E. VanVlack Professor Emeritus of
Materials Science and Engineering and professor emeritus of materials and
metallurgical engineering and materials science and engineering.
Dennis J. Hegyi, Ph.D., professor of physics in the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Hegyi earned his B.S. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1963 and his Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1968. He held a
National Academy of Sciences Fellowship at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies
from 1968-70, and he was an assistant professor at Boston University from 1970-73 and
at the Bartol Research Foundation from 1973-75. Professor Hegyi joined the University
of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1975 and was promoted to associate
professor in 1978 and professor in 1986.
Professor Hegyi's scholarship is characterized by its broad reach and enormous
ambition. He engaged the most fundamental questions of cosmology, which ranged
from a measurement of the primordial helium abundance to theoretical studies of the
properties of dark matter. Early in his career, he studied microwaves to show how
cosmic background radiation affected the rotational temperature of molecules in space,
and he was among the first to search for anisotropies in that radiation. His later work
on optical measurements that detected halos surrounding galaxies were among the
earliest observational steps in the still-continuing search for dark matter. Professor
Hegyi's vigorous theoretical analyses of the halos showed that they could not consist of
baryons and helped him to rule out an entire series of conjectures proposed by others.
Concurrently, he was performing theoretical work on the structure of neutron stars and
helped develop one of the very first successful charge-coupled image detectors for use
on a telescope. The detectors are a standard in today's astronomy.  He is currently
involved in an ongoing project to unify the special theory of relativity with a rational
concept of causality.
In addition to his extensive research work, Professor Hegyi developed several
small group tutorials for introductory physics courses, and he provided educational
direction for a research group of Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows.


287




The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Dennis J. Hegyi
professor emeritus of physics.
Bruce H. Karnopp, Ph.D., associate professor of mechanical engineering in the
College of Engineering, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Kamopp received his S.B. degree from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1960, his Sc.M. degree from Brown University in 1963, and his Ph.D.
degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1965. He was an assistant professor at the
University of Toronto from 1965-68. Professor Kamopp joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1968 and was promoted to associate
professor in 1973.
Professor Kamopp's reputation as an instructor in dynamics is legendary, and his
teaching has impacted the professional lives of over 15,000 students during the last 36
years. Generations of students know Professor Kamopp as the "best instructor I've ever
had at this University." In recognition of his success as a teacher, he has received the
Amoco Foundation Faculty Teaching Award, the Arthur F. Thumau Professorship, the
College of Engineering Teaching Excellence Award, and the Michigan Association of
Governing Boards of State Universities Distinguished Faculty Award. He was also
selected as "Professor of the Term" six times by the University of Michigan Chapter of
Pi Tau Sigma.
As an assistant dean for the College of Engineering from 1984-89, Professor
Kamopp initiated recruiting programs for underrepresented minorities and out-of-state
students, and coordinated a project to improve access to the University for students in
rural areas of Michigan. From 1987-96, Professor Kamopp served on the University's
Admissions Advisory Committee; as chair of that committee, he helped develop the
mission statement that so clearly confirms the University's long-standing commitment
to diversity. He participated in the College's Summer Engineering Academy, preparing
new students for success at the University, and during his 13 years of service in the
College of Engineering Orientation Program, he was often the first face seen by the
entering class of students and their parents.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Bruce H. Kamopp
associate professor emeritus of mechanical engineering.
Raymond C. Kelly, Ph.D., professor of anthropology in the College of Literature,
Science and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Kelly earned his B.A. degree from the University of Chicago in 1965
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1966 and 1974,
respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1971 and
was promoted to assistant professor in 1974, associate professor in 1977, and professor
in 1986.
Combining outstanding fieldwork and cross-cultural research, Professor Kelly has
studied a wide range of topics, and his research and writings have focused on answering
questions of broad anthropological interest. In his book, Constructing Inequality,
Professor Kelly questions if any human society is truly egalitarian and brilliantly shows
how even a so-called "egalitarian" people achieve inequality in adulthood through a
"hierarchy of virtue." In a more recent text, Warless Societies and the Origin of War,
Professor Kelly explains why unsegmented societies remain warless, while some
segmented societies develop a principle of "social substitutability" that leads to group
conflict. He also authored Etoro Social Structure, a text on infant betrothal in New
288




Guinea, and The Nuer Conflict, which discusses the Nuer territorial expansion in Africa
and marked a major contribution to the literature on African segmentary systems. His
work is imaginative, rigorous, and attentive to empirical and historical data, and his
books are marvelous models for students of history, sociocultural anthropology, and
archaeology.
Professor Kelly received a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship in
1979, a Center for Advanced Study fellowship in 1982, and a Guggenheim fellowship
in 1982. His honors also include the Excellence in Education Award (1991) and the
Excellence in Research Award (1996) from the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Raymond C. Kelly
professor emeritus of anthropology.
John E. Knodel, Ph.D., professor of sociology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, and research professor in the Institute for Social Research, will
retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Knodel received his B.A. degree from Duke University in 1961 and his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Princeton University in 1963 and 1965, respectively. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty as an associate professor and assistant
research scientist in 1975 and was promoted to associate research scientist in 1979 and
professor and research scientist (currently research professor) in 1980.
One of the country's leading demographers, Professor Knodel has written or
collaborated on more than 200 scholarly articles, book chapters, and reports and authored
three major books. His earlier work on demographic change since the mid-eighteenth
century in Germany and on the fertility transition in Europe established him as a leading
figure in historical demography. During much of his career he studied the contemporary
determinants of fertility, sexual behavior and attitudes, changing family patterns, aging, and
general population trends in the developing world. He explored the social aspects of the
AIDS epidemic in Southeast Asia and discovered important implications for the parents of
adult sons and daughters who die from the disease. Professor Knodel's intellectually rich
body of work, much of which appears in the leading journals, is characterized by deep,
local knowledge of his cases, creative use of multiple research methods, and lucid and
compelling exposition. He has received numerous research fellowships and awards and
served as vice president of the Population Association of America and consultant to the
United Nations.
A talented and highly-regarded teacher, Professor Knodel taught both the core
undergraduate class on population problems and the core graduate course on social
demography and was a reliable and effective mentor to numerous graduate students. In
recognition of his teaching skills, Professor Knodel received the college's Excellence in
Education Award in 1991.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming John E. Knodel professor
emeritus of sociology and research professor emeritus.
Charles R. Krahmalkov, Ph.D., professor of ancient Near Eastern languages and
literatures in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active
faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Krahmalkov received his A.B. degree from     the University of
California-Berkeley in 1957 and his Ph.D. degree from Harvard University in 1965. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1965 and then
289




went to teach at the University of California from 1966-68. He returned to the
University as an assistant professor in 1968 and was promoted to associate professor in
1970 and professor in 1975.
Professor Krahmalkov is a renowned philologist and linguist of Northwest Semitic
languages, including Hebrew, Amorite, Ugaritic, and Phoenician-Punic. His particular
and unusual interest is Punic, the language of Carthage and North Africa during the
classical period and the mother tongue language of Saint Augustine. He devoted most
of his scholarly work to the exploration of this language. Professor Krahmalkov gained
international fame, in academia as well as in the popular press, with the decipherment
and discovery of the earliest western specimen of rhymed poetry in a Punic inscription,
dated to the late second century B.C. The leading authority in the field, he crowned his
work with three pioneering volumes on Phoenician-Punic.
During his long and exemplary career at the University of Michigan, Professor
Krahmalkov was continuously dedicated to teaching and caring for his students. Dear
to many, he has shown his erudite humanity, warmth, and spirit of collegiality and
support throughout the years.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Charles R. Krahmalkov
professor emeritus of ancient Near Eastern languages and literatures.
Andre Modigliani, Ph.D., associate professor of sociology in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Modigliani earned his A.B. degree from Harvard University in 1962 and his
Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1966. He was an assistant professor at
Harvard University from 1967-71 and joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
associate professor in 1972.
In his earliest research, Professor Modigliani sought to understand the impact of
the then emergent threat of nuclear confrontation on public opinion about the Cold War.
He examined the behavioral implications of alternative beliefs about the actual and
perceived goals of both the United States and the former Soviet Union, and the results
of this study were reported in a series of articles which became the basis for Untangling
the Cold War. Later, he developed a highly influential analysis of public opinion
toward military policy and an examination of some notable paradoxes in public
attitudes toward the federal deficit. He produced several seminal articles about political
behavior, including assessments of the evolving culture of the affirmative action issue
and media portrayals of the nuclear power issue. Recently, Professor Modigliani turned
his attention to studying the sources of obedience and defiance toward authority. He
wrote several papers and publications that reinterpreted the classic studies of obedience
and extended these studies to analyze the covert forms of resistance used by Holocaust
rescuers.
A very hard-working and dedicated teacher, Professor Modigliani was for many
years the mainstay of the department's teaching programs in deviance and social
psychology. He set high expectations for his students, and he more than met them half
way by presenting lectures and classroom exercises that were intellectually engaging
and stimulating. Professor Modigliani was that rare mentor who poured over the work
of his students and offered detailed feedback and generous advice. His life of teaching,
like his pursuit of knowledge, was tempered by a firm belief that learning requires equal
parts patience, compassion, and moral engagement.

The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Andre Modigliani
associate professor emeritus of sociology.
Theodore C. Moore, Jr., Ph.D., professor of geological sciences in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Moore received his B.S. degree from the University of North Carolina in
1960 and his Ph.D. degree from the University of California-San Diego, in 1968. He
served on the oceanography faculty at Oregon State University from 1968-75 and at the
University of Rhode Island from 1975-81. From 1981-89 he conducted research at
Exxon Production Research Company. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as
a professor in 1989 and was director of the Center for Great Lakes and Aquatic
Sciences from 1989-98.
Professor Moore's research and leadership have made him preeminent in the field
of paleoceanography. His studies on the Great Lakes led to a deeper understanding of
how the circum-Atlantic, post-glacial climate has been shaped, and his analysis of
sediment records yielded a continuing succession of new and profound understandings
about the history and process of global climate change over the short- and long-term.
He was also the director of the long-range climate investigation mapping and planning
project and its successor, the Cenozoic oceanography program.
Through his teaching and professional service, Professor Moore made important
contributions to the University and the community. He was the associate editor of the
American Geophysical Union journal, Paleoceanography. He also served as chair of
the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) planning subcommittee and co-chair for
the IODP interim planning committee. He taught numerous graduate and undergraduate
courses and oversaw the work of many masters and doctoral students. In 2002 he was
honored by being selected as a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Theodore C. Moore, Jr.,
professor emeritus of geological sciences.
H. Joan Morley, professor of linguistics in the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.

in 1952 and her M.S. and M.A. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1958 and 1968,
respectively. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1959. In 1966,
Professor Morley took a short leave to complete her M.A. degree and then returned to the
faculty as a lecturer in 1968. She was promoted to associate professor in 1983 and professor
in 1995.
Professor Morley was the country's leading expert in teaching pronunciation and
verbal skills to non-native speakers of English. She edited two books and authored ten
textbooks and numerous papers on this and related areas. Professor Morley was also an
outstanding presenter and workshop leader. She gave more than a hundred plenary or
keynote addresses at conferences, and later in her career she traveled throughout the world
on speaking engagements--often at the invitation of the Department of State. She was an
indefatigable supporter of the TESOL International Research Foundation and served as
president of this 15,000-strong association of ESL specialists in 1986-87.
Professor Morley served four terms as acting director of the University's English
Language Institute (ELI). She was a long-standing member of the Program in Linguistics'
Undergraduate Curriculum Committee; indeed, she was largely responsible for developing
the successful sub-concentration in applied linguistics and second language learning and
291




teaching. She was consistently one of the most successful and most appreciated teachers in
both the department and ELI. In 1994, ELI established the Morley Scholarship Fund to
honor Professor Morley and to celebrate her 25 years of service to the institute. To date, the
scholarship has brought more than 40 young scholars from around the world to Ann Arbor
to work on applied linguistics research projects.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming H. Joan Morley
professor emerita of linguistics.
James C. Snyder, Ph.D., professor of architecture and urban planning in the A.
Alfred Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, will retire from active
faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Snyder received his B.Arch. degree from The Ohio State University
(1963) and his M.Arch. (1966), M.C.P. (1967), and Ph.D. (1971) degrees from the
University of Michigan.  He was an assistant professor at Georgia Institute of
Technology from 1971-75 and associate professor and associate dean of the School of
Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee from
1976-80. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a professor in 1980.
Professor Snyder helped initiate the Studies in Urban Security Group (SUSG) in
1985. SUSG, an interdisciplinary faculty and student alliance, focused on applied
research in urban security and safety. Though this is a substantive area that greatly
affects the quality of urban life, it had been largely ignored by architects and urban
planners. SUSG placed a methodological emphasis on environmental design, risk
analysis, technology evolution, and strategic planning. It involved numerous faculty,
supported over 100 graduate students, and surpassed $3 million in sponsored funding.
The group's projects include plans for corporate and industrial facilities, public utilities,
community groups, municipalities, federal agencies, and the United Nations.
Professor Snyder was associate director of the Ph.D. program in urban and
regional planning from 1981-85 and chair of the Urban and Regional Planning Program
from 1982-84. He also served the college as associate dean (1996-99) and interim dean
(1997-98). His teaching exhibited a strong commitment to the integration of sound
fiscal and physical planning within a well-designed and safely-built environment.
Professor Snyder's work promoted faculty and student learning and made a positive
impact on the safety and security of many people.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming James C. Snyder professor
emeritus of architecture and urban planning.
Yukio Tomozawa, D.Sc., professor of physics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2004.
Professor Tomozawa received his B.Sc. and D.Sc. degrees from Tokyo University
in 1952 and 1961, respectively, and he did post-doctoral work at Cambridge University,
the University College London, the University of Pisa, and the Institute for Advanced
Study. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1966
and was promoted to associate professor in 1968 and professor in 1972.
An exceptional researcher, Professor Tomozawa's work spans a wide range of
issues in fundamental interactions, including structural analyticity, consequences and
imposition of symmetries, and new physics phenomenology. Early in his career, he
published several influential articles that investigated partially conserved axial vector
currents, which produce rigorous results at low energies for pion-nucleon scattering and
proton decay matrix elements. Professor Tomozawa's contributions in this area will
292




stand the test of time. He turned his focus next to studying the nature of quark
confinement due to psi spectroscopy, and he developed a new understanding of
potentials in quantum chromodynamics. More recently, Professor Tomozawa shifted his
interests to neutrino, cosmological, and gravitational physics.  He proposed new
theoretical ideas in these areas and designed and carried out some of the resulting
experimental studies himself. Based on his research throughout the years, Professor
Tomozawa has published more than 80 articles in physics journals and conference
proceedings.
Professor Tomozawa is a dedicated teacher. He initiated an undergraduate course
in general relativity, and the classes he taught were very popular among students. He
supervised six Ph.D. dissertations and was invited as a visiting professor to many
international research centers.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Yukio Tomozawa
professor emeritus of physics.
Wei-Hsuin Yang, Ph.D., professor of applied mechanics in the College of

1962, and his Ph.D. degree from Stanford University in 1965. He joined the University
of Michigan faculty in 1965 as an assistant professor and was promoted to associate
professor in 1969 and professor in 1975.
Professor Yang's research focused on the mathematical foundation of plasticity
theory. He developed a generalization of the well-known Holder inequality and applied
this generalization to problems of minimal surfaces, plasticity, and optimal designs. The
practical impact of this research to industrial manufacturing processes and structural
designs is only now being realized. His research interests extended further to solid
mechanics, applied  mathematics, numerical analysis, structural optimization,
manufacturing process optimization, structural crash worthiness, optional design of
wheels, and welding, and resulted in more than 65 publications.
Professor Yang was a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,
the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the scientific research society,
Sigma Xi. He served on numerous departmental, college, and university committees
including the Senate Assembly, the college's Coordinating Committee on Mechanics,
and the department's graduate, curriculum, admissions, and financial aid committees. A
popular teacher, Professor Yang mentored 19 Ph.D. students. Professor Yang was a
visiting scholar at many institutions including the Courant Institute of Mathematical
Science at New York University, Stanford University, the University of Stuttgart in
Germany, and the University of Perugia in Italy.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Wei-Hsuin Yang
professor emeritus of applied mechanics.

received by the University from the company.
New Intellectual Property Revenue Distribution Policy
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved a revision of the 1996 intellectual property revenue distribution
policy. The revised policy follows:


296




Distribution of Revenue from Royalties or Sale of Equity Interest
Revenue Distribution Plan
The goals of this revenue distribution plan include creating a strong incentive for faculty participation in
technology transfer and supporting further investment in research and technology transfer activities
generally. All net revenues, aside from those going to inventors, resulting from this plan should be used
broadly for research and educational purposes. The distribution formula is divided into three revenue
categories:
(a) Net revenue derived from intellectual property up to $200,000 will be distributed as follows:
50% to the inventors, 17% to the originating department, 18% to the originating school or
college, and 15% to the central administration.
(b) Net revenue derived from intellectual property over $200,000 and up to $2 million will be
distributed as follows: 30% to the inventors, 20% to the originating department, 25% to the
originating school or college, and 25% to the central administration.
(c) Net revenue derived from intellectual property over $2 million will be distributed as
follows: 30% to the inventors, 35% to the originating school or college, and 35% to the
central administration.
The foregoing revised revenue distribution plan will apply only to licenses (including options) and
assignments that are granted after the Regents approve this revised plan. This revised distribution plan
may be applied to existing licenses and assignments by agreement between the Vice President for
Research and the relevant unit(s) provided that the inventor's share will not thereby be disadvantaged.
Insofar as the overall allocation of revenues derived from intellectual property between faculty and the
University remains as described above, Executive Officers may determine how to allocate the University
portion in accord with University budget authority. Any change in the overall allocation between
inventors and the University will require Regental approval.
Faculty Option to Redirect Personal Portion of Revenue Distribution
Faculty will have the option of directing the University to allocate all or some portion of their personal
share to a University unit.
Patent Cost Recovery
Beginning in FY 2005, patent expenses above the annual central budget allocation, such allocation not to
fall below $800,000 in any fiscal year, will be recovered from all IP revenues prior to any distribution,
thus sharing this expense across all inventors and units.
Faculty Ownership of Equity
In cases where an inventor obtains ownership interests in a business entity as a result of a grant of
intellectual property rights by the University to the entity and/or as compensation for consulting by the
inventor associated with a transfer of Intellectual Property rights, and in cases of reassignment to
inventors, any resulting revenues to the University as the result of such grant will be distributed only to
the originating unit(s), the Schools or Colleges, and the central administration.
The inventor(s)' potential for revenue under the University's standard distribution plan outlined above is
exchanged for the potential rewards from the license or assignment.
Exceptions
In exceptional cases, in order to benefit the University, the vice president for research, in consultation
with the relevant unit(s), may make modifications in this distribution plan and shall record a description
of the exceptional circumstances.
Equity received by the University as a result of technology transfer shall be treated in accordance with
applicable University policy.


297




Approval of Academic Calendar for 2006-2007


On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved the 2006-2007 academic calendar for the Ann Arbor campus.
Approval of Changes to Academic Calendars for 2004-2005 and 2005-2006
Provost Courant submitted a request to revise previously approved academic
calendars for Winter terms 2005 and 2006 to eliminate the overlap of the Horace H.
Rackham School of Graduate Studies commencement exercises and the last day of final
exams.
Regent McGowan inquired whether the dates of the 2005 winter vacation
correspond to the dates of the Ann Arbor Public Schools (AAPS) winter vacation.
Provost Courant responded that the dates of the two vacations are always coordinated
and that they were the same but he would check again and report back.
Regent McGowan said that "on that condition" she would move approval of the
changes to the academic calendars for 2004-2005 and 2005-2006, as described. Regent
Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. [Note: Subsequent to
the meeting it was learned that the 2005 AAPS set its winter vacation so as not to
coincide with the University's vacation, due to the early occurrence of Easter in 2005.]
Public Comments, Continued
The Regents heard comments from Jon Manning, vice president of Flint STRIVE,
regarding proposed purchase of 1108 Lapeer Street in Flint from the University of
Michigan-Flint.
The Regents requested feedback from the administration on the proposal put forth
by Mr. Manning.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 3:40 p.m. The next
meeting is scheduled for June 17, 2004.

JUNE MEETING, 2004


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, June 17, 2004
The Regents convened at 2:00 p.m. in the Great Lakes Room, Palmer Commons
Building. Present were President Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard,
McGowan, Newman, Richner, and Taylor. Also present were Provost Courant,
Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President Slottow, Vice President
and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent
White and Vice President Rudgers were absent.
President Coleman called the meeting to order and noted that the first order of
business would be a panel discussion about intercollegiate athletics. She introduced the
participants, who included Myles Brand, president of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association ("NCAA"), Jim Delaney, commissioner of the Big Ten Conference ("Big
Ten"), and Bill Martin, University of Michigan athletic director.
Panel Discussion - Intercollegiate Athletics
Bill Martin praised the leadership and guidance provided by Mr. Delaney on behalf
of the Big Ten Conference. Mr. Martin noted that Dr. Brand has been a leader in
promoting academic and eligibility reforms in intercollegiate athletics, and he was fully in
support of Dr. Brand's efforts.
Dr. Brand commented that the NCAA is interested in improving the academic
success of student athletes and described the dramatic reforms that have been put in
place to help achieve this goal. These include raising the standards for initial eligibility
for athletic scholarships and requiring that demonstrated progress be made towards a
degree over a five-year period to maintain eligibility. Member institutions are being
held accountable for maintaining these standards and sanctions have been put in place if
they do not. Dr. Brand commented that he is committed to ensuring that every student
athlete has a genuine opportunity to receive an education and to graduate.
Mr. Delaney commented on post-season college football. He noted that the Big
Ten believes in the bowl tradition but does not believe in a college football playoff, and
he described how the decision was made to integrate the Rose Bowl with the bowl
games organized by other collegiate athletic conferences. The Rose Bowl tradition will
be reestablished by holding an annual Big Ten - Pac Ten championship game every
year in the Rose Bowl, unless one of those two teams is ranked first or second.
The panelists then responded to questions about compliance requirements,
financing of the NCAA and collegiate sports, Title IX and gender equity, subsidization
of athletic department budgets by the universities' general funds, freshman ineligibility,
and the role of governing boards and presidents in the oversight of athletic programs.
The session concluded at 3:10 p.m. and was followed by a 10-minute break.


299




Public Comments


The Regents heard comments from Jim Mogensen, citizen, about the town-gown
relationship with respect to housing, and from the following individuals about the planned
changes to SAPAC: Lisa Bakale-Wise, student; Mia White, student; Paul Douglas Wise,
citizen; Ann Chi, student; and Kathryn Turnock, student.
Discussion of Planned Changes to SAPAC Services
Vice President Harper responded to questions from the Regents about the changes
being planned for the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC) that
have prompted the negative reaction from students at the last several Public Comments
sessions. She noted that student concerns about the need for safe spaces, accurate data
collection, a campus-based crisis line, easily accessible services, and a more consultative
process when making significant changes have been and continue to be very important in
the planning process. She reported that the changes are necessary to allow efforts to be
focused on the prevention of sexual assault and to assure that services meet the needs of
all students, and she said that the University is committed to assuring that its services are
truly meeting the needs of survivors of sexual assault.
Vice President Harper provided details of the plans being put in place regarding
provision of services to survivors of sexual assault and further explained the rationale
and intended outcomes for the upcoming changes in organizational structure and service
delivery models. She said that a more systematic, integrated, educational approach to
sexual violence is needed in order to really make a difference in prevention.
Furthermore, she pointed out that the University has a responsibility to consider the
well-being of all students, including perpetrators as well as survivors, and that there
must be an integrated approach to provision of support services. Vice President Harper
noted that the current system is effective for a small number of survivors but does not
reach many others in need of services. She also emphasized that advocacy work and
therapy are fundamentally different undertakings that should not be combined in one
individual service provider.
Vice President Harper commented that administrative staff is well aware of the
reasons that the students are opposed to the direction being taken, and staff will
continue to listen to and address students' concerns as appropriate.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman commented on the death of Ann Arbor citizen Robert Teeter and
pointed out that he was a nationally-known expert in electoral politics and also provided
wise counsel and support to the University of Michigan.
President Coleman reported that Regent White's absence is due to her annual
active duty service as a captain in the U.S. Army reserves. She commented on
accolades received over the past month by University students, faculty, and alumni and
observed that the University had placed second, its highest ranking ever, in the annual
U.S. Sports Academy "Directors' Cup" Division I race.

Report on Undergraduate Admissions


President Coleman observed that in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision
of 2003, there has been extensive public interest in the University's revised undergraduate
admissions process. She said that Provost Courant would be giving an update on how the
new process worked and the makeup of the incoming class that will matriculate in Fall
2004. She praised the staff of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and of the Office
of the Provost for their work in revamping the admissions process in a short amount of
time and noted that several factors may have contributed to discouraging some students,
particularly minorities, from submitting applications. She said the University would focus
its efforts on removing any barriers to full participation.
Provost Courant described the changes in the admissions process that had been
implemented following the Supreme Court decision. These include a new application
form as part of a new process that met the court's requirements for a more holistic and
individualized admissions procedure and evaluation. New staff were hired to review
applications and additional training was provided for all staff. The budget for the
Office of Undergraduate Admissions was increased by $1.8 million in FY 2003-2004 to
accommodate the change in evaluation procedures.
Provost Courant reported that the total number of applications declined from
25,918 in 2003 to 21,261 in 2004 (an 18% decrease). He noted that despite the
decreased number of applications, the "deposit yield" increased by 13% for Fall 2004,
indicating that a higher proportion of admitted students than ever before had applied
with the intention of accepting offers of admission. Indications are that the freshman
class for Fall 2004 will be the largest ever, and staff in housing, the College of
Literature, Science and the Arts, and the College of Engineering are planning
accordingly to insure that students receive a high-quality educational experience.
Provost Courant observed that the number of applications received from
under-represented minority students had declined by 21 %, while the "deposit yield" had
increased by 15% over the previous year. He noted that the decline in applications from
this population is part of a national trend, and the reasons for it are not well understood.
The University is very concerned about this situation and will be working hard to insure
that the campus presents a welcoming atmosphere to all students. It is believed that
publicity over the affirmative action lawsuit may have contributed to misperceptions
about the University's commitment to a broadly diverse student body, and efforts are
being made to communicate the meaning of the Supreme Court decision and the
University's commitment to affirmative action.
He noted that the admissions process is reviewed every year, and the application
and review process is being reviewed to see if any changes are necessary. Feedback has
been received from a broad array of potential students and parents, faculty, high school
counselors, and admissions staff to evaluate all aspects of the recently completed
admissions process, and some modifications will be made. He also noted that the
University's commitment to meeting the full demonstrated financial need of Michigan
resident undergraduate students has not changed.

Annual Reports of Committees on the Economic Status of the Faculty, All Three
Campuses
Ann Arbor Campus. Professor Fred Askari presented the annual CESF report for
the Ann Arbor campus. Among the points he made was that health insurance coverage
for faculty retirees is not guaranteed and is considered to be an area of vulnerability. He
also distributed salary data and discussed faculty compensation issues more generally. He
praised the cooperation the committee had received from the provost's office and from
other administrative areas in collecting the data, and he urged that efforts be continued to
make this data more transparent. Key trends that emerged are discrepancies in aggregate
salaries by gender, particularly at the high end of the pay scale; unpublished salary
supplements; lower compensation for nontenured faculty; the "loyalty tax"; the use of
incentive pay; and the notion of whether pay is optimal.
Flint Campus. Professor Jami Anderson presented the report of the Flint campus
CESF. She commented that faculty at the UM-Flint were the only faculty at a Michigan
public university who did not receive a salary increase last year. Thus, the effects on
the faculty of inflation, salary compression, and faculty salaries relative to peer
institutions have all worsened during the past year, making it difficult to recruit and
retain good faculty.  The CESF recommends a one-time equity payment of 2% to
compensate for last year's losses and an additional increase for this year. Salary
compression and merit pay would have to be addressed over the long term. She
observed that tuition, which is the main source of income for the campus, does not
increase at nearly the rate as do the expenses it must cover.
Dearborn Campus. Chancellor Little read a summary of the report that had been
prepared by the Dearborn campus CESF, chaired by Professor Marlene Gordon. He
complimented the committee for the quality of its report. He noted that the report
focused on issues of salary comparison and equity, salary compression, and benefits.
The committee concluded that there is a significant amount of salary compression on
the Dearborn campus. With respect to benefits, the committee noted that only one
Michigan public university reported paying less for employee benefits than the
University of Michigan. The committee recommendations are that if any equity funding
becomes available, it should be provided to associate and full professors; that a salary
review be conducted when salary ratios among the faculty ranks differ from national
averages; and that complete salary and wage payment data be provided for the Dearborn
campus, as has been done for the Ann Arbor campus.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning. It received the semi-annual report on M-Care; received
a preliminary review of the FY 2005 Athletic Department budget; and reviewed the
proposed FY 2005 Hospitals and Health Systems budget. The committee also was
updated regarding the "Orders Management Project" underway at the Hospitals and
Health System. He reported that the committee was pleased to learn that the FY 2004
Hospitals and Health Systems budget is exceeding expectations.
Compensation and Personnel Committee. Regent Maynard reported that the
committee had not met this month but would have a report in July.

Richard E. Darnell, Ph.D., professor of physical therapy in the School of Health
Professions and Studies at the University of Michigan-Flint, will retire from active
faculty status on June 30, 2004.
Professor Darnell obtained his B.S. degree from New York University in 1956 and
his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from        Michigan State University in      1964 and 1971,
respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as assistant professor in
1971 and was promoted to associate professor in 1976 and professor in 1982.
315




Professor Darnell was director of the curriculum in physical therapy and program
director for physical therapy at the Institute for the Study for Mental Retardation and
Related Disabilities on the Ann Arbor campus from 1971-76 and an associate at the
University Hospital from 1972-75. He was director of the Physical Therapy Program on
the Flint campus from 1982-88 and assistant to the dean from 1998-99. He engineered
the relocation of the physical therapy program from Ann Arbor to Flint, which improved
the program's capacity to respond to post-graduate, entry-level educational needs. He is
well known for promoting education in pediatric physical therapy, developing clinical
research in physical therapy within the state, and fostering an interdisciplinary orientation
to patient care. He has the notable distinction of being the first full professor of physical
therapy in the State of Michigan.
Nationally recognized in his field, Professor Darnell has received numerous
awards including the Michigan Physical Therapy Association's (MPTA) Outstanding
Service Award, the American Physical Therapy Association's (APTA) Lucy Blair
Service Award, the Distinguished Educator in Physical Therapy Award from the
APTA's Section for Education, the APTA's Catherine Worthingham Fellowship, and
University of Michigan-Flint's Teaching Excellence Award. He was the first recipient
of the Richard E. Darnell Research Award, which was created by the MPTA's Institute
for Education and Research to recognize Professor Darnell's excellence in teaching.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physical therapy educator for his
dedicated service by naming Richard E. Darnell professor emeritus of physical therapy.
Jane R. Heirich, lecturer III in music in the Residential College, College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on December 31,

degree from Harvard University in 1957. She joined the University of Michigan faculty
as a lecturer in 1972 and was promoted to lecturer II in 1992 and lecturer III in 1993.
For more than three decades, Ms. Heirich has been responsible for developing and
administering the Residential College Music Program. She created and taught several
new classes, including a course in chamber music in which she organized a chamber
orchestra, several smaller ensembles, and a student vocal group known as the Madrigal
Singers. She also developed a class in creative musicianship that combined music
theory and composition and another course on using the human voice as an acoustic
instrument.
Drawing on her success as a uniquely effective vocal instructor, Ms. Heirich
developed the widely-circulated text, Miracles Usually Can't Be Learned. The text
includes extensive information on all the fundamental areas of concern for voice
students: anatomy, physiology, acoustics, breath training, vocal tract training, and
imagery as a tool for vocal development. A certified teacher of the Alexander
Technique, Ms. Heirich also published numerous articles on the Alexander Technique
and vocal pedagogy and integrated the training into her teaching. She has presented at
numerous conferences and led seminars and workshops around the world.
Ms. Heirich has been a creative and inspirational teacher for thousands of students
during her 32 years of teaching in the Residential College. The popularity of her
courses, the enthusiasm and achievements of her students, and the respect that she has
garnered from her peers, all speak eloquently of her accomplishments. The Residential


316




College Music Program, as it is known and admired today, is Ms. Heirich's
achievement and her legacy to the University.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Jane R. Heirich lecturer
emerita of music.
Yale Kamisar, LL.B., Clarence Darrow Distinguished University Professor of
Law and professor of law in the Law School, will retire from active faculty status on
June 30, 2004.
Professor Kamisar received his A.B. degree from New York University in 1950
and his LL.B. degree from Columbia University in 1954. He worked in private practice
from 1954-57 and then taught at the University of Minnesota Law School from
1957-63. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as professor of law in 1964.
Professor Kamisar is perhaps best known for his work in constitutional criminal
procedure, a field that his writings have transformed. His work in that area is partially
represented by his classic volume on criminal interrogation, Police Interrogation and
Confessions: Essays in Law and Policy (1980); but the body of his work, over a span of
more than three decades, is much larger and has touched all parts of the field. Professor
Kamisar has had an enormous impact in shaping the law made by the Supreme Court of
the United States and in setting the agenda for scholarly debate. He has had a
considerable influence on other issues as well, most notably the ongoing debate about
euthanasia.  His classic 1958 article on mercy-killing has been reprinted in ten
anthologies and continues to this day to be the focus of study and debate by teachers of
law, philosophy, religion, and medical ethics.
In addition to his scholarly achievements, Professor Kamisar has excelled as a
teacher. Generations of students at the Law School have chosen courses simply to "take
Kamisar." He is co-author of seven editions of two widely-used casebooks that have
carried his learning, pedagogy, and relentless enthusiasm to untold numbers of students
at other law schools. His influence has also extended well beyond the confines of
academia, as evidenced by his preeminence as an author of articles about legal issues
for general audiences in national newspapers, magazines, and other media; his activities
in this area have made him a three-time co-recipient of the American Bar Association
Silver Gavel Award.
The Regents now salute this accomplished scholar and educator for his long and
dedicated service to the University of Michigan by naming Yale Kamisar the Clarence
Darrow Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of Law and professor emeritus of
law.
Robert M. Kren, Ph.D., professor of chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences
at the University of Michigan-Flint, will retire from active faculty status on June 30,
2004, after an extraordinary 36 years of service.
Professor Kren received his B.S. degree from San Francisco State University in 1963
and his Ph.D. degree from Washington State University in 1967. He was a post-doctoral
fellow at the University of Florida in 1967, and he served there as an interim assistant
professor from 1967-68. Professor Kern joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty as
an assistant professor in 1968 and was promoted to associate professor in 1972 and
professor in 1990.
Professor Kren's research focused on inorganic chemistry, specifically in the areas
of synthesis and characterization of compounds of the non-metals.  His early
publications appeared in such journals as Inorganic Chemistry and Monatshefte der
317




Anorganischen Chemie, but his most recent research and publications have been in the
field of astronomy. He taught a wide variety of courses, including principles of
chemistry, advanced inorganic chemistry, advanced synthesis, polymer chemistry, and
"Beyond the Solar System." His willingness to teach on such a variety of topics indicates
the depth of his commitment to the University and to the students that he served.
Outside the classroom, Professor Kren served as chair of the chemistry department
from 1974-78, and he served on numerous faculty standing committees and special
committees, most notably the College of Arts and Science Executive Committee and the
Budget Priorities and Chancellor's Advisory Committee.
The Regents now salute this distinguished chemistry educator for his dedicated
service by naming Robert M. Kren professor emeritus of chemistry.
Memorials. Vice President Tedesco submitted a memorial statement for Milagros
Simmons, Ph.D., associate professor of environmental health sciences.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Milagros S. Simmons, associate professor of environmental health
sciences in the School of Public Health. Professor Simmons died on May 11, 2004, at
the age of 64.
Professor Simmons received her baccalaureate in chemistry from the University of
Santo Tomas in the Philippines in 1959. After an early career in industry, she moved to
the United States and earned her M.S. degree in analytical chemistry and Ph.D. degree
in organic analytical chemistry from Wayne State University in 1962 and 1966,
respectively. She was an assistant professor in the department of chemistry at Mercy
College in Detroit from 1962-66, and she was a senior scientist in the scientific research
laboratory at Ford Motor Company from 1966-68. Professor Simmons joined the
University of Michigan as a postdoctoral fellow in the Biophysics Research Division in
1969. She was appointed to the faculty as an assistant research scientist in the Center
for Great Lakes and Aquatic Sciences in 1971 and was also appointed assistant
professor of environmental chemistry in 1975. She was promoted to associate research
scientist in 1987 and associate professor in 1980.
A highly respected teacher who took special delight in mentoring students,
Professor Simmons was also a renowned researcher in environmental chemistry. The
research she started in water science in the Philippines was just one example of her
many legendary contributions. During her long career, Professor Simmons studied a
wide range of contaminants in water and examined the detection and characterization of
organic chemicals in both lake water and sediments. In particular, she was interested in
the toxic organic compounds that pose the highest human health risks because of their
potential to undergo bio-magnification in ecological systems such as the food chain.
Her pioneering work on polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Great Lakes food
chain was instrumental in the establishment of health advisories against the
consumption of fish from the lakes, and her work on the International Joint Commission
on the Great Lakes strongly influenced the direction of research and policy relating to
these bodies of water.
Professor Simmons received international recognition and numerous awards for
her work, including the Multiple Sclerosis Society Fellowship, the Macromolecular
Research Center Fellowship, the Fogarty International Fellowship, the Rotary
International Fellowship, and membership in the Philippines Scientist Program.

As we mourn the loss of this distinguished scientist, our condolences go to her
husband, Curtis Simmons, as well as her brothers and sisters.

entirety for legislative history.
Two-and-a-half years ago, the Board voted to amend its bylaws and modify its
governance structure. For the first time, we created two committees. These were. 1) Finance, Audit and
Investment, and 2) Compensation and Personnel.
We also created the positions of chair and vice chair. These positions were to be
elected by a majority of the Board. I was elected chair. Regent Newman was elected vice chair.
As written, the term of office was to be 2 years. The first term was also extended for 6 months
because of when the system was put in place. As originally written, the job descriptions for the
chair and vice chair were vague. But, nevertheless, off we went.
For me, kicking off something new was an interesting, and at times, frustrating
experience. On the whole, our new structure has worked very well...but not perfectly.
Certainly, the committees have fulfilled our hopes for them. By empowering sub-sets of
the Board to delve deeply into subjects which are at the heart of our governance responsibility,
namely finance and executive personnel, we more thoroughly and thoughtfully fulfill our
responsibilities.
I am particularly proud of the fact that we created an audit committee well in advance
of Enron and Sarbanes-Oxley. Prudent management of our resources is at the heart of our
stewardship responsibilities, and we have done that well.


327




June Meeting, 2004


Speaking  of   Sarbanes-Oxley,  as  previously  reported,  we  have   asked
PricewatershouseCoopers to advise us on how to bring University practice into as full
compliance as possible with Sarbanes-Oxley even though that law does not apply to non-profit
institutions. Accordingly, we will be bringing forward a revised charter for the Finance, Audit
and Investment Committee in the near future.
Similarly, Sarbanes-Oxley mandates that public companies have a nominating and
governance committee to review Board performance. We will not create such a committee, but
we will be revising the charter of the Compensation and Personnel Committee to include Board
assessment and self-evaluation in its charter. Those revisions will be completed soon.
Both of these actions are consistent with the Board's insistence that both its own
activities and those of University leadership be conducted at all times with the highest possible
professionalism and integrity.
As we came to the end of my V22 year term, afew things became apparent to all of us
regarding the role of the chair and vice chair. These were.
1) The job takes a lot of extra time.
2) Defining  the  chair's responsibilities  would  be  helpful and  would  avoid
misunderstandings.
3) Preserving a spirit of egalitarian collegiality among 8 individually elected public
officials was ofpreeminent importance.
Accordingly, we have brought forth the following major bylaw revisions in addition to a few
other technical corrections.
1) Henceforth, the chair and vice chair will serve one-year terms.
2) The positions will be filled on a rotating basis based on seniority.
3) The chair will be the Regent with the most seniority with the vice chair having the
second most seniority.
4) Members can, of course, feel free to decline to serve for personal reasons - family,
other commitments, and so forth.
5) No one will serve again until all other members have served or forfeited the
opportunity to serve.
6) The duties of the chair have been clarified and specified to include.
*   setting the annual schedule for meetings, agenda and major topics for
presentation or study by the Board
* monitoring committee agenda planning for coordination and
comprehensiveness
* acting as spokesperson and convener of the Board where appropriate
* presiding over executive sessions when held without the president of the
University
* appointing the chair and members of the ad hoc and standing committees
With that background, in a moment I will propose the following motions.
Approve the bylaw changes as published in the June 7, 2004 University Record,
Confirm the appointment of Rebecca McGowan as chair and Andrea Fischer Newman as
vice chair commencing July 1, 2004.
Before making those motions, I would like to make afew personal observations.


328




First on transition: For the record, Regent McGowan and I have equal seniority. Because
of my 2 ~V years of service as chair, I do not expect to serve as chair next year. Rather, I
will serve again when my turn next arrives. Similarly, Regent Newman was elected vice
chair with me. She will serve again and is scheduled to be the next chair unless she
declines to serve.
Second, the record should reflect that this method of selecting the chair was originally
suggested by Regent Maynard 2 V2 years ago. She was correct.
I would like to offer my thanks to Andrea Newman. Her probing questions and savvy
insights always made me do a better job - even when we didn't agree.
I wish to offer my thanks to Lisa Tedesco. Her value as a colleague to me and to all of the
Regents is simply unquantifiable. Her work and advice are superb.
A few words on Rebecca McGowan: We are very fortunate to have her as our next chair.
If we hadn't changed our system she would have been my personal nominee for the job.
She is completely dedicated to the University's excellence. She will insist that we all do our
best. Beckie, through good days and bad, over 12 years, there is no Regent for whom I
have more respect.
Finally, thanks to my colleagues for giving me the privilege of kicking off this new system. I
look forward to continued service with all ofyou. "
Regent Deitch moved the adoption of the proposed revisions to Regents' Bylaws
1.06 and 1.07, and the confirmation of Regents McGowan and Newman as chair and
vice chair, respectively. Regent Newman seconded the motion.
Regent Maynard thanked Regent Deitch for the way he had "put this together with
all the rest of us," and noted that she appreciated the manner in which this has occurred.
She thanked Regent Deitch for his service, pointing out that his great passion for the
University is an honorable characteristic. Regent Brandon associated himself with
Regent Maynard's remarks and noted that "it is hard to be the first of anything" and for
that, he appreciated Regent Deitch's efforts. Regent McGowan agreed, commenting
that in their twelve years of association, she and Regent Deitch have usually agreed, but
when they don't, "It is very exciting to engage him and then to anticipate the fireworks
that follow." She noted that Regent Deitch works so hard for the University because he
truly believes in the values and opportunities it presents for its students.
The vote was then taken, and the motion to amend Regents' Bylaws Sections 1.06
and 1.07 were approved unanimously. The revised bylaws appear in the appendix,
beginning on page 331.
Implementation of the Regents' Policy on Research Grants, Contracts, and
Agreements, FY 03
The Regents received the annual report regarding the implementation of the
Regents' Policy on Research Grants, Contracts, and Agreements for FY 03.
Approval of the Academic Calendars for 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 for the
University of Michigan-Dearborn Campus
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved academic calendars for 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 for the
University of Michigan-Dearborn campus.


329




Approval of Proposed Change to the Academic Calendars for the Summer Term
2006 for the University of Michigan-Dearborn Campus
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved a change to the academic calendar for the summer term 2006 for
the University of Michigan-Dearborn campus.
Official Enrollment Count Dates for the University of Michigan-Flint Campus
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved an amendment to the official enrollment count dates, as follows:
"The official enrollment report for the University of Michigan-Flint will be prepared by
the Office of the Registrar as of the 10th day of classes for all terms, using consistent
definitions and procedures each term and year."
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 5:45 p.m. The next
meeting is scheduled for July 15, 2004.

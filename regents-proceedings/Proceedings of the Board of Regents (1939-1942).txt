First August Meeting, 1939


FRANKFORT, MICHIGAN,
AUGUST 4, 1939
The Board met at 8:30 P.M. at the summer residence of President
Ruthven.
Present, the President, Regent Beal, Regent Crowley, Regent
Shields, Regent Lynch, Regent Hemans, Regent Cram, and Regent
Stone. Absent, Regent Cook and Superintendent Elliott. None of the
administrative officers of the Board was required to attend this meeting.
The following communication from Ann Arbor Trust Company
was presented in person by Mr. Earl H. Cress. After discussion, the
Board authorized Ann Arbor Trust Company to secure commitments for the purchase of bonds of the proposed new issue. Further,
the Finance Committee was empowered to proceed with the refinancing of the dormitories, indebtedness if, in the judgment of the Committee, the commitments are satisfactory (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 641):
August 3, 1939
President A. G. Ruthven
Frankfort, Michigan
Dear Dr. Ruthven:
I am writing you to suggest the advisability of considering the refinancing
of Mosher-Jordan Halls, the Union and Medical Dormitories, and the Second
Men's and Second Girls' Dormitory Loans at a lower rate of interest than now
being paid by the Board of Regents.
At the present time, there are outstanding the following dormitory loans:
a. $573,000.00 Par Value Mosher-Jordan Halls of which $227,000.00 are
3/2% and $346,000.00 are 4%. These bonds are callable at par as of
December 1, 1936 upon giving two weeks notice.
b. $1,477,000.00 Par Value University of Michigan Dormitory Revenue
Bonds Union and Medical Dormitories 3%2 interest, callable at 101
as of September 15, 1938 with twenty days notice of call required.
c. $1,500,000.00 Par Value University of Michigan Dormitory Revenue
Bonds Series II, Second Men's Dormitory, Second Women's Dormitory
and the Addition to the Power Plant bearing interest at the rate of 3 2 %
callable at 101 as of October 15, 1938 upon giving twenty days notice.
The total of these three dormitory loans which are now      outstanding, is
$3,550,000.00. The annual payments required to service these loans after the
dormitories are once in operation, are as follows:
a.  Mosher-Jordan............................$  60,000.00  per  annum
b.  Union  &  Medical..........................  82,000.00  per  annum
c. 2nd Men's and 2nd Women's.................84,000.00    per annum
Total annual payments required............. $226,000.00
Since last September and October when the funds were raised for the new
dormitory projects, there has been a further reduction of interest rates. The Union
and Medical Dormitories will have been completed this fall, which has some
effect in the rate of interest which has to be paid; further, Congress has made
no changes in the tax laws affecting the exemption of the dormitory bonds from
income tax in this session of Congress. These several factors along with the
actual contact with institutions interested in University of Michigan Dormitory
loans lead me to believe that the Board of Regents could borrow $3,550,000.00 to
be repaid over a period of thirty years at an interest rate of 3%.
It is surprising the saving to be made over a period of years. The interest
charges on the present outstanding loans for the next year at the present in1

FIRST AUGUST MEETING, 1939


terest rates would be $19,480.00 more than if the money were borrowed at 3%.
This interest saving annually becomes less as the principal is reduced, but over
the full period of thirty years, the total saving would be in excess of $340,000.00.
If consideration were given to refinancing at the lower rate, it would also be
possible to reduce the total annual payments which are now called for to service
the three loans of $226,000.00 to a minimum annual payment of $184,500.00
This is $41,500.00 less per annum.
At the time the $1,500,000.00 and the $1,477,000.00 loans were issued,
excess funds were borrowed to cover contingencies which might arise in the construction of the dormitories which might require additional funds. It seems
reasonable at this time to anticipate that there will be a minimum of $100,000.00
unexpended at the time the dormitories are completed, of the funds borrowed,
and possibly as much as $150,000.00. The new loan could be reduced by this
amount.
Of the loans now outstanding $2,947,000.00 par value are callable at a
premium of 1% amounting to $29,477.00. I believe that if The Regents thought
it desirable to issue new bonds at 3% that they could be sold at 101. The premium of 1 % would cover the premium of 1 % which would have to be paid in
calling those bonds now outstanding which are callable at a price of 101.
In view of the fact that notice of calling the $1,477,000.00 loan would have
to be given not later than August 25, immediate action will be required if advantage is to be taken of refunding the outstanding loans at a lower rate of
interest this fall. The loan of $1,500,000.00 would have to be called by September 25 and the Mosher-Jordan Halls loan of $573,000.00 would have to be called
by December 10. I have given this matter a great deal of attention in view of
having represented the Board of Regents in the placing of the present outstanding
loans and call attention to the possibility of refunding at a substantial interest
saving because of my desire to keep you and the Board of Regents fully advised
in regard to matters of this kind. If I can be of service in connection with the
refinancing of the present outstanding loans at a reduced interest rate, I would
be pleased to be so advised and assure you that the same would have my very
best attention.
Yours very truly,
EARL H. CRESS
Executive Vice-President
Recommendations from      the Division of the Health Sciences (R.P.
1932-1936, p. 511) were received advocating the establishment of a
School of Hygiene and Public Health at this University, with the understanding "that the Deans and Directors of the several schools making
up the Division of the Health Sciences serve as the advisory council
of the School of Hygiene and Public Health" (excerpt from minutes
of meeting of a Committee of the Division, February 20, 1939). The
Board approved the recommendations of the Committee of the Division
of the Health Sciences, with the understanding that no additions to
the budget of the Division of Hygiene and Public Health as adopted
for 1939-1940 would result from this action. The Board fixed the
name of the School here established as "School of Public Health and
Preventive Medicine." This action is contingent on the working out
of satisfactory administrative details. It is planned that it will take
effect at the beginning of the academic year, 1940-41.
The following report of the University Council's Committee on
Public Relations, dated April 27, 1939, was presented and approved
by the Board, with the provision that the University Committee on
Continuing Professional Education be considered an enlargement and
modification of the University Committee on Postgraduate Education,
authorized by The Regents on December 1, 1933 (R.P. 1932-1936,
p. 288):
To President Alexander G. Ruthven and the Members of the University Council:
In view of the rapid growth of continuing professional training afforded by
various units of the University, as described in the report submitted at the




FIRST AUGUST MEETING, 1939


3


April meeting of the University Council, and in view of the likelihood that there
will be pressure for further development of educational opportunities along these
lines, it is recommended that a University Committee on Continuing Professional
Education be appointed by the President with the approval of the Board of
Regents. The Committee is to consist of representatives of the Schools of Medicine, Law, Dentistry, Education, Business Administration, Forestry and Conservation, Nursing, and Music, of the Colleges of Engineering, Architecture, and Pharmacy, and of the Division of Hygiene and Public Health. In addition, the Dean
of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and the Dean of the Horace H.
Rackham   School of Graduate Studies, or their designated representatives, shall
be ex-officio members of the Committee to represent such professional fields as
may be embraced within the jurisdiction of their respective units.
The Committee shall be authorized to act through an Executive Committee
of not less than five members under such procedure as it may itself establish.
The functions of the Committee shall be twofold: (1) to keep itself informed
of the experience of the various units, with a view to harmonizing and improving
established activities for continuing professional education; and (2) to advise
the President, on the basis of this knowledge, concerning the desirability and
character of new projects for continuing professional education. This University
Committee on Continuing Professional Education is to replace the University
Committee on Postgraduate Education authorized by the Board of Regents at
its meeting of December, 1933.

The Board authorized the President, at his discretion, to proceed
with the applications for several art projects under the Works Progress
Administration, which applications are now in the hands of Professor
Lewis M. Gram, as Director of Plant Extension. This action was
taken with the understanding that the University's share of the total
amount necessary in each case would be provided from sources outside
the University's budget.
The sum of $6,000 was appropriated, on recommendation of the
Director of Plant Extension, to provide funds for certain room alterations and equipment as follows:
1. To provide administrative offices for the dormitory staff, consisting of
Dr. Litzenberg, Mrs. Stanley, Mr. Shiel, Miss Hamm, and an assistant, on the
second floor of the South Wing of University Hall. Approximate estimate, $2,000.
2. To make necessary changes in Mason Hall and the South Wing to
adjust the needs of the Literary College to the conditions resulting from Item 1
and from the removal of the Department of Landscape Design from the South
Wing to the Architecture Building. Approximate estimate, $2,000.
3. To provide additional equipment such as classroom platforms, seats,
desks, and blackboards, as required under Item 2, and to cover a shortage of
similar equipment elsewhere on the campus. Approximate estimate, $2,000.
After extended discussion the President was requested to appoint a
committee of The Regents to study the organization of the School of
Music, with particular reference to the functions of the Board of
Directors of the University Musical Society. The President later
appointed Regents Cram, Cook, and Crowley to constitute this committee.
The Regents extended the leave of absence granted to Alex Schlupe
(R.P. 1936-1939, p. 908) for an additional month, namely, to September 10, 1939.




4              FIRST AUGUST MEETING, 1939
Regent Cram requested that further study be made of possible
sites for the proposed Mary B. Henderson House (R.P. 1936-1939,
p. 851). Mrs. Cram stated that the University-owned property on the
corner of North University Avenue and Camden Court is quite satisfactory to the Alumnae Council, except for the, size of the lot.
The Board adjourned to meet on call of the President.

Trustee to the contractor or subcontractor for work performed by him, or to the
Obligor, in such amounts as said architect shall from time to time estimate and
certify. The Trustee may rely entirely upon such certificates, but shall not be
required to do so to the exclusion of the Obligor and/or its own discretion. The
Obligor agrees that it will at any time upon request of the Trustee, procure and
furnish to the Trustee a certificate of any architect or contractor or contractors
certifying as to the amount required to complete one or more of said dormitories
or work incidental to enlarging and expanding the University of Michigan heating
and power plant as herein contemplated, and such evidence as the Trustee may
require to satisfy it that all construction may be paid for and furnishings and

funds available will not be sufficient to pay the costs incidental to constructing,
furnishing, and equipping of any dormitory or any group of dormitories or to pay
the costs incidental to the enlarging or expanding of said heating and power
plant, the Trustee shall have the right to refuse to pay out any of the funds then
in its possession or under its control (construction accounts and contingency

and to furnish and equip the same, or to complete the work incidental to the
enlarging and expanding of said heating and power plant, as herein contemplated,
have been provided for.
Section 6. The Obligor covenants and agrees that any funds which shall
remain in any construction account or contingency fund referred to in this Article
which shall not be needed to pay the costs of construction and the costs of furnishings and equipment for which the same has been set aside and segregated, shall
be used for the following purposes:
a) To supplement any other account or fund hereinbefore referred to which
shall not have sufficient funds to pay all costs incidental to the construction and
furnishings and equipment chargeable to it and which it is contemplated will be
paid therefrom;
b) To pay costs incidental to the refinancing of the Certificates of Indebtedness and Dormitory Revenue Bonds as herein contemplated;
c) To call and redeem University of Michigan Dormitory Revenue Bonds,
Series B, issued hereunder.
Section 7. The Obligor covenants and agrees that it will not terminate any
bonds guaranteeing the performance of the construction contracts now in force
and effect between the Obligor and any contractor or subcontractor engaged in
constructing the dormitories hereinbefore enumerated, or in enlarging and expanding the University of Michigan heating and power plant, or consent to the
alteration or modification of the terms and conditions of the same without first
obtaining the written consent of the Trustee to such termination, alteration, or
modification.
Section 8. The Obligor shall carry or cause to be carried such insurance
during the balance of the time that any of the dormitories herein enumerated are
under construction or during the balance of the time construction work is being
carried on upon the University of Michigan heating and power plant as the Trustee
may request. Such insurance shall be payable to the Trustee as its interest shall
appear.

completed and in operation, and in Robert Mark Wenley House, Michigan House,
Henry Carter Adams House, Chicago House, Alfred Henry Lloyd House, Alexander Winchell House, George Palmer Williams House, Charles Ezra Greene
House, Moses Coit Tyler House, Albert Benjamin Prescott House, Burke Aaron
Hinsdale House, Victor C. Vaughan Residence, and Madelon Louisa Stockwell
Hall, when the same are constructed and placed in operation, before any deductions are made therefrom.
The term "net income" shall mean and include any excess of room rents not
needed to cover the interest and principal payments to the Trustee herein provided for, together with the income from dining rooms to be operated in conjunction with said dormitories, and other service charges, after deducting from
the aggregate thereof the actual expenses, insurance premiums, and ordinary
repairs to buildings and equipment.
Section 1. The Obligor covenants and agrees as follows:
a) Beginning with the first semester of the 1939-1940 scholastic year of the
University of Michigan, to set aside out of the gross room rents to be collected
from students of the University of Michigan who shall reside and occupy rooms in
the dormitories above enumerated and out of the net income to be derived from
the operation thereof, and to pay to the Trustee on the dates hereinafter set forth,

Revenue Bonds issued hereunder are paid in full, the sum of Ninety-three Thousand One Hundred Dollars ($93,100.00); and on the first day of November, 1941,
and on the first day of November in each year thereafter until all Dormitory
Revenue Bonds issued hereunder are paid in full, the sum of Ninety-three Thousand One Hundred Dollars ($93,100.00). All monies so paid to the Trustee shall
be used solely for the payment of interest on the Dormitory Revenue Bonds issued
hereunder as it shall accrue and for the payment of principal of said bonds at
maturity or in the manner herein reserved.
b) In order that there may be funds available to meet each payment of
principal and interest to be made to the Trustee as provided for in the preceding
paragraph, the Obligor shall set aside a sufficient sum from said gross room rents
to assure that it will have funds available to meet the next such payment which
shall become due and payable to the Trustee, before diverting or using any of the
gross room rents from said students in any semiannual period between said payments for any other purpose.
c) That the Trustee shall have a first lien on the net income derived from
the operation of the dormitories above enumerated; and said net income is hereby
pledged to meet all payments herein provided for.
d) That it will set aside proper reserves for replacements and purchases of
necessary equipment, and for extraordinary repairs to buildings. Payments to said
Depreciation Reserve Funds shall be omitted or reduced whenever necessary in
order that the payments to the Trustee hereinbefore provided for may be made as
they shall fall due. Provided, however, that should any default be made in any
payment to said reserve funds, the same shall be made good out of the first surplus net income available. All reserve funds for depreciation shall be maintained
in cash or invested in such manner as shall be approved by the Obligor.
Section 2. The Obligor covenants and agrees that on or before October 15
of each year, it will pay over to the Trustee all net income derived from  the
operation of the dormitories above named for the preceding year, after meeting all
payments to the Trustee and for the Depreciation Reserve Fund hereinbefore
provided for.

Dormitory Revenue Bonds in the manner hereinbefore outlined, unless the Obligor
shall direct that said funds so paid be held by the Trustee in a reserve fund to
be designated as "Bond and Interest Reserve Fund." Provided, however, the
amount that may be held in said Bond and Interest Reserve Fund at any one
time shall be limited to One Hundred Eighty-six Thousand Two Hundred Dollars
($186,200.00).
The funds held in the Bond and Interest Reserve Fund which may be created
in the manner above provided shall be used by the Trustee for the following
purposes, to-wit:
a) To meet any payment of principal or interest which shall accrue on any
Dormitory Revenue Bond issued hereunder whenever the same shall be necessary
by reason of the failure on the part of the Obligor to meet some payment herein
provided to be made to the Trustee.
b) To reimburse the Obligor for any net loss resulting from the operation of
the dormitories above named.
NOTE: It is the intention of the parties hereto that any funds held in the Bond and
Interest Reserve Fund shall be held for the purpose of not only providing a reserve
to secure the payment of principal and interest on Dormitory Revenue Bonds issued
hereunder as the same shall become payable, but also to provide a reserve which
may be drawn upon by the Obligor should it suffer a net operating loss resulting
from the operation of the above-named dormitories during one or more years of
operation.
The Obligor shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to direct the Trustee to
use all or any part of the funds held by the Trustee in the Bond and Interest
Reserve Fund for the purpose of redeeming outstanding Dormitory Revenue
Bonds issued hereunder in the manner hereinbefore authorized.
Section 3. Until required for use, any monies in said Bond and Interest
Reserve Fund may be invested or reinvested in bonds or other evidence of debt
of the Federal Government or of the State of Michigan, or bonds or other evidence of debt guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Federal Government.

SECOND AUGUST MEETING, 1939


The Trustee, in making any investment of such funds, shall first secure a writing
approving such investment, executed by the Obligor. Any proceeds of said investments shall accrue to the benefit of the Obligor and shall be applied by the
Trustee in the same manner as if the same were net income paid to it under the
provisions of Section 2 of this Article.
Section 4. The Obligor covenants and agrees as follows:
a) That it will at all times keep the dormitories hereinbefore named in
operation while the said University of Michigan is in session, except during the
summer session when one or all of said dormitories may be operated or closed in
its discretion.
b) That it will at all times charge and use its best efforts to collect rates for
rooms, board, and other service charges sufficient to meet all payments to be
made to the Trustee as hereinbefore provided for, and to the Reserve for Depreciation Funds as herein set forth.
c) That it will, if necessary to meet payments to the Trustee herein required
and the payments to the Reserve Funds herein provided for, adopt such reasonable
rules, regulations, and requirements relative to the residence of students attending
the University of Michigan as shall be necessary to assure that said dormitories
will be as fully occupied during the regular scholastic year as reasonably possible.
Section 5. The Obligor reserves the right to use, in making any payments to
the Trustee herein provided for or for the purpose of retiring by redemption or
otherwise any Dormitory Revenue Bonds hereunder, any funds in its possession
which it may legally use for that purpose.
Section 6. The Obligor shall, out of the revenue derived from the operation
of the dormitories above named:
a) Pay the insurance premiums to keep said buildings insured against fire
and other hazards in an amount at least equal to the face value of all Dormitory
Revenue Bonds outstanding. (Provided, that in case the face value of the Dormitory Revenue Bonds outstanding shall be greater than the insurable interest in the
buildings, then the Obligor shall insure to their insurable value.) And in case
there shall be any dispute between the Obligor and the Trustee on how said
insurance shall be distributed between said buildings, the decision of the Trustee
shall be final, if reasonably exercised.
b) Pay the insurance premiums necessary to keep the contents of said dormitories above named insured in an amount equal, to their full insurable value or
such lesser amount as the Trustee shall consent to in writing.
All insurance shall be carried in Companies approved by the Trustee. All
policies of insurance shall be assigned to and deposited with the Trustee, and it
shall have a first lien on all payments made on the same up to but not to exceed
the face value of all Dormitory Revenue Bonds outstanding. In case of loss, the
proceeds of said insurance shall be applied by the Trustee to the repair or restoration of the building or buildings and contents thereof to their former condition, or
in such other manner as will make said building or buildings tenantable to the
satisfaction of the Trustee and the Obligor. Provided, however, if in the judgment
of the Trustee, funds received from said insurance policies or otherwise shall be
insufficient to make any building or buildings suffering such loss tenantable, then,
in that case, the Trustee may hold the funds paid to it by reason of such loss
for the benefit of the holders of all outstanding Dormitory Revenue Bonds.
The Obligor shall, also out of the revenue derived from the operation of said
dormitories, pay the insurance premiums necessary to provide "rental value
insurance" for said dormitories hereinbefore named, in an aggregate amount of
One Hundred Eighty-six Thousand Dollars ($186,000.00), to be prorated on said
buildings in the ratio to be fixed by the Trustee.
Section 7. The Obligor agrees to furnish to the Trustee a written statement
as of June 30 of each year on or before September 30 of each year, showing the
following:
If said dormitories are operated as more than one unit, said statement shall
show in detail the gross rents collected for rooms in each unit, the gross income
derived from the operation of each unit, and the dining room or rooms which
may be operated in conjunction therewith, the gross operating expense for each
unit during the preceding twelve-month period, the net income earned, and the
depreciation reserve set up for each unit.
If said dormitories shall be operated as a single unit, then said written statement shall be made up accordingly and shall give the information above set forth.

herein required to be kept or performed by the Obligor, and such default shall
continue for a period of sixty (60) days after written notice thereof is given to

request of the holders of twenty-five per cent (25%) in amount of Dormitory
Revenue Bonds then outstanding, the Trustee may:
a) Proceed to protect or enforce the rights of the Trustee and the holders
of the Dormitory Revenue Bonds either by mandamus to compel the Obligor to

equity thereon or upon in respect to this Agreement unless such holder shall
previously have given written notice to the Trustee of the existing default and
the Trustee shall have been afforded reasonable opportunity to exercise its power
hereunder and shall have failed to do so. Nothing contained in this paragraph
shall be construed as granting to the holder of any Dormitory Revenue Bond or
coupon secured hereby the right to bring any action or proceeding at law or in
equity which the Trustee is not expressly authorized to bring.

Second September Meeting, 1939
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, SEPTEMBER 27, 1939
The Board met at 2:10 P.M. in special session in the Regents'
Room at the call of the President.
Present, the President, Regent Cook, Regent Stone, Regent Lynch,
and Regent Crowley. Absent, Regent Beal, Regent Cram, Regent
Shields, Regent Hemans, and Superintendent Elliott. There were also
in attendance Vice-President Yoakum, Professor L. M. Gram, Dr.
F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G. Watkins, and the Secretary.
The President presented the following offer received from the
McGregor Fund, of Detroit:
The President and Board of Regents
of the University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, Michigan
Gentlemen:
The late Tracy W. McGregor of Detroit on several occasions evidenced his
interest in the astronomical work of the University of Michigan, and at his suggestion the Trustees of McGregor Fund commenced in 1934 to give the work of
the McMath-Hulbert Observatory of the University at Lake Angelus financial
support from the Fund.
Dr. Robert R. McMath has recently submitted to the Trustees preliminary
plans for an additional unit at the Lake Angelus Observatory, to consist of a
second solar tower and connected laboratory building. Estimates accompanying the
plans indicate a probable cost of $100,000 for construction and equipment. A copy
of the preliminary plans and estimate is handed to you with this letter.
Dr. and Mrs. McMath have assured the Fund of their readiness to give a
deed to the University, covering the land necessary for the construction of the
proposed tower and laboratory, and confirming also title to the land now occupied
by the present Observatory and tower now held by the University under a perpetual lease. These lands have been staked out and surveyors have been asked to
prepare a description for the deed. The deed will include the necessary right of
access from the highway.
McGregor Fund has made the necessary appropriation for the complete construction and equipment of the proposed tower and laboratory at a cost of no
more than $100,000, and is prepared to authorize the Director of the Observatory
to commence construction under his direction at once upon the acceptance by the
University of the gift of land from Dr. and Mrs. McMath and the buildings and
equipment from the Fund.
Dr. McMath has advised us that time is of great importance in the matter,
inasmuch as the work to be done at the Observatory being related to the present
cycle of the sun, activities should be gotten under way as soon as possible. This
suggests the rapid completion of the building, and the season of the year prompts
the wish for very early breaking of ground. Present business conditions make it
imperative that any orders for materials, particularly fine tools and optical equipment, be placed without delay. More than a year will be required to complete the
construction.
The enclosed copy of a letter from Dr. McMiath to the Fund indicates the
nature of the work to be undertaken. You are, of course, thoroughly familiar with
the distinguished character of the accomplishments to this date at the Observatory.
Another enclosure contains a proposed budget prepared by Dr. McMath,
covering operations at the Observatory when the new buildings and equipment are
added. The added operating expense over the present budget will, we understand,
commence early in 1941, after the construction is completed.
33




34           SECOND     SEPTEMBER       M1EETING, 1939
McGregor Fund has for several years appropriated $6,500 to the University
for the support of the work at the Observatory, in addition to other grants for
construction. The Fund is prepared to assure the University that it will appropriate $10,000 annually for maintenance and operation for the five years ending
June 30, 1941 to 1945 inclusive. This will leave approximately $7,500 per year
to be provided by the University after the new equipment is ready for use over
and above the present University annual appropriation of approximately $9,200.
Will you advise us of your action on this offer so that we may complete
arrangements with the Director for commencement of the construction?
Respectfully yours
RENVILLE WHEAT
September 25, 1939                  Secretary
After full discussion the proffer of the McGregor Fund was unanimously accepted in accordance with its terms and conditions and with a
vote of thanks to the McGregor Fund for its continued interest in
and support of the McMath-Hulbert Observatory.
The date of the next succeeding meeting was changed from Friday,
October 6, at 3:30 P.M. (p. 31) to Saturday, October 7, at 10:30 A.M.
The Board adjourned.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary




First October Meeting, 1939
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, OCTOBER 7, 1939
The Board met at 10:30 A.M. in the Regents' Room.
Present, the President, Regent Shields, Regent Cram, Regent Cook,

Regent Beal, Regent Crowley, and Regent Lynch, who later took his
seat. There were also in attendance Vice-President Bruce, Vice-President Yoakum, Professor L. M. Gram, Dr. F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G.
Watkins, and the Secretary.
The usual current financial reports were placed on file.
Messrs. Harley and Ellington, Detroit, Michigan, were selected as
architects to prepare plans and specifications for the University portion
of the proposed Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies,
Detroit Branch (p. 25). This appointment is subject to preparation of
a mutually satisfactory contract.
Professor Gram submitted preliminary plans for the Horace H.
Rackham School of Graduate Studies, Detroit Branch building. The
Board withheld approval of these plans until the proposed site of the
building shall have been definitely acquired by The Regents.
The following "Resolution Requesting Extension of Time" was
adopted (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 921):
Docket No. Mich. 1691-F
WHEREAS: The United States of America, through the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works, in compliance with a request of The Regents of the
University of Michigan, offered to assist, by means of a grant not to exceed
$232,830, in the construction of the Medical Building including necessary equipment, landscaping, the acquisition of necessary land and the demolition of existing
structures (herein called the Project known as Docket No. Mich. 1691-F), and
WHEREAS: The Regents of the University of Michigan by proper resolution
accepted said Offer made by the United States of America, and
WHEREAS: The offer specifies that the project shall be completed by January
17, 1940, and

Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Federal Works Agency, Public Works
Administration, is requested to amend the contract created by the acceptance by

Regent Cram reported that the 1939 meeting of the Association of
Governing Boards (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 897) is to be held at the
University of Texas, October 25 to October 28, and that one of the
matters to come before this Association is the proposal that it should
render active support and encouragement to the movement to procure
from  the Federal Government funds with which the state educational
institutions may carry on instruction and research in the social sciences
as well as in technical subjects. Regent Cram was named as an official
delegate from the Regents of the University of Michigan to attend
this meeting and was instructed to oppose the proposal herein recited
on the ground that any such subsidization by the Federal Government
would have the effect of taking away the independence of the state
universities and of subjecting them more or less to national control.
The Board approved the minutes of the meetings of June 16, June
26, August 4, August 18, September 18, and September 27 as submitted to the Regents in press proof.
The Board approved and ratified actions of the Finance Committee
as follows (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 956):

July 12, 1939
Present, the President, Regent Beal, and Regent Shields.
It having appeared that the course in Safety Education for which the sum
of $1,000 was placed in the budget of the Summer Session (R.P. 1936-1939, p.
916) would not fill, the committee transferred the sum of $644 from the budget of
the Summer Session to the Salary account of the Department of Industrial Education for the year 1939-1940. This sum of $644 will ultimately be reimbursed to
the University by the State Board of Vocational Education.
The balance of the original appropriation of $1,000, namely, $356, will revert
to General Funds at the close of the University year 1939-1940. The University,
therefore, will not finally spend any of the appropriation of $1,000.

Present, the President, Regent Beal, and Regent Shields.
Upon request of the Department of Economics and the Executive Committee
of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts as communicated by Dean

1939-1940 with half pay to sabbatical leave for the second semester of the
University year 1939-1940, with full salary. This change was thought advisable
due to leave of absence granted Professor William Haber for the University year
1939-1940 (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 907).
July 22, 1939
Present, the President, Regent Beal, and Regent Shields.
Upon recommendation of Dr. R. W. Waggoner, Director of the Neuropsychiatric

the Executive Committee of the Medical School, the committee placed Dr. Robert
Dieterle, Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, on a one-third-time
basis, effective September 1, 1939. This arrangement is made to enable Dr. Dieterle

basis. Dr. Waggoner will take over Dr. Dieterle's duties. Dr. Dieterle will attend
case conferences and staff meetings and consult with patients needing his services or
referred directly to him from other departments.
While this arrangement is for the period from September 1, 1939, to June 30,
1940, it may, upon Dr. Dieterle's request, and with proper approval, be continued
for such period as Dr. Dieterle may require, and The Regents approve, in order to
complete the book.

$900, which amount is guaranteed by Dean Bunting and Dr. Jeserich (R.P. 1936 -1939, p. 917).
July 31, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Shields.
On recommendation by Associate Professor Louis A. Hopkins, Director of the
Summer Session, and Professor John G. Winter, the committee approved the transfer of $352.66 from the Summer Session budget to the Salary budget of the
Museum of Archaeology as special compensation to Mr. Enoch E. Peterson for
work assigned to him during the Summer Session of 1939. This action is taken
because of the fact that Mr. Peterson is already employed on the twelve-month
basis (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 569).
The committee further approved the request of Professor Clifford Woody,
Graduate Adviser to Teachers Colleges, and Associate Professor Louis A. Hopkins, that a special course of two weeks' duration be authorized at Western
State Teachers College, August 7 to 18, inclusive, with a special tuition fee of
$15, with no refunds unless the registered student attends none of the work, and
with the further provision that the course will carry two hours' credit in the
Graduate School. The necessary funds are provided in the Summer Session budget.
This request had also the approval of Dean James B. Edmonson and Dean C. S.
Yoakum.

At the request and with the approval of Dean Edmonson, the committee accepted the sum of $2,800 from the American Council on Education, Washington,
D. C., to be used for payment of part of the salary of Dr. Willard C. Olson,
Professor of Education and Director of Research in Child Development in the
University Elementary School, to allow him to accept an invitation to assist in a
program on Child Development under the direction of Dr. Daniel A. Prescott, of

At the request and with the approval of Dean Edmonson, Vice-President

effective at the beginning of the University year 1939-1940.
Dr. Edgar G. Johnston, previously a full-time member of the staff of the
School of Education, was transferred for the major portion of his duties to the
Bureau of Co-operation with Educational Institutions, and his title changed from
Associate Professor of Secondary Education and Principal of the University High
School to one-third-time Associate Professor of Secondary Education in the School
of Education and two-thirds-time High-School Visitor in the Bureau of Co-operation with Educational Institutions. Dr. Johnston will receive a total salary of
$4,150, as at present, distributed as follows: $1,350 from the Salary budget of
the School of Education, Department of Education, and $2,800 from the Salary
budget of the Bureau of Co-operation with Educational Institutions, both on the
University-year basis. This action requires the addition of $600 to the budget
of the Bureau of Co-operation with Educational Institutions to provide the necessary funds.
The status of Dr. Harlan C. Koch, at present Assistant Director of the Bureau
of Co-operation with Educational Institutions, with salary of $4,400 for the University year, was changed to Half-time Assistant Director of the Bureau of Cooperation with Educational Institutions, beginning with the University year 1939 -1940, with compensation at the rate of $2,200 for the University year and Half-time

of $2,168 from the Salary budget of the University High School to the Salary
budget of the School of Education.

School, and Head of the Department of Mathematics in the University High
School, to Professor of Education, Director of Instruction and Head of the Department of Mathematics in the University High School, and Supervisor of Directed Teaching. No change in salary is indicated by this action-it is intended
to clarify the responsibilities of Dr. Schorling for his work in the University High
School.

The committee approved the proposal of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, offering the opportunity to give to senior dental students two weeks' field experience
in dental public health service, outlined as follows:
It is proposed that the two-week field experience for senior dental students
shall consist of one week in the county health department at which time
they will have an opportunity to observe the various health department programs and their relationship to specific health problems in the community.
This will consist of studying the administration of the health department,
the responsibilities of the various members of the health department staff,
as well as an opportunity of learning the specific programs that a health
department administers for the welfare of the people and the part that the
dentist in the community has in each of these programs. They will also have
an opportunity to observe how the various resources of a community can be
utilized to develop the health program, as well as the techniques used in
educating various community groups as to their responsibility in the total
health picture. The second week each student will be assigned to a private
dentist's office where he will have an opportunity of observing (1) the manner in which the dentist conducts his practice, (2) various operative techniques, (3) the dentist's relationship to the health department program, and
(4) the technics he uses to educate the people in his community as to the
value of dental service. The group will also have an opportunity of contacting and meeting the various community groups, as well as the dental
groups, by working with and studying the community health problems.
This proposal had the approval of, Dean Russell W. Bunting and Dr. Paul
H. Jeserich.
August 3, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Shields.
At the request of Dean Henry C. Anderson, the committee granted leave of
absence, with full salary, for a period of three weeks, beginning July 31, 1939,
to John Grennan, Instructor in Foundry Practice in the Department of Metal
Processing, College of Engineering. Mr. Grennan required an operation on July 31,

August 8, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Shields.
On recommendation by Dean James B. Edmonson and with the approval of
Dean C. S. Yoakum, the committee approved the details of the participation by
Professor Willard C. Olson in the program to be conducted by Dr. Daniel Prescott
of the Commission on Teacher Education of the American Council on Education
in Chicago during the University year 1939-1940 (p. 46).
It is understood that Dr. Olson will receive as salary $2,800 accepted by the
University from the American Council on Education and in addition will receive
$2,800, divided as follows: $2,000 from the Salary budget of the School of
Education and $800 from the Salary budget of the University Elementary School.
Under this plan Dr. Olson's salary will be $400 more than his allotted salary for
next year, but the increase is approved because of the additional expense involved
in carrying on a portion of his work in Chicago rather than in Ann Arbor. This
salary commitment is for the University year 1939-1940 only. The $2,400 saved
by this arrangement will be used on approval by the committee to provide personnel needed to carry forward certain of Dr. Olson's responsibilities in the School
of Education during the University year 1939-1940.
August 11, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Shields.

pally for secretarial help for which Professor John S. Worley made a special
request (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 681).
The Finance Committee filed the report of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell
and Company of their audit of the accounts of the University, including the University Hospital, for the year 1938-1939 (R.P. 1936-1939,
p. 674). The auditor's certificate was as follows:
To the Board of Regents of the
University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
We have examined the accounts of the University of Michigan for the year
ended June 30, 1939. In our opinion, based on our examination and information
furnished to us, the accompanying balance sheet and relative schedules referred
to therein, set forth the financial position of the University as at that date.
The University accounts are maintained on the basis of cash actually received
and disbursed, except that at the end of the fiscal year, in this instance, June 30,
1939, the Balance Sheet is adjusted to include accounts receivable uncollected
at that date. All invoices received prior to the closing of the books, and relating
to operating charges of the year ended June 30, 1939, were recorded and paid.
The several financial statements annexed hereto and forming part of our
annual report on the University, have been compared by us with the books of
account and found to be in accordance therewith.
PEAT, MARWICK, MITCHELL AND Co.
Certified Public Accountants
Detroit, Michigan
September 20, 1939
The Finance Committee made the following statement in writing:
We have examined the report of the audit of the books and accounts of the
University for the year ended June 30, 1939, made by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell
and Company, public accountants, and submit to The Regents the following matters of general information relating thereto:
In addition to the general statements made in the auditors' certificate, their
report states substantially as follows: That the cash in the hands of the University, both as to its own funds and as to funds held by it for the various trust
accounts and in other capacities, was confirmed by certificates from the several
depositaries and by actual count of the funds on hand; that the bonds, contracts,
mortgages, stocks, etc., were produced for their inspection or otherwise satisfactorily accounted for by certificates from custodians of these securities; that all
income from such securities has been properly accounted for and the sales and
purchases of such securities properly vouched or checked; that income from
specifically invested funds has been allocated properly and that income from consolidated investments has been prorated fairly and correctly to the participating
funds; and that expenditures from the trust funds under a general test were found
to be in accordance with the several deeds of gift.
The total of the so-called trust funds, exclusive of agency and deposit funds,
is approximately $15,725,000, an increase of nearly $500,000 during the year.
Notable changes in the trust fund investments are an increase of bonds of
$254,000 and a decrease of mortgages of $110,000. The investment reserves
against loss upon trust fund securities increased during the year from $183,000
to $260,000, or an increase of $77,000.
The audit report takes into account the financial transactions involved in the
PWA projects. The balance sheet, as of June 30, 1939, shows a total of University assets of $75,741,702.33. The comparative total for the year ended June
30, 1938, was $69,548,641.67, showing an increase during the year of a little over
$6,000,000. About $5,000,000 of this increase is accounted for by the new
lands, buildings and equipment and the cash to complete placed upon the books
during the year.
The report relating to the Hospital shows a net excess of revenues over expenditures of approximately $13,000, after transfer of $21,788.91 to the current hospital operating account to cover items properly chargeable to the accumulated
depreciation funds. The Hospital's accounts receivable of June 30, 1939, were
$688,614.77 and on the same date in 1938 were $468,596.63, showing an excess
this year over last of $220,018.14. Of the total on June 30, 1939, $555,106.84

FIRST OCTOBER MEETING, 1939


were due from the State of Michigan, and of the balance, $133,507.93, less than
5% were past due prior to April, 1939. -A reserve of $77,497.41 against bad debts
is carried on the books, which the auditors state should be adequate.
The report of the auditors and that of the Finance Committee were
accepted and placed on file and the annual Financial Report of the
Vice-President and Secretary for the year ended June 30, 1939, covered
by the above-recorded audit, was filed and was accepted and adopted
by The Regents as the report of the Board to the Governor of the
State. The usual number of copies was ordered printed.
Regent Stone filed the audit by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company, of the Michigan League and of all the University dormitories
(R.P. 1936-1939, p. 675) and formally placed on file the audit by
Miller, Bailey and Company of their audit of the Michigan Union for
the year ended June 30, 1939. This latter report had already been
informally placed before the Board by Regent Cook for the Michigan
Union Board but had not been formally filed until it could be included
with reports of other indicated University organizations.
For the Finance Committee Regent Stone filed the following report
of the net earnings of the dormitories, the Union, and the League.
This report and the report of the auditors were accepted and placed
on file.
Attached is a comparative statement of net income of the Michigan Union
and the Michigan League and of the ten dormitories of the University operated
during the years ended June 30, ~1939, and June 30, 1938, after provision for
depreciation on buildings and equipment. The tabulation is taken from reports
of examination of accounts by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell, and Company with the
exception of the Michigan Union the audit of which was made by Miller, Bailey,
and Company.
The improved earnings of the Michigan Union are attributed principally to
the increased rooming facilities. The improved earnings of the League are attributable principally to the decline in the cost of food on the table during the year
1938-1939. The increase in the net income of the Lawyers Club is due mostly
to the Club's system of bookkeeping which included in the operating expenses of
the year 1938 the loss in the sale of certain securities.
It is interesting to note that the total of reserves for depreciation of buildings
and equipment charged in the operating expenses for the year for the ten dormitories is $53,418.25. The financial condition of all the dormitories is sound. The
prospective loss on student accounts receivable is negligible. The buildings and
contents are adequately insured. They are in a good cash position, with fair cash
balances and cash assets. There are substantial reserves for depreciation on
buildings and equipment.
Regent Stone, as Chairman of the Finance Committee, filed the
audit by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company of the accounts of
the Board in Control of Physical Education and accompanied the auditors' report with the following statement:
The following is a statement of the more important items of information
taken from the report by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company upon examination
of accounts of the Board in Control of Physical Education for the year ended
June 30, 1939:
The total receipts for the year (collections in respect to Federal Admissions
Taxes being excluded from both receipts and disbursements) were $410,222.58, as
against $324,976.81 for the year 1938, an increase of about $85,000. The disbursements, including cost of plant additions, retirement of stadium bonds, interest
on stadium bonds, and payment of bank loans, total $386,796.63, as against
$326,656.78, or an increase in disbursements of about $60,000. Therefore the
excess of receipts over disbursements was $23,906.94 as against an excess of disbursements over receipts for 1938 of $1,679.97.

FIRST OCTOBER MEETING, 1939


The major portion of the additional receipts from sports is attributable to an
increase in net football receipts from $192,618.10 during 1937-1938 to $291,266.21 in 1938-1939, an increase of $98,648.11. The disbursements for football
alone were $75,788.28, thus leaving an excess of receipts over disbursements for
football of $215,477.93. All other sports were operated at a loss, amounting to
$59,425.11, thus leaving $156,052.83 profit from football to carry the other
expenses of the Board. Excess of all operating receipts over all disbursements for
the year was $151,746.94. From this was paid about $35,000 current interest on
the stadium bonds, $50,000 of the bonds, about $13,000 of plant additions, and
$30,000 of bank loans, leaving the net excess of receipts over disbursements
referred to above of $23,906.94.
The report contains full information respecting the situation as to the 10%
Federal Admissions Tax, which was tested in the United States Supreme Court in
the case of Allen vs. The Regents of the,University System of Georgia, the constitutionality of the tax being upheld by the Court. Reserves were created for
such of these taxes as were not paid to the Government. The total for the seven
years from 1932-1933 to and including 1938-1939 is about $176,000.
The stadium bonds were issued on October 15, 1926, in the amount of $1,500,000, with annual redemption of 1/20th of the principal, bearing interest at 3%.
If this redemption had been carried out, the total amount now outstanding would
have been $525,000. However, the years of the depression have very seriously
and adversely affected the receipts from sports. The amount of bonds outstanding
at this time is $1,087,100. The retirement program, therefore, is past due to the
extent of $562,000 of bonds.
The above firm of accountants also made an examination and separate report
of the records of the ticket division of the Board, in so far as they relate to
receipts from football games during the 1938 season. These receipts for the games
at Ann Arbor were traced as deposits to bank, and all transfers of funds to the
general accounts of the Board in Control were traced and found to be properly
recorded. Checks issued by the ticket office, etc., were inspected and disbursements
appeared to be in order. Test checks were made to satisfy the auditors that the
appropriate amount of cash had been recorded as receipts from tickets sold for
games at Ann Arbor. A test check of unissued tickets was also made. Complimentary tickets issued for the five Ann Arbor games averaged about 1,800 per
game and a total value for these games of about $20,000. Amounts paid to
opponent schools as their shares of gross receipts from games at Ann Arbor were
found by computation to be correct. Receipts from games played at opponents'
schools, as recorded in accounts of the ticket office, were supported by statements
issued by those institutions.
Routine comments only were made by the auditors in this report, and there
are no statements in it as to discrepancies and no recommendations as to procedure or systems of records, booking, etc.
The President reported for record the death, July 13, 1939, of Dr.
Warren Plimpton Lombard, M.D., Sc.D., Professor Emeritus of Physiology. Dr. Lombard was eighty-four years old. From 1892 until 1923,
when he retired from his professorship, he was a member of the
faculty of the Medical School, and his teachings and researches added
much to the prestige of the School during the period of his activities.
The President filed the following:
I report with regret the death of Dr. William Hiram McCracken, who for the
past two years has served as lecturer in Postgraduate Education, in the School of
Dentistry, and was appointed in June of this year Assistant Professor of Operative
Dentistry and Oral Hygiene. Dr. McCracken died in Detroit on September 14,
1939. He was thirty-eight years old and a native of Allegheny, Pennsylvania;
in 1923 he received the degree of D.D.S. from the University of Michigan and in
1925 the degree M.S.
I recommend that the foregoing record of Dr. McCracken's death be included
in the Proceedings of The Regents, and that the Secretary of the Board be instructed to convey to Dr. McCracken's family the heartfelt sympathy of The
Regents.
The Regents enacted the President's recommendation.
The President and the Vice-President and Secretary were authorized to execute certification of acceptance and release as prepared

FIRST OCTOBER MEETING, 1939


The status of Professor John W. Riegel was changed to the extent
that he appears on the salary roll of the School of Business Administration with salary of $5,000, twelve-month basis, and on the
budget of the Bureau of Industrial Relations, twelve-month basis, with
salary of $1,000. This change makes no difference in the total amount
paid to Dr. Riegel but merely reallocates the sums in the budget.
The sum of $300 was appropriated for a dinner to be tendered the
University Press Club during its annual session in Ann Arbor on Thursday evening, October 26.
The sum of $500 was set aside from the Baird Endowment fund
for secretarial assistance to Dr. Reuben Peterson, Professor Emeritus,
in the preparation of his history of the University Hospital (R.P. 1936 -1939, p. 527). It was expressly provided that no additional appropriation for this purpose would be made during the year 1939-1940.
The following changes were made in the terms and conditions of
the Margaret Kraus Ramsdell Fellowship, the changes being requested
unanimously by the donors of this fund (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 102):
For paragraph six of the communication in the Regents' Proceedings referred to
above which readsThe fellowship shall be used to assist students of the University of Michigan of Methodist affiliation who have been active in the work of the First Methodist Church of Ann
Arbor, or of the Wesley Foundation at the University of Michigan, to pursue studies
in religious education in this country or abroad or in preparation for the Christian
ministry.
there be substituted the following:
The fellowship is to be used to assist graduates of the University of Michigan to pursue
advanced studies in this country or abroad in religious education or in preparation for the
Christian ministry.
For paragraph seven which reads as followsFellows shall be selected by a committee consisting of the Dean of the Graduate School
of the University of Michigan, the Dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts of the University of Michigan, the minister of the First Methodist Episcopal Church
of Ann Arbor, the Director of the Wesley Foundation at the University of Michigan, and
a fifth member who shall be a member of the faculty of the University of Michigan and
of the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Ann Arbor. The fifth member of the committee shall be chosen by the first four named. Applications for the fellowship shall be
filed with the Dean of the Graduate School.
there be substituted:
Fellows shall be selected by a committee consisting of the Dean of the Graduate School,
the Dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and three additional members to be appointed by the first two. Of these three additional members two shall be
active ministers of Ann Arbor churches; the third shall be a member of the faculty of the
University of Michigan. The appointive members shall serve for' three years, and their
terms of office shall be staggered. They shall not be eligible for reappointment until after
the lapse of three years. The Dean of the Graduate School shall act as chairman of the
committee. Applications for the fellowship shall be filed with the Dean of the Graduate
School.
Paragraph twelve of the original communication be eliminated.
Assistant Professor George G. Ross, of the Department of Landscape Architecture, was designated as consultant in problems of Campus landscaping to succeed Messrs. Pitkin and Mott as of October 1,
1939 (R.P. 1926-1929, p. 839). Professor Ross's compensation for
this additional service is to be at the rate of $500 per year, or $375
for the period remaining in the present University year. This compensation is already provided in the budget.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to 10:30 A.M. Saturday, November 11.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary

to such claim which said parties mentioned in this paragraph, or any of them,
might have had or may now or hereafter have.
Seventh: Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore provided, it is agreed that
in the event of the pendency on December 31, 1941, of any claim or claims or

the Victor C. Vaughan House, under circumstances involved in the
opening of these houses for student occupancy before the buildings

102


SECOND OCTOBER MEETING, 1939


Miechanical Engineering, as a member of important committees, and more recently
as Director of Student-Alumni Relations and as Dean of the College of Engineering, served the University in a way which can be measured by no ordinary methods
of estimation, since all his words and acts were infused with the serenity of a
great and forceful character and were guided by the wisdom of a talented and
cultured mind. His gentle spirit made him the friend of all whom he met; his
high sense of honor led others to place implicit trust in him; his professional attainments gained him respect among colleagues everywhere. It was inevitable
that he should be singled out as one to whom the University might confide great
responsibilities in full confidence that the burdens would be carried and the duties
performed with tact and skill. By his sudden death this institution has suffered
irreparably, and has lost an officer whose presence on this campus, as an inspiration and an example of noble, purposeful living, can ill be spared. To Dean
Anderson's surviving family The Regents of the University of Michigan offer their
heartfelt condolences.
The Regents received from Mr. Henry M. Wallace, of St. Petersburg, Florida, as one of the executors of the last will and testament of
William  H. Hill, deceased, a request for further services of Professor
Emeritus Edwin C. Goddard. Professor Goddard appeared in the proceedings in the Sixth Judicial District of Florida, and his construction
of Mr. Hill's will was upheld by the Court. An appeal has been taken
from the decision of this Court to the Supreme Court of Florida, and
the action of The Regents is intended to continue Professor Goddard's
participation through the appeal proceedings.
The Board referred to the President and the Secretary with power
questions that may arise between the Alumnae Council and the University with respect to a site for the proposed co-operative dormitory
for women to be known as the Mary Bartron Henderson House, or
with respect to the erection of such building in due course (R.P. 1936 -1939, p. 851).
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to the date of the next regular meeting, November 11, 1939, at 10:30 A.M.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary




November Meeting, 1939

The Board met at 10:40 A.M. in the Regents' Room.

Harley and Ellington, architects of Detroit, similar to that already executed by
the Rackham Engineering Foundation for its portion of the proposed building,
covering plans and specifications for the University's portion of the Horace H.
Rackham School of Graduate Studies, Detroit branch, as may be satisfactory to
these architects and to a committee consisting of the President, the Vice-President
and Secretary, and Professor L. M. Gram, Director of Plant Extension.
The following resolution was adopted (p. 35):
WHEREAS, The preliminary plans, as revised on November 1, 1939, for the
proposed Rackham Educational Memorial Building for the joint use of the Engineering Society of Detroit and the University have been submitted by Harley &
Ellington, Architects, indicating that the University share of the cost of the

Therefore, be it Resolved, That on recommendation of the President, the VicePresident and Secretary, and Professor Gram these preliminary plans be approved
and that the architects be instructed by the Vice-President and Secretary to proceed with the preparation of working drawings and specifications in substantial
conformity thereto.
Upon recommendation of the University Building Committee, the

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1939                            111
Actions of the Executive Committee were approved and ratified
as follows (p. 42):
October 5, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Shields, and Regent Cook, appointed by
the President to act for Regent Beal during his illness.
Because of increased enrollment in the departments indicated, the committee,
at the request of Dean Anderson, to provide for necessary teaching assistance,
added the sum of $1,200 to the budget of the College of Engineering, to be distributed as follows:
Engineering English, Salaries..................................... $ 700
Mechanism and Engineering Drawing, Salaries.......................   200
Metal Processing, Salaries.......................................    300
Total....................................................  $1,200
October 6, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Shields.
With the understanding that all the suggestions recommended by Regent
Shields have been embodied in the final agreement, the committee granted permission to the Detroit Edison Company to construct, operate, and maintain certain
underground lines for the transmission and distribution of electric light, power, and
steam, under and across the University property located on the southwest corner
of Washington Street and State Street and known as Lane Hall.
The original request, dated September 2, 1939, had the approval of the President and Regent Beal, but the final agreement, as changed on the recommendations
of Regent Shields, was not signed by the President and the Vice-President and
Secretary until October 6, 1939, which accounts for the fact that Regent Beal's
name is shown as being one of the members of the committee who approved the
agreement, but who was ill at the time the final agreement was signed.
October 12, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Shields, and Regent Cook.
At the request of Dean E. Blythe Stason, the committee gave permission for
the engagement of four or five members of the University teaching staff to act
as proctors for Law School examinations during the present University year. It is
understood that those selected for this assignment are already employed on the
full-time basis but are as a rule in the lower salary brackets and that the rate
of compensation for proctoring is $1.00 an hour. No addition to the Salary
budget is necessitated by this action as the sum of $400 is provided for this
service in the budget of the Law School for 1939-1940.
October 14, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Shields, and Regent Cook.
The committee accepted, with appropriate thanks to the donor, from the
American Pharmaceutical Association through its Committee on Research Grants,
the sum of $400 for use by Dr. Justin L. Powers, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy, on a chemical study of viburnums. The fund is to be known as Viburnum
Research. The gift was accepted at this time because it is necessary to appoint
an assistant to Dr. Powers at once for the period from October 1, 1939, to July
31, 1940, using the total grant as salary for that period.
October 14, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Shields, and Regent Cook.
The committee accepted with grateful appreciation a check for $1,000 from
Mr. Laird Bell, Chicago, Illinois, to be used as salary for an investigator to study
the wildlife of the Huron Mountain Club lands and certain adjoining properties,
to the end that recommendations may be made to the Huron Mountain Club regarding the future of wildlife management policies. Dr. William H. Burt, Curator
of Mammals in the Museum of Zoology, is to be in charge of this investigation,
and Richard Hyde Manville, A.M., who will do the actual research work, is hereby
appointed Investigator in Wildlife Research, from October 1, 1939, to September
30, 1940, with compensation at the rate of $1,000 a year, twelve-month basis.
October 20, 1.939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Shields, and Regent Cook.
On request by Dean E. Blythe Stason, the committee approved the use of the
sum of $5,000 from the unexpended balance in the William W. Cook Endowment

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1939


fund, Research Office Expense account, by the William W. Cook Endowment
fund, Law Review account, to be available for the Michigan Law Review during
the fiscal year 1939-1940.
This action was necessitated because, in the preparation of the annual budget
from the William W. Cook Endowment fund, this item was inadvertently omitted.
October 23, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Shields, and Regent Cook.
The committee, on recommendation by Dean C. S. Yoakum, appointed Lucy
Dell Henry, M.D., Instructor in Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases in the Medical
School, with salary of $1,500 a year, twelve-month basis, as Clinic Physician in
the Institute for Human Adjustment (Speech Clinic) at the rate of $300 a year,
twelve-month basis, beginning October 1, 1939. This arrangement, it is understood, will continue until June 30, 1940, and no increase in the budget is necessitated by this action.
October 23, 1939
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Shields, and Regent Cook.
At the request of Dean James B. Edmonson, the committee granted sickness
leave of absence from October 18, 1939, to June 30, 1940, with salary of $1,115
for the University year to Selma A. Lindell, Teacher of 7Mathematics in the University High School. The remainder of Miss Lindell's salary, $1,400, will be used
as salary for others who will carry on her work during her absence.
Actions of the Operating Committee were approved and ratified as
follows (p. 60):
September 28, 1939
To provide sufficient funds for the payment of a full-time secretary in the
Department of Geography, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the
committee appropriated the sum of $450 as an addition to an amount of $600
already appearing in the Salary budget of that Department as salary for a fulltime secretary for the period from October 1, 1939, to June 30, 1940.
October 14, 1939
On recommendation by Dr. John Sundwall, the committee approved the use
of the sum of $100 in the Special Public Health Course trust fund, as an addition
to the item of $300 appearing in that budget as salary for an Assistant Sanitarian.
October 19, 1939
The committee approved the use of $300, appearing in the budget of the
Special Public Health Course trust fund under the item of Travel, as salary for
Albert McCown, M.D., who will offer certain courses in the Division of Hygiene
and Public Health during the University year 1939-1940.
October 20, 1939
The committee appropriated and added the sum of $300 to the Current account of the Laboratory of Vertebrate Genetics to provide for the care and cataloging of certain material which has accumulated during the past two years.'
October 26, 1939
The committee approved the use of $100 in the budget of the Physiology of
Respiration Research fund, to provide salary for the first semester of the University year 1939-1940 for David Francis Bohr, who has been appointed as Research
Assistant for that period.
October' 27, 1939
On recommendation by Dean Clare E. Griffin, the committee appropriated
the sum of $500 for outfitting a statistics laboratory in the School of Business
Administration. The equipment includes chairs, tables, calculating machines, and
certain alterations which must necessarily be made.
The Board recorded with sincere regret the death of Irving K. Pond,
C.E. '79, A.M. (hon.) '11, D. Arch. (hon.) '30, Visiting Lecturer in
Architecture, which occurred on September 29, 1939, at the age of
eighty-two, in Washington, D. C.
The President notified the Regents of the death of William Bruce
Dick, A.M., Teaching Fellow in Geography, which occurred October




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1939


113


28, 1939, in Hurley Hospital at Flint, as a result of injuries received
in an automobile accident, and the Regents adopted the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan extend their heartfelt sympathy to the family of Mr. William Bruce Dick, who, as a student in this
University and later as teacher and scholar in the Department of Geography, had
given promise of a distinguished and useful career. The Regents hereby record
their appreciation of the services which this gifted young alumnus had rendered
to his University and their genuine sorrow at the sudden and tragic termination
of a life which seemed destined to bring honor to himself and to the institution.
The Assistant Secretary placed on file a letter of appreciation from
Dean Emeritus Herbert C. Sadler with respect to the action in his
behalf recorded in the minutes of the meeting of October 7 (p. 42).
The Regents approved payment of the bill for legal services totaling
$889.40 presented by Burke and Burke for the quarter ended October
31. Of this total the sum of $518.80 is to be paid from Legal Fees
and Expenses, and the balance to be distributed among other appropriate funds (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 909).

The Secretary reported that the will of the late Mrs. Jessie Flora
Hinsdale, widow of Albert Euclid Hinsdale, A.B., '07, M.D., '06, contained the following provision:
Item 5. To the University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor, I give the sum of
Fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), to be held by it solely for the purpose of constituting and maintaining the Albert Euclid Hinsdale Memorial Fund, to be per



NOVEMBER MEETING, 1939                            115
petually invested in accordance with the laws of Michigan, made and to be made
in that behalf, and the income to be perpetually used for the sole purpose of aiding
worthy students who are enrolled and in residence at said University and pursuing
the course in Chemistry. Said aid may be given in the form of loan or gift at the
discretion of the management of said fund and in accordance with such rules and
practices of said University for the management of scholarship funds as may be in
force from time to time.
Item 6. In case of a deficiency of assets in my estate none of such deficiency
shall be charged against or fall upon said bequest in Item 5 hereof to the University of Michigan, and in case of a surplus of assets, said surplus shall be
added to the gift in said Item 5.
The Board voted that when the bequest of the late Mrs. Hinsdale
should be paid it would be accepted and administered in accordance
with the terms and conditions of her will.
The Board received and accepted in accordance with its terms and
conditions, and with a vote of thanks, the following proffer from an
anonymous donor:
I hereby give to the Regents of the University of Michigan the sum of $5,000
to found a permanent memorial to Martha Robinson Hawkins, the fund having
been in her possession at the time of her death. The gift is contingent upon the
acceptance of the following qualifications by the Regents:
1. This memorial shall be permanently known as the Martha Robinson Hawkins Scholarship.
2. The income from the fund given shall be set aside annually in outright
awards to successful candidates whose qualifications are hereinafter prescribed. If,
however, the annual income for any year should exceed $500 plus the nonresident
tuition fee for that year the excess shall be added to the principal until the fund
can provide two scholarships of proportions no greater than prescribed above. If
in any year no qualified and worthy candidate can be found the entire income
from the fund for that year shall similarly be added to the principal.
3. The awards shall be made by a committee of three, consisting of the
Registrar of the University, the Dean of Women, and the Dean of Students, or
their successors, under such general regulations as the University may subsequently
establish with regard to scholarship awards, the Dean of Students to be chairman.
4. For a trial period of three years applicants for this scholarship shall be
restricted to undergraduates from Maryland, Virginia, and Maine who at the time
of their candidacy, having completed at least one full academic year's work in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, are enrolled in the said College.
If at the expiration of three years, however, it is apparent that the geographical
limitation is too strict to provide satisfactory candidates, the scholarship is to be
open to candidates from other states, provided that a preference is always given
to those from the three states named.
5. In making the award the committee shall take into consideration promise
of distinguished personality, distinction in moral character, distinction in scholarship, and the need for financial aid. In general it is intended that this grant shall
be used to assist those students of unusual promise and ambition who are in real
need of financial help; it is not designed for students whose need is only temporary.
6. If the need for which this fund is created should cease to exist the income
may be used for other purposes as nearly similar to the original purpose of the
gift as possible, provided that no part of the income be used for any purpose
whatever without due credit given to its source.
Dean Dana reported that on October 27. 1939, a burr oak, in honor
of former President James Burrill Angell, was planted in the open space
between Alumni Memorial Hall and the Romance Language Building by
the timberland members of the Land Utilization Conference at their
annual meeting in Ann Arbor under the auspices of the School of Forestry and Conservation. The tree was presented in behalf of the group
by State Senator George P. McCallum, whose remarks on the occasion
were placed on file, and was accepted on behalf of the University by
President Ruthven (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 791).

132


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1939


The Board further approved the following regulations concerning
employment of the Faculty for the Summer Session, as recommended
by the Executive Committee of the Summer Session.
1. All elementary and general courses shall be elected by at least eight
students.
2. Courses designed primarily for graduates shall be elected by at least five
students.
3. The Director of the Summer Session in consultation with the administrative representative of the College or School concerned shall have authority to
sanction courses with a smaller number of students in especially urgent cases.
4. In case a course is not elected by a sufficiently large number of students
to warrant sanctioning the same as a full course by the Director of the Summer
Session, the instructor offering such course may at his option and with the approval of the Director either withdraw the course or give it at an agreed reduced
compensation.
5. Teachers on temporary summer appointments will be required to take the
oath prescribed by the statutes of Michigan, viz., "I do solemnly swear (or
affirm) that I will support the constitution of the United States of America and
the constitution of the State of Michigan, and that I will faithfully discharge
the duties of my position, according to the best of my ability."
6. All members of the faculty are expected to be present at the University
on Thursday morning preceding the opening of classes in order to participate in
the registration of students.
7. All instructors shall file in the office of the Summer Session at the close
of the first week of the session the names of all students registered in their classes.
8. Salaries are payable in one payment after the completion of the courses
and the filing of examination reports. In the Law School salaries are paid at the
close of each term.
The Board authorized the employment of a stenographer-clerk in
the office of the Director of the Orientation Period and Counselor to
New   Students beginning November 2, 1939, at salary of $1,140 a
year, twelve-month basis. For the balance of the present fiscal year
this necessitates, and the Regents made, an appropriation from          general funds of $756.81, which was added to the Salary account of the
Office of the Dean of Students.
The Regents gave approval to the holding of a conference upon the
campus of the University of Michigan in August, 1940, sponsored by
the Progressive Education Association of the United States and the
sister organization in Canada. The Progressive Education Association
is a section of an international organization known as the New Education Fellowship. Conditions abroad may make it impossible to hold the
proposed American conference in 1940. In the event the conference
is held the Board of Governors of the Horace H. Rackham School of
Graduate Studies will present a budget and recommend an appropriation from research funds to aid the organization and the University in
financing the conference.
The Board approved the following expenditures from            the President's Special Fund No. 2 (p. 92 and R. P. 1936-1939, p. 503):
To Herman Godfrey Klimmek, Adrian Gillesse, and Weldon Hartley Wilson, grants
of $60 each
To the Academic Counselors, Assistant Professor Arthur Van Duren, Jr., Chairman, the sum of $350 to be used by them, when in their judgment it is
necessary, as an emergency-aid fund for students who are in immediate need
of assistance, with the provision that no student is to receive more than
$15 from this fund at any one time

that the remaining unimproved lots in a Bay City subdivision, coming

paid as they accrued because the value of the lots did not justify such

WHEREAS, Part of the supplementary grant was to cover the cost of the installation of an elevator which was contemplated being installed as a Change Order
on the General Contract, and competitive prices had been taken, when, at the
request of PWA it was found necessary to advertise for bids to let a separate
contract for this work, and
WHEREAS, The time required for advertising for bids and to check shop
drawings on the elevator being installed on Contract No. 11, together with the
difficulty that the contractor has encountered in obtaining satisfactory delivery
of materials, particularly door frames and casings, will make it impossible to
complete this and adjoining portions of the work on or before December 22, and
WHEREAS, The manufacturer of asphalt tile shipped to the job, in error, a

placed until proper material had been received, and
WHEREAS, A labor dispute between December 1 and December 7 by the
carpenters' and and painters' refusal to work upon material being supplied by a
non-union mill, caused a delay of a week in the installation of finished trim, and

Manufacturing Company on Contract No. 13, cannot be expected to be completed
by December 22, due to the time necessary to manufacture and install this
equipment, and
WHEREAS, Due to the above delays, which were not considered in our first
request for extension of time, it will require approximately six weeks to complete this project,
Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Federal Works Agency, Public
Works Administration, is requested to further waive the provision of the contract

WHEREAS, There was a delay experienced in obtaining the exterior mill work,
on account of the mill working company putting all time on the job which had
been ordered earlier, and
WHEREAS, A shortage of slate roofers caused a delay in the job by not
completing the roofing as speedily as it should have been, thus holding up plastering and other operations which could be damaged by the weather, and
WHEREAS, A labor dispute on this project started on Friday, December 1,
and was not settled until Thursday, December 7, and
WHEREAS, Due to the above delays, which were not considered in making our
first request for extension of time, it will require approximately five weeks to
complete this project, and

January Meeting, 1940


UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, JANUARY 26, 1940
The Board met at 3:40 P.M. in the Regents' Room.
Present, the President, Regent Crowley, Regent Shields, Regent
Lynch, Regent Kipke, Regent Herbert, Regent Hemans, Regent Cook,
and Regent Cram. Absent, the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
There were also in attendance Professor L. M. Gram, Vice-President
Bruce, Vice-President Yoakum, Provost Stason, Dr. F. E. Robbins,
Mr. H. G. Watkins, and the Secretary.
Professor Gram orally presented the status of the various items in
the PWA building program to date.
The following resolution was adopted:
RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS
Resolved, That during the interim between January 31, 1940, and March 1,
1940, the Committee on Plant and Equipment of the Regents of the University
of Michigan, consisting of Regent Cook, Regent Crowley, and Regent Lynch, be,
and it is hereby authorized and empowered to act for, on behalf of, and in the
name of the Regents of the University of Michigan in making awards of contracts
in connection with the University building program now being carried on with
grants-in-aid from the Public Works Administration. All contracts so awarded
shall be deemed to have been let, and shall have the same effect in all respects
as though they had been let by the Regents themselves.
The Secretary filed the usual current financial reports.
The minutes of the meeting of December 15, 1939, were approved
as submitted to the members of the Board in press proof.
The following statements were adopted (p. 137):
With the close of the year 1939 there came to an end the sixteen-year term
of service of Regent Ralph Stone. Next to Regent Junius E. Beal, he had served
the University longer than any of his colleagues at the time of his retirement.
During this entire period he was Chairman of i the Finance Committee and during
a part of the time he was a member of the Executive and other standing committees as well as of numerous special committees. One of his first services on coming
upon the Board was the provision for an annual audit of the University's books
by public accountants of such standing and widespread reputation as to give
respect everywhere to their certificate. Regent Stone has been interested in every
phase of University activities; his concern with University athletics and journalism, when a student, has carried through into his official years. But his primary
interest and responsibility throughout his sixteen years as a Regent have lain
in the care of the University trust funds. These increased from the round sum
of $1,300,000 when he came on the Board to $16,000,000 when he left it. We,
his colleagues, shall miss his knowledge, his judgment, his fairness and consideration, and his cheerful, direct energy. At this, the first meeting following his
retirement, we desire to go on record in admiration for him as a man and as a
devoted official of the University, and we' therefore direct that this statement be
incorporated in the minutes of this meeting and that a copy hereof be sent to
Mr. Stone with our congratulations and our best wishes for his future.
Thirty-two years ago, on January 11, 1908, Junius Emery Beal became a
Regent of the University of Michigan. At the time of his retirement from office,
December 31, 1939, he had completed a term of service longer than that of any
predecessor in the entire history of the institution, and one which was characterized by a high measure of ability and trustworthiness. His special knowledge of
Ann Arbor and its people, among whom he had lived all his life, was constantly
169




170                 JANUARY      MEETING, 1940
of value to the University in its dealings with the community in which it is
situated. His broad sympathies and practical interests permitted him to participate effectively in matters concerning the welfare and activities of students. His
intimate acquaintance with the University, in all of its phases, gained first as a
student and later by patient study of the problems of the various departments and
units, led six successive presidents of the University to call frequently upon him
for counsel and assistance and the Regents to impose upon him, from the beginning to the end of his term of office, the responsibility of membership in their
Executive Committee. Few men, as regents or as officers or faculty members,
have so long and so faithfully kept the interests of the University of Michigan
uppermost in heart and mind. His colleagues upon the Board of Regents have
come to look upon him as a monument of loyalty and dependability, and upon
his conduct of his office as a pattern and a standard which all public servants
might well attempt to emulate. They have also come to respect and love him for
his unassuming friendliness, the comely dignity of his life, and his steadfast
adherence to ideals. To him, as he lays down the office which he has filled so long
and with such distinction, the Regents of the University of Michigan express their
affectionate felicitations, and their hopes for health and happiness in the years
to come.
The following letter was presented (p. 25):

JANUARY MEETING, 1940


ing a total of 5,115 names as compared with 5,066 names for the month
of November, 1938. The largest increase in any of the departments
or divisions of the University was in the dormitory personnel which,
owing to the opening of the new residence halls, had increased from

the contraction under the working of the Crippled and Afflicted Children's acts, had lessened by 350 persons, and the Buildings and Grounds

completion of those buildings on which the University force itself
performed the mechanical trades (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 826).

from the salary originally allocated to the late Professor Max Handman
(p. 91). Dr. Wynne was formally appointed Associate Professor of
Economics for the first semester of 1939-1940, at the meeting of October
7, 1939, but by error record thereof was omitted from the minutes.
The Board accepted the resignation of Professor George R. LaRue
as Director of the Biological Station and Custodian of the Bogardus
Tract, effective October 31, 1939, embodying this acceptance in the
following resolution:
Resolved, That in accepting the resignation of Professor George R. LaRue
as Director of the Biological Station and Custodian of the Bogardus Tract, the
Regents of the University of Michigan place on record their deep appreciation
of the constructive leadership which Professor LaRue has given to this important
University activity during the twenty-three years of his directorship, of the devotion
with which he has carried out the duties of the office, and of the judgment and skill
which he has manifested in establishing and maintaining the high standards of instruction and research which characterize the work of the Station.
To succeed Professor LaRue as Director of the Biological Station
and Custodian of the Bogardus Tract, the Regents appointed Assistant
Professor Alfred H. Stockard, with compensation to be later determined.
The Board further authorized the President to appoint an advisory
committee for the Biological Station, to consist of the Director as
Chairman ex officio, with three additional members, ordinarily to be
appointed for terms of three years each, the first three, however, to be
appointed with staggered terms so that one vacancy shall occur each
year. This committee is to assist in the selection of staff, in planning
programs of instruction and research, and in determination of major
policies, subject to review by the appropriate department of the University.
The following appointments to and changes in the teaching staff of
the Summer Session of 1940 were made, all being within the budget

The Board made certain salary adjustments within the budget in
accordance with recommendations presented by the Committee on
Office Personnel (p. 164).
The salary of Dr. Paul H. Jeserich, Professor of Operative Dentistry, Director of the Operative Clinic, and Director of Postgraduate
Education, in the School of Dentistry, was increased from a total of
$8,150 to a total of $10,000 a year, twelve-month basis, beginning with
September 1, 1939. This increase of $1,850 is to be provided from the
Kellogg Dental Postgraduate Fund, from which Dr. Jeserich now
receives $3,000 a year. His adjusted rate of pay will be allocated as
follows: from the budget of the School of Dentistry, $5,150; from the
Kellogg Dental Postgraduate Fund, $4,850.
The salaries of certain employees of the University Hospital were
increased by 60~ a month and certain other employees by 75~ a month,
these monthly additions being the amount required for participation in
the Michigan Society for Group Hospitalization (R.P. 1936-1939, p.
851). The monthly increases specified are limited to persons receiving
less than $200 a month. In view of the above monthly allowances for
hospitalization all free inpatient hospitalization for employees of the
University Hospital was discontinued and the following outpatient program was made effective for employees of the University Hospital:
1. No charge to be made for professional service rendered University Hospital
employees by physicians of the University Hospital unless the employee requests
the personal attention of a part-time staff man.
2. All drugs, appliances, special tests, and diagnostic procedures (except
x-rays) to be furnished employees of the University Hospital at prevailing State
rates, which represent as nearly as possible the cost to the Hospital.
3. By virtue of employment in; the University Hospital it may be necessary
to use x-ray service frequently for protection of personnel, hospital patients, and
family. All x-rays to be furnished employees of the University Hospital at a
50 per cent discount from prevailing State rates. All x-rays and examinations
involved at the time of employment examination to be without charge to the
individual.
4. Maintenance personnel not receiving cash remuneration, namely, student
nurses, student dietitians, student anesthetists, and interns to receive all outpatient service, supplies, drugs, tests, and so forth, without charge except in those
cases where the employee upon appointment has some existing condition which
needs special attention, such as the furnishing of insulin to a student suffering
from diabetes at the time of appointment. In such cases necessary drugs are
to be supplied at cost to the Hospital.
5. The above recommendations not to change existing schedules for sick-leave
allowance with pay.
Leave of absence for the month of February, without pay, was
voted to Harry 0. Potter, Assistant to the Director of Engineering
Research.
Leave of absence from January 11 to April 10, 1940, with pay,
was voted to Dr. John Alexander, Professor of Surgery. Dr. Alexander's work will be carried by his colleagues without additional compensation during his absence (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 462).
Notice was filed of leaves of absence as follows, approved by the
Office Personnel Committee (p. 165):

JANUARY MEETING, 1940


The following University officials were authorized, beginning January 1, 1940, to subscribe for retirement annuities, under the usual terms
and conditions, at the joint expense of themselves and of the University. The required sum, not to exceed $1,227.50, as the University's
quota for the present fiscal year, was added to the budget:
Dr. Edward W. Blakeman, Counselor in Religious Education
Walter L. Bulbick, Purchasing Agent
R. Gordon Griffith, Associate Investment Officer
Dr. A. C. Kerlikowske, Assistant Medical Director and Chief Resident Physician.
University Hospital
Kenneth W. Morgan, Director of Student Religious Association
Walter B. Rea, Assistant Dean of Students
Julius E. Schmidt, Investment Officer
Francis Shiel, Business Manager of Residence Halls
Boyd C. Stephens, Cashier
Herbert P. Wagner, Chief Accountant
Dr. Robert L. Williams, Assistant Registrar
Dr. Lloyd S. Woodburne, Assistant Dean, College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts
The sum of $6,480.72 was appropriated for the graduate work in
the three teachers colleges which, jointly with the University, are giving work during the present academic year (R.P. 1936-1939, pp. 626 -627).
The sum of $784.50 was voted to the equipment account of the
Department of Botany.
The sum of $200 was added to the salary budget of the Bureau of
Co-operation with Educational Institutions, for use in employing Dr.
Leon Stephen Waskiewicz as a Part-time High-School Visitor from
January 8 to May 31, 1940, with compensation of $200 for the period.
A total sum of $2,250 was added to the budget of the Summer
Session for use as follows: $500 to provide a course for an expected
group of twenty-five graduate students serving as Educational Advisers
in the CCC camps of the Sixth Corps Area; and $1,750 for a group
of courses, graduate and undergraduate, in education and public health,
these courses to be given at Marshall, Michigan, to a group of fifty
selected teachers. Fees for the CCC Advisers' course will be $20 for
the period and for the Teachers' course, $35 for the period.
The Regents approved expenditure of not to exceed $1,760 from the
income account of the William W. Cook trust for the purpose of completing, with proper landscaping, the monument erected to the late
Mr. W. W. Cook on the site of his Westchester country home. The
work on the memorial thus far done, paid for out of the funds of the
estate, has not produced an entirely satisfactory result. It is believed
that this further proposed expenditure will produce a completed and
effective whole.

The Board established "The W. K. Kellogg Foundation Institute:
Graduate and Postgraduate Dentistry," to be housed in the building
now being completed known as Project No. Mich. 1669-F (p. 151).
This Institute is to operate on a budget separate from that of the
Dental School, and to be maintained by special appropriations from the




188


JANUARY MEETING, 1940


University, from   the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, and from       any other
sources which may be available. Dr. Paul Harold Jeserich was appointed as Director of the Institute, his title hereafter to be Professor
of Operative Dentistry, Director of the Operative Clinic, and Director
of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation Institute: Graduate and Postgraduate
Dentistry, effective this date (p. 185).
The following changes in the curriculum of the Department of
Aeronautical Engineering were made on recommendation of the Faculty
of the College of Engineering:
(1) Change of name, but not content, of required courses:
a) Aero. Eng. 4, From Airplane Structures to Elementary Airplane Structures
b) Aero. Eng. 23, From Advanced Airplane Structures to Airplane Structures
(2) Aero. Eng. 15a, Advanced Theoretical Aerodynamics, three hours credit,
dropped.
(3) Three new courses added:
a) Aero. Eng. 28, Airplane Design Load Distribution. Two hours credit.
b) Aero. Eng. 29, Mechanics of Fluid Resistance. Two hours credit.
c) Aero. Eng. 30, Advanced Airplane Structures. Three hours credit.
The Regents approved for an indefinite period deductions by the
Business Office from payrolls of May 31 each year of the annual dues
to the University Club, whenever such procedure shall have been requested by members of the Club who are on the University payroll
and who have not paid their current dues to the University Club before
the month of May in any given year.
The Board declined the request of Mr. Lawrence E. Howard to
be enrolled in the University as a resident of the state of Michigan.
Associate Professor L. J. Carr filed with the Board a statement of
the needs of the Michigan Child Guidance Institute for larger quarters
for the Institute.
The Secretary reported on certain correspondence he had had with
a representative of a union of hotel, restaurant, and dormitory employees.
The following resolution was adopted (pp. 8-22):
WHEREAS, The Regents of the University of Michigan entered into a Trust
Agreement with the Ann Arbor Trust Company, which Agreement is dated as of
the first day of August, 1939, in which, among other things, The Regents agreed
that on or before the fifteenth day of January, 1940, barring strikes, fire, cyclone
or other acts of God, it would cause to be completed dormitories to be known
as: Charles Ezra Greene House, Moses Coit Tyler House, Albert Benjamin Prescott House, and Burke Aaron Hinsdale House, and furnish and equip the same
in sufficient time to make the same available for occupancy at the beginning of
the second semester of the 1939-1940 scholastic year of the University of Michigan, and
WHEREAS, After careful consideration of all of the factors affecting the
matter of the time of opening said dormitories, it is the opinion of The Regents
that the opening of said dormitories should be delayed until the commencement
of the 1940-1941 scholastic year of the University of Michigan, and
WHEREAS, Such a delay will constitute a default under said Trust Agreement
which would entitle the Trustee to exercise certain rights thereunder, and
WHEREAS, Under the provisions of Section 5 of Article VI of said Agreement, the Trustee may, and upon request of a majority in amount of the outstanding bonds issued thereunder, waive any such default, and
WHEREAS, It appears that even if said dormitories are not placed in operation until the beginning of the first semester of the 1940-1941 scholastic year
of the University of Michigan instead of the second semester of the 1939-1940
scholastic year as originally anticipated, the net earnings of the other dormitories
mentioned and pledged in said Trust Agreement will be amply sufficient to provide




JANUARY MEETING, 1940


189


for all payments to be made to the Trustee as provided for in said Agreement
prior to the opening of said above-mentioned dormitories as herein contemplated:
Now, therefore, be it Resolved, By The Regents of the University of Michigan,
that Shirley W. Smith, its Secretary, be and he is hereby authorized and directed
to request in writing that the said Ann Arbor Trust Company as Trustee under
said Trust Agreement waive said default and thereby permit the delaying of the
opening of said above-mentioned dormitories until the commencement of the
1940-1941 scholastic year of the University of Michigan.
Be it further Resolved, That a certified copy of this Resolution be attached
to the request for the waiving of said default, with the understanding that if
said default be waived, the provisions herein shall be binding on The Regents of
the University of Michigan.
The terms and conditions of the Phi Sigma Society Loan fund (R.P.
1932-1936, p. 845) were on request of the Society altered as follows:
1. Loan to be used in study at the Biological Station of the University of
Michigan.
2. Both graduate and undergraduate students shall be eligible for the loan.
Preference shall be given, however, to students who have been enrolled in the
University of Michigan for at least one semester.
3. Formal application for the loan must be made to the University Committee on Student Loans. Selection of the recipient of said loan shall rest with this
committee, subject to approval of the Director of the Biological Station.
4. In the event that, in the opinion of the said Regents, the needs to meet
which this bequest is made should pass out of existence with the passage of time
or not require all of the income provided, then the said Regents are hereby
expressly given authority and charged with the duty to use; the said income or so
much of it as in their discretion may seem for the best advantage of the University, for other purposes allied to or in harmony with the spirit and purpose
of this request as above expressed; or if such approximation of our specific purpose is in the discretion of the Regents inexpedient or impracticable then and
in that event the Regents shall use the income for whatever educational or University needs they may see fit, as trustees of the University in general and of this
fund in particular, since it is our purpose and intent that the income shall not
lie idle and useless but shall be active and useful in contributing currently to the
benefit of mankind through education.
The President and the Vice-President and Secretary were authorized to execute certification of acceptance and release as prepared by
the Trustees of the estate of the late William W. Cook for the year
ended June 30, 1939. Approval was likewise given for payment of the
usual annual fees, and general authority given to the President and
the Vice-President and Secretary to execute similar certifications and
make similar payments in future years if on examination by the University Accountant the reports of the Trustees are found to justify
such action (p. 64).
The Regents approved the traveling-expense vouchers of Regent
Hemans in the sum of $67.79 for the period from January 31 to
December 5, 1939, inclusive.
The annual report of the Board in Control of Physical Education
for the year ended June 30, 1939, was placed on file by the President,
as submitted to each Regent individually by Professor Ralph W.
Aigler (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 848). Extracts from the report are as follows:
On behalf of the Board in Control of Physical Education, this annual report
covering the period from July 1, 1938, to June 30, 1939, is presented. As to
matters other than financial the limits of the fiscal year are ignored.
The membership of the Board has been the Director of Intercollegiate Athletics, ex officio; Professors Aigler, Anderson, Badgley, Boak, Gram, Mitchell,
Smith, and Woody of the University Senate; Charles B. DuCharme of Detroit,
James E. Duffy of Bay City, and George C. Patterson of Flint, representing the
alumni; and James W. Rae of Toledo, Ohio, and Harold Davidson of Grand
Rapids, Michigan, representing the students.

Obviously the outstanding feature of this comparative tabulation is the
marked increase in receipts from "sports." This increase is due almost entirely
to football.
The profit derived from operations exceeds that of the preceding college year
by almost the same amount by which the football receipts increased, thus indicating that with the exception of that one item, the operations of the fiscal year
covered by this report in net result almost duplicated those of the preceding
year.
Expenditures for what might be designated "capital" accounts amounted to
$127,654.33, consisting of interest of $34,435.00, loans paid off, $80,000o00 (of
which $50,000.00 was in respect of bond retirements), and $13,219.33 in plant
additions.
The following table shows the attendances at the eight football games played
during the fall of 1939. These attendance figures are not official but are substantially accurate.

For sake of comparison the following table showing the official attendances for
the eight games of the season 1938 is presented.
Michigan State College......... 73,589
University of Chicago.......... 22,976
University of Illinois........... 43,006

University of Minnesota.........  54,212

393,208
It will be noticed from the above table showing attendances for the fall ot
1939 that it discloses an attendance at the five home games of 297,090. In last
year's annual report a table was presented showing the attendances at the home
games during each one of the twelve seasons during which the present stadium
has been in use. That table which showed a total attendance of 2,433,366 also
showed a maximum attendance of 286,527 for the season of 1927 and a minimum
attendance of 122,560 for the season of 1934. The average attendance for the
sixty-three games played in the present stadium was stated to be 38,624. The
average attendance for the five games of the season just closed is 59,418, and
the total attendance, it will be observed, exceeds that for the year 1927 which
set the high mark prior to the present year.
At the meeting of the Board held early in December, it was voted to call for
retirement 150 of the outstanding bonds issued by the "Board in Control of
Athletics." These bonds, with a face value of $75,000 together with accrued
interest, were called for payment as of December 15, 1939. One interesting fact
should be noticed in this connection. Each year an increasing number of bondholders, whose bonds have been chosen by lot for retirement, have indicated their
wish not to receive payment. Of the 150 bonds called for payment in December,

The Regents of the University of Michigan hereby record their deep sorrow
at the death of Dr. David Murray Cowie, Professor of Pediatrics and Infectious
Diseases in the Medical School of this University, and their appreciation of the
attainments and the services of this loyal alumnus of Michigan who became a
member of its staff forty-four years ago. Constantly alive to the need for research
upon the cause and treatment of disease, Dr. Cowie contributed importantly to
medical knowledge; at the same time, throughout his career, he employed in active
medical practice his skill and his talent for human relationships. His success as a
physician and scientist is attested by the honors conferred upon him by his
colleagues, by the respect and affection which he inspired in his students, and by
the confidence reposed in him by thousands of patients. In testimony of the
great loss which the University of Michigan has suffered in Dr. Cowie's lamented
death, and in token of their sympathy with his surviving family, the Regents have
directed that this memoir be incorporated in their official Proceedings, and that
a copy thereof be sent to Mlrs. Cowie by the Secretary of the Board.

FIRST MARCH MEETING, 1940


From the Joint Committee on Health Education, Grand Rapids, through Dr. B. R.
Corbus, Chairman, $600 for the Joint Committee on Health Education fund
(p. 67)
The University has received from the National Research Council, under dates of
February 20 and February 23, checks for a total of $2,887.50, being the first
two of eight monthly payments on a grant of $7,700. This is for research by
Assistant Professor Edward B. Greene and Assistant Professor Emerson W.
Conlon in visual instruction on the so-called link trainer prior to actual flight
training. The link trainer is a device for producing upon the ground identical
conditions, with the obvious exceptions, experienced by students in flight
training. The funds originate with the United States Government, though they
come to us through the National Research Council and cover expenditures for
the period from November 1, 1939, to June 30, 1940.
The Timken Roller Bearing Company, Canton, Ohio, has forwarded to the University a check for $1,000 to finance a Symposium on Vibration Problems
in Engineering during the Summer Session of 1940. This Symposium is to
be under the direction of Professor Stephen Timoshenko, formerly on the staff
of the Engineering College of this University, now of Stanford University.
Proffer from Mr. Dexter M. Ferry, Jr., Detroit, to finance the publication cost of
the Encyclopedia, at an estimated amount of $6,000 (p. 155)
The Regents accepted in accordance with the stated terms the sum
of $460.47, all as set forth in the following letter from Kenneth
Morgan, Director of the Student Religious Association:
We have deposited with you a cashier's check for $460.47, payable to the
Student Christian Association. This money is from an account at the Ann Arbor
Savings and Commercial Bank which was forgotten by the Y.W.C.A. when it was
absorbed by the Student Christian Association in 1927. Since the Student Religious
Association is the successor to the Student Christian Association, the check was
sent to us. At the meeting of the Board of Governors on January 9, 1940, it was
agreed that since the money was originally set aside for sending girls to the
Y.W.C.A. Conference at Geneva, it iwould be in keeping with its original purpose
to use the funds for student conferences. At that meeting, the Board of Governors
passed the following motion:
It was moved, seconded and carried that the money received from the Geneva
Loan Fund be deposited with the University in a special account to be used
for conference purposes, in the broadest sense of the term, that is, for sending
students to conferences, for holding conferences in Ann Arbor, or for sending
students to visit other campuses to study their religious program.
We should like to have this money placed in a separate account to be used for
the purposes stated in the above motion.
In view of the resignation of Assistant Professor Justin L. Powers
of the College of Pharmacy (p. 178) the as yet unreceived balance of
the grant of $400 from the American Pharmaceutical Association
(p. 111) or $240, has been canceled by the American Pharmaceutical
Association. The sum actually received, namely, $160, has been assigned to Haldane Burgess Leask, B.S.Pharm., Research Assistant, from
October 1, 1939, to January 31, 1940, at the rate of $40 a month.

PENALTY FOR IMUPROPER REGISTRATION AS A MICHIGAN RESIDENT
The fees for students from Michigan are lower, with obvious propriety, than
those for students from other states and countries. Thus it is necessary that
residence be properly determined at the time of registration. The Regents have,
therefore, adopted the following resolutions providing for a penalty for improper
registration as a Michigan resident:
WHEREAS, The state of Michigan in a liberal and generous spirit extends
the privileges of the University of Michigan to students from other states and
countries at but moderate advance in fees above fees charged residents of Michigan; and
WHEREAS, It happens from time to time that persons not legally resident in
Michigan attempt to take advantage of the University by registering from Michigan in order to save the small difference in fees;




236               FIRST MARCH MEETING, 1940
Therefore, be it Resolved, That hereafter the burden of registering under
proper residence shall be placed upon the student; and it shall be the duty of
each student at registration, if there be any possible question of right to legal
residence in Michigan under the rules of the Regents, to raise the question with
the registration officer and have such question passed upon and settled by the
proper officers of the University, previous to registration. Any student who registers improperly under this rule shall, when discovered, be required to pay not only
the proper nonresident fees, but shall be assessed, as an addition to the fee for
that semester, the sum of $10.
Resolved, further, That before any student's registration is accepted by the
departmental registration officer, such officer shall place in the hands of the prospective student a copy of this legislation and also of the Regents' rules with
respect to the determination of residence.
E. REGULATIONS GOVERNING HEALTH SERVICE PRIVILEGES
1. Treatment by the Health Service of those students entitled to that service
is optional on their part, except when in the opinion of the Director they may be
a source of danger to student health. The type and amount of service rendered
shall be in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Health Service.
2. Students who enroll for the first time in either the first or second semester
on full program status must obtain Health Service approval. The same requirement shall apply to all applicants on reduced program status who have not
waived Health Service privileges. Such approval is to be based upon assurance of
health safety to the entrant and associates as determined by a suitable examination and evidence of vaccination (immunity to smallpox). Vaccination may be
waived by the Director of the Health Service for applicants who file statements of
objection on religious grounds properly signed, in case of minors, by parents or
guardians. Such waiver shall release the University from the responsibility of
financial assistance to the applicant who contracts smallpox.

The Secretary placed on file the terms and conditions of the will
of the late Hugh Brodie, so far as they relate to the University, as
follows (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 62):
Item Four: I have several articles consisting for the most part of household furnishings of one kind or another and in the nature of heirlooms. These articles
I have put by themselves in two groups in my home at No. 611 Forest Avenue, Ann Arbor, Mich., and have indicated by name thereon which of the
respective groups I desire my respective sisters to have, and I do hereby give
and bequeath to my sister Grace Brodie that group of articles which I have
so as above indicated as intended for her, and to my sister Jessie E. Fox
the other group of such articles and so as above indicated as intended for her.
Item Fifth: All the rest, residue and remainder of my property of every and all
kinds, real and personal, I give devise and bequeath unto The Regents of
the University of Michigan, IN TRUST, however, for the following uses and
purposes:
A. For many years I have been interested in the work of surveying as
taught at the University of Michigan, and particularly in this work as developed under the late Professor Joseph B. Davis under whom I served for a
long time. I have hoped that, uniting with others, (realizing that I alone was
financially unable to accomplish it), there might be established in the University of Michigan the foundation for a professorial chair in surveying to
be known as the Joseph B. Davis Professorship. To give an opportunity for
the gathering of a fund which, including that herein given, will be reasonably
adequate for such a purpose, I direct that, in this item devised and bequeathed,
shall be safely invested and allowed to accumulate for a period not exceeding
five years and if during or at the expiration of such period, there shall have
been gathered sufficient, including that herein given, for the purpose above
indicated, then that in this item given shall be devoted to such purpose, and
The Regents of the University of Michigan are hereby authorized to determine whether the total available for such purpose is adequate.
B. If within the said term of five years the total amount available for
the establishing of the proposed chair shall not, in the judgment of The Board
of Regents, be sufficient for the purpose, then and in that event, it is my
wish, and I do give, devise and bequeath accordingly, that such residue, together with its accumulations, be established as a loan fund for students at
the University of Michigan who are in their junior or senior years and taking
work in the department of surveying in the Engineering College. The beneficiaries of such loan fund to be needy students and to be chosen by The
Regents of the University upon the recommendation of the ranking professor
of surveying. Such loan fund, except it be otherwise indicated shall be conserved and administered under such regulations as may be established from
time to time by The Regents of the University.
The Secretary further stated that the sisters of Mr. Brodie had some
years ago made all the selections of furniture that they desired under
Item Four, and the estate had been closed and the executor discharged
early in 1935. The property had been put on the books of the University in February of that year. Now, as of December 31, 1939,




250


SECOND MARCH MEETING, 1940


the amount accumulated in the fund is $19,544.51. It being the opinion of the Regents that this amount is insufficient for the establishment
of a "Joseph B. Davis Professorship," the Regents directed that the
bequest hereafter be administered as the "Joseph B. Davis Loan
Fund" for students in surveying-provided, however, that before this
direction is made effective the Secretary shall investigate and find out
whether any other funds given to the University in memory of Professor Davis are now desired by their donor or donors to be used for
the professorship purposes preferred by Professor Brodie in making his
bequest.
The President reported the following gifts, all of which were accepted with thanks and, where special terms or conditions were involved, in agreement with such special terms and conditions (p. 209):

An appropriation of $1,470 was added to the budget of the Summer

261


highest bidder, for wrecking purposes, with the provision that the sites

Arbor down-river sewer and sewage-disposal plant (p. 154 and R.P.
1936-1939, p. 406). The Board voted to approve settlement with the
City on the basis of a total payment of $17,807.68, which is approximately one-third of the cost of the sewage-disposal plant above the
amount of funds provided by the Federal Government, The settlement
is to be arranged by the Secretary of the Board with the City authorities on such installment terms as may be found mutually satisfactory.
All of the above actions taken were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned, leaving the date of the next meeting to be
determined.

The Regents authorized the appointment by the President of a
committee to participate with a similar committee from Wayne University in possible co-operation by Wayne University and the University of Michigan in solving questions involved in advance instruction
in the Detroit metropolitan area. Wayne University has already appointed such a committee.
The Regents approved the following proposals of the Faculty of the
College of Architecture and Design:
(1) That a program in landscape management be offered in the Department
of Landscape Architecture, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Landscape Management
(2) That this program have the requirement of 136 hours' credit in accordance with the accompanying exhibit, and that this program be offered with the
beginning of the University year 1940-1941
(3) That the present five-year programs in Landscape Architecture remain,
except that the five-year option in landscape management be withdrawn for entering students with the end of the current University year.
No staff changes are involved.
The Board directed that there be printed in full in the minutes the
following resolution adopted by the Executive Faculty of the Medical
School April 2, 1940, upon the death of Dr. David Murray Cowie
(p. 208):
WHEREAS: On January 27, Dr. David Murray Cowie, for forty-four years
a member of the teaching staff of the University and for the past thirty-three
years head of the Department of Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases at our Medical School, passed away after a brief illness, and
WHEREAS: In Doctor Cowie's death the Medical Faculty has lost an earnest
teacher and an esteemed and helpful colleague, and the University a loyal and
honored alumnus,
Be it therefore, Resolved, That the Executive Faculty of the Medical School
expresses its appreciation of Doctor Cowie's long service and his valued contributions to the Medical School, as well as its high regard for him as a colleague
and a man, and
Be it further, Resolved, That a copy of these Resolutions be transmitted to
the members of Doctor Cowie's family and that an additional copy be transmitted to the President and the Board of Regents of the University as an
expression from this Faculty of its sense of loss in Doctor Cowie's death.
The traveling expenses of Regent Herbert in the sum of $49.94,
covering attendance at the Board meeting of March 29, were approved.
The title of Robert H. McDowell (p. 85) was corrected to read
"Research Associate in Mesopotamian Archaeology, Museum of Classical Archaeology," in place of "Research Associate, Departments of
Greek and Latin."
The Board declined to consider further communications seeking to
open again the requests of Mr. F. M. Hesling (p. 227) and Mr. Nathan
G. Antonofsky (p. 261).
On the basis of communications from Mr. Stanley Waltz, in behalf
of the Finance Committee of the Michigan Union, and from Watling,
Lerchen and Company indicating that the Michigan Union revenue
bonds maturing on and after January 1, 1947, could be refunded on a
3 per cent instead of the present 312 per cent basis, the Regents approved such refunding proposal and authorized the President and the
Secretary of the Board to take such actions as might be required in
behalf of the Regents to effect such refunding (R.P. 1936-1939, pp.
447-459).

SECOND APRIL MEETING, 1940


The Secretary reported in behalf of the Dean of Women, the
Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, and the Director of Plant
Extension upon the general subject of the safety of women upon the
Campus (p. 246). The Regents approved recommendations for the
installation of additional outdoor lights at a total cost of approximately
$800 and for such expense as might be required for two Campus
patrolmen during such hours in the evening as seemed advisable. The
Regents further recorded that the Dean of Women had called together
dormitory directors and had discussed with them the problem of ensuring the safety of women students and of warning these students against
taking unnecessary risks.
The Board approved and adopted the report made by the Committee on Labor Relations at the meeting of March 1 (p. 227) with
respect to petition of certain Hospital employees and directed that
the following statement be made in writing to a delegation of these
employees in attendance in the anteroom:
In view of the fact that your committee has had two previous conferences
with the Regents and since no further recommendations have been advanced
whereby the funds representing the increases which your committee has suggested
may be procured, the Regents feel that until the University Hospital is able to
operate on a financially profitable basis there is no possible means of meeting any
increases in salary for the group you represent.
The Regents will welcome any suggestions of how the financial situation of
the Hospital may be improved to the point where increases may be given consideration.
The Secretary reported the petition by the Regents and by the
Rackham Engineering Foundation requesting the vacation of the east
and west alley in the block constituting the site of the proposed new
Rackham Memorial Building in Detroit (p. 267). The Secretary reported the following action taken by the Common Council of the City
of Detroit under date of April 16 and recorded in the Council's minutes on pages 1132 and 1133 thereof, as follows:

The Secretary reported that the State Department of Labor and
Industry had taken the view that Willard I. Wilcox (p. 94) had been
an employee of the University at the time of his accidental death and
had made an award of compensation. The Regents took the view that
the precedent which such a decision would set up, should it be allowed
to stand, justified the Regents in being represented in any further
proceedings before the State Labor and Accident Board or before the
Courts of the State, by the Board's own attorney.
The President was authorized to accept two gifts upon which he
informally reported, should they be formally tendered.
The Board voted that their session should continue in the future,
as in the past, to be confined to Regents and to the usual officials of the
Board.
The Board approved the ratified actions of the Finance Committee
of the Regents as follows (p. 265):

The following memoir and resolution were adopted and their
inclusion in the records in full was directed:
Roderick Duncan McKenzie, Professor of Sociology and Chairman of the
Department of Sociology in the University of Michigan, whose untimely and
much lamented death occurred on May 6, 1940, had won the respect of the
Regents, his colleagues, and his students by the competent manner in which he
managed the responsibilities of his position and by the extent and soundness of
his scholarship. The authority which he commanded in his special field of study,
human ecology, gained for him a position of eminence among sociologists and
brought about, in 1929-30, an invitation from the Federal Government to serve as
special investigator of urban problems for the President's Research Committee on
Social Trends. The sturdiness of his character, his good sense, and his unremitting
friendliness throughout his ten years among us, made him a member of the University community whose companionship was prized and whose loss is sincerely
mourned.
Therefore, be it Resolved, That in token of their heartfelt sorrow for the
death of a teacher and scholar who has rendered distinguished service to this
institution, the Regents of the University of Michigan adopt the foregoing
memoir and, as an expression of their deep sympathy, direct their Secretary to
furnish a copy to Mrs. McKenzie.

Descriptions to be deeded to the University:
Tract A, 40 acres, northeast '4 of the northwest ~ of Section 35.
Tract B, 24 acres, series of lots on Chippewa Resort plat, consisting of:
Block  8, lots 1-6                     Block 14, lots 1-6
Block 15, lots 1-6                     Block 21, lots 1-6
Block 22, lots 1-6                     Block 29, lots 1-6
Block 30, lots 1-6                     Block 35, lots, 1-6

On request of the Finance Committee the Secretary presented the
budget for the University residence halls, prepared by the Board of
Governors of Residence Halls. On motion, duly made and seconded,
this budget was adopted by the Regents in the amounts of $82,939
for the group of six residence halls not covered by any bond issue and
$635,482 for the group of five residence halls whose revenues are
pledged to secure a bond issue (pp. 1 to 25).
The Regents approved the plan proposed by Dean A. C. Furstenberg of the Medical School on behalf of the Galens Honorary Medical
Society, as follows:
The Galens Honorary Medical Society Scholarship Fund of $2,000 is to be
allotted annually to students of the University of Michigan Medical School by
the University of Michigan Medical Scholarship Committee according to the
following regulations:
1. The recipients must be native born citizens of the United States of
America or of its territorial possessions
2. They must be juniors or seniors in good standing in the Medical School and
must have completed two full years in the University of Michigan Medical School,
and at the time of the granting of such scholarship be enrolled in the University
of Michigan Medical School
3. Preference for said scholarships shall be given to those students whose
scholastic work, in the opinion of the University of Michigan Medical School
Scholarship Committee, will be improved by granting of financial aid
4. This money is not to be used for the payment of tuition, but for the
payment of the current expenses of the student, such as room, board, and laundry
5. The payment of a grant may be discontinued by the Committee for sufficient reason, such as withdrawal of the student from school, misuse of funds, or
the receipt of substantial aid from some other source
6. At the discretion of the Scholarship Committee payments to the recipients
may be distributed periodically, since it is believed that by this method provisions
No. 4 and No. 5 can best be accomplished
The number and amount of each scholarship to be granted shall be regulated
at the discretion of the Scholarship Committee of the University of Michigan
Medical School, but in no case shall the maximum of any one scholarship exceed $400.
Application for such scholarship shall be made to the Scholarship Committee
of the University of Michigan Medical School.
In any event that the sum available for scholarship is not utilized during
any academic year, the funds shall be allowed to accumulate to be expended on
scholarships in subsequent years at the discretion of the Scholarship Committee.




322


SECOND MAY MEETING, 1940


In the event that the income from the Galens Newsstand is not sufficient to
meet the' funds necessary to continue this scholarship, the Society will give such
funds as are available from the above source.
The amount of money available for any one academic year shall be decided
by a vote of the said Galens Honorary Medical Society in May of the preceding
academic year.
Dean Furstenberg reported and the Regents accepted with thanks
the proffer of the Upjohn Company of Kalamazoo of a grant of $1,000
to facilitate animal experimental work on the effect of diets deficient
in Vitamin B on the central nervous system, to be carried out under
the direction of Associate Professor Henry Field, Jr., of the Department of Internal Medicine. A check for $500 has already been received from the donors, and the balance is to be expected January 1,
1941. This fund is to be entitled "Studies in Spinal Cord Lesions."
In view of the fact that Associate Professor Herbert Jay Goulding
has announced his intention to retire at the close of the present semester after forty-five years of University teaching, the Regents voted to
him the title of Associate Professor Emeritus of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing, effective upon his actual retirement. The Regents
further voted that he be recommended to the Carnegie Foundation and
the Carnegie Corporation for their usual retiring allowance and that he
receive from   the Older Faculty Members Retirement fund the additional allowance to which he is entitled under the usual terms and conditions. It is anticipated that proper recognition of Professor Goulding's
service to the University will be in due course included in the minutes.
The following resolutions were adopted (p. 303):
WHEREAS, On July 21, 1940, Emil Lorch, A.M., since 1906 Professor of
Architecture in the University of Michigan and from 1931 to 1936, Director of
the College of Architecture, will reach the age of seventy and become eligible for
retirement from active service, therefore be it
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan felicitate Professor
Lorch upon the completion of a period of thirty-four years as administrator and
teacher, during which he took the leadership in the organization of the College
of Architecture, contributed largely to the development of its resources and its
prestige, was untiring in his efforts to advance the interests and usefulness of the
architectural profession both in this State and nationally, and received many
testimonials of honor and respect at the hands of his fellow architects; and be
it further
Resolved, That in grateful recognition of his notable services the Regents of
the University of Mlichigan confer upon Professor Lorch, on and after the date
of his retirement, the title Professor Emeritus of Architecture, and that he be
recommended for the usual retiring allowance, beginning July 21, 1940.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to the date and hour of the annual meeting,
June 14, 1940, at 10:30 A.M.

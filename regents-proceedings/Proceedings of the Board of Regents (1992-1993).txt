JULY MEETING, 1992


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, July 16, 1992
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, and Smith.
Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice Presidents
Cosovich, Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors
Jones and Wilson. Regent Waters was absent; Regent Varner arrived at about
1:20 P.M.
Chancellor, UM-Dearborn
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order, noting that this would be
Chancellor Blenda Wilson's last Regents' Meeting. He asked Chancellor Wilson
to introduce her successor. Chancellor Wilson introduced Professor Bernard
Klein, who will be serving as interim chancellor until a permanent chancellor is
named.
Revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 13.11 (Board for Student Publications)
President Duderstadt observed that discussions had been ongoing for several years about how to restructure the oversight of student publications. He called
to the table Professor Gayl Ness and Mr. Noah Finkel, members of the Task
Force on the Future Governance of Student Publications. Professor Ness had
chaired the task force and Mr. Finkel is a former editor-in-chief of the Michigan
Daily.
Professor Ness reported that the task force had recognized the importance
of student control over student publications as well as the necessity for ensuring
the survival of the publications for future generations of students. The task force
had held two public hearings and had spoken to faculty committees, the current
board for student publications, the board's professional employees, and others,
and had collected information from other University publications.
Members of the task force came to the conclusion that the Board for Student Publications needs people who have both experience or technical expertise
in publications and a strong commitment to those publications. MSA and
SACUA selection of board members, as has been done in the past, do not
necessarily assure that kind of selection. The task force is proposing a selfnominating board as the best mechanism for obtaining the needed expertise and
commitment. The appointment authority would reside with the president, which
would provide a kind of check and balance to this procedure. He noted that in a
meeting with the task force in March, the current Board for Student Publications
had fully endorsed this proposal.




July Meeting, 1992


Following further comments, Professor Ness introduced Noah Finkel, a
1990 LSA graduate and current law student, who was editor of the Michigan
Daily in 1990 and was a member of the task force. Mr. Finkel observed that during his tenure on the Daily, the Board for Student Publications had constantly
interfered in the Daily's day-to-day operations, which hampered the students' independence and lessened the learning experience they could have gained. He also
explained the disadvantages of having board members who did not have personal
experience or interest in the Daily, and he noted that previous editorial staffs
had expressed the same opinions over the years. Mr. Finkel emphasized that the
type of self-perpetuating board now being proposed would assure the best educational experience for Daily staffers, while also assuring that final editorial control
would rest with the students.
Regent Power observed that he had been a Daily staff member when he was
a student at the University, and later had served on the Board for Student Publications. Two important things to consider are to avoid control of the Daily by
any group or ideology, and the question of journalistic quality as distinguished
from political ideology. He noted that about five years ago the Daily staff was
more interested in political ideology than the process of publishing a newspaper,
and that process almost caused the demise of the Daily's institutional credibility
on the campus.
Professor Ness recalled that after the Daily had been taken over by a group
with a certain political agenda, an opposing group had organized and retaken
control, shifting the orientation from political ideology to good journalism. He
viewed that as a good lesson for the students in the responsibility inherent in the
democratic process. The proposed board arangement would, in his view, facilitate this learning process, as it could guide the students toward exercising the
kind of leadership necessary to maintain professional journalistic values.
Regent Nielsen pointed out that the Daily has to be run as a business in
order for it to keep existing. In the past, the Daily's editorial content had gone
beyond what is acceptable in the normal news media. The boards in place during
those times were not effective in the educational process and the students were
not receptive to input from those boards. The current proposal is an attempt to
ensure accountability in both business and editorial matters. In response to concerns that action was being contemplated when students were away from campus, Regent Nielsen stated that University business cannot be dependent upon
when students are available. Regarding the concern that presidential appointments to the board would be used to control its political ideology, Regent Nielsen
stated that there has to be accountability. He suggested that perhaps having a
pool of potential board members involved in the newspaper business that the
president could choose from might avoid the appearance of the president trying
to "control" the board.
Regent Baker observed that some years ago, when the Daily was in precarious financial condition and was in danger of folding, the Regents arranged to
have people knowledgeable about the newspaper business work with the Daily to
solve its financial problems. If the Regents and administration had wanted to


2




July Meeting, 1992


"control" the Daily, they could have done so at that time; he reiterated that the
Regents have no desire or intention to do that.
Regent Brown agreed that in all the years of the Daily's existence, neither
the Regents nor administration have sought to control the Daily; the fear of this
is simply not realistic. He also noted that the bylaws could be changed at any
time to allow for this if the Regents so desired; however, it is also highly unlikely
that the administration and the Regents would ever be involved in running the
Daily in any way.
Regent Power spoke in favor of having Daily alumni as members of the
board, noting that they would be tougher than others would be and would cherish the institution. In addition, board members who are former Daily staffers
would have more credibility with students than would others who might have
been picked from a pool of nominees.
Regent Smith asked Professor Ness to elaborate on a statement he had
made that the proposed arrangement would help prevent control of the Daily's
being seized by the radical right or the radical left. He responded that the nine
individual board members would all have some expertise in and commitment to
student publications. They would therefore be committed to maintaining a board
with those characteristics, and would select people of that sort who are also willing to attend meetings. The self-nominating procedure provides the best mechanism for ensuring that board members will have the necessary competence and
commitment.
Regarding student input into the task force, Professor Ness noted that a
representative from MSA was on the task force last September, and that he and
other task force members had met with MSA's executive committee twice. On
March 25th, the task force's proposal was presented to MSA and all other interested parties; at that time, MSA was in complete accord with it.
Following further discussion, the president noted that action would be taken the following day, and turned to the next item of business.
Nontenure Track Clinical Appointment Sequences in the College of
Pharmacy and School of Dentistry
Provost Whitaker reported that the requests to establish nontenure clinical
appointment sequences in the College of Pharmacy and School of Dentistry had
in each case been recommended unanimously by the faculty and executive
committees of those schools. SACUA was in support of the College of Pharmacy
proposal but declined to endorse the School of Dentistry proposal because of
some members' concerns about the potential cumulative long-term impact of
these types of tracks. Provost Whitaker is in support of both proposals, but had
agreed to conduct a study of this issue to satisfy concerns that had been raised.
In response to a question from Regent Smith, Provost Whitaker stated that
there would not be large numbers of people participating in the clinical track program. Following further discussion, Regent Varner moved, and Regent Nielsen
seconded, the establishment of nontenure track clinical appointment sequences


3




July Meeting, 1992


in the College of Pharmacy and the School of Dentistry. It was noted that approval of the motion would require subsequent revision of the Regents' Bylaws.
The vote was taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
1992-93 Ann Arbor General Fund Operating Budget
President Duderstadt called on Provost Whitaker to present the 1992-93
Ann Arbor General Fund Operating Budget.
Provost Whitaker reviewed the budget preparation process and timeline and
noted the four sources of General Fund revenue: state appropriation, tuition and
fees, indirect cost recovery, and investment income. The proposed 1992-93 General Fund Operating Budget calls for increases of $2.0 million in state appropriation, $25.8 in tuition and fees, and $3.4 million for the infrastructure
maintenance fee, and for estimated losses of about $3.0 million in indirect cost
recovery and about $3.3 million in the "other " category, which consists mainly
of investment income. The total recommended 1992-93 general fund operating
budget of $630.0 million represents an increase of $23.8 million (3.9 percent)
over the 1991-92 budget, and is one of the lowest increases in the past 30 years.
Provost Whitaker described the long-term goals of the budget as being to
enhance the quality of the institution by maintaining and enhancing access for
Michigan undergraduates, reducing the backlog of deferred infrastructure maintenance, enhancing the undergraduate educational experience, expanding the internationalization of programs, and providing reserves against potential
shortfalls in revenue. He described specific efforts underway to shift the locus of
responsibility and decision-making to the units as a means of encouraging the
efficient use of resources.
Provost Whitaker pointed out that the state appropriation currently supplies only about 41 percent of the General Fund, versus about 78 percent in the
1960s. He then reviewed the objectives for the 1992-93 budget, terming it a
"shared sacrifice". The incremental expenditures of $23.8 million include a general base budget reduction of 2 percent (-$12.8 million); fixed cost increases
($13.8 million); student financial aid ($12.0 million); minority faculty hiring program ($1.0 million), undergraduate initiatives ($2.3 million); international initiatives ($1.7 million), a special salary program for staff members making less than
$25,000 per year ($.8 million); other critical academic needs ($1.1 million); "passthrough" revenue ($0.8 million); a special adjustment in ICR accounts (-$1.1 million), and an infrastructure maintenance fee ($3.4 million). He noted that the
outcome of this shared sacrifice should be that budget goals will be met and
funds will be available for improved compensation in 1993-94.
Regarding the proposed increase in student tuition and fees, Provost Whitaker noted that the cost to a student attending the University is a combina- tion
of financial aid and tuition, and noted that financial aid is very important to a
large number of undergraduate students. He also pointed out that the cost to the
University of educating students is much higher than the actual amount of tuition. He reiterated the University's policy of meeting the demonstrated financial
need of all regularly-enrolled Michigan resident undergraduate students, and


4




July Meeting, 1992


pointed out that budgeted financial aid in the General Fund has steadily increased since 1981 in the face of decreasing federal support. He illustrated how
financial aid packages are configured for several typical students, and also
pointed out that public universities across the nation have had to implement
severe tuition and fee increases in 1991-92 and 1992-93 in the face of decreasing
state support.
Provost Whitaker gave other examples to illustrate the comparison of the
cost of education at the University of Michigan with that at peer institutions. He
announced a proposed tuition increase in most programs of 9.9 percent for resident undergraduates and 7.5 percent for nonresident undergraduates, along with
a registration fee increase of $20 per term and an additional infrastructur maintenance fee of $50 per term. Provost Whitaker also pointed out that steps are
being taken to lessen the gap between resident and nonresident tuition to eventually achieve a level of 35.0 percent.
Provost Whitaker responded to questions from Regent Baker about the
proposed use of the infrastructure maintenance fee. Regent Baker pointed out
that the increased student fees are necessary because state appropriations have
not been sufficient to meet the needs of the General Fund, and that in effect,
increasing portions of the costs of higher education have been transferred from
the state to students and families.
Provost Whitaker concluded his presentation by giving various comparisons
of the costs for Michigan first-year undergraduate students to attend the University of Michigan as opposed to other top universities. He observed that a 4.0
percent salary program would have required $16 million, which would require
either an additional across-the-board tuition increase of 7.2 percent or an additional 2.5-3.0 percent cut in unit budgets. The latter option would have led to
layoffs. He explained that the shared sacrifice notion was implemented instead,
which, combined with other measures being taken, should put the university in a
position to implement a salary program in the 1993-94 fiscal year.
President Duderstadt pointed out that even though the budget reflects a
zero increase in state appropriation, it is courageous, creative, and visionary,
because it continues to place the focus on enhancing access, enhancing the
educational experience provided students, maintaining the institution's infrastructure, and providing reserves to protect the institution against potential
shortfalls in revenue. He expressed regret over not being able to fund a salary
program, but said this "shared sacrifice" approach was thought to be preferable
to the alternative, which would have required major layoffs and would have been
much more painful in the long run.
Regent Nielsen observed that 20 to 30 percent of students' tuition goes
toward paying the financial aid for other students. He questioned the policy
ramifications of this.
President Duderstadt responded that no student pays the full cost of their
education; thus, none of the tuition dollars paid by parents are being used to
subsidize other students. The University is merely asking the families of those


5




July Meeting, 1992


students who have the capacity, to pay a larger portion of the fair share of the
cost of their education so that families with no capacity to pay can still have the
opportunity for higher education. Families who pay full tuition are not
subsidizing other families; higher education is subsidized through residents'
general tax obligations to the state.
Regent McFee pointed out that all of tuition money goes into one pot, the
General Fund, and is then taken out of that pot. She noted that education has
long been considered the key to upward mobility in our society, but neither the
state nor federal governments have been providing funds to provide this access.
Thus, more responsibility for this obligation is being left to individuals. Regent
McFee observed that the state is now at a crossroads in deciding how the University can continue as a public institution in the face of this reality.
President Duderstadt pointed out that the principle that the public should
support education through general tax revenues because it benefits all of society
has eroded over the past few decades. He noted that the state component of the
University's total operating budget for 1992-93 is only about 13 percent. To preserve the University's ability to serve the state's citizens in the future, it is necessary to take the budgetary measures that have been described.
Regent Varner noted that in the primary grades, some people don't pay
taxes but they still attend school, because of the national policy of providing public education to all, financed by property owners, some of whom pay far more
than others and don't receive additional benefit. Although nobody is pleased with
tuition increases, she believes that access is a priority and that people are concerned about the ability of their children to attend the University. A Michigan
education is a bargain compared with that provided by comparable institutions.
The University is asking families that are able to pay a higher portion of the tuition cost to do so; whereas families who are unable to pay are still benefiting
from being able to attend a public institution. She stated that it was unfair to
place the psychological burden on the less fortunate students that they are attending the University because someone else is paying part of their tuition.
Regent Brown observed that the state over the years has made the decision
to pay less and less of the cost of higher education at the University of Michigan.
Until the point is reached that tuition pays the entire cost of a resident education
and the state pays nothing, the argument cannot be made that one person's tuition is supporting another student He pointed out that one of the best things
about the University is its students' economic diversity, as well their ethnic diversity. The loss of students who could not afford to attend would lead to a poorer education for those who could afford to attend; the diversity is one reason for
the University's quality.
Regent Smith stated that she was concerned about middle class students,
and noted that the middle class student in the example in the Regents Communication had to take out a loan to finance her education, which constituted as
much of a burden to her family as to the economically deprived.

July Meeting, 1992


In response to a question from Regent Power, Provost Whitaker said that
the proportion of the tuition increase allocated to increases in financial aid is
about 46 percent, or $12 million, which is 8 percent of the General Fund. The entire financial aid budget is expended every year. Regent Power concluded that as
a public university, the University of Michigan has special obligations having to
do with access for all kinds of people, and it has demonstrated that it provides financial aid to middle class people, as well as people with very high and very low
incomes.
Regent Nielsen reiterated that loans taken out by middle income students
to pay their tuition are being used to subsidize financial aid for lower income people. Regent McFee pointed out that the issue is really an accounting problem; all
money comes from the General Fund, regardless of the particular stream of
money that has fed it. She suggested that it might be more forthright not to differentiate the various funding streams that make up the General Fund, as has
been the practice.
President Duderstadt pointed out that in private education, the dominant
cost is tuition, whereas in public education, housing, books, and other expenses
make up the dominant portion of the cost.
Provost Whitaker also noted that financial aid funding for the coming year
includes an increased proportion of gift aid, which decreases the proportion of
loan aid. He reiterated the University's determination to have all income classes
represented in the student body.
Regent Baker complimented Provost Whitaker on having devised a budget
that represents a rational solution to a difficult problem. Noting the central importance of faculty to the institution, he stated his concern that there will be no
increases in faculty salaries, and said he could support this situation for one year
only. Regent Baker asked for assurances that administration salaries would not
be increased either. President Duderstadt responded that they would not be. Provost Whitaker stated that the 1992-93 budget should provide a better opportunity
to increase salaries in the next fiscal year. President Duderstadt commented on
the outstanding contributions of all of the institution's employees, and noted the
University's obligation to provide them with a salary program which reflects
their efforts.
Following further comments, President Duderstadt called on Chancellor
Wilson to present the UM-Dearbom budget.
1992-93 UM-Dearborn General Fund Budget
Chancellor Wilson observed that the University of Michigan-Dearborn is affected by the fact that the level of state funding it receives is not comparable to
that of its peer institutions or to other Michigan public institutions, nor is its
funding level at all related to its enrollment. In addition, its tuition is high compared to that for other comprehensive regional institutions with which it must
compete, which is important because the majority of UM-Dearborn students do
not receive financial aid. She pointed out that over the past several years,


7




July Meeting, 1992


reallocation strategies have allowed modest salary enhancements, but the limit of
this technique has now been reached. The 1992-92 incremental budget of
$2,088,550 proposes no salary increases, except for lower paid staff and for faculty promotions, with the priority being to preserve jobs rather than to increase
salaries. The budget also calls for an infrastrucure fee of $10 per credit hour,
with a maximum of $60 per student The only increments in new personnel
(except for previous commitments in faculty appointments) will be in the area of
institutional advancement, given the importance of the campus' participating in
the capital campaign and ultimately increasing other funding sources.
1992-93 UM-Flint General Fund Budget
President Duderstadt called on Chancellor Jones to present the 1992-93
UM-Flint General Fund Budget.
Chancellor Jones noted that this is a very difficult budget, observing that
the UM-Flint could admit more students and better serve the community if more
funding were available. He also stated that because the campus had in past years
given the highest priority to access, it had increasingly relied on junior-level and
adjunct faculty, an option which has now been exhausted and must be addressed
in order to maintain quality. He credited the legislature and governor with having consistently given the Flint campus above-average increases in appropriation
over the past ten years; however, the decision had been made also during that
time to admit increasing numbers of students, which has created the current
budget situation.
Chancellor Jones reviewed the 1992-93 incremental General Fund budget of
$2,656,000. It calls for a state appropriation increase of $100,441, a tuition increase of 6.7 percent ($906,459), introduction of a $40 per semester infrastructure fee ($700,000), an enrollment increase ($350,000), and internal reallocation
of $600,000. Expenditures include a 3.2 percent salary program ($870,900), staff
benefits increases ($230,000), infrastructure maintenance ($400,000), student aid
($450,000), recharges ($50,000), and programmatic initiatives ($656,000).
The meeting recessed at 3:50 PM. and reconvened at 4:00 P.M. in the Anderson Room of the Michigan Union to hear Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Michelle Matelic, president of the UM Law Enforcement Association,
on labor relations; David Toland, president of the Graduate Employees Organization, on campus labor issues; Charles Tackett, citizen, on freedom of speech;
Judith Levy, bargaining chairperson of AFSCME Local 1583, on contract negotiations; Alice Hamele, citizen, on her problems with the School of Dentistry, Clair
H. Bell, assistant chief steward, and Stephen Jaynes, chief steward, UM Trades,
on contract negotiations; Jonathan I. Rose, alumnus, Matt Rennie, executive editor, Michigan Daily, and Andrew Long, summer editor in chief, Michigan Daily,
on the Michigan Daily and the Board for Student Publications.

July Meeting, 1992


Following Public Comments, the meeting recessed at 4:00 PM. until the following day.
Friday, July 17, 1992
The Regents met at 9:00 AM. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner,
and Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were
Chancellors Jones and Wilson.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and announced that the
University of Michigan Cybermotion K2A robot, "Carmel," had won the National Robotics Competition on July 16, 1992, in San Jose, California. The competition had been entered by an international team of undergraduate and graduate
students.
1992-93 Revenue Budgets and 1992-93 Student Fee Rates for All Three
Campuses
Regent Brown moved adoption of the 1992-93 revenue budgets and the
1992-93 student fee rates for the UM-Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint campuses,
as described in the Regents Communications. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Provost Whitaker commented that the objective of this budget is to reposition the base budget towards our highest priorities. This budget proposes shared
sacrifices: reduced budgets to provide for reallocation, avoidance of layoffs with a
very modest salary program for only the lowest paid employees (except for union
wages, which are determined by contact negotiations), and higher tuition rates.
The budget allocation meets fixed costs, maintains and modestly improves access,
holds reserves against shortfalls in revenue predictions, and positions the year
1992-93 for the highest academic priorities and a decent compensation program.
Approval of the proposed tuition and fee increases will allow the University to
meet these budget projections.
Regent Baker commented that Provost Whitaker had done an admirable job
preparing the budget, and reiterated his comments from the previous day. He
stated that in the coming year he would point out things that he feels should be
examined for reductions in cost.
Regent Nielsen also complimented the provost and his staff, and again
expressed his concern about financial aid for low income families being
subsidized by middle income families with loans that need to be repaid, while
lower income families receive grants-in-aid, rather than loans. He expressed the
hope that the Board would examine this situation from a policy perspective in the
years to come.
Regent Power observed that this budget is a significant step forward because it begins to set in place a series of policy and managerial initiatives through


9




July Meeting, 1992


which the University can begin better to manage and understand both costs and
revenue.
Regent Varner commented that the budget shows that the University is not
getting adequate public support. In response to Regent Nielsen's comments, she
pointed out that Provost Whitaker's examples of actual financial aid packages
illustrated a low income student who accumulated loans higher than those of
middle and upper middle class students, which proves that middle class students
are not ending up with higher loans than the less advantaged students and that
most economically disadvantaged students leave the University with debt.
Regent Varner stated that middle class students pay a larger portion of their
share of the cost of their education, rather than supporting economically disadvantaged families. She pointed out that not many economically disadvantaged
students attend the University of Michigan; most of the recipients of financial aid
are middle class white students.
Regent Nielsen responded that the example provided of the low income student was not realistic, and stated his opinion that if no financial aid whatsoever
were offered, tuition would be reduced by 20 percent, which is a significant sum
of money to families striving to send their children to college.
Regent Varner commented that if there were no financial aid, the University of Michigan would be a school for only rich, white students. Without access as
an important goal, she would be unable to continue to support tuition increases.
She asserted that the issue is one of class, not race. Although more black students who attend the University may be in the economically disadvantaged class,
the bulk of financial aid goes to white students, because they make up the majority of students at the University. The University has an obligation and a mission
to educate all students in the state, regardless of their economic class, if they are
able to come here.
Further discussion ensued about the issue of access to the University of
Michigan.
Regent Brown agreed that the provost's examples do indicate the lowest income families having the highest loan payback obligation, with the majority of financial aid going to resident students. He pointed out that the University has
always had financial aid, which goes to those with the greatest need, and the
Board has taken the position that no student would be prohibited from going to
the University of Michigan because of financial need. If there were no financial
aid, there would be no students attending the University from lower economic
classes.
Regent Power noted that the financial aid budget makes up only eight percent of the General Fund. The issue is how the Board chooses to allocate the pool
of resources that comprise the General Fund. As a public university, the University has an obligation to all citizens, and especially those in the middle class who
are struggling to attend.


10




July Meeting, 1992


Regent Smith commended Provost Whitaker for his presentation, and
pointed out that families are sacrificing a great deal to put their students through
the University. She requested that the University's financial aid policy be communicated to middle class students; Provost Whitaker pointed out that all
students receive the same information about financial aid. He also noted that the
financial aid package is adjusted individually each year as costs and family financial situations change.
There was further discussion about the issue of financial aid. Regent Waters
commented that in the example provided for a low income student from a fourperson family with an income of $10,000, it is unconscionable that this student
should have to contribute $1,100 and also have to work and receive a loan. This
type of burden would lead to increased dropout ratios; he believes financial aid
should be increased to decrease the burden on lower income students. The president pointed out that a task force is investigating the impact of financial aid
packages on attrition.
Following further discussion on this issue, the vote was taken and the
1992-93 revenue budgets and student fee rates for all three campuses, as described in the Regents Communications, were approved unanimously.
Revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 13.11 (Board for Student Publications)
Regent Power moved revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 13.11 (Board for
Student Publications) so as to change the composition of the Board for Student
Publications, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent Nielsen seconded the motion.
Regent Smith said that students' input should be considered before action is
taken on matters that concern them. She moved that consideration of this matter
be tabled until September. Regent Baker seconded the motion.
President Duderstadt observed that this proposal has had extensive student
involvement over the past year. It is important for the matter to be resolved at
this meeting so that the new board can be appointed in time for the beginning of
the fall semester.
Regent Brown pointed out that a motion to table is not debatable; Regent
Smith withdrew her motion and Regent Baker withdrew his second.
Regent Power commented that there had been extensive discussion of this
matter for the past one and one-half years, so he saw no reason to delay action at
this time. In response to a question from Regent Smith about whether she
thought there had been sufficient student input, Vice President Hartford said
that the current president of MSA had not been involved with MSA last year, so
she wasn't aware of the extensive discussion that had occurred. She believes that
the students most affected by an issue should be most heavily involved in any decision regarding it, and in this case, students involved in student publications
were in agreement that the bylaw should be changed.


11




July Meeting, 1992


Regent Smith moved to table the item; Regent Baker seconded the motion.
This motion failed, with Regent Smith in favor and the other seven Regents opposed. The vote was then taken on Regent Power's motion to amend Regents'
Bylaw Section 13.11. It was approved, with Regents Baker, Brown, McFee,
Nielsen, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor, and Regent Smith abstaining. The
revised text of Bylaw Section 13.11 is as follows:
Sec. 13.11. The Board for Student Publications
The Board for Student Publications is an agency of the Board of Regents of the

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Smith, the Regents
voted unanimously to adopt the following retirement memoirs:
Samuel K. Clark, professor of mechanical engineering and applied mechanics, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1992.
A native of Ypsilanti, Professor Clark earned his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in engineering from the University of Michigan in 1946, 1948, and 1951, respectively. He worked as an engineer in the aircraft and automotive industries
for five years before beginning his academic career as an assistant professor at
Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland in 1952. He joined the University of
Michigan as an assistant professor of engineering mechanics in 1955; he was promoted to associate professor in 1957 and professor in 1959.
Professor Clark's research interests spanned a number of areas, but his
greatest contributions have been his studies related to aircraft and automotive
tires. His research has been sponsored by major rubber, automobile, and aircraft
companies as well as by the U.S. Air Force, NASA, NSF, and the Department of
Transportation. The author of over 100 journal articles and research reports, in
1971 Professor Clark wrote a monograph for the U.S. Bureau of Standards on
"Mechanics of Pneumatic Tires." In 1979, he and a colleague were granted a


21




July Meeting, 1992


patent for a tire bead inspection machine. In honor of his many achievements, he
was named a fellow of the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1985.
In addition to his research work, Professor Clark served as director of the
undergraduate materials testing laboratory from 1957-78, developed popular
courses in composite materials and experimental stress analysis, and was the
dynamics course leader. He served on numerous departmental committees,
chaired the college's Placement Advisory Committee, Mechanics Coordinating
Committee, and Nominating Committee, and also served on the Admissions
Advisory Committee, the review committee for the aerospace department, and
the College of Engineering Executive Committee. On the University level, he has
served as chair of the University Relations Committee and as a member of the
Scholastic Standing Committee. He is a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Association of University Professors, the Society for Experimental Stress Analysis, the Society of Automotive Engineers, and
the National Materials Advisory Board Committee on Surface Effect Vehicles,
and served as associate editor of the Journal of Lubrication Technology from
1973-79.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming Samuel K Clark Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics.
William 0. Dobbins mI, M.D., professor of internal medicine, will retire
from active faculty status on August 31, 1992, after a very productive career.
Dr. Dobbins studied at Davidson College, North Carolina, before entering
the Medical College of Alabama where he graduated first in his class in 1957. He
served his internship at Bellevue Hospital (Cornell Medical Division) in New
York before completing his residency in medicine and a fellowship in gastroenterology at the University of Washington Affiliated Hospitals. In 1965, Dr. Dobbins was appointed assistant professor at Duke University Medical Center, he
was promoted to associate professor and chief of medical service at Durham Veterans Administration Hospital in 1968. The following year, he joined George
Washington University Medical Center as an associate professor of medicine and
was made director of the division of gastroenterology in 1970. He was promoted
to professor of medicine in 1973.
In 1979, Dr. Dobbins came to Ann Arbor as a professor of internal medicine
at the University of Michigan Medical Center and as associate chief of staff
(research) of the Veterans Administration Medical Center. Under his leadership,
the research program at the VA Hospital has been revitalized and the GI Division, with Dr. Dobbins' contribution, has become one of the nation's most prominent programs.
Dr. Dobbins is recognized as the world authority on Whipple's disease and
has written what is considered the definitive text on this topic. He provided the
first detailed description of bacterial characteristics in Whipple's disease. His
article on the natural history and treatment of CNS manifestation of Whipple's
disease is considered the most authoritative discussion on this subject, and the
treatment recommendation remains the standard practice. Dr. Dobbins is also an
internationally renowned histopathologist, whose article on in vitro characterization of human intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes represents the first detailed


22




July Meeting, 1992


description of this subject His research efforts have helped to define the gastrointestinal histopathologic features of the immune suppressed host. Dr. Dobbins is
also an astute clinician and inspiring teacher, whose lectures on gastrointestinal
histopathology are well attended by both GI fellows and faculty. His recent
monograph, "Diagnostic Pathology of the Intestinal Mucosa," is considered
among the finest on this subject matter and is widely used by gastroenterologists
and pathologists.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service by naming William 0. Dobbins III Professor Emeritus of Internal Medicine.
Kenneth P. Langton, associate professor of political science in the College
of Literature, Science, and the Arts and associate research scientist in the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations, retired from active faculty status on May
31, 1992, after 27 years at the University of Michigan.
Professor Langton earned his B.A degree from the University of Washington in 1956 and his M.A and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Oregon in
1962 and 1965, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan as an assistant
professor in 1965, was promoted to associate professor in 1969, and was granted
tenure in 1970. He became affiliated with ILIR in 1988. In addition to his positions at the University of Michigan, he also has served as a program advisor for
South America for the Ford Foundation and as a visiting research professor at
FLASCO in Santiago, Chile. Professor Langton has received numerous research
grants from the Ford Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the National
Institute of Mental Health, the U.S. Office of Education, and the Earhart
Foundation for his studies of political socialization and participation.
Professor Langton's work began with widely published studies of political
socialization in America which expanded to the study of the processes of
socialization in Latin America. His work wedded political science surveys and
psychological theories as a means of analyzing the motives for and nature of political participation. These studies extended as well to analyses of workplace democracy in such areas as the coal mining industry in Peru. Professor Langton
was a fine educator whose courses for undergraduates consistently earned strong
evaluations, and who guided numerous graduate students through to their own
Ph.D.s.
The Regents now salute this able political scientist for his dedicated service
by naming Kenneth P. Langton Associate Professor Emeritus of Political Science
and Associate Research Scientist Emeritus.
Robert R. Lewis, Jr., professor of physics, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1992, after a notable career as a teacher and researcher.
Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Professor Lewis attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate before transferring to the University of Michigan where he received his B.S. (with a double major in
mathematics and physics), M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in 1950, 1953, and 1954, respectively. He became an assistant professor of physics at the University of Notre
Dame in 1954. In 1956, he was given a visiting appointment in the School of
Mathematics in the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, where


23




July Meeting, 1992


he was well-regarded by some of the most distinguished physicists in the world,
including C. N. Yang, A Pais, and R. Oppenheimer. Professor Lewis joined the
University of Michigan Department of Physics in 1958 as an assistant professor,
he was promoted to associate professor in 1960 and to professor in 1965.
Professor Lewis is a theorist whose work has focused on problems in atomic
physics, low-energy physics, and the physics of weak interactions. His contributions are notable for their range and depth, particularly in the use of symmetries
to attack very fundamental problems. He has long been noted for effective collaborations with experimentalists, and even now continues to be a valued member of several collaborations with atomic, molecular, and optical experimentalists
at the University of Michigan and elsewhere.
As a researcher, Professor Lewis made important advances in the study of
parity violating interactions, in neutrino physics, in optical pumping and level
crossing spectroscopy, and most recently in the study of anapole moments. As a
teacher, he was for many years a mainstay of the department's introductory
graduate curriculum. He served on a variety of departmental and University
committees, including the Physics Executive Committee. He has held visiting appointments at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Rutherford Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Geneva, and the Institute of
Theoretical Physics at Stony Brook. In 1990, he was chair of the 12th International Conference of Atomic Physics.
The Regents now salute this accomplished theorist for his dedicated service
by naming Robert R. Lewis, Jr., Professor Emeritus of Physics.
Oliver E. Overseth, Jr., professor of physics, will retire from active faculty status on July 31, 1992, after a highly productive career as a teacher and researcher.
A native of New York City, Professor Overseth graduated from the
University of Chicago with a B.S. degree in physics in 1953. He received his
Ph.D. degree in physics from Brown University in 1958. He subsequently served
as an instructor and then research associate at Princeton University.
In 1961, Professor Overseth joined the faculty at the University of Michigan
as an assistant professor of physics; he was promoted to associate professor in
1965 and to professor in 1968. During this period, he was one of several young
faculty who helped raise Michigan to a position of leadership in the growing and
then relatively new field of high energy physics. Professor Overseth's primary
research interest was in the properties of elementary particles which contained
the "strange" quark. In a celebrated series of experiments at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory, his group observed and studied the polarization of a class
of elementary particles known as hyperons in their production at energies of 200
to 400 GeV. Many of his group's determinations of the production, decay
parameters, and magnetic moments of hyperons remain today as the best
published measurements. More recently, his research has been centered at the
European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), where he has continued his
experimental program in elementary particle research.
Professor Overseth was among the best teachers in the Department of Physics: demanding, conscientious, and gifted, particularly in large lecture courses
where he demonstrated a special ability. He took a keen interest in teaching at all


24




July Meeting, 1992


levels and continually worked to improve the department's educational program.
His undergraduate students were exceptionally well-prepared for subsequent
education. His doctoral students have gone on to successful careers on the faculties of major universities where they continue to bear witness to his outstanding
training.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physicist for his dedicated service
by naming Oliver E. Overseth, Jr., Professor Emeritus of Physics.
Memorial
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Smith, the Regents
voted unanimously to adopt the following memorial statement:
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness the death of John L. Kemink, M.D., interim associate chair and professor
of otorhinolaryngology, and director, Division of Otology, Neurootology and
Skull Base Surgery in the Department of Otorhinolayngology, Medical SchooL
Dr. Kemink was born in Muskegon, Michigan, on September 4, 1949. He received his B.A degree from Hope College in Holland, Michigan, in 1971. He then
attended the University of Michigan Medical School and received his M.D. degree
in 1975. Following his general surgical residency at Moffitt Hospital in San
Francisco, Dr. Kemink returned to the University of Michigan to complete his
residency in otolaryngology and a fellowship in otology, neurootology, and skull
base surgery. Dr. Kemink joined the faculty of the University of Michigan as an
instructor in 1981 and rapidly progressed through the academic ranks. He was
appointed as an assistant professor in 1982 and was promoted to associate professor in 1986. In 1991, the Regents approved Dr. Kemink's promotion to full
professor, with tenure.
In his shortened career, Dr. Kemink authored more than one hundred
scholarly publications in medical journals and books, edited a textbook, and
served on the editorial review boards of six medical journals. He had been a coinvestigator on NIH funded cochlear prosthesis research since 1985, and was
called upon on two occasions to testify before congressional appropriations committees regarding expanded funding for deafness and communications disorders.
His honors and awards were many. Dr. Kemink received the 1987 Program of
the Year Award from the University of Michigan Hospitals for the Cochlear Implant Program. He was selected for the Galens Faculty Honorary Award from
1990-92, and was awarded the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and
Neck Surgery Honor Award in 1990. Most recently, in February 1992, he was
named one of the ten best pediatric specialists in America by Child Magazine,
and this past spring Hope College honored him with its Distinguished Alumni
Award.
Dr. Kemink was recognized as a remarkable leader, gifted physician, and
outstanding teacher, not only in the medical center but internationally. Under
his direction, the neurootology program at the University of Michigan became
widely known as the premier academic program of its type in the world. He
served as director of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology medical student
education programs, and had been recently appointed co-director of the third


25




July Meeting, 1992


year Medical School curriculum. As a teacher and mentor, he was sought out and
praised by medical students, residents, and fellows alike.
Dr. Kemink will be sorely missed by those who had the privilege of knowing
him. The academic and medical communities, particularly the field of hearing
and communicative disorders, are significantly lessened by his departure. As we
mourn the loss of this distinguished scholar, surgeon, teacher, and friend, we
unite in extending our condolences to Dr. Kemink's wife Janet, daughter Lauren,
son John, and the rest of his family.
Degrees
Regent Smith moved, Regent Power seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, the following 1) the final degree lists for the May 1992 commencements; 2) the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies doctoral degree list

AM. with Regents Baker, McFee, Power, Smith, and Varner in attendance.
Student Fee Allocations for the Michigan Union, Michigan League,
North Campus Commons, and Recreational Sports
Regent McFee moved that authority be granted to the provost and vice
president for academic affairs to establish an annual budget allocation to cover
the operation and debt service support of the Michigan Union, Michigan League,
North Campus Commons, and Recreational Sports. Regent Baker seconded the
motion, and following some discussion, it was approved unanimously.
Common Stock Manager Guidelines
Vice President Womack explained that the University's investment advisors, Cambridge Associates, had recommended changes in the way the managers
are allowed to look at the universe of stocks that are available, without the imposition of stock quality rating restrictions that currently exist, as described in


26




July Meeting, 1992


the Regents Communication. The recommendation has also been discussed with
the Investment Advisory Committee. Regent Power moved that the University's
equity managers be permitted to invest University Endowment Fund assets
without imposition of stock quality rating restrictions which may interfere with
their management styles or with their ability to take advantage of market options. Regent Varner seconded the motion, and following some discussion, it was
adopted unanimously.
Partial Refinancing of $126,075,000 Hospital Revenue Bonds, Series
1986A
Vice President Womack explained that the result of the refinancing of the
Hospital Revenue Bonds will be to lower the interest rate cost by at least $2.5
million. He also noted that this is the portion of the hospital debt that is the Regents' debt, as opposed to the portion of the debt belonging to the State Building
Authority.
Regent Smith moved, Regent Power seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, adoption of the following resolution which authorizes the vice president and chief financial officer to 1) develop with the underwriters the terms and
legal documentation for the bonds, and to prepare, circulate, and execute preliminary and final official statements describing the bonds, the University, the Hospital, and its' affairs; and 2) apply for and obtain from Moody's Investors Service
and Standard & Poor's Corporation their ratings on the bonds; and 3) obtain a
final proposal for the bonds, including price and initial interest rate, negotiate,
execute, and deliver the bond purchase agreement with the underwriters, a trust
indenture with a trustee to be selected, and related documentation setting forth
the terms of the bonds and the sale and delivery of the bonds, all within the limitations of the resolution.

Natural Resources to the School of Natural Resources and Environment. Regent
Smith seconded the motion, and following some discussion, it was approved
unanimously, with the understanding that the change will require revisions to
the Regents' Bylaws.
Revision of Regental Policy Regarding Research Using Recombinant
DNA
Vice President Kelly reported that in response to regental action at the June
Regents' Meeting, he had considered the administrative burden imposed by existing Regental policy regarding research using recombinant DNA and was recommending that the two requirements that go beyond those required by existing
laws and regulations be removed from Regental policy. He stated that the vice
president for research would notify the Regents of any major new developments,
such as the initiation of research requiring the highest containment level
Following some discussion, Regent Brown moved changing the Regental
Policy on Recombinant DNA so as to read:
The University of Michigan shall adhere to all applicable federal
and state laws regarding the approval, conduct, and safety monitoring
of recombinant DNA research. The vice president for research shall report to the Regents upon request or when it is deemed appropriate by the
vice president. The vice president will report to the Regents on any initiation of research requiring containment above BL3.

Traditions Committee.
401 East Stadium Boulevard, Ann Arbor
Regent Smith moved approval of acquisition of the property at 401 East Stadium Boulevard, Ann Arbor, at a price of $3.3 million, recognizing the University
will be granted a first right of refusal to acquire the single story, brick office
building at a later date and the existing tenant of the office space will be granted
two years of free rent. Regent Varner seconded the motion.
Regent Baker observed that although he has always thought the University
should acquire that property, he was troubled by the price and by the fact that
the office building is not included in the transaction. Vice President Womack expressed agreement with Regent Baker's sentiments, but stated that there were
no other options. Regent Varner expressed the same concerns, but said that the
property is valuable enough to the University to justify paying the premium
price. She wished the price of the building, which is to be purchased in the future,
could have been negotiated at this time.
Vice President Womack responded that the proposed transaction had been
vigorously pursued, and this was the best arrangement that could be obtained.
Following further discussion, the vote was taken, with Regents Brown,
Power, McFee, Smith, and Varner in favor and Regent Baker abstaining.
Proposed Research Subcontract between the University of Michigan
and Stanford University
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Varner, all six Regents
present unanimously approved a subcontract between the University of Michigan and Stanford University, which is issued under a prime contract between the
University of Michigan and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) involving the Shuttle Electrodynamic Tether System (SETS).
Because the project director of SETS, Peter M. Banks, is an employee of the
University of Michigan and holds a no-salary appointment at Stanford University, this arrangement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be Stanford University and the Regents of the University of Michigan.
2.  The subcontract will obligate Stanford University to complete a portion of the

Resolution in Honor of Chancellor Blenda Wilson
Regent Varner read the following resolution, which was approved by acclamation:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan wish to commend,
thank, and congratulate Chancellor Blenda J. Wilson as she leaves the
University of Michigan to assume her new position as president of California State University at Northridge.
One of those rare individuals who can electrify a gathering by her
presence, Blenda Wilson personifies the meaning of "class.  Upon her
appointment as chancellor of the University of Michigan-Dearborn in
1988, she quickly rose to the challenge of being the first woman to lead a
public college in Michigan. With her characteristic style and energy, she
began pursuing the pledge she'd made in her inaugural address: to
make the UM-Dearborn the "best in class. 
Her infectious enthusiasm and dynamic leadership style not only
invigorated the faculty, staff, and administration, but also left its mark
on the broader Detroit metropolitan community. In four short years,
Chancellor Wilson has transformed the Dearborn campus, thrusting it
into the regional and national spotlight and thereby enhancing the entire University.
It takes a remarkable leader to systematically develop, pursue, and
achieve her goals with such vision, grace, and sense of purpose. Blenda
Wilson, a jewel among educators, exemplifies such a leader; she herself
is truly "best in class." As she and her husband, Louis Fair, leave
Michigan to accept new challenges in California and beyond, the
Regents express their gratitude and admiration to Blenda J. Wilson for
ajob well done.
President Duderstadt conveyed the University's thanks, congratulations,
and pride in Chancellor Wilson's achievements.


42




July Meeting, 1992


Comments by Chancellor Wilson
Chancellor Wilson thanked the Regents. She commented that the University of Michigan-Dearborn is wholly representative of the legacy of the University
of Michigan, as it assures that students in the greater metropolitan area will have
an opportunity to receive a Michigan education in every respect. She observed
that UM-Dearborn contains unusually talented and dedicated faculty, staff, and
students, and she has been proud to represent it. Chancellor Wilson thanked the
Regents and executive officers for their support and kindness over the years.
Interim Policy on Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment
In response to a question from Regent Smith, President Duderstadt reported that in light of the recent Supreme Court decision, the University has
suspended the speech component of the Interim Harassment Policy. He called on
Vice President Hartford to describe the steps being taken to revise that policy.
Vice President Hartford reported that she had been working with students
from MSA, along with deans, SACUA, and other student leaders, to develop a
revised version of the policy. Thirty-six thousand copies of Draft #10 are
currently being mailed out to the entire student body with a survey attached asking for input. Public hearings and focus groups will be held in September, with
the idea that a final draft should be ready to put into effect on October 9, 1992.
President Duderstadt stated that until that time, the present interim policy,
without the speech component, will remain in place.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:50 AM.
The next meeting will be held on September 17 and 18, 1992. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses for the month
of June 1992 totalled $2,679.28.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1992


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, September 17, 1992
The Regents met at 1:00 PRM. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, and
Varner. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were
Chancellor Jones and Interim Chancellor Klein. Regent Waters arrived shortly
after the start of the meeting.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order, and welcomed Bernard
Klein, Interim Chancellor for the Dearborn campus, to the Regents' meeting.
Commercials for Big Ten Conference Televised Games
President Duderstadt announced that as part of his efforts to convince universities nationwide to work together to rebuild the public trust, the Big Ten
Conference had agreed to use its allotted time for public service announcements
during televised games to air a series of promotional commercials that promote
the importance of higher education generally, rather than the merits of a particular university. He called on Mr. Walter Harrison, executive director of university
relations, to explain the process by which the Big Ten presidents had agreed to
participate in this effort. This is envisioned as at least a five-year campaign, during which each of the Big Ten universities would have at least one advertisement
devoted to one of its alumni The first commercial produced features the University of Michigan. He noted that Leo Burnett, a Chicago advertising agency, had
done all of the creative and coordinating work on a pro bono basis. The commercial was then played for the Regents.
Campaign for Michigan
President Duderstadt announced that on September 18, the University
would kick off the Campaign for Michigan, the largest fndraising project ever
mounted by a public university. In recognition of this campaign, Regent Brown
offered the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
This week, the University will publicly announce the Campaign for
Michigan, the largest fundraising campaign in the history of the institution, indeed the largest fundraising campaign ever undertaken by a
public university.
The campaign's goal will be one billion dollars-$850 million in
gifts and pledges and $150 million in new bequest intentions. This allfund campaign is a five-year concentrated effort to raise funds for many


45




September Meeting, 1992


of the University's most vital needs, including student financial aid,
faculty and program endowments, operating funds for every University
school and college, and facilities of various kinds on all three of the
University's campuses. The Campaign will appeal to the generosity of
all of Michigan's alumni and its many friends. Each gift-from the
largest to the smallest-will be important. It represents in the most concrete way possible an investment in the future.
Our goal is ambitious, but a successful Campaign for Michigan is
essential to the University. It represents our intention to fulfill the promise of public higher education for which this University has so long
stood making an education that is second to none available to the widest possible number of students from all backgrounds, or as President
James B. Angell put it over a century ago, providing "an uncommon
education for the common man. 
Be it resolved, therefore, that the Board of Regents warmly endorses the Campaign for Michigan; thanks all of the many volunteers
who are working so diligently and creatively in this effort; and urges the
executive officers, members of the administration, faculty, staff, and students of the University, its alumni and its many friends-all the maize
and blue faithful everywhere-to join them in supporting the University
through this most important fundraising effort.
The resolution was approved by acclamation.
University Annual Financial Statements for 1991-92
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Womack, who announced
that this is the first year in the University's history in which revenue had exceeded $2 billion. He pointed out that this revenue represents the enormous difference that the University makes in the lives of the people of the state and the
nation.
He noted that each of the eight opinions expressed by the outside auditor,
Ernst & Young, in the financial statements, contains the crucial statement:
"In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the University of
Michigan at June 30, 1992, and the changes in fund balances and the
current funds revenues, expenditures and transfers for the year then
ended in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles."
Vice President Womack also pointed out that this is the first year that the
opinion regarding Veritas contains no qualifications. He commented that these
reports are a tribute to the daily efforts of all University staff.
Year-End Financial Information
Vice President Womack then introduced Mr. Chandler Matthews, associate
vice president for finance and controller, and Mr. Robert Moenart, director of


46




September Meeting, 1992


financial operations and sponsored programs finance, to present the year-end financial information.
Mr. Moenart displayed charts and graphs illustrating changes in current
funds revenues by source from fiscal year 1982-83 to fiscal year 1991-92. In that
time period, state appropriations had decreased from 32.0 percent of educational
and general current funds to less than 27.0 percent. Since 1972, student fees as a
proportion of student fees and state appropriations have gone from about 35.0
percent to about 52.0 percent in 1992. Revenues from government programs
have steadily increased since 1983. The 10-year compound growth rate for current funds was 5.7 percent. Revenues from auxiliary activities have increased
from about $320 million in 1983 to over $900 million in 1992, with most of that
revenue from hospital and other medical activities.
As for expenditures, salaries, wages, and staff benefits comprised approximately 65.0 percent of expenditures in the Educational and General Funds in
1982-83, and approximately 61.0 percent in 1991-92. Scholarships and fellowships grew from 7.4 percent ($35 million) to 9.5 percent ($102 million) of expenditures during that time, with a compound growth rate of 12.6 percent. The total
compound growth rate for expenditures in educational and general funds for the
10-year period was 5.5 percent, with staff benefits having grown at twice the rate
of salaries and wages. Regent Baker asked for a breakdown in the various factors
contributing to the growth in staff benefits over time.
Expenditures for Auxiliary Activities funds grew from $350 million in 1983
to about $870 million in 1991-92. Total University revenues from all sources
grew from $797 million in 1982-83 to $2.04 billion in 1991-92, while expenditures
and transfers grew from $825 million to $1.95 billion in that time period.
In response to a question from Regent Power, Mr. Moenart said that the
two fastest-growing components in the supplies categories are primarily utilities
and telecommunications.
Regent Power observed that it would be helpful for indices to be developed
that would measure the comparative cost per unit of activity; this would serve as
a useful managerial tool for evaluating the University's performance in a variety
of areas. Vice President Womack observed that it would be difficult to define the
"output" variable; President Duderstadt pointed out that the annual U.S. News
and World Report ranking of colleges and universities provides one measure of
performance. He also noted that the Association of American Universities is currently working to devise a quantitative analysis mechanism, but it is difficult to
define measurement criteria Regent McFee suggested that the output measurements should reflect what the University is trying to achieve.
Following further discussion, Regent Power moved adoption of the annual
financial statements for 1991-92. Regent Varner seconded the motion. Regents
Power and Nielsen complimented the staff on the excellence of the University's
financial condition. There being no further discussion, the vote was taken and
the motion was approved unanimously.

September Meeting, 1992


1992-93 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
Vice President Womack presented an overview of current funds budgets
(General Fund, Designated Fund, Auxiliary Activities Fund, and Expendable Restricted Fund) for the 1992-93 fiscal year, compared with those for the 1991-92
fiscal year. Estimated revenues for 1992-93 are $2.092 billion (compared to
$1.889 billion in 1991-92); estimated expenditures will total $1.989 billion ($1.827
billion in 1991-92). State appropriations will rise from $307 million in 1991-92 to
$309 in 1992-93; tuition and fees will rise from $320 million to $353 million.
Current funds revenues have risen from about $850 million in 1984 to just
over $2 billion in 1992-93. The 1992-93 budgets consist of the General Fund (34
percent), Axiliary Activities Fund (40 percent for medical areas and 5 percent
for all other categories), Expendable Restricted Fund (18 percent), and the Designated Fund (3 percent).
Provost Whitaker took the floor to present the 1992-93 General Fund revenue budget, which totals $703 million for all three campuses. It is comprised of
state appropriations (42 percent), tuition and fees (50 percent), indirect cost reimbursement (6 percent), and other (2 percent). By function, General Fund expenditures consist of instruction (43 percent); academic support (18 percent);
"other" (public service, student services, institutional support, mandatory transfers) (15 percent); plant operations (13 percent); scholarships (8 percent); and research (3 percent). General Fund expenditures by object include salaries and
benefits (65 percent), nonsalaries (27 percent), and financial aid (8 percent).
Provost Whitaker reviewed the detailed budgets in the 1992-93 budget book
for the Colleges of LSA and Engineering, the Medical School, the School of Information and Library Studies, and the University Library. He also reviewed
charts depicting budget expenditures by school, by vice presidential areas, and
within the vice presidential areas of academic affairs and vice president and chief
financial officer.
Chancellor Klein and Chancellor Jones reviewed budgeted expenditures for
the Dearborn and Flint campuses, respectively. Chancellor Klein pointed out
that the biggest change in the Dearborn budget is in the area of institutional advancement. Chancellor Jones observed that most of the growth in the Flint campus' budget was from tuition and fees, which is a result of decreasing state
appropriations.
Vice President Womack took the floor to review revenue budgets for the
Designated, Auxiliary Activities, and Expendable Restricted Funds. Designated
Fund revenues, which total $62.5 million, are made up of departmental activities
(67 percent), investment income (29 percent), and private gifts (4 percent). The
budget for Auxiliary Activities is about $950.0 million, of which about 89 percent
is derived from medical activities. Other sources of Auxiliary Activities revenues
are housing (6 percent), "other" (3 percent), and athletics (2 percent). The Expendable Restricted Fund (voluntary private support and federally sponsored research programs) is $376.4 million. This budget is comprised of government


48




September Meeting, 1992


sponsored programs (63 percent), private gifts (29 percent), investments (6 percent), state appropriations (1 percent, and departmental activities (1 percent).
On a motion by Regent Varer, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
nnanimously approved the 1992-93 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets.
Regent Smith observed that she had read a report that the University had
hired 327 full-time employees on the Ann Arbor campus last year, and that given
the tight budget situation, this report greatly disturbed her. President Duderstadt noted that it is probable that if these figures are correct, they reflect new
hires associated with the hospitals and with increased research volume, neither
of which would be paid from the General Fund. Following further discussion, it
was decided to investigate the data described by Regent Smith and provide an explanation.
The vote was then taken on the motion to adopt the 1992-93 budgets; it was
approved unanimously.
Michigan Mandate
President Duderstadt handed out draft copies of the fourth-year report on
the Michigan Mandate. He noted that the Mandate had been very successful, and
that graduation rates for minority students were about twice as high as those at
other public institutions. The Mandate will be discussed in more detail at another meeting.
Minutes
Regent McFee moved approval of the minutes of the meeting of July 16 and
17. Regent Baker seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Packard Hanger, Willow Run Airport
Vice President Womack referred to a communication that had been distributed at the meeting, advising the Regents of discussions with Wayne County regarding the potential for disposing of the Packard Hangar at Willow Run
Airport. Regent Baker asked if his recall was correct, that at the time the University sold the airport to Wayne County, assurance was given that the Packard
Hangar would have access to the airport.
Vice President Womack responded that he did not believe this to be a correct assertion, as the issue of access is one of the areas of contention between the
parties and has been thoroughly researched during the course of the discussions
about the Packard Hanger. He reported that Wayne County and the University
have not been able to come to agreement on the appraised value of the property.
Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports on Investment Transactions,
Plant Extension, Litigation, and Personnel-Labor Relations. Vice President Kelly
submitted reports on Projects Established-Research and Other Activities and


49




September Meeting, 1992


Summaries of a Selection of Current Research and Sponsored Projects for the
months of July and August, 1991. On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by
Regent Varner, the Regents voted unanimously to receive the reports.
Voluntary Support
Vice President Cosovich submitted Reports on Voluntary Support for the
months of June, July, and August, 1992, and a summary report for Fiscal Year
1991-92. He noted that bequests and gifts from individuals were up from those of
the previous year. Regent Baker complimented Vice President Cosovich on his
achievements in securing voluntary support. On a motion by Regent Nielsen,
seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents voted unanimously to accept the following gifts, with thanks, and in accord with their terms and conditions:

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved adoption of the following retirement memoirs:
Kenneth A. Lockridge, professor of history, retired from active faculty
status on May 31, 1992. A nationally recognized historian of the American colonial period, he has been an important figure in the teaching of American colonial
history at the University for 22 years.
Professor Lockridge received his B.A degree, magna cum laude, from Yale
University in 1962, and completed his M.A and Ph.D. degrees at Princeton
University in 1964 and 1965, respectively. A member of Phi Beta Kappa at Yale,
he was elected as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at Princeton in 1962 and subsequently received more than 15 international fellowships and awards. Between
1965 and 1970, he taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle. Professor


82




September Meeting, 1992


Lockridge came to the University of Michigan as an associate professor of history
in 1970 and was promoted to professor in 1974.
In 1970, Professor Lockridge published his first major book: A New England Town: The First Hundred Years. This volume was chosen as one of the
"significant books in American history" for the five-year period 1969-1974 in a
poll printed in The American Scholar in 1975. By 1985, when an expanded edition was published, more than 130,000 copies of this influential work had been
sold. A New England Town combined sophisticated quantitative methodology
with a sensitive treatment of qualitative aspects of New England town development. These attributes also characterze Professor Lockridge's later work, Literacy in Colonial New England, and a series of subsequent essays on historical
demography. In 1981, Cambridge University Press published his Settlement and
Unsettlement in Early America: The Crisis of Political Legitimacy Before the
Revolution. These volumes and a series of distinguished essays firmly established
Professor Lockridge as one of the country's leading colonial historians.
While at Michigan, Professor Lockridge also undertook a number of significant professional assignments. He served as a consultant to the Newberry Library's Center for Family and Community History in Chicago, was a consultant on
demographic databases at Umea University in Sweden, and played a prominent
role in various Department of History internal committees, particularly those
having to do with fellowships. He leaves Michigan having contributed greatly to
the development of its distinguished program in early American history and with
our very best wishes.
The Regents now salute this nationally recognized American colonialist for
his scholarship and dedicated service to the University and the historical profession by naming Kenneth A Lockridge Professor Emeritus of History.
Patricia A. O'Connor, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases in the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1992.
Dr. O'Connor received her AB. degree in 1949, her M.D. degree in 1953,
and her M.P.H. degree in 1958, all from the University of Michigan. She completed her residency in pediatrics at University of Michigan Hospitals from
1953-1956, and was an instructor in pediatrics from 1956-57. She spent the years
1958-63 in Arkansas, serving as an instructor and assistant clinical professor in
pediatrics at the University of Arkansas Medical Center, medical director of the
Child Development Center, and director of the Division of Maternal and Child
Health of the Arkansas State Board of Health. She returned to the University of
Michigan Medical Center as an assistant professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases in the Medical School and as assistant professor of maternal and
child health in the School of Public Health, and assistant director of the pediatric
outpatient clinic at the University of Michigan Medical Center in 1963. She was
named director of the pediatric outpatient clinic in 1968. In 1969, she was
promoted to associate professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases and of
maternal and child health. She remained active in the clinical service, teaching,
and administration of that division until the onset of her retirement furlough in
the summer of 1991.


83




September Meeting, 1992


Dr. O'Connor's career has been characterized by her consistent devotion to
the rigorous training of medical students and pediatric residents in those aspects
of medicine which are designed to prevent illness and promote normal growth
and development. She was awarded the Kaiser Permanente Award for Excellence
in Teaching in the Clinical Sciences because of her 25 years of outstanding service to that goal Throughout most of her career, she was responsible for all of
the administrative and much of the clinical supervision of medical student education in all facets of ambulatory pediatrics. In this role, she was responsible for
nearly 10 percent of the educational experience of every third-year medical student for 30 years. Dr. O'Connor's personal clinical practice was exceptional in
that she provided service to large numbers of multiple handicapped children and
their parents. Her experience and skill in that endeavor, much used as a medical
model, will not be readily replaced.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for her dedicated service by
naming Patricia A O'Connor Associate Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics and
Communicable Diseases.
Memorials
No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees
Regent Brown moved approval of a recommendation for an honorary degree. Regent Varner seconded the motion. Following some discussion, the vote
was taken and the motion was approved unanimously.
June 30,1992 Report of Investments
Vice President Womack reported that the total of the University's invested
funds (University Investment Pool, University Endowment Fund, plus other invested funds) was $1.4 billion as of June 30, 1991, and $1.7 billion as of June 30,
1992. In 1991-92, the University Endowment Fund passed $500 million and by
June 30 had exceeded $600 million; over the past 10 years, the fund's purchasing
power had increased by 3.7 percent per annum. Vice President Womack pointed
out that the total return in the past year was 12.2 percent, which highlights the
value of diversification of the assets.
Vice President Womack praised the efforts of the development office, deans,
department chairs, and others around the University, as well as to University
Investment Officer Norman Herbert and his staff, for contributing to the growth
in the endowment Regents Power, Brown, and Baker also complimented the
people responsible for the growth of the investment portfolio.
Telephone Replacement Project
Regent Brown moved to authorize an increase in the budget for the Telephone Replacement Project to $46,140,000 to cover the increased cost of the telephone replacement contract. Regent Power seconded the motion.


84




September Meeting, 1992


Regent Baker observed that he had had serious reservations about certain
aspects of this project since its inception and had hoped that some of his concerns
would have been satisfied over the life of the construction project. He stated he
would vote against the motion, because these concerns have not been satisfied.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved, with Regents
Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner, and Waters in favor and Regent
Baker opposed.
Refinancing of $65,115,000 Hospital Revenue Bonds, Series 1990
Regent Power moved that the Regents adopt a resolution amending the
resolution authorizing the issuance and delivery of the Hospital Revenue Bonds,
Series 1992B. The resolution also authorizes the vice president and chief
financial officer to refinance all or a portion of the $65,115,000 Hospital Revenue
Bonds, Series 1990, in addition to the Series 1986A bonds, and to: 1) develop
with the underwriters the terms and legal documentation for the bonds, and to
prepare, circulate, and execute the preliminary and the final official statements
describing the bonds, the University, the Hospital, and its affairs; and 2) apply
for and obtain from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Corporation their ratings for the bonds; and 3) obtain a final proposal for the bonds, including price and initial interest rate, negotiate, execute, and deliver the bond
purchase agreement with the underwriters, a trust indenture with a trustee to be
selected, and related documentation setting forth the terms of the bonds and the
sale and delivery of the bonds, all within the limitations of the resolution. Regent
McFee seconded the motion.
Vice President Womack noted that the net savings from refinancing would
equal about $2.5 million. The vote was taken, and the motion was approved
unanimously. The text of the resolution is as follows:
RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AMENDING RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE AND
DELIVERY OF HOSPITAL REVENUE REFUNDING BONDS, AND
PROVIDING FOR OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO
WHEREAS, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer") adopted on July 17,
1992 a "Resolution of the Regents of the University of Michigan Authorizing the Issuance and
Delivery of Hospital Revenue Refunding Bonds, and Providing for Other Matters Relating
Thereto" (the "Resolution"), which Resolution provided for the issuance and delivery of Hospital
revenue Refunding Bonds for the purpose of refunding a portion of the Issuer's outstanding
$130,720,000 Hospital Revenue Bonds, Series 1986A; and
WHEREAS, it is now appropriate to amend the Resolution to permit the issuance of Hospital Revenue Refunding Bonds to refund all or a portion of the Issuer's $65,115,000 Hospital
Revenue Bonds, Series 1990;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. The Resolution is hereby amended as follows:


85




September Meeting, 1992


(a)  The third "WHEREAS" clause of the Resolution is hereby amended to
read in its entirety as follows:
"WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously issued under the Master Indenture its $130,720,000 Hospital Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series
1986A, dated as of May 1, 1986, and its $65,115,000 Hospital Revenue
Bonds, Series 1990, dated as of December 15, 1990 (collectively, the "Prior
Bonds"); and"
(b) The first and second sentences of paragraph 1 of the Resolution are hereby amended to read as follows:
"The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery
of the Bonds of the Issuer to be designated as shall be determined by an
Authorized Officer (but which designation shall include the words "HOSPITAL REVENUE REFUNDING BONDS") in the aggregate original
principal amount of not to exceed $185,000,000, to be dated as of the date
or dates to be determined by an Authorized Officer, for the purpose of
providing funds to pay the cost of the refunding of all or that portion of
the Prior Bonds as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer and costs
incidental to issuance of the Bonds and refunding of the Prior Bonds. The
Bonds should be serial Bonds or term Bonds or a combination thereof maturing not later than December 1, 2024."
(c)  All references in the Resolution to an aggregate original principal
amount of not to exceed Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) shall be amended
to increase the amount to not to exceed One Hundred Eighty-Five Million Dollars
($185,000,000).
2. All resolutions or parts of resolutions or other proceedings of the Issuer in conflict hereof
be and the same are hereby repealed insofar as such conflict exists. As amended hereby, the Resolution is ratified and confirmed.
Regent Baker suggested that once all of the bond refinancing has been completed, a summary report be compiled on the fixed costs that will have been saved
as a result of the refinancing.
Frederick Babcock Trust
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a recommendation that the treasurer and investment
officer be appointed advisor to the Babcock Trust, with the proviso that this
appointment shall apply to the position of treasurer and investment officer, and
not just to the current incumbent. They noted that the Babcock Trust was established as a perpetual trust, so it was appropriate to designate a position rather
than an individual as an advisor.
525 S. Division, Ann Arbor
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved purchase of the property at 525 S. Division in Ann Arbor
at a price of $162,000, with parking revenues being used to fund the acquisition.
358 West Ashby Road, Lee Township, Midland County, Michigan
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved acceptance of the offer of $225,000 for purchase of the
property at 358 West Ashby Road, Lee Township, Midland County, Michigan.


86




September Meeting, 1992


The proceeds will benefit the athletic department's Sports Service Building
(Glenn E. (Bo) Schembechler Hall).
Mary Markley and South Quad Renovation Projects
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved proceeding with projects for the renovation of Mary
Markley and South Quadrangle residence halls, as described in the Regents Communication.
Intercollegiate Athletics Athletic Administration Building Renovations
Regent Power moved approval of the project budget and awarding of the
contract for renovations to the athletic administration building to the low bidder,
MSI, of Detroit. Regent Smith seconded the motion, and following some discussion, it was adopted unanimously.
Frangois-Xavier Bagnoud Courtyard Sculpture
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a project to create a courtyard sculpture in connection
with the Frangois-Xavier Bagnoud Building, to be designed by Maya Lin, working with Johnson Johnson & Roy/inc.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects, as described in the Regents Communication: 1) Engineering 1-A ventilation improvements; 2) Alumni
Memorial Hall (Museum of Art) chiller replacement; 3) Medical Science I infrastructure and laboratory renovations; 4) UM-Dearborn Mardigian Library roof
replacement; and 5) UM Golf Course renovations.
Agreements between the University of Michigan and the Consortium
for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) for the
Conduct of Certain Tasks
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents approved the University's entering into agreements with CIESIN, with Regents
Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Varner, and Waters voting in favor, and
Regent Smith abstaining. Because certain University employees (Douglas E. Van
Houweling and Peter M. Banks) also serve on the board of directors of CIESIN
and the president of CIESIN (Jack Lousma) is an adjunct professor of aerospace
engineering, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreements will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and
CIESIN, Inc.
2.  The contracts between CIESIN and the University will be in the form of a basic
ordering agreement or other types of agreements as appropriate to the


87




September Meeting, 1992


circumstances of the project. The current Basic Organizing Agreement provides
up to $2,500,000 over a fourteen month period. Negotiations for the 1993 Basic
Ordering Agreement will soon begin. CIESIN and the University will agree
upon Task Orders for specific aspets of the project within the budget limit for
the Basic Ordering Agreement. University compensation for Drs. Van Houweling or Banks may be included depending on their scientific involvement in particular Task Orders. (Neither is currently budgeted to receive any portion of
their salaries from these agreements.) Other University employees will participate in provision of technical services to CIESIN at CIESIN facilities and will
act in management positions for CIESIN for periods of time as necessary and
agreed in writing. The Basic Ordering Agreement is consistent with standard
University policies regarding publication and intellectual property.
3.   Neither Van Houweling nor Banks receive a salary or other pecuniary benefit
from CIESIN and neither is receiving any portion of his University salary from
the performance of this subcontract. Mr. Lousma receives a salary as president
of CIESIN. No other university employee has a personal pecuniary interest in
these agreements.
Reassignment of the University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual
Property (Nicklas, Lee, Greenhut, and Monsur)
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Smith, the Regents
unanimously approved an assignment agreement with John M. Nicklas, Jong
Lee, Saul Greenhut, and Joseph Monsur for the intellectual property "Laboratory Data Processor." Because the inventors of the intellectual property are also
University employees, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict
of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the assignment agreement will be the University of Michigan and the
above-named employees/inventors.
2.   The terms and pecuniary interests were previously disclosed to and approved by
the Regents on July 16, 1987, and are hereby incorporated by reference in this
action request.
Reassignment of the University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual
Property (Ensminger, Andrews, Knol)
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved an assignment agreement with William D. Ensminger,
James C. Andrews, and James A Knol for the intellectual property "Intravascular Catheter Anchor for Vascular Access Catheters (Cath-Tach)." Because the inventors of the intellectual property are also University employees, this agreement
falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the assignment agreement will be the University of Michigan and the
above-named employees/inventors.
2.   The terms and pecuniary interests were previously disclosed to and approved by
the Regents on July 16, 1987, and are hereby incorporated by reference in this
action request.


88




September Meeting, 1992


Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and
k-Space Associates, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a contract between the University of Michigan and
k-Space Associates, Inc. ("k-Space"). Because the owners of k-Space (Roy Clarke
and Darryl Bartlett) are both the developers of the technology to be commercialized by k-Space (the "Technology") and are University employees, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and k-Space, a corporation owned by Professor Roy Clarke and Mr. Darryl Bartlett.
2.   Terms of the contract include: a duration of 10 years or for the term of the last
to expire of any patents (if applicable), and consideration to the University
consisting of the payment of royalties, including modest minimum annual
requirements, on products utilizing the Technology, a share of sublicensing
revenues received by k-Space; and reimbursement of future University patent
filing and prosecution costs for the Technology, if applicable. Royalties will be
paid to the University at a rate of 10 percent for products sold by k-Space which
are covered by one or more patents, and 7 percent for products sold which incorporate University copyrights and know-how. k-Space will pay the University
35 percent of any sublicensing revenues k-Space receives. Minimum royalties
shall commence in 1993 at $1,000 and progress to $2,000 in 1994 and in each
subsequent year. For two years, k-Space shall be allowed to deduct, from royalties due the University, the cost of product liability insurance, which is being
obtained by k-Space and will be maintained at the University's request. The
University retains ownership of all Technology. The University retains the
right to use the Technology for research, teaching, and other educationallyrelated purposes. k-Space shall diligently pursue the commercial development
and exploitation of the Technology covered by the proposed license agreement.
There is no use of facilities or services of the University included in the contract
and no assignment of University employees for fulfillment of the contract.
3.   Professor Clarke and Mr. Bartlett's pecuniary interest in the contract arises
from their ownership of the entirety of k-Space. Professor Clarke and Mr. Bartlett's equity interest will be in lieu of participation in the sharing of royalties
received by the University, in accordance with standard University policy.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and
Improvement Path Systems (IPS)
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved the University's entering into a license agreement with
IPS. The owners of IPS, Steven J. Littig and Linda A Urich, formed IPS to commercialize a computerized discharge system      ("Program") they had invented.
Because Mr. Littig is also a University employee, this arrangement falls under
the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the license agreement will be the University of Michigan and Improvement Path Systems, a corporation in which Steven J. Littig has part ownership.
2.   The terms of the contract include: Royalties to be paid to the University in the
amount of $250.00 for each copy of the Program licensed to a third party by


89




September Meeting, 1992


IPS or its affiliates and 25 percent of sublicensing revenues. Minimum annual
royalties of $200 in 1993 and $450 in each suceeding year are payable to the
University. The University retains the right to use internally and create derivative works from the Program.
3.  Steven Littig and Linda Urich's pecuniary interest in the contract arise from
their ownership interest in IPS. Their equity interest will be in lieu of any
potential participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University in
accordance with University policy

On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Nielsen, the Regents
unanimously approved the following resolution commemorating the 175th anniversary of the founding of the University of Michigan.
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commemorate the 175th
anniversary of the enactment of legislation by the Territorial Legislature
of Michigan, which established the "Catholepistemiad, or University, of
Michigania" in Detroit on August 26, 1817.
We celebrate the wisdom and vision of the founders of Michigan's
first educational system. Their belief in the principle of broad public
support for a unified educational system has led to a tradition of academic excellence at the University of Michigan.
As we begin the 175th year, it is worth noting that the institution
which exists in 1992 as one of the foremost in the nation officially began
in 1817 with only a president, a vice president, an organizational structure, and one small building. The population of the entire Michigan territory was only about 7,000 at that time, and today we have a student
enrollment of well over 50,000, along with more than 4,000 faculty and
18,000 staff at three campuses. From 42 acres of rural land in Ann Arbor where the first University classes were held, to total land holdings of
20,851 acres, the University of Michigan has grown, both in size and
stature.
Today we salute 175 years of the University of Michigan, and we
look forward to the future with great expectations for the next 175 years.
Public Comments
There were no speakers signed up to address the Regents this month.
Campaign for Michigan
President Duderstadt commented the events of the next 48 hours are very
important for the University of Michigan, as they would mark the kickoff of the
Campaign for Michigan. He expressed appreciation for the Regents continuing
involvement in these activities.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1992


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, October 15, 1992
The Regents met at 10:13 AM. in the Michigan Rooms of the Harding Mott
University Center at the University of Michigan-Flint. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, and Smith.
Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice President
Womack were also present.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Regent
Nielsen, who made the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(e), 8(f), and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act,
as amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in
closed session at 10:00 AM. on October 15, 1992, in the Alumni Rooms,
Harding Mott University Center, for the purpose of consulting with our
attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection with specific pending litigation, reviewing the specific contents of applications for
employment where the candidates have requested that the applications
remain confidential, and considering material exempt from discussion
or disclosure by state and federal statute.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. The
meeting participants left the room and continued meeting in closed session in the
Alumni Rooms. Regents Varner and Waters arrived shortly after the start of the
closed meeting, which was adjourned at 12:20 PM.
The Regents met again in open session at 1:45 PM. in the Michigan Rooms
of the Harding Mott University Center Building. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner, and
Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were
Chancellors Jones and Klein.
Community Dental Center
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and asked Vice President
Kennedy to present an information item about the Community Dental Center.
Vice President Kennedy noted that the legislature had recently passed a
resolution in honor of the Community Dental Center, which is a joint cooperative
effort between the University and the City of Ann Arbor to provide dental care
for low income residents of Washtenaw County. He introduced Dr. Robert
Bagramian, director of the Community Dental Center, who gave a brief
description of the program.

October Meeting, 1992


1993-94 State Budget Request, Ann Arbor Campus
President Duderstadt called on Provost Whitaker to present the 1993-94
State Budget Request. Provost Whitaker noted that the University's large employment base, leveraged by the state's contribution, is a direct benefit to the
state. Indirect benefits of the state's investment, which far exceed direct benefits,
include new knowledge, patient care, and education of citizens who go on to build
businesses in the state, which in turn provide employment benefits and income
to the state.
The 1993-94 State Budget Request requests a continuation of the current
level of support, plus additional support. He displayed a chart illustrating the decline in purchasing power of the state appropriation since 1980. In 1992-93, the
General Fund Budget was affected by a flat state appropriation, an expected loss
of $3.0 million in revenue from indirect cost recovery, an expected reduction of
$3.5 million in interest income, and concerns about possible further reductions in
the current fiscal year. The 1992-93 budget reflects the "shared sacrifice" approach taken to deal with these losses in revenue.
Continuing critical academic needs for 1993-94 include an adequate salary
program, continuing to increase faculty diversity and expand financial aid, improving the undergraduate educational experience, and increasing the internationalization of the curricula. Facilities-related needs include improving the
infrastructure, operating costs for new facilities, and costs for new facilities that
have been deferred from prior years.
There are three components of the 1993-94 state budget request: a 2.9 percent inflation component to maintain the purchasing power of the current budget ($7.9 million); a facilities-related component to cover operating costs ($5.8
million) and infrastructure maintenance improvement ($3.4 million); and an increase of 3.0 percent for salary and academic program improvement ($8.2 million), for a total requested increase of $25.3 million.
1993-94 State Budget Request, Dearborn Campus
Chancellor Klein reported that the UM-Dearborn request identifies four
critical needs: new faculty ($259,000); new space operating costs ($348,000); an
inflation component of 2.9 percent ($536,000); and service to the community to
expand outreach programs ($150,000), for a total increase of 8.0 percent
($1,293,000).
1993-94 State Budget Request, Flint Campus
Chancellor Jones stated that the Flint campus' priorities include an
inflationary increase program of 5 percent to improve faculty salaries and help
recruit new full-time faculty ($1,375,000); facilities operation and maintenance
costs ($292,000); additional support for minority recruitment and retention
($100,000); enhancements in information technology services ($200,000); academic program enhancement and new academic ventures ($250,000); library acquisitions ($100,000); and science building equipment maintenance ($50,000).
The total requested increase is $2,367,000.


94




October Meeting, 1992


Regent Nielsen complimented Chancellor Jones for his leadership on the
Flint campus and for encouraging programs that enhance the campus' relationships with the Flint community. He also noted that a number of Flint students
had contacted him asking that a residential housing community be considered
for the Flint campus. He suggested that this might be pursued as a joint venture
with other educational institutions in the Flint area.
Chancellor Jones responded that he would be supportive of the campus having the freedom to plan and investigate the feasibility of housing for the campus.
Regent Nielsen pointed out that because of the unique relationship that exists
between the city of Flint and the University, UM-Flint ought to be given the opportunity to explore this type of arrangement.
Regent Smith pointed out that the Dearborn campus also has no residential
facilities, noting that she had voted against converting housing to academic use.
Chancellor Jones observed that UM-Dearborn had the option of housing but had
chosen not to continue it. Regent Smith said she supports Regent Nielsen's suggestion.
President Duderstadt agreed that this idea should be explored. Regent Baker pointed out that there were a number of reasons for the original decision not
to incorporate residential facilities into the Flint campus. Chancellor Jones stated
that he would not support the campus losing its nonresidential emphasis, but
that didn't mean that there should be no housing. Many urban commuter campuses have housing, but it is a matter of emphasis.
President Duderstadt observed that the 1993-94 State Budget Requests recognize the very serious financial pressures on the state of Michigan. He pointed
out that state support had deteriorated markedly over the past five years and
that the state's colleges and universities had done an excellent job of planning in
a conservative, prudent fashion while protecting the quality of their programs.
Regent Power stated that it is now being accepted among the state's leaders
that the reason that universities have found it necessary to raise tuition and find
other funding sources is because a public policy decision is being made not to invest in the future of our people. The issue of whether the country is going to invest in this area needs to be openly debated, and the quality of its universities
will depend on the public policy consequences of that discussion.
Regent Nielsen pointed to UM-Flint's joint venture with Hurley Hospital as
an example of the type of resource sharing that will have to be undertaken by
other institutions in the state. He reported that a board member at Eastern
Michigan University had expressed an interest to him in a joint arrangement,
and said that as a leader in higher education, the University of Michigan should
take the initiative to explore such opportunities with other institutions in an effort to reduce costs.
In response to Regent Power's comments, Regent McFee observed that the
issue is not whether we should invest in education, but what kind of investment
should be made in terms of the output that is desired from that investment. She


95




October Meeting, 1992


felt that the University of Michigan could be a leader in assuring that the outcomes achieved from the investments into the University are of value to students
and citizens.
Regent Baker moved approval of the 1993-94 State Budget Requests for all
three campuses. Regent Smith seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Ernst & Young Management Report and Responses
Vice President Womack introduced Mr. Robert Emde of Ernst & Young.
Mr. Emde introduced two colleagues: Harold Miller of Ernst & Young in Detroit
and George Johnson, managing partner of George Johnson and Company in Detroit. His firm provided staff assistance to Ernst & Young during the audit.
Mr. Emde reported that the third paragraph of the audit report expresses
the opinion that the University's financial statements present fairly its financial
position, results of operations, changes, and fund balances for the year, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. He noted that the accounting principles used in 1992 were consistent with those used in 1991. The opinion
of the audits of the financial statements of the separately reported University
units were unqualified, as well. Mr. Emde further stated that the review of the
internal control structure did not reveal any condition that Ernst & Young would
consider to be a material weakness in procedures or controls.
Mr. Emde noted that the University administration had concurred with
each of the suggestions in the management letter for further improvement and
strengthening of the University's procedures and controls, and that each of the
action steps planned in response to the suggestions is appropriate.
Regent Baker offered the auditors an opportunity to talk to the Regents in
private if they had any concerns. Regent Power noted that he had never seen a
management letter that is, by its lack of problems, so complimentary to the financial and administrative management of a large institution such as the University.
Minutes
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
voted unanimously to approve the minutes of the meeting of September 17, 1992.
Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports on Investment Transactions,
Plant Extension, Litigation, Personnel-Labor Relations, and Non-Competitive
Purchases over $2,000. He called attention to the chart indicating the decline in
the rates of return for the University Investment Pool and noted that attention is
being paid to ways of enhancing those returns, while still providing for the kind
of liquidity and security that the pool requires. He then responded to questions
from the Regents about several of the reports.


96




October Meeting, 1992


Vice President Kelly submitted reports of Projects Established-Research
and Other Activities and Summaries of a Selection of Current Research and
Sponsored Projects.

Retirement Memoirs
The Regents voted unanimously to adopt the following retirement memoirs:
Harm Buning, professor of aerospace engineering, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1992, after an outstanding career as a teacher and educator.
Professor Buning received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan in 1949 and 1951, respectively. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor of aerospace engineering
in 1956, and was promoted to associate professor in 1958 and professor in 1963.
The major part of Professor Buning's career was concerned with manned
space flight and related subjects. A leading expert in astrodynamics and spaecraft design, Professor Buning was selected by the Johnson Manned Spacecraft
Center to lecture the original groups of astronauts on orbital mechanics. He also
taught courses on flight mechanics at NASA in Houston. At the University of
Michigan, his courses on spacecraft design were an outstanding success and were
supported by NASA through the Universities Space Research Association. He


109




October Meeting, 1992


achieved a national reputation for his leadership of these design courses, and
numerous students benefited from this unique opportunity to be part of a major
spacecraft design effort.
In addition to his close interactions with NASA, Professor Buning has been
involved in numerous professional activities. He was active in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and was a member of many acreditation committees for aerospace engineering curricula for departments throughout
the country. In the Department of Aerospace Engineering, Professor Buning was
the undergraduate program advisor and served as associate chair of the department from 1966 until his retirement. He was recognized by the University as an
outstanding teacher by the award of a Thurnau Professorship in 1988.
Professor Buning's contributions to the department's educational programs
have been exceptional. He has provided outstanding educational leadership and
has always been willing to share his time and effort on behalf of his faculty colleagues and his students. His long-term commitment to the Department of Aerospace Engineering is greatly appreciated.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Harm Buning Professor Emeritus of Aerospace Engineering.
Lyall H. Powers, professor of English language and literature, will retire
from active faculty status on December 31, 1992.
A native of Canada, Professor Powers received his B.S. and M.S. degrees
from the University of Manitoba in 1948 and 1951, respectively, and his Ph.D.
degree from Indiana University in 1955. After teaching at the University of Wisconsin, he came to the University of Michigan as an assistant professor in 1958;
he was promoted to associate professor in 1963 and professor in 1968. He has
held visiting professorships and exchange professorships at several universities.
He has also served as vice-chair and then chair of the language and literature section, Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters Convention. His honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship and election as a fellow of the Royal Society of
Arts.
Professor Powers has published numerous studies of twentieth century fiction, particularly the work of Henry James and William Faulkner. His many essays range widely from the eighteenth century work of Henry Fielding to that of
Nathaniel Hawthorne and Mark Twain in the nineteenth century and Thornton
Wilder and James Baldwin in the present century. His scholarly work includes a
bibliography of American periodicals as well as editions of the notebooks and letters of James and of Edith Wharton. The richness of the resources his work has
made available in James studies constitutes a major achievement which will continue to benefit all scholars working on the enormous body of literature left by
this master artist. His current work continues to bear fruit in further editions
and studies of the fiction of James, Wilder, and the Canadian novelist, Margaret
Laurence.
Many graduate students studying the genre of fiction have benefited from
Professor Powers' conscientious and genial guidance on honors essays, masters'
theses, and doctoral dissertations. Combining erudition and wit, he has been a
popular lecturer in many of the department's most successful courses. He has


110




October Meeting, 1992


also been a loyal and collegial academic citizen, serving on many administrative
and consultative bodies on the departmental, college, and University levels.
The Regents now honor this distinguished scholar, teacher, and educator by
naming Lyall H. Powers Professor Emeritus of English Language and Literature.
John F. Riordan, professor of mathematics in the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters and professor of computer and information science in the
School of Engineering, retired from active faculty status at the University of
Michigan-Dearborn on June 30, 1992.
Professor Riordan received his B.S. degree from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in 1948 and his M.S. degree from the University of Michigan in
1949. From 1951-53, he served as a mathematician with the U.S. Air Force, after
which he returned to the University in various research capacities. From
1961-66, Professor Riordan served on the staffs of the Institute of Science and
Technology (IST) and the UM Computing Center. He joined the faculty of the
UM-Dearborn as an associate professor of industrial engineering in 1968 and in
1969 received a joint appointment as associate professor of  mathematics. He was
granted tenure in 1970, and joined the mathematics department full time in
1971. He was promoted to professor of mathematics and statistics in the College
of Arts, Sciences, and Letters in 1975 and was awarded the additional title of professor of computer and information science in the Division of Interdisciplinary
Studies in 1985.
Although trained as a mathematician, Professor Riordan's interests
spanned engineering, mathematics, and computer science. He published in the
area of spectral filters, programming methods, and Fourier transforms. He did
early work in analogue calculations while at IST and, during the years 1959-77,
was a lecturer and/or chair of the University of Michigan Engineering Summer
conferences. He also served as a consultant to the American Mathematical Society during much of his academic career.
As a teacher, Professor Riordan was especially adept at dealing with students on a one-to-one basis. He was responsible for introducing several courses
into the     mathematics curriculum, was one of the early architects of the computer
science program, and served for a number of years as chair of the Computers and
Computational Mathematics Committee. In 1990, his efforts on behalf of the
computer and information science program were recognized by a nomination for
a "Best in Class" award at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming John F. Riordan Professor Emeritus of Mathematics and Professor
Emeritus of Computer and Information Science.

October Meeting, 1992


University of Michigan Financial Report for the Year Ended June 30,
1992
Vice President Womack submitted the financial report for the University of
Michigan for the year ended June 30, 1992, and responded to questions from the
Regents.
Asset-Backed and Mortgage-Backed Security Investments
Regent Varner moved, and Regent McFee seconded, that the University's
fixed-income investment guidelines for "Other Invested Funds" be amended as
follows (amendments underlined):
The following types of fixed income investments are eligible for
purchase In any fund'
U.S. dollar or Eurodollar notes, debentures, bonds, assetbacked securities. mortgage-backed securities, or floating-rate
instruments rated "A" or better by Standard & Poor's corporation or Moody's Investors Service.
Following some discussion, the vote was taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Common Fund Inventories
Vice President Womack submitted the June 30, 1992, inventories of the
Common Fund pooled funds in which the University Endowment Fund participates, and responded to questions from Regent Baker about the return compared
to that of Standard & Poors.
South Campus Master Plan
Vice President Womack introduced Mr. Richard Rigterink, of Johnson &
Roy/inc to present the South Campus master plan. Mr. Rigterink used maps and
slides to illustrate the major points of the master plan and to describe the
features of each of the four development zones. Following some discussion,
Regent Power moved approval of the master plan for the South Campus of the
University of Michigan. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
UM-Flint Campus 1991-92 Master Plan Update
Vice President Womack again called on Mr. Rigterink to present the master
plan update for the Flint campus. The Regents had requested that the plan be
updated as a result of the acquisition of the Water Street Pavilion and the relocation of the Frances Willson Thompson Library.
Mr. Rigterink used maps and slides to illustrate the features of the updated
master plan. He pointed out that the plan includes four areas of special interest
to the Flint campus. These are areas that are currently not owned by the University but are so close in proximity to the University that careful attention needs to


112




October Meeting, 1992


be paid to their future use. He identified these areas as the State Office Building
and parking deck, the former AutoWorld theme park, the United Way site, and
the municipal parking lot immediately adjacent to the University Pavilion.
Regent Nielsen noted that the master plan does not contain any references
to residential housing. He said about two years ago a scheme for residential housing had been envisioned which could be utilized not only by UM-Flint but by all
of the educational institutions in the Flint area He requested that the plan be revised to address housing issues.
Mr. Rigterink reported that housing had been discussed in relation to the
master plan but that it was his understanding it did not play a part in the University's current educational mission. However, planners are appreciative of the
fact that there appears to be a need for housing, which currently is being filled by
private entrepreneurs.
Regent Nielsen again urged that the plan be reworked to incorporate residential housing. Mr. Rigterink suggested that a possible use for the AutoWorld
site could be for housing.
In the discussion following Mr. Rigterink's presentation, Regent Power observed that more work needs to be done to incorporate the riverfront as a major
feature of the campus. Regent Power also stated that access to the campus and
parking areas needs to be improved from that which currently exists, especially
from the south and west. Mr. Rigterink agreed with both of these points and described how planners are addressing these concerns.
Regent Nielsen moved that approval of the master plan update be postponed until the residential housing issue is addressed. Regent Smith seconded
the motion. In the discussion of this motion, Regent Power cautioned against the
Board's dictating a use for a specific activity, such as housing, for which neither a
demonstrated need nor demonstrated purpose exists on campus. Regent Nielsen
responded that the community has expressed a desire for housing to service the
educational corridor and he believes the plan should address the interests of the
community.
Regent McFee suggested that the issue could be addressed in a section of the
plan identified as recommendations for future consideration. Mr. Rigterink
stated that there is a section in the technical report that deals with such issues
and that housing could be added to that section.
Regent Baker observed that the master plan is a flexible document that
allows for changing circumstances as they arise, and cited the siting of the library
as an example. He advised rejecting the motion for this reason, noting that
Chancellor Jones has made a commitment to review the issue of residential
housing. Regent Brown agreed, noting that the plan has been amended in the
past and can be amended in the future. Adoption of the plan as it currently exists
does not preclude addressing the issue of housing in the fiture.
Regent Nielsen responded that the Regents would be sending a message to
the Flint community if a plan is approved that has no reference to the issue of


113




October Meeting, 1992


housing whatsoever, given that they have indicated they would like to have it addressed
Regent Power made a substitute motion to adopt the master plan as presented and invite JJR to consider the need for residential housing and Chancellor
Jones to consult with the Flint community as to the way the residential housing
needs of the community may be adapted into the evolving master plan. Regent
Brown seconded the motion.
At the suggestion of Regent Nielsen, Regent Power's substitute motion was
amended to state that the results of the housing needs study be reported back to
the Regents in six months time. Regent Power supported the amendment.
There being no further discussion, the vote was taken, and the motion was
approved unanimously.
Horace H. Rackham Educational Memorial Building in Detroit
Vice President Womack reported that Wayne State University (WSU) had
approached the University of Michigan about the possibility of the Rackham
Building in Detroit being used as a site for a school they were seeking to establish. The University would like to lease all or a part of the building to WSU in
consideration of their agreement both to assume the responsibilities concerning
the educational activities taking place and to make the necessary renovations in
this leased space in the Rackham Building. It is also expected that the Engineering Society of Detroit would enter into an agreement with Wayne State University. The Regents are being asked to approve the lease of all or a large part of the
University's portion of the space in the Rackham Building, and for reasons described in the Regents Communication, to pursue a court action to obtain Michigan attorney general and court approval of the lease and any subsequent
conveyance to WSU.
President Duderstadt stated that the University's commitment to and involvement in Detroit are continuing to expand, but will increasingly be conducted in multiple locations. The University intends to establish other sites for
outreach in the city.
Provost Whitaker reported that faculty in the UM and WSU Schools of
Education are involved in discussions to determine what might be an appropriate
kind of participation for UM faculty and students in this venture.
In response to a question from Regent Nielsen, Vice President Womack
stated that a 30-50 year lease is being contemplated because of the amount of
money WSU will be required to spend for renovating the facility to comply with
the Americans with Disabilities Act. Regent Nielsen expressed his opposition to
selling the property. Vice President Womack responded that authority is being
sought to lease the property, not to sell it. However, authority is also being
sought for allowing the Regents to convey the property if it wishes to do so at
some time in the future.


114




October Meeting, 1992


Regent Nielsen responded that he was not opposed to a lease concept but
that he vehemently opposed efforts to sell or convey the property.
In response to a question from Regent McFee, Regent Varner observed that
the community in general welcomes WSU's interest in public education in the
city. Her major concern is what would replace the Rackham Building as the symbol of the University of Michigan's presence in Detroit, should that presence be
withdrawn. Regent Smith expressed the same concerns as Regents Nielsen and
Varner.
Regent Varner noted that if this action regarding the Rackham Building is
approved, it would create an incentive to make the Dearborn campus more a part
of Detroit. Chancellor Klein pointed out that the Dearborn Campus had in the
past requested the use of parts of the Rackham Building for outreach programs
and had been turned down for lack of funding. They had been disappointed when
this happened because it had prevented UM-Dearborn from representing the
University's presence in Detroit.
In response to a question from Vice President Womack, Provost Simpson of
UM-Dearbom described the circumstances of the request made by the Dearborn
campus. Vice President Womack reported that there has never been an official
request made to him, nor had there ever been a discussion by the executive
officers of any interest on the part of UM-Dearborn in that property. He observed
that had such a request come forward, it would have been considered warmly.
There was further discussion about the physical characteristics of the Rackham Building and what would be required to make it barrier free. Several comments were made about the extraordinay architecture and craftsmanship in
that building and about the potential damage that could be inflicted upon it were
it to be used as a middle school
Mr. Jim Christenson, director of Plant Operations, stated that the Engineering Society has been used as the University's agent to manage space in the
Rackham Building. They have stopped leasing space out of fear of lawsuits related to the building's inaccessibility. Thus, no income can be expected from the
building, it is only an expense.
Regent McFee suggested that since the legislature has agreed to appropriate
funds to WSU to make the building barrier-free, it might be to the University's
advantage to explore the idea of a joint venture with WSU or perhaps a joint use
of the building rather than just leasing it to them.
Regent Brown suggested delaying action on the proposal until the next
meeting, Regent Nielsen supported this idea. Regent Baker asked that the
parking deck situation also be examined. He stated he would not be opposed to
leasing the building but advocates a shorter term and some control over how the
state appropriation is spent so as not to injure the University's interests. He expressed concern about a possible joint venture.
President Duderstadt stated that the proposition would be returned to the
Regents at the November meeting with a broader set of options and with


115




October Meeting, 1992


attention paid to the Regents' concerns. Regent Varner commented that it was
difficult for her to visualize the Rackham Building being used as a middle schooL
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following people on the topics indicated: Gena R. Beamon, staff member, on tuition waivers for employees; Brian
Kight and Robert Van Houweling, students, on the Statement of Student Rights
and Responsibilities.
Following Public Comments, the Regents returned to the business agenda
Tennis Center
Regent Baker moved that the site of the new Tennis Center be changed
from the previously approved location of the former Par Three Golf Course on
South Main Street to the northern portion of recently acquired property on
South State Street, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent Brown
seconded the motion.
Mr. Fred Mayer, university planner, described the site and responded to
questions. The vote was then taken and the motion was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan Hospitals Implementation of the Hospitals'
Network Upgrade
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved submission of a Certificate of Need application to the
Michigan Department of Public Health for the upgrade of the Hospitals' communication network infrastructure at a total cost of $6,800,000.
Replacement of Adult Cardiology Catheterization Laboratory Equipment in University of Michigan Hospitals
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved submission of a Certificate of Need application to the
Michigan Department of Public Health for replacement of the adult cardiac catheterization laboratory equipment in the University of Michigan Hospitals.
University of Michigan Hospitals' Expansion of Cardiac Surgery Services to Crittenton Hospital
Regent Nielsen moved approval of submission of a Certificate of Need application to the Michigan Department of Public Health for expansion of cardiac surgery services to Crittenton Hospital
Vice President Womack responded to questions about the proposal from
Regent Power. The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved
unanimously.


116




October Meeting, 1992


Renovations
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Nielsen, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects: 1) modification of Unit
8B in University of Michigan Hospitals (UMH) to accommodate allogeneic bone
marrow transplant patients; 2) renovations in the North Ingalls Building to
house the MNet (Referring Physician Computer Network) program; 3) replacement of UMH angiography equipment with a neurointerventional imaging system; 4) renovation of labs G142 and G173 in the Dana Building for the School of
Natural Resources and Environment; and 5) replacement of condensate water
lines in the School of Dentistry.
Resolution Regarding Gift Designation for Matching Grants
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Smith, the Regents
unanimously approved the following: 1) their acceptance of certain gifts already
received and accepted by them prior to August 1992 on the terms and conditions
under which they were solicited, received, and accepted, for the agreed upon purpose of meeting and matching qualification standards for this grant; and 2) their
understanding that these gifts, and any future gifts solicited, received, and accepted for this purpose, which qualify for the matching funds, are and will be
committed as permanent endowment funds of the Horace H. Rackham School of
Graduate Studies or the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
Agreements between the University of Michigan and Advanced Network and Services (ANS)
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved agreements with Advanced Network and Services (ANS),
a nonprofit company formed by MERIT, IBM, and MCI, to operate the Network
Operations Center on the University of Michigan's North Campus.
Because the chair of the ANS board of directors, Douglas Van Houweling, is
also a University employee, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreements will be the Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan and Advanced Network and Services (ANS).
2.  The proposed contracts between ANS and the University of Michigan will be in
the form of a lease agreement for University space at the UM Network
Operations Center (NOC) at $25 per square foot, with a contract for services
totaling approximately $109,000 annually for 18 months effective November 1,
1992. There will be no University employees assigned to the facility or service
contract
3.  Dr. Van Houweling will not receive a salary or other pecuniary benefit from
ANS and is not receiving any portion of his University salary from the performance of these contracts. No other University of Michigan employee has a
pecuniary interest in these agreements.


117




October Meeting, 1992


Agreements between the University of Michigan and the Medical College of Ohio
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved a subcontract between the University of Michigan and
the Medical College of Ohio to conduct a joint research project. Because one of
the parties to the agreement, Dr. Robert Blumenthal, is an employee of the Medical College of Ohio and also is an adjunct associate professor at the University of
Michigan, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreements will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and
the Medical College of Ohio.
2.   The agreement will be a standard Michigan subcontract for three years in the
amount of $79,052. The prime award from the National Science Foundation is
for three years in the amount of $390,000. The proposed subcontract will detail
the scope of work and the budget.
3.   Dr. Blumenthal will be compensated by the Medical College of Ohio from the
subcontract for a total of 1.8 months. His adjunct appointment at Michigan is
without compensation.
Reassignment of the University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual
Property (William D. Ensminger)
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved reassignment of the University's ownership interest in
the intellectual property of William D. Ensminger, "Implantable Access Device."
Because Dr. Ensminger is also a University employee, this agreement falls under
the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the assignment agreement will be the University of Michigan and
William D. Ensminger, MD., Ph.D.
2.   The terms and pecuniary interests are the same as those previously disclosed to
and approved by the Regents on July 16, 1987 (hereby incorporated by reference in this action request) with one exception: the University will receive 23
percent of future royalties instead of the standard 15 percent. This is consistent
with a previous reassignment agreement (UM file #503) with Dr. Ensminger
and two other employees/inventors, James Knoll and James Andrews. The
higher percentage for the University is in recognition of its significant licensing
efforts prior to reassignment.
Reassignment of the University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual
Property (William D. Ensminger, James C. Andrews, and James A.
Knol)
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved reassignment of the University's ownership interest in
the intellectual property of William D. Ensminger, James C. Andrews, and James
A   Knol, "Implantable Access Devices" (UM       File #503c4). Because Drs.
Ensminger, Andrews, and Knol are both parties to the agreement and University


118




October Meeting, 1992


employees, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the assignment agreement will be the University of Michigan and
William D. Ensminger, James C. Andrews, and James A Knol.
2.  The terms and pecuniary interests are the same as those previously disclosed to
and approved by the Regents on July 16, 1987 (hereby incorporated by reference in this action request) with one exception: the University will receive 23
percent of future royalties instead of the standard 15 percent. This is consistent
with a previous reassignment agreement (UM file #503) with Ensminger,
Knoll, and Andrews. The higher percentage for the University is in recognition
of its significant licensing efforts prior to reassignment.
Reassignment of the University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual
Property (Michael Sivak and Michael J. Flannagan)
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved reassignment of the University's ownership interest in
the intellectual property of Michael Sivak and Michael J. Flannagan, "Fast-Onset
Incandescent Signal Light" (UM File #137). Because Messrs. Sivak and Flannagan are both parties to the agreement and University employees, this agreement
falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the assignment agreement will be the University of Michigan and Michael Sivak and Michael J. Flannagan.
2.  The terms and pecuniary interests were previously disclosed to and approved by
the Regents on July 16, 1987, and are hereby incorporated by reference in this
action request.
Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities
Vice President Hartford described the process by which the Statement of
Student Rights and Responsibilities had been developed, noting that input had
been solicited from a wide variety of constituent groups on campus. She pointed
out that 89 percent of students completing a survey favored the concept of having
such a statement. Draft 12.2 contained many suggestions from students and reflected the concerns expressed by both the student rights commission of MSA
and the student ACLU group. That draft was published in the Michigan Daily
and the Michigan Review and was also discussed in a public forum on Monday,
October 12. On Wednesday morning, she met with students who had been involved in the earlier drafts. The statement was revised again, and that is the version being presented to the Regents.
Vice President Hartford pointed out that certain elements of the statement
are required by federal law. One area in which the University is currently not in
compliance with the law is in not having an on-campus policy and hearing process for sexual assault and rape. This is one reason for her desire to enact the
statement as soon as possible. Her suggestion is that the current Statement of
Student Rights and Responsibilities be put into place by the president as an


119




October Meeting, 1992


interim policy for a period of one year, using his powers under Regents' Bylaw
2.01. This would give the University a chance to assess how the policy works and
to further revise it if necessary. The policy would then be brought to the Regents
in the fall of 1993 with a request for adoption as a permanent policy.
Regent Baker read from a prepared statement in which he observed that the
University has had a strong history of resistance to attempts to limit speech and
conduct. He reviewed the history of previous attempts at codifying behavior, including Regents' Bylaw 7.02, the 1988 Policy on Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment which had been found unconstitutional, and the interim code
established in 1989 which was abandoned after the U.S. Supreme Court found
such codes to be unconstitutional.
Regent Baker stated that he strongly opposes any code of student conduct,
except those required by law. Some of the reasons for this are that the accused
does not have the right to representation by an attorney; some of the sanctioned
behavior, such as murder, arson, and forgery are already covered by city and
state law; and the fact that certain crimes, such as sexual harassment, rape, and
harassment apply wherever they occur, whereas crimes such as assault, battery,
and murder are covered only when they occur in Ann Arbor. The latter point
constitutes a double standard.
Other concerns are that the code incorporates the Faculty Senate's 1990
"Statement of Fundamental Tenets of Membership in the University Community" and then attempts to establish and define the values of the University and
standards and expectations for behavior, and lists penalties for noncompliance.
Regent Baker believes that this is problematic because it is nearly impossible to
define University values, and that most students arrive at the University with
strong moral or religious beliefs which affect their definition of values. It is difficult to reconcile the differences between the student's values and the University's values. Regent Baker pointed to the statement in the section on sanctions
that while "it is inappropriate for the University to try to change a student's convictions, it remains appropriate for the University to ask a student to change behavior," as illustrating where different sets of values come into conflict, and as an
Orwellian example of behavior modification.
He pointed out that the section on mediation does not include the various
student religious organizations as places which are available to provide counseling and support when students' values and morals conflict with those established
by the University. He also noted the seriousness of the policy's not allowing for
legal representation when a student is accused of a serious crime such as murder,
and he pointed out that some actions which are illegal under state law are not
specified in the policy; this is inconsistent with the duty of campus safety officers
and Regents to uphold state law.
Regarding the president's intention to implement the policy under the powers of Bylaw 2.01, Regent Baker's interpretation of the bylaw is that it places limits on the president's authority. His opinion is that the policy should be enacted
by the Regents, not by the president, with a specific time limit set for review.
Experience with the previous interim harassment policy, which was not enacted


120




October Meeting, 1992


by the Regents, proved unpleasant; he urged further review and discussion of the
statement by the Regents, and a student vote on the final draft, before the Regents vote whether or not to enact it. Regent Baker's final objection is that
implementation of the code would lead to an expanded University bureaucracy in
which many aspects of student life would be controlled and behavior modification
might become the norm, affecting not only students, but all members of the University community. He urged that action on the policy be delayed until the Regents have had an opportunity to receive input from all interested parties,
particularly students.
Regent Brown noted that the current intent is to implement the code, see
how it works for a year, and then to have the Regents consider a final document
for approval. He pointed out that there had been extensive student input at all
stages of development of the code. Because of statutory mandates that there be a
policy to deal with sexual assault and rape, there is no choice but to have a process in place.
Regarding due process, in the absence of a code setting out procedures to be
followed, the president is currently powerless to expel a student if that student
were to go to court and raise due process questions about the expulsion. Although valid objections have been raised, he thought there was no choice but to
put the code in place and then bring it back for eventual consideration.
Noting that the concept of a student code had been an issue for a number of
years, Regent Varner commended Vice President Hartford for developing the
code now before the Board. She stated that we need a code, and need some statement of rights and responsibilities. She expressed her support for enacting this
code on an interim basis, as it gives people a chance to work out any problems
with members of the University community prior to formal adoption by the Regents.
Regent Smith stated her belief that the current document goes far beyond
the requirements of the law. She had many questions about legal issues, the definition of "harassment", and stated her belief that this code is unconstitutional
and invites lawsuits. She believed that accused parties should be allowed to have
legal representation, and asked to have the dean of the Law School review the
policy to make certain that it is constitutional Regent Smith also stated that having only received the document the previous evening, she had not had sufficient
time to review it before the meeting. She expressed agreement with Regent
Baker that because it is a policy, it should be implemented by the Regents.
In response to a question from Regent Smith, Vice President Hartford read
the definition of harassment from the statement and gave examples of behavior
that could be considered harassment. Regent Smith expressed doubts that students would be able to understand everything that is expected of them by this
document. She asked what the University's rights are with respect to conduct
that occurs in a private home or apartment; Vice President Hartford explained
that just as the University has a right to control who is admitted, it has a right to
control who can stay if their behavior poses a danger to the community.


121




October Meeting, 1992


In response to Regents Smith's request that the document be reviewed for
legality, Vice President Hartford stated that it had been reviewed for legality by
counsel and had been sent to the dean of the Law School Regent Smith stated
that she would like the Law School dean's review to be in writing. Regent Brown
observed that it would be inappropriate to have the dean of the Law School act as
counsel to the Regents.
President Duderstadt pointed out that thousands of American colleges and
universities operate with similar policies. Vice President Hartford added that the
University's document provides more due process protections than the majority
of other such policies.
Regent Nielsen complimented Vice President Hartford for all of her efforts
in developing the policy and obtaining input. He stated that this issue would be
more appropriately discussed on the Ann Arbor campus than the Flint campus.
He also expressed concurrence with Regents Baker and Smith that the policy
should be adopted by the Regents, not implemented by the president, even on an
interim basis. Regent Nielsen also noted that he had not had adequate time to
review the document.
Regent Nielsen agreed with previous comments that the University does not
have jurisdiction over conduct that occurs off campus and stated that he would
not support any code that addresses such conduct. Regarding the issue of
counsel, he stated that he did not believe the University was obliged to provide
counsel but that students should not be prohibited from having legal counsel or
other type of representation. Regent Nielsen suggested that the document be
held over until the next meeting in Ann Arbor and then brought to a vote by the
Regents rather than be implemented by the president
Regent Power pointed out that there were two issues, one having to do with
the substance of the proposed interim code, and the other having to do with the
process by which the code is evaluated by the University and eventually implemented or not implemented by vote of the Regents. He agreed that there were a
number of questions about the code that needed to be resolved and suggested
that implementing it on an interim basis would allow for a real-life evaluation of
it and would serve as a means for perfecting it. The process question had to do
with whether the Regents should rescind the old Rules of the University Community and thereby set in motion a process for the president to implement an interim code for evaluation by the University community.
Regent McFee stated that although she recognized the urgency of enacting a
code, there had not been a mechanism for Regents to have any input. Among her
questions are 1) What is the objection to having legal counsel? 2) What are the
limits placed on actions by students that occur outside of Ann Arbor? Do the
actions relate only to those having some relationship to their status as a student
or do they concern any activity they might engage in while outside of Ann Arbor?
3) When bringing significant criminal charges for such crimes as murder and
arson, she wondered how, in terms of timing, the University's proceedings would
affect criminal proceedings that occur outside of the University.


122




October Meeting, 1992


President Duderstadt pointed out that he has suspended students deemed
to be a significant threat to the University community, usually after they have
been indicted for a serious crime. He has also taken action under Bylaw 2.01 in
cases where students have committed assault or destroyed property. The problem
is that with no code, there has been no due process in these situations. He stated
that he looked at establishment of the code as an evolutionary process, and it can
be modified as experience dictates.
Regents Brown and Varner noted that the questions raised by Regent
McFee have all been raised in previous discussions. Regent Varner asked how a
student's status at the University would be affected by the student being convicted of a crime. Regent Brown pointed out that it is impossible to anticipate every question that could arise under the code; some things will have to be
determined through experience. The assumption should be that reasonable people will use their best judgment, will administer the policy reasonably, and will
respond to problems on a case-by-case basis.
Vice President Hartford stated that all of the concerns regarding due process that had been expressed by the Regents had been addressed in formulating
the document and that the draft statement extends far beyond what case law has
determined is needed on a college campus. She pointed out that in recent years,
state and federal governments have been holding universities more accountable
for what they are doing on campus to deal with crime. The view is that campuses
themselves have a responsibility to deal with crime; it is not enough to resort to
existing laws. Regarding the issue of legal counsel, under this policy students
have the right to have legal counsel with them to advise them, which is consistent with other existing policies affecting faculty and staff. The faculty chair and
students on the hearing panel serve as questioners; not an attorney. She emphasized that it is ethically right for the University of Michigan to have a document
like this; we are behind the times not to have one. She believes that it is fair to
say that there are certain rules that students are expected to abide by; if they feel
they cannot, they can lose the privilege to attend the University.
Regent Baker moved that further consideration of this matter be delayed
until the next month. Regent Nielsen seconded the motion. Regent Brown
pointed out that no action on the part of the Regents was being requested; therefore the motion should be restated that the policy should not be put into effect
until the following month. The vote was taken, and the motion failed, with
Regents Baker, McFee, Nielsen, and Smith in favor and Regents Brown, Power,
Varner, and Waters opposed.
Regent Brown noted that if the policy were to be put into effect, it would be
in conflict with two other documents already in effect Therefore Regent Brown
moved that those two instruments (The Rules of the University Community and
the University Judicial System) be repealed, to be effective at such time as the interim code is put into effect.
Regent Nielsen stated that it would be inappropriate for the president to put
the Statement on Student Rights and Responsibilities into effect, given the discussion and vote that had just occurred. He asked the Board to reject Regent


123




October Meeting, 1992


Brown's motion at this time so that the entire issue could culminate next month
in      Arbor.
Following some discussion, at 6:35 P.M., it was decided to take a five minute
recess.
The meeting resumed at 6:50 P.M. President Duderstadt stated that a number of important issues had been raised, both by the Regents and by students
and that the effort to put a policy together is organic and evolutionary. He stated
that although he does have the authority under Regents' Bylaw 2.01 to enact the
policy on an interim basis, he did not intend to invoke that authority until such
time as some of the questions that had been raised had been addressed. He would
continue to interact with members of the Board and with student groups until
such time as the policy had been refined to the point where he could implement
it.
Regent Brown then withdrew his motion to repeal the Rules of the University Community and the University Judicial System. Regent Nielsen withdrew
his objections to the motion.
Revision of Regents' Bylaws Sections 5.01 and 5.23 (non-tenure-track
clinical appointment sequence for the School of Dentistry)

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1992


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, November 19, 1992
The Regents met at 10:15 AM. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, and Smith.
Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice Presidents
Cosovich, Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as was Chancellor
Klein. Regents Varner and Waters and Chancellor Jones were absent.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and welcomed Regentelect Rebecca McGowan, who would be sitting in on the November and December Regents' meetings. Regent-elect Laurence Deitch had intended to be present,
but had become ill that morning.
Proposed Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities
President Duderstadt announced that time had been set aside to continue
the discussion from the October meeting about the proposed Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities, and called on Vice President Hartford.
Vice President Hartford reviewed the process, begun in March of 1992, that
had been used in arriving at the present draft of the statement. She noted that
students had expressed concerns about infringement of free speech rights under
the Interim Policy on Discriminatory Conduct. Development of the proposed
statement escalated following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in R.E.V. v St.
Paul. That decision led to a belief on the part of the general counsel that the
interim policy would be held unconstitutional if challenged. In addition, the
Higher Education Amendments of 1992 required that there be an on-campus
prohibition of and hearing process for cases of sexual assault and rape.
Vice President Hartford said that she had met with a wide variety of campus constituencies in developing the policy, with a goal of addressing student
concerns about infringements of first amendment rights in the current policy,
and bringing the University into compliance with federal law and with common
practice at other universities. Last summer, copies of an earlier draft had been
sent to every currently registered student with a form soliciting comments. Of
the approximately 3,000 students who responded, most were in favor of having
some kind of statement of student rights and responsibilities.
Public hearings and focus groups had been conducted soliciting input on the
various drafts of the policy. The current draft incorporates suggestions from Regents as well as students. Vice President Hartford is recommending that the
Board rescind the 1973 Rules of the University Community, the 1979 University
Judicial System, and adopt the proposed Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities as an interim policy for one year. An assessment would then be


129




November Meeting, 1992


conducted, and early in 1994 recommendations would be made to the Regents regarding continuation of the policy.
Vice President Hartford quoted from an opinion from Supreme Court Justice Blackman on the rights of universities to adopt policies such as the one proposed.
Statement by Regent Baker. Regent Baker read from a prepared statement in which he argued that the University does not need the proposed code of
student conduct because it would limit free speech, sow distrust within the University, encourage politically correct conduct, and is unconstitutional. Most of the
areas addressed by the proposed Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities ("code"), he argued, are already covered under federal, state, and local law;
those that are not could be handled under a minimalist policy. A copy of Regent
Baker's statement is on file in the Office of the Secretary of the University.
Regent Baker described the strategy undertaken by the administration to
enact the code, including creating the appearance of need, relying on a limited
survey of student attitudes toward such a code, ignoring a student referendum
on the code, and placing advertisements in the Michigan Daily and distributing
handbills in the dormitories just prior to the election. He cited statistics showing
that only a very small fraction of students (one-tenth of one percent) is directly
exposed to serious campus crime.
Regent Baker stated his belief that the administration is seeking to expand
control of student life far beyond the matter of criminal activity, and that this
goal has not changed since 1988. He cited Professor Carl Cohen's letter published
in the October 28, 1992, issue of the University Record warning that the proposed code would silence expression, chill speech, and use improper means to justify the University's ends as it is cast as a suppresser when it is drawn into court
to protect the policy. Professor Cohen described a recent campus example of limiting free speech in which a student dropped a political science class after being
warned by a teaching assistant, with the knowledge of the professor, that the student's language used in a class paper was not acceptable. Further, the student
was warned that his statements would be carefully monitored, and told, "You are
forewarned".
Regent Baker pointed out that the University's original policy on discrimination and discriminatory conduct had been found unconstitutional in September 1989, and that shortly thereafter, a second "hate speech" policy (the "Interim
Policy") had been implemented by President Duderstadt. He cited a statement by
University of Minnesota law professor Suzanna Sherry that Michigan's 1988
code used "raw political power to enforce orthodoxy."
Regent Baker noted that in November 1991 he had argued against codes
that restrict free speech, and quoted from his remarks at that time, which had
called such codes "an insult to the United States Constitution and an anathema
to the idea of a University." He observed that a "hate speech" policy at the University of Wisconsin had been found unconstitutional, and that the University of
Michigan's interim  policy had been abandoned earlier this year after the


130




November Meeting, 1992


Supreme Court found a similar code in Minneapolis to be unconstitutional. He
reiterated his belief that although President Duderstadt and Vice President
Hartford do not agree with him, history and current experience prove that the
proposed code does restrict free speech.
Regent Baker reviewed complaints filed under existing policies since 1988,
noting that these totaled about 100 per year. According to his analysis, most of
the complaints had to do with an individual feeling injured by a remark, obscene
language written on a wall, or posters being torn down. There were also complaints in dormitories stemming from drinking, partying, and sexual harassment
in various forms, from minor to extremely serious. Complaints had also been
filed for rape and other criminal acts which had also been reported to the appropriate civil authorities.
Regent Baker stated that he had supported the establishment of a University police force because of his belief that it would be more responsive to dangerous
incidents involving students; he believes that the police force has led to reductions in crime. He also pointed out that the number of incidents cited under the
current policies indicates that only.0029 percent of the total student body has
been affected by reported crimes.
Regent Baker concluded that the case for adoption of the proposed Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities has not been proved; the code will
injure freedom of speech and will injure the overall integrity of the University; it
will be found unconstitutional by federal courts; and politically correct conduct
will be expected of students. He distributed the text of his prepared remarks, including an addendum listing 15 specific text changes to the proposed statement,
and suggested that the matter of the code be set aside until the December meeting for resolution.
Statement by Regent Smith. Noting that she had opposed the first
harassment policy in 1987, Regent Smith then read from a prepared statement
which described her views about the proposed Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities. A copy of Regent Smith's statement is on file in the Office of the
Secretary of the University. Regent Smith said that she is concerned for the safety of individuals and for civil liberties and believes that the University should
promote democracy. After carefully reviewing arguments on both sides of the issue and consulting with administrators, lawyers, and others, she has come to the
conclusion that the use of administrative trials to accomplish the document's
goals is the wrong approach.
Regent Smith observed that the two things she favored about the document
are the concept of a list of expected student conduct consistent with the law, and
its provision for the use of voluntary mediation as an alternative to bringing formal charges in a court of law.
Regent Smith enumerated a list of problems with the statement, including
that lawyers are not allowed to speak at hearings; protest isn't really excluded
from punishment; alleged violence in a protest is subjective; the accused should
not have to have the consent of others to a trial's being public; the code can be


131




November Meeting, 1992


interpreted to include restrictions on speech; a sworn affidavit can be brought
against the accused; and the judicial advisor can testify.
Regent Smith concluded that it would not be enough to amend these problems; she agreed with the students that the process is controlled and that the
code is unfair. As alternatives to addressing the problems addressed by the document, she said that the legal system provides means to deal with problems caused
by students who commit major crimes. In all other cases, she stated that she likes
the voluntary mediation provision in the proposed statement, and would like to
see that available. She would also be in favor of a narrow code for sex crimes, as
required by law.
Regent Smith noted that a number of students had expressed concerns
about administrators sending out a purportedly one-sided explanation of the
statement three days before a student vote, giving no time for rebuttal. She said
she was surprised that this had been done.
Regent Brown observed that Regent Baker's remarks stated general objections to a code, but these objections did not apply to the code in question. The
questions raised by Regent Smith seem to be clearly covered by this code, and
would be rebutted by a reading of it. He noted that the code defines students' basic rights and the University's expectations; it is not punitive, and it states the
conditions under which the code does not apply. He listed the areas to which the
code does not apply, noting that it does not apply to speech protected by the first
amendment.
Regent Brown read from the section of the code on "Student Responsibilities" (Section IV), which lists the specific personal actions that are prohibited on
University property or at official University functions, asking whether anyone
really believed that these actions (such as sexual assault and rape, harassment,
physical assault and battery, etc.) should not be prohibited. Regarding the area of
harassment, he said that thiis sdifficult to interpret and define and would be
handled by experience under the code.
Finally, Regent Brown pointed out that if the University did not have a legal framework for handling these sorts of violations, it could be found liable, and
its hands would be tied for not having a procedure to handle these obviously
grievous offenses. As for the concerns that had been expressed about the code's
limiting freedom of speech, he quoted from Section I of the code, "it does not apply to speech protected by the First Amendment." He noted that proper procedures had been followed in drawing up the code and that legal counsel had
advised that it does meet standards of due process. It was time to proceed with
establishing a framework in which students' rights and responsibilities can be
enforced.
Regent Nielsen made specific suggestions as to language that could be inserted so as to assuage concerns about freedom of speech. He then pointed to specific concerns with Sections 14(a) and 14(h) under Students' Responsibilities.
Vice President Hartford responded that she would be happy to review and
perhaps revise those sections. Regent Nielsen then addressed other specific


132




November Meeting, 1992


concerns he had about other sections of the statement, and Vice President Hartford responded with the reasoning behind the language to which he referred.
Regent McFee observed that she had extensive discussions with a wide variety of people about the code, many of whom had expressed the same concerns as
some of the other Regents, but she had decided to support it. She pointed out
that although there may not ever have been a student code, the University has
historically had numerous regulations governing student conduct, especially for
female students. Many of the problems addressed in the code have developed
since the advent of coed dormitories and changes in some of the other norms regarding student living situations, leading to a more constant interchange between male and female students as well as between students from diverse
cultural backgrounds.
The strength of the policy, according to Regent McFee, is that it offers a student judicial process, which gives students the opportunity to not only help develop what should be dealt with in the code, but to evaluate complaints brought
under the code and further refine the definition of what constitutes offensive behavior in our society. Regent McFee defined offensive behavior as being offensive
to the person experiencing it, not offensive to the person who is giving it.
Regent McFee commented that to her, education is not necessarily an attempt to change one's moral values, but it is an educational process to become
aware of the effect that an offensive act has on the receiving individual. Regent
McFee observed that the strength of the policy is the student judicial process, as
it provides an opportunity to define and evaluate offensive behavior, and to express concerns about behavior in a forum that is at a far lower level than what
takes place in a civil proceeding. This process also creates an opportunity to raise
matters that might eventually become severe enough to become cause for legislative action. She cited recently enacted legislation concerning stalking as an example.
Regent McFee concluded that the policy needs to be enacted to see how well
it will work and to discover what amendments might be necessary for it to be a
well-functioning policy.
Regent Power observed that a code of student behavior is not a criminal
code, and to criticize it for failing to meet the standards of a criminal code distorts the discussion. The purpose of the code is to set forth the expectations for
behavior for students in a university community and to facilitate an educational
process by which people of different backgrounds can learn to live together in a
university environment. Thus, the issues addressed by the code do not have to do
with determining guilt or innocence with defendants and prosecutors, as in
criminal law, but in setting forth expectations for student behavior and determining whether or not people have behaved in ways that are inappropriate in the
context of membership in a university community.
Regent Baker pointed out that no matter how good the intent, once a policy
is set in place, the mindset is created that certain behaviors are punishable that
were never meant to be so. His objection is with what the policy will become once


133




November Meeting, 1992


it is set in motion. Regent Baker then described the fifteen specific objections to
the policy that are included in his prepared statement Vice President Hartford
responded to some of the issues raised by Regent Baker.
Regent Smith reiterated her belief that unless there are no restrictions on
free speech, the University is likely to end up in court In response, Regent
Brown pointed out that the code states that as the law currently stands, it does
nothing to limit legally protected free speech. Regent Smith replied that she
agreed with Regent Baker, that the mere existence of the document would repress free speech on a campus with a long history of activism.
President Duderstadt noted that all other campuses with activist traditions,
including the University of California at Berkeley and Columbia University have
student behavioral codes similar to this one. Regent Smith pointed out that at
those two campuses, attorneys are allowed to speak for their clients at hearings
held under auspices of their codes. Regent Brown responded that the courts have
held that this is not required for student codes.
Regent Power noted that concerns had been raised about the process followed by Vice President Hartford in developing the code, whether it had been an
insincere, manipulative process designed to develop a political coloration, or a
sincere attempt to consult with students. If the code was indeed developed with
extensive student involvement, and the Regents then criticize the resulting draft
and change much of the language, it is being subjected to an impossible standard.
Regent Smith asked whether the Regents would vote on the code before the
outcome of the MSA referendum on it was known. President Duderstadt responded that this might be the case. He noted that it was to be an interim policy
that had a sunset, and it had been developed after much input from the community.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Nielsen then made the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(e) and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in
closed session at 3:00 P.M. on November 19, 1992, in the Regents' Room,
for the purpose of consulting with our attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection with specific pending litigation, and for
considering material exempt from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. Such exempt material consists of a
written opinion from the Boards' legal counsel.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was adopted unanimously.
The meeting recessed at 12:20 PM. for lunch.
The meeting reconvened at 1:25 PM. in the Regents' Room Present were
President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith,


134




November Meeting, 1992


and Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were
Chancellors Jones and Klein. Regent Varner was absent.
Chancellor, University of Michigan-Dearborn
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and announced that he
was recommending the appointment of James C. Renick as chancellor of the
University of Michigan-Dearborn. He expressed his deep appreciation to Interim
Chancellor Bernard Klein for providing leadership to the Dearborn campus and
counsel to the executive officers during the interim period.
President Duderstadt reviewed Professor Renick's credentials and then introduced Professor Charlotte Otto, who chaired the search committee that recommended his appointment. Professor Otto reviewed the search process and
noted that all of the people involved in the search were unanimous in their support of Professor Renick
Regent Brown moved approval of the appointment of James C. Renick as
chancellor of the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Regent Waters seconded the
motion. Regent Brown expressed his gratification with the search process. Chancellor Klein commented that he had never seen such unanimity and enthusiasm
in any search that had been conducted in his 22 years on campus. There being no
further discussion, the vote was taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Chancellor Selection Process
Regent Baker observed that the Regents had always participated in choosing senior officers of the University, but that was not the case in this instance because of the constraints imposed by the Open Meetings Act. Consequently, he
had no knowledge of Professor Renick. He stated that public oversight of the
University should entail the Regents being able to meet with individuals under
consideration for guiding the University in a setting that allows for thorough discussion of questions and issues that might be germane to the position. He believes the Open Meetings Act diminishes the powers of the Regents to the point
of making them inconsequential in the process of governance. Because serious
policy and personnel matters cannot be discussed in private, the process forces
the Regents to turn over such decisions to the administrative officers of the University. This does great injury to the process of governance; the Regents had no
part whatsoever in the selection of Professor Renick.
Regent Brown pointed out that because of pending litigation, it is difficult to
determine the status of the Open Meetings Act, and therefore the Regents could
not risk getting involved in this search in a meaningful way. He noted that this
problem also affects the governing boards of the state's other public institutions,
and that the legislature may revisit the question. He stated that the best situation would be one in which at least part of a search process can be done in a
non-public forum where tougher questions can be asked than would otherwise be
the case. He believes that injury could be done to the quality of these institutions


135




November Meeting, 1992


unless a process can be worked out which both protects the public's right to
know and the candidate's right to privacy.
Regent McFee noted that she had not had an opportunity to participate in
the search for a major University post until now, and she was disappointed in the
constraints placed on the Board in this process. She noted that in a private
search, the variety and quality of candidates is enhanced over those in which
there is public scrutiny of the candidates, because to entice people not seeking
new employment, confidentiality has to be ensured.
There being no further discussion, the president turned to the regular business agenda.

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved adoption of the following retirement memoirs:
Rose M. Rizki research scientist in the Department of Biology, retired
from active faculty status on June 30, 1992, following 30 years of service at the
University of Michigan.
Ms. Rizki received her B.A degree from Seton Hill College in 1948, and her
M.A degree from Columbia University in 1949. She held research and teaching
appointments at the American Museum of Natural History, Columbia University, and Reed College before coming to the University of Michigan as a research
associate in 1962. She was appointed assistant research scientist in 1974, associate research scientist in 1976, and research scientist in 1977.
Her research, much of it undertaken jointly with Tahir M. Rizki, has
embraced a wide variety of topics concerned with the genetics, development,


146




November Meeting, 1992


physiology, and molecular and cellular biology of the celebrated "fruit fly,"
Drosophila, and has been widely disseminated in 68 publications. Ms. Rizki's
contributions have also extended to graduate education; many Ph.D. dissertations and publications have acknowledged her assistance. It is no exaggeration to
say that the longevity and continuing importance of Drosophila as a pre-eminent
experimental system derives in no small measure from her scientific studies and
from comparable studies elsewhere. Over the years, her studies have been supported by the National Science Foundation.
Ms. Rizki's studies of Drosophila include a long series of studies (jointly
with T. M. Rizki) on special attributes of hemocytes (blood cells). She has also investigated the consequences in Drosophila of various chemical agents known to
affect nucleic acid synthesis and modify growth; these agents were early precursors of current chemotherapeutic agents directed against cancers. Indeed, several
of her studies have been published in the premier journal, Cancer Research. In
other joint work, she has studied the role of hemocytes in relation to tumor
growth and in biological defense mechanisms of Drosophila. During the past decade, Ms. Rizki has focused on the cell biology underlying defense reactions of
Drosophila to parasites and to virus-like agents that act through their effect on
the cytoskeleton.
In recognition of her many contributions to the Department of Biology and
the University community, the Regents now name Rose M. Rizki Research Scientist Emeritus.
Garry R. Walz, professor of education, will retire from active faculty status
on December 31, 1992, after 31 years of service at the University of Michigan.
Professor Walz received his B.A degree in 1949, his M.A degree in 1950,
and his Ph.D. degree in 1958, all from the University of Minnesota He served on
the faculties of North Dakota State University from 1958-60, and Illinois State
University from 1960-61. In 1961, he joined the faculty of the University of
Michigan as an assistant professor, he was promoted to associate professor in
1964 and professor in 1969. Professor Walz was named director of the ERIC
Clearinghouse on Counseling and Personnel Services in the School of Education
in 1966.
In the School of Education, Professor Walz taught courses in guidance and
counseling, research design methods, and human resource development; he also
worked extensively with graduate students on their doctoral research. Since
1966, his work has centered on the ERIC Clearinghouse on Counseling and Personnel Services, funded by the U.S. Department of Education. In directing this
large project, he served as editor-in-chief of the publication program, represented
the clearinghouse at conferences and conventions around the world, and assisted
faculty and students in the School of Education in using the ERIC system to improve their research.
During his career, Professor Walz was very active in professional organizations: he served as trustee and chair-elect of the American Foundation for
Counseling and Development from 1989-92; chair of the OERI Task Force on
ERIC and the Future from 1988-89; president of the American Personnel and
Guidance Association from 1971-72; and president of the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision from 1966-67. Professor Walz also published


147




November Meeting, 1992


extensively in such publications as the Journal of Career Planning and Employment, the Journal of Counseling and Development and the Personnel and Guidance Journal. He received the Distinguished Scholar Award from Chi Sigma Iota
in 1988 and the Kathleen and Gilbert Wrenn Humanitarian Award from the
American Association for Counseling and Development in 1984.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator by naming Garry R.
Walz Professor Emeritus of Education.
Memorial Statements
Provost Whitaker reported the death of Professor Shien-Ming ("Sam") Wu.
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents voted
unanimously to adopt the following memorial statement:
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness the death on October 28, 1992, of Shien-Ming Wu, the J. Reid and Polly
Anderson Professor of Manufacturing Technology. Professor Wu was a faculty
member of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics
and director of the National Science Foundation's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Mechanical and Optical Coordinate Measuring Machines
at the University of Michigan. He was also a fellow of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, and a member of Academia Sinica
Born in Chekiang, China, on October 28, 1924, Professor Wu received his
B.S. degree from Chiao-Tung University in Shanghai in 1945, his M.B.A degree
from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1956, and his B.S.
and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin
in 1958 and 1962, respectively. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1987 after serving 30 years on the faculty of the University of Wisconsin
in Madison.
During his career, Professor Wu supervised 113 doctoral students in manufacturing engineering, many from China Almost one-quarter of the current active U.S. faculty in manufacturing engineering worked under him or one of his
students. In December 1991, Professor Wu received the Chiang Technology
Achievement Award from the Chiang Industrial Charity Foundation in Hong
Kong, which carried a $100,000 cash award that he donated to the University of
Michigan College of Engineering. In October 1992, he received the University of
Michigan Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award.
Professor Wu was the first to introduce advanced statistical techniques to
manufacturing research and application. His methodology, which uses a mathematical description of complex manufacturing processes and on-line system data
to provide diagnostics and quality control, is used by the manufacturing industry
worldwide, particularly by U.S. automotive manufacturers. Professor Wu has
been an inspiration for several generations of manufacturing engineers with his
gentle but firm guidance of many young minds.
As we mourn the loss of this great scholar and teacher, our condolences go
to his wife, Daisy Te-Hsien Tsui Wu, and his daughter and son-in-law, Elaine
and John Stephenson.

November Meeting, 1992


Degrees
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
took the following actions with respect to degrees:
They approved final degree lists for the May and August, 1992 commencements, changes to previously approved degree lists, and recommendations for
doctoral degrees for the December 1992 commencement.
Henry Russel Lecturer
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Smith, the Regents
unanimously approved the appointment of John H. Holland, professor of electrical engineering and computer science in the College of Engineering, and professor of psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, as the Henry
Russel Lecturer for 1993.
University of Michigan 1992 Financial Report Supplemental Schedules
for the Year Ended June 30, 1992
The Regents received the University of Michigan 1992 Financial Report
Supplemental Schedules for the Year Ended June 30, 1992.
Six Month Report on University Audits
The Regents received the Six Month Report on University Audits for the period April 1 through September 30, 1992. Mr. Carl Smith, Director of University
Audits, pointed out that among the audits conducted were complete reviews of
President Duderstadt's and Vice President Womack's travel expenses and
charges on the president's corporate Visa card for Inglis House and President's
House expenses. He noted also that audits are also regularly conducted of the
travel expenses of all other senior officers of the University. Regent Power noted
for the record that these procedures ensure that public funds are being properly
spent by senior leaders of the University.
International Bond Investments
Vice President Womack stated that the Regents were being asked for the authority to invest University Investment Pool funds in the Common Fund's Global Bond Fund. The purpose of this investment is to diversify the University's
investments and reduce risk.
Following some discussion, Regent Power moved that the University Investment Pool guidelines for fixed income investments be amended as follows:
The following types of fixed income investments are eligible for
purchase by any fund:
* The Common Fund Short Term Fund, Intermediate Cash
Fund, and Global Bond Fund.
Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.


149




November Meeting, 1992


Reorganization Investment
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of $5 million of the University Endowment
Fund to Restart Partners IV, L.P., pending the general counsel's review of the
partnership agreement
Venture Capital Investment
Regent Nielsen moved that $4 million of the University Endowment Fund
be committed to Advent VII, L.P. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
Industrial Technology Institute (ITI)
Vice President Womack stated that this request is being made to help the
Industrial Technology Institute with some working capital needs. He reviewed
ITI's relationship with the University and noted that the request is being made
due to a provision in the Institute's lease of its building that it cannot mortgage
its interest in the lease, the leased premises, or its building without the University's prior written approval (see action request).
Following some discussion, Regent Baker moved that the vice president and
chief financial officer be authorized to approve in writing the institute's request
to obtain financing for its operations using, to the extent requested, its interest
in the facility and the leasehold as collateral, provided the terms and amount of
the financing are satisfactory to the University and they permit all of the material terms and provisions of the lease dated March 1, 1985, to remain intact. Regent Waters seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Stadium Boulevard Easement
This is a request for the University to grant to G.T. Products an easement
for ingress and egress from the public roadway connecting Boulevard Drive and
Stadium Boulevard to the southwest corner of the property at 401 E. Stadium.
Regent Nielsen observed that by granting the easement, the University
would be enhancing the value of the property. He suggested that the easement
grant be tied to an option for a sum certain or some other formula process by
which the University can acquire the property, which would be more favorable
than the University's existing right of first refusal Vice President Womack
pointed out that it is in the University's interest to be cooperative in granting the
easement, since the company can obtain it in any case. Regent Smith suggested
granting a conditional easement to G.T. Products that would not be turned over
to the next owner, unless that owner is the University.
Regent Nielsen proposed that the University get some kind of option price
or a better option formula price for the acquisition as opposed to just matching
whatever offer there is. Further discussion followed about other options for
granting the easement. Regent Nielsen moved to approve the grant of the
easement, conditioned upon Vice President Womack's obtaining an option to


150




November Meeting, 1992


purchase the principal for a sum certain by a time certain. Regent McFee
seconded the motion. The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved,
with Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Smith, and Waters in favor and Regent Power opposed. Regent Power stated that his opposition was based on the
motion's being micromanagement.
Engineering Center in the College of Engineering
Vice President Womack called on Mr. Fred Mayer, university planner, to describe this project, to be located among the College of Engineering facilities on
North Campus. Mr. Mayer gave a presentation illustrating the site and the programmatic elements of the proposed building. Following the presentation, Regent Smith moved approval of the project and site as described, and
authorization for the appointment of Moore-Anderson of Austin, Texas, and
Hobbs and Black of Ann Arbor as architects for the project. Regent Waters seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Undergraduate Library Addition and Renovations
Mr. Mayer gave a presentation describing plans for an addition and building
renovations for the Undergraduate Library. Following the presentation, Regent
Brown moved the following. approval of the design of the addition and proceeding with the addition and building renovations as funding is identified, and authorization for soliciting bids and awarding a construction contract to the
successful bidder, providing the contract values are within the approved budget.
Regent Waters seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Central Power Plant and North Campus Electrical Expansions
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved central power plant electrical expansion and North Campus electrical expansion, as described in the Regents Communication.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects: 1) Kelsey Museum
renovations; 2) Cooling tower replacements in several campus buildings; 3) Parking Services 1993 annual maintenance program; and 4) University of Michigan
Hospitals Mott elevator controller upgrade.
Proposed Subcontract between the University of Michigan and Columbia University
Regent Nielsen moved, Regent Power seconded, and all seven Regents present unanimously approved a research subcontract between the University of
Michigan and Columbia University, to be conducted as part of a grant to the University of Michigan for the project "M.D./Family Partnership: Education in
Asthma Management." Because the principal investigator of the project, Noreen
M. Clark, is both a faculty member at the University of Michigan and an adjunct
faculty member at Columbia University, this arrangement falls under the state of


151




November Meeting, 1992


Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the subcontract will be Columbia University and the Regents of the
University of Michigan.
2.  The subcontract will obligate Columbia University to complete a portion of the
research project. The initial subcontract will cover work through August 31,
1993, and be in the amount of $139,772. It is expected that the agreement will
be continued for an additional four years, at comparable funding levels, subject
to continued funding from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The
specific scope of work and detailed budget will be set forth in the subcontract.
3.  Professor Clark does not and will not receive a salary or other pecuniary benefit
from Columbia University during the life of the project.
Wolverine Tower
Vice President Womack reviewed this request for authorization to purchase
and renovate the Wolverine Tower, located on the southeast corner of State
Street and Eisenhower Parkway. The building would reduce rental costs, and
would provide space for units being displaced during renovation projects, and for
other offices, with the ultimate goal of Wolverine Tower's becoming the administrative services center for the University. (Regent Varner arrived at the meeting
at this point, at 2:50 p.m.)
Vice President Womack noted that this is an opportunity to acquire a substantial amount of square footage at a favorable price, which amounts to about
$70 per square foot, including purchase price and renovation cost, compared to
$135-$150 per square foot to construct a comparable facility. Regent Brown
pointed out that the $70 price includes land, while the $135-$150 does not.
Regent Baker stated that he was not enthusiastic about this acquisition because it is an old building with an outdated elevator and other systems, a poor
layout, and an exterior skin of corten steel that is worn and will need to be replaced. He noted that substantial investments will have to be made to meet the
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Regent Baker suggested
that the University could construct a building to its own specifications on land it
already owns, for a figure comparable to the $70 per square foot cost of the Wolverine Tower.
Regent Baker said that he agrees that the University needs an office building, but it would be better served by one specifically designed to accommodate its
needs. He suggested as another alternative the 777 office building across the
street from the Wolverine Tower, which is currently in foreclosure.
In response to a question by Regent Smith about whether there were plans
to make the building more attractive, Mr. Paul Spradlin, director of plant
extension, stated that the corten steel, which gives the building a poor
appearance, will be cleaned at a price of $65,000. He said that this should improve the appearance for 15-20 years.
Regent Smith noted her understanding that land purchased on State Street
was to be used for expansion opportunities, and that this building is very


152




November Meeting, 1992


isolated, with no continuity with the rest of the University. She asked what the
opinion of Johnson, Johnson & Roy/inc. was about this acquisition.
Vice President Womack read the text of a letter from JJR, dated November
4, 1992, regarding the proposed purchase of the Wolverine Tower. The letter concluded with a statement that it supports the proposal to acquire the property,
with the expectation that it will be used to consolidate administrative and support functions.
In response to a question from Regent Nielsen, Vice President Womack
stated that the property was assessed at $5 million, which yields $316,000 per
year in taxes. He noted that since 1957, the University had acquired property
with a total state equalized value (SEV) of $7.9 million, while it had sold, and
thus returned to the tax rolls, property with an SEV totaling $51.7 million during that time.
In response to questions about the amount of space the University is renting in Ann Arbor, Vice President Womack stated that the University does not intend to ever stop renting property; however, it does seek to take advantage of
opportunities to reduce costs by not expanding rental space.
Regent Smith asked the total amount of rental income that will accrue from
Wolverine Tower. Vice President Womack commented that the intent is to eliminate tenants so the University can use the entire building.
Regent Baker stated that the University had an obligation to look at the
property on State Street as a place to build an office building specifically designed
for its own uses, and to investigate purchase of the building across the street. For
these reasons, he cannot support the recommendation.
Regent Brown pointed out that the Wolverine Tower had been designed to
be used as an office building and that was what the University was planning to
use it for.
There being no further discussion, Regent Power moved approval of the acquisition of the Wolverine Tower at a price of $9.0 million, and authorization of
renovations for $6.5 million, for a total project cost of $15.5 million, with funding
provided as described in the Regents Communication. Regent Nielsen seconded
the motion, and it was approved, with Regents Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power,
Varner, and Waters in favor and Regents Baker and Smith opposed.
Capital Outlay Request, 1993-94, All Campuses
Vice President Womack reported that the state has indicated its intention to
sell bonds to support a Higher Education Capital Outlay Bill for Fiscal Year
1994. The Integrated Technology Instruction Center (ITIC) will be one of the
two major projects to be funded in this way. For the other, the University intends
to combine four long-standing building renewal requests (West Engineering
Building, C.C. Little Building, Angell Hall, and Frieze Building) into a single,
multi-year, Central Campus Renovation Project with an estimated cost of
$58,500,000.


153




November Meeting, 1992


Following some discussion, the Regents approved the 1993-94 Capital Outlay Request, with Regent Baker abstaining.
Major Capital Projects Student Fee Bonds
Vice President Womack commented that this is a request for authority to
adopt a resolution to secure financing in the amount of $78,463,000, with a bond
issue size of approximately $81 million, to finance the following projects: the
Francis Willson Thompson Library and Central Energy Plant Utility Distribution Expansion on the Flint campus, and on the Ann Arbor campus, the East
Engineering renovation, Randall Laboratory addition, Undergraduate Library
expansion, administrative office support (authorized in May), Undergraduate Library renovation, and utility projects.
Regent Nielsen moved that the Regents adopt a resolution that authorizes
the vice president and chief financial officer to: 1) develop the terms and legal
documentation for the bonds, and to prepare, circulate, and execute preliminary
and final official statements describing the bonds, the University and its affairs;
2) apply for and obtain from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's
Corporation their ratings on the bonds; and 3) publish a notice of sale, receive
bids, award the bonds to the winning bidder, execute an order establishing the
terms of bonds, and execute an order establishing the terms of bonds, and execute and deliver bonds. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Regent Smith stated that she would not support the motion because it included funding for the Wolverine Tower. Following some discussion about the
calculations of student fees used to compute debt service coverage, the vote was
taken, and the motion carried, with Regents Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power,
Vamer, and Waters in favor and Regents Baker and Smith opposed. The text of
the resolution can be found in Appendix A (page 161).
Revisions to Bylaws of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive
Board and Amendments to Regents' Bylaw Sections 11.151, 11.151A,
11.151B Concerning the UM Hospitals Executive Board and Public Advisory Board
The Regents were informed about amendments being made to the bylaws of
the UM Hospitals Executive Board to comply with the Joint Commission on the
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations standards. There are several revisions
necessary to the Regents' Bylaws as a result of these revisions. On a motion by
Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents unanimously approved
the following changes to Regents' Bylaws, pending completion of the University's
bylaws revision procedure: deletion of section 11.151B (Public Advisory Board),
deletion of the phrase in section 11.151A which provides that the Executive
Board "shall review and approve fees charged under the Medical Service Plan,"
and addition of the president as a member of the executive board in Section
11.151. The revised bylaws, to take effect following completion of the formal procedure for bylaws revision, will read as follows:

November Meeting, 1992


Establishment of Master of Science in Technical Information Design
and Management Degree
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved establishment of a new degree entitled "Master of Science
in Technical Information Design and Management," to be granted upon the recommendation of the faculty in the Technical Communication Program in the
College of Engineering.
Medical Staff Appointments
On the recommendation of the UM Hospitals Executive Board, Regent Baker moved, Regent Smith seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, several appointments to medical staff membership.
There followed a five-minute break at 3:00 P.M., after which the Regents
met in executive session. The public meeting reconvened at 4:05 P.M. in the Anderson Room of the Michigan Union to hear public comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: David Schwartz, Robert Van Houweling, Brian Kight, and Amy Ellis,
students, on the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities; Jean King
and Jonathan Rose, citizens, on the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities; Eve M. Brosco, former staff, on the reduction in force policy; James A.
Shields, citizen, on MSA/student rights/my constituency; Laura Martin, member
of Citizens for Safe Waste Disposal, on the North Campus radioactive waste incinerator, and Adam DeVore, student, on implicit education and the road to serfdom.
Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities
The meeting reconvened in the Regents' Room at 5:05 P.M. Vice President
Hartford distributed an amended version of the statement, reflecting comments
made at the Regents' Meeting earlier that day.
President Duderstadt stated that the officers were recommending rescinding the March 1973 Rules of the University Community and the October 1979
University Judicial System, and replacing these, effective January 1, 1993, with
the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities as an interim policy. The
interim policy would come back to the Regents for re-evaluation at the February
1994 meeting, leaving a period of one year for the interim policy to be in place.
Regent McFee moved approval of the recommendation as stated by President Duderstadt. Regent Power seconded the motion. Regent McFee requested
that the Regents receive an evaluation at least quarterly during the one-year interim period, which would apprise the Regents of any changes proposed as the
policy is being implemented.
Regent Baker moved to amend the motion to include the fifteen suggested
changes set forth in his prepared remarks:

University the right to censor the words used in student newspapers such as the
Michigan Daily or the Michigan Review if the writer is considered to be writing
beyond "...the scope of their journalistic responsibilities...". Rewrite the
paragraph to allow true freedom of the press.
7.   Section III, Students' Rights and the University's Responsibilities, page 2, para
2, line 7, add the sentence, "It is not the University's purpose to change the
behavior or denigrate the ethics, mores, values and religious beliefs of its
students." after the words "...right to others...".

evidence and transcript of the testimony" after the words "...due process
protections...".

"pedophilia, sadomasochism, incest, and gross indecency" after the words

delete entire Item B.
12. Procedures for responding to violation of these standards, page 5, item I,
Purposes of the Procedures, para 1, line 1. This is vague and does not define
"standards"; there is no penalty for false accusation."
13. IV. Mediation, page 6, para 2, line 8. Add the words "Religious Advisors" after
the phrase "...schools and colleges...".

15. Add to the document the following: "The request of any student for a change of
roommate will not be a cause of action under this code."
Regent Smith seconded the motion. Regent Brown suggested that counsel
review Regent Baker's recommendations, along with other recommendations.
The vote was taken on Regent Baker's amendment, and it failed, with Regents


157




November Meeting, 1992


Baker and Smith in favor and Regents Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Varner,
and Waters opposed.
Discussion then turned to Regent McFee's original motion. President Duderstadt encouraged the Board to continue to work with the administration to improve the policy during the interim period. In addition to having counsel review
Regent Bakers amendments, Regent Brown suggested an amendment that if the
complainant is an attorney, the respondent should also be able to have an attorney.
In response to some of the public comments, Regent Brown pointed out that
the reason there has to be a code is that the courts have said a procedure is necessary in order to take disciplinary action. Regent Power pointed out that speakers
had fallaciously equated the creation of a code with a set of sanctions appropriate
to criminal activities. The code had then been attacked on the basis that it was
different from criminal law and was defective because it did not have the same
protection that criminal law allows for crimes. Regent Power asserted that the
purpose of the code is to set out what kind of conduct is appropriate for student
members of the University community, to establish fair procedures through
which sanctions can be established to encourage compliance with those standards, and to set in motion a course of education and understanding of why those
standards are appropriate in the University community. To him, the central issue is freedom of speech, because it is the central point that characterizes a university community. As the policy is implemented, he will be attentive to whether
freedom of speech is in any way chilled or hampered.
Regent Smith asked about the right of a student who has been suspended
under the policy to be reinstated if found innocent of the infraction in a court of
law. Vice President Hartford responded that reinstatement would not be automatic; the student would have to appeal the suspension decision. Regent Smith
also observed that 81 percent of voters in the recent MSA referendum were opposed to institution of a code. She said the Regents should listen to student opinion and should be enfranchising students, rather than disenfranchising them.
President Duderstadt pointed out that there had been extensive interaction
with students on this issue over the past year, and student opinion had been
carefully listened to. Regent Smith said that we would be doing the students an
injustice by instituting the code. Vice President Hartford noted that students
who are victims of violence and in support of the code need to be listened to as
well.
Regent Nielsen observed that the policy will be an evolving one. He
commented on the issue of suspension/expulsion raised by Regent Smith and
suggested that a provision be considered that provides for legal counsel during
that process. Further discussion followed on this issue in which Vice President
Hartford cautioned against this being turned into a court of law rather than an
administrative academic hearing. She pointed out that the fact that a student
hearing board will be conducting such hearings indicates the trust being placed
in students. Regent Nielsen pointed out the devastating effect suspension or
expulsion would have on students' academic careers. Vice President Hartford


158




November Meeting, 1992


responded that this policy is fair and hearing procedures are consistent with
those in place at other universities and with existing faculty and staff policies.
Regent Baker noted that he had read all of the decisions made under previous policies for the past four years; the bulk of the issues decided upon were not
serious. Regent Baker reiterated that even though it may not be the intent, the
result of the code will be to change behavior, making people adhere to politically
correct conduct, and to enforce whatever current orthodoxy is in effect at any given time. He concluded that a code could have been promulgated in a very minimalist way, rather than through a lengthy document that will end up being
tested in court.
There being no further discussion, the vote was taken on Regent McFee's
motion to rescind the Rules of the University Community and the University Judicial System and to adopt the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities
as an interim policy effective January 1, 1993, with the policy coming back for reevaluation by the Regents in February 1994. The vote was taken and the motion
carried, with Regents Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor and Regents Baker and Smith opposed.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting will be held on December 17 and 18, 1992. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and other expenses for the month of October 1992 totalled $1,327.96.

Michigan, 1972, as amended ("Act 354"), if any bond shall become mutilated, the Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer or the Associate Vice President for Finance of the University, at the
expense of the holder of the Bond, shall without further action being required by the Regents of
the University of Michigan, execute or cause to be executed in the manner specified above, and
the Transfer Agent shall authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like tenor in exchange and substitution for the mutilated bond, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the mutilated Bond
and receipt by the Transfer Agent and the Issuer of indemnity satisfactory to them. Subject to
and in accordance with Act 354, if any Bond issued under this Resolution shall be lost, destroyed
or stolen, evidence of the loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the Transfer Agent and, if

the Issuer, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Bonds and the obligations created
hereunder are secured by and payable only from Student Fees and moneys in the Bond Fund,
and that no other liability whatsoever shall attach to or be incurred by the State of Michigan, the

DECEMBER MEETING, 1992


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, December 17, 1992
The Regents met at 1:15 PM. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, and Smith. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice Presidents Cosovich, Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones
and Klein. Regent Varner arrived shortly after the start of the meeting, Regent
Waters was absent.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and welcomed Regentselect Rebecca McGowan and Laurence Deitch, who were present to observe the
meeting.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Nielsen read the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed session at
3:00 P.M. on December 17, 1992, in the Regents' Room, for the purpose
of consulting with our attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in
connection with specific pending litigation.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Report of Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA)
President Duderstadt invited Professors Ejner Jensen, chair of SACUA, and
John Tropman, chair of CESF, to the table to give their reports.
Professor Jensen reported on the range of activities undertaken by SACUA,
including both completed and ongoing projects. Among the completed projects
are the creation of a Legal Advisory Council; enlargement of the pool of persons
eligible for election to SACUA; establishment of an annual academic freedom lecture; and adoption of the recommendations of the Task Force on the Evaluation
of Administrators. Projects in progress include revisions of grievance policies to
make them uniform across the University; creation of unit "ombuds"; a study of
clinical and nontenure-track faculty appointments; a task force on retirement;
and consideration of a discriminatory harassment policy.
Ongoing committee activities in the Senate Assembly include the Student
Affairs Committee, the Rules Committee, the University Relations Committee,
the Committee for a Multicultural University, the Academic Affairs Committee,
the Civil Liberties Board, and the Research Policies Committee.


181




December Meeting, 1992


Professor Jensen pointed out the connection between the practical issues
noted above to values and principles, and to the various missions of the
University. Noting that this would be the last Regents' Meeting for Regents
Nielsen and Smith, he thanked them and the other Regents for participating in a
continuing dialogue with SACUA
Regent Baker commented that he has some reservations about the notion of
evaluation of administrators. Regarding the proposed discriminatory harassment
policy, Regent Baker observed that often such codes tend to grow out of proportion to their original intent once they are executed, and if they inhibit free expression of ideas, they could do permanent injmy to the idea of a university.
Professor Jensen responded that faculty share Regent Baker's concerns, and that
a policy is needed at the University so that there will be a mechanism for handling incidents that raise questions of possible inhibition of freedom of expression.
Following further discussion, Professor Jensen introduced Professor John
Tropman to present the report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the
Faculty (CESF). Professor Tropman proposed a review of the whole issue of compensation, leading, perhaps, to adoption of a strategic pay system that might better achieve the goals of both the faculty and the University better. Such a review
would include exploring new compensation approaches, such as flexible benefits,
bonus plans, gainsharing, faculty draw accounts, and other possibilities.
There followed some discussion about how to broaden this idea to include
all segments of the University, not just faculty. Regent Power said that such a
discussion needs to occur in the context of developing a more explicit formulation
of the University's strategic goals and mission. He also noted the importance of
building the notion of community in the context of a complex university.
Regarding the fact that the faculty was developing a harassment code to cover faculty, Regent Smith observed that she thought the student code should have
been developed in a similar fashion, by the students.
Regent McFee stressed the importance of communication as a means of
solving problems. Further discussion ensued in response to issues that had been
raised by the SACUA and CESF reports. At the conclusion, Regent Brown expressed the Regents' appreciation for the work done by SACUA and CESF, and
invited them to continue communicating with the Board as a whole and with individual Regents as necessary.
Annual Report on Research
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Kelly to present the Annual
Report on Research. Vice President Kelly reported that in fiscal year 1992, total
research expenditures had increased by 6.9 percent, reaching a record total of
$346.5 million. Despite the fact that the indirect cost reimbursement rate decreased, indirect cost recovery increased as a result of total direct cost expenditures.

December Meeting, 1992


According to a study by the National Science Foundation, the University
ranks first in the volume of total research expenditures among all public institutions, and second among all colleges and universities, public and private. Vice
President Kelly displayed charts describing various other comparative measures
of the University's research volume, noting that if the National Science Foundation didn't count the Applied Physics Laboratory at The Johns Hopkins University as a research expenditure, it would drop to number nine in the rankings, and
the University of Michigan would rank number one.
Vice President Kelly explained that one possible rason for the University's
large research volume is its competitive proposal success rate, which in 1991 exceeded national averages in six of seven categories.
Vice President Kelly reviewed trends in research expenditures by source, by
sponsor group, and by University unit. He then turned to a discussion of
technology transfer activities, using the example of the National Center for Ultrafast Optical Science, headed by Professor Gerard Mourou. He also made note
of the "culture transfer" that takes place in the humanities and performing arts
fields.
In the discussion that followed, Vice President Kelly and President Duderstadt responded to comments from the Regents about how to facilitate and enhance the transfer of University-developed intellectual properties to the private
sector. In response to a comment from Regent Brown, Vice President Kelly
pointed out that the University receives seven dollars for every dollar in discretionary funds it spends to support research.
Minutes
Consideration of the minutes of the November 1992 meeting was deferred
until the next meeting.
Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports on Investment Transactions,
Plant Extension, and Litigation. Vice President Kelly submitted reports on Projects Established-Research and Other Activities and Summaries of a Selection of
Current Research and Sponsored Projects. On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Varer, the Regents voted unanimously to receive the reports.

November 1992. The Regents received the following gifts, with thanks, and in

Retirement Memoirs

unanimously approved adoption of the following retirement memoirs.
Frederick W. Bertolaet, professor of education, will retire from active
faculty status on December 31, 1992, after 26 years of service to the University of
Michigan.
Professor Bertolaet received his B.Ed. degree from Wisconsin State University in 1951 and his M.S. and PLhD. degrees from the University of Wisconsin in
1958 and 1964, respectively. From 1953-60, he worked as a teacher or principal
in various Wisconsin schools, and from 1962-66, he served as executive secretary
of the Research Council of the Great Cities Program for School Improvement in
Chicago. Professor Bertolaet joined the faculty of the University of Michigan
School of Education as an assistant professor in 1966; he was promoted to
associate professor in 1968 and to fill professor in 1970. He served as assistant


192




December Meeting, 1992


dean of the School of Education from 1972-73 and as associate dean from
1973-79.
At the School of Education, Professor Bertolaet taught courses in educational administration and supervision and worked extensively with graduate students on their doctoral research. He served as director of the Detroit High School
Study from 1966-68; chaired the Program in Educational Administration and Supervision from 1970-72; served as project director of the EPDA Administrative
Training Program with the Detroit Public Schools from 1971-74; and co-directed
the National Program for the Study of Collective Negotiations in Education from
1972-78. Professor Bertolaet also served on the University of Michigan-Detroit
Public Schools Liaison Committee, GEO bargaining teams, the Senate Assembly,
and the University of Michigan Library Council.
During his career, Professor Bertolaet was very active in professional organizations, including the American Association of School Administrators, the
American Educational Research Association, the Association for Supervision and
Curriculum Development, and the NEA Task Force on Urban Education. His
scholarly work appeared in such publications as the Review of Educational Research, Encyclopedia of Educational Research, and the 66th Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Frederick W. Bertolaet Professor Emeritus of Education.
Francis D. Bundra, professor of music (viola), retired from active faculty
status on October 31, 1992.
Professor Bundra was born in Northampton, Pennsylvania, and received
his early education there. He enrolled at West Chester State College in 1945, but
his studies were interrupted by service in the U.S. Army from 1945-47. He then
re-enrolled at West Chester State College and graduated with his B.S. degree in
public school music teaching in 1950. He taught in the public schools in Camden,
New Jersey, from 1950-52, gave private lessons in Philadelphia from 1952-53,
and resumed viola studies at the New School of Music in Philadelphia during
1953-54.
From 1954-63, Professor Bundra taught in the public schools in Rochester,
New York, while simultaneously completing his M.Mus. degree and Performer's
Certificate at the Eastman School of Music (1957) and performing as violist in
the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra. He taught violin and chamber music at
the Interlochen Arts Academy and its summer National Music Camp from
1963-65. Professor Bundra came to the University of Michigan as a visiting lecturer in 1965. He was appointed assistant professor in 1966, and was promoted
to associate professor in 1968, and professor in 1970.
Professor Bundra offered skilled and dedicated teaching in the School of
Music, and made substantial contributions.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Francis D. Bundra
Professor Emeritus of Music.
Stanley M. Garn, professor of anthropology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, professor of nutrition in the School of Public Health, and


193




December Meeting, 1992


fellow in the Center for Human Growth and Development, will retire from active
faculty status on December 31, 1992.
Professor Garn received his AB., AM. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard
University in 1942, 1947, and 1948, respectively. He taught anthropology at Harvard from 1948-52, and then went to Yellow Springs, Ohio, where he served as
chair of growth and development at the Fels Research Institute and professor of
anthropology at Antioch College. Professor Garn came to the University of
Michigan in 1968 as a fellow in the Center for Human Growth and Development
and professor of health development (later nutrition) in the School of Public
Health. He was named professor of anthropology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts in 1973.
A scholar with catholic and encompassing interests, Professor Garn was
ideally suited to work in a center designed for interdisciplinary study. The author
of approximately 900 publications, he is an internationally recognized authority
in many areas of human development, and has made many important contributions to the study of growth of low-birth-weight infants, the relation of genetics
to tooth development, nutrition in human growth and development, and osteoporosis and aging. One way to describe the breadth and scope of his interest is to
note that when he was offered the position as fellow at the Center for Human
Growth and Development, six different departments in four schools and colleges
at the University were prepared to give him a tenured professorship. Throughout
all of his wide-ranging research studies, several themes persist: the interactions
of nutrition and genetics during growth and aging, racial and gender differences
in growth and morphology, and evolutionary dynamics. His research and academic leadership have made him one of the most respected physical anthropologists in the world today.
Professor Garn's prestigious honors and awards include membership in the
National Academy of Science, fellowship in the American Academy of Pediatrics,
numerous lectureships, and the University of Michigan's Distinguished Faculty
Achievement Award. However, his two greatest achievements may be his unusual record of research publications and his having supervised more than 40 Ph.D.
students who have gone on to illustrious careers of their own.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Stanley M. Garn Professor Emeritus of Anthropology, Professor Emeritus of
Nutrition, and Fellow Emeritus in the Center for Human Growth and Development.
Richard L. Malvin, professor of physiology, will retire from active faculty
status on December 31, 1992, after a most productive career as a teacher and researcher.
A native of Brooklyn, New York, Professor Malvin received his B.Sc. degree
from McGill University in 1950, his M.S. degree from New York University in
1953, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1956. He joined
the University of Michigan as a research associate in 1956, and was appointed instructor in the Department of Physiology in 1957. He was promoted to assistant
professor of physiology in 1959, associate professor in 1964, and professor in
1967.


194




December Meeting, 1992


A renal physiologist of distinction, Professor Malvin was one of the originators (with Walter Wilde and Lawrence Sullivan) of the stop-flow technique, a
method of localizing function in nephrons. Although he has been active in many
areas of renal physiology, he is best known for his work on the role of renin and
angiotensin. He found that there are multiple forms of renin and demonstrated
the central nervous system action of angiotensin. He has contributed significantly to the study of the relation of renin and angiotensin to hypertension.
Professor Malvin has taught medical students and graduate students and is
known for his popular undergraduate course on quackery and fakery in medicine
and science. A large number of today's renal physiologists received their training
in Professor Malvin's laboratory.
In addition to research and teaching, Professor Malvin has been active on
University and national committees and has served on the editorial boards of
scientific journals. He is one of the founders of the American Society of Nephrology. Another major contribution has been his activist role in the Michigan Society
for Medical Research, first as chair of the Public Information Committee and
then as president of the society.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator by naming
Richard L. Malvin Professor Emeritus of Physiology.

Purchase Agreement between the University of Michigan and Universal Algorithms, Inc. (UAI)
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Power, all seven regents
present unanimously approved a purchase agreement between the University
Registrar's Office and University Algorithms, Inc. (UAI). Because one of the
stockholders in the UAI (Bernard A Galler) is also a University employee, this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract (purchase) will be the Regents of the University of
Michigan and Universal Algorithms, Inc. (UAI).
2.  The terms of the contract (purchase) include that UAI provide to the Registrar's Office a) one Schedule 25 Software, Model I, capacity for 390 classrooms;
b) one Schedule 25E Software, Model C, for a maximum of 22 users; and c) licensing agreements for both models for one year at a cost totaling $27,864.
3.  Bernard A. Galler's pecuniary interest arises from his position as a stockholder
in Universal Algorithms, Inc.
Modified Standard Assignment Agreement between the University of
Michigan and Agranoff, Conti4 and Rich (deceased)
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved reassignment of the inventions "Scintillation Multiplexer" (UM  files 159 and 159c1) and "Multi-Sample Scintillation Counter Using
Position-Sensitive Detector" (UM file 461). Because the inventors are also University employees, this arrangement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the assignment agreement will be the University of Michigan and
Bernard W. Agranoff, Ralph S. Conti, and Arthur Rich (deceased).
2.  Terms of the contract include standard terms previously disclosed to and approved by the Regents on July 16, 1987, with one exception: in accordance with
the 1986 assignment agreement between the parties, the University's share of
any future royalties will be 7.5 percent rather than 15 percent.

December Meeting, 1992


Resolution in Honor of Bernard Klein
Regent Power moved adoption of the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents are once again indebted to Dr. Bernard Klein for his
service as interim chancellor of the Dearborn campus since September of
this year.
As he did in 1979-80, Dr. Klein has once again brought his managerial skills to the task of maintaining this campus on an even keel
while a new chancellor was recruited and installed. And once again, he
went well beyond "maintaining an even keel" and, even in this short
period, sustained the momentum of the campus and added impetus to
its efforts to move forward with many critical decisions.
The Regents commend this valued member of the faculty and periodic administrator for his dedicated service to the Dearborn campus
and to the University generally.
The words of the immortal Yogi Berra, New York Yankee catcher,
were never more appropriate: "It's sorta like deja vu all over again. 
Thanks Bernie for ajob well done,... again.
There followed a round of applause. Chancellor Klein made some comments
and thanked the Regents.
Resolution in Honor of Regent Smith
Regent Baker moved adoption of the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend their warm greetings and deep gratitude to their friend and colleague, Veronica Latta
Smith, as she concludes eight years of dedicated service to the faculty,
staff, and students of the University.
Few Regents, past or present, can point to a lifetime that is so closely tied to the University of Michigan and dedicated to efforts on its behalf Beginning with her own graduation in 1948 and subsequent
graduate studies, her life has been continually marked with service to
this institution. Membership on the Martha Cook Board of Governors,
the Martha Cook Alumni Association, the University of Michigan Alumni Association, the President's Club, and life membership in the University of Michigan's Women's Athletic Association are but a few examples
of her efforts which culminated, of course, with her role as Regent for
the past eight years.


197




December Meeting, 1992


And, throughout all of this University activity, Regent Smith has
maintained a full and active business and professional career. Over the
years, she has served as a teacher and insurance executive, as well as a
commercial real estate developer and manager.
It is not surprising that Regent Smith's special concern as Regent
was students. Her efforts on their behalf were surely an extension of her
own family's interest: she and her husband, Stewart, and their six
children share twelve different degrees from the University of Michigan.
The dedication she displayed on behalf of her own children was especially appreciated by the students she served as Regent of the University.
The Regents happily commend this splendid woman of Michigan,
applaud her many accomplishments, thank her for her service to the
University, and proudly install Veronica Latta Smith as Regent Emeritus of the University of Michigan.
President Duderstadt thanked Regent Smith for her years of service, and
presented her with a Regents Medal There followed a round of applause.
Comments by Regent Smith. Regent Smith said that she had enjoyed
serving and working with everyone for the past eight years. She noted that
Regents-elect Deitch and McGowan had pledged to the students that they would
hold the Regents accountable to students. She also thanked students and the
Michigan Daily for their support, and thanked Jeff Rowe for writing the editorial
praising her service as Regent. She said that she would continue her association
with the University as a Regent Emeritus, and thanked the people of Michigan
for providing her the opportunity to serve these past eight years.
Comments from MSA. President Duderstadt calle to the table Ms. Ede
Fox, president of MSA, and Mr. Hunter Van Valkenberg, executive vice president
of MSA. Ms. Fox stated that MSA had passed a resolution in honor of Regent
Smith. She thanked Regent Smith for her support and stated that she and the
other executive officers of MSA were there to show appreciation for her fairness
while serving on the Board. She particularly noted Regent Smith's support for
policies that affect students, such as deputization, the nonacademic code of conduct, and changes in the Board of Student Publications. Ms. Fox observed that
over the years, students have worked hard to express their opinions but that the
administration had often contradicted student opinions. She said that Regent
Smith had been a "beacon of light" in these specific instances, and she noted that
Regent Smith had always advocated having issues that affect students be decided
upon when students were on campus and aware of the issue under consideration.
She expressed hope that in the future, other Regents would consider student decisions seriously before deciding policy.
Mr. Van Valkenberg then presented the MSA resolution to Regent Smith.
Resolution in Honor of Regent Nielsen
Regent Brown then moved the following resolution:


198




December Meeting, 1992


Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University warmly salute and commend their
fellow Regent, Neal D. Nielsen, as he completes eight years of devoted
service as a member of the University's governing board.
His association with the University began as an undergraduate at
Michigan, where he received his bachelor's degree. After graduate work
at Western Michigan University, he entered law school and earned his
L.L.B. at Detroit College of Law.
Regent Nielsen's experience and expertise have been especially
helpful during this period in the history of the University, which has
seen many difficult priority decisions brought on by funding shortfalls
and changing revenue patterns. He was especially sensitive to keeping a
University education within the financial reach of all Michigan citizens.
Yet he realized that the quality of the University could not be compromised. He sought instead to maintain quality through prioritization
and the development of alternative revenue sources.
As a particular champion of the University's Flint campus, Regent
Nielsen saw in that institution another way of maintaining access to a
University of Michigan education, especially for students in that region
of the state. He was tireless in his interest and support of the activities
on that campus, and he did so without in any way slighting the other
campuses of the University.
Regent Nielsen has maintained a full professional practice and is
a recognized leader in his home community of Brighton. The Regents
are grateful that the institution they all serve has been the beneficiary of
the dedication of this distinguished public servant. And in recognition,
they are pleased to name Neal D. Nielsen Regent Emeritus of the University of Michigan.
President Duderstadt expressed the University's gratitude for Regent Nielsen's years of service, and presented him with the Regents' Medal. There followed a round of applause.
Comments by Regent Nielsen. Regent Nielsen stated that his eight
years of service had been very enjoyable, especially his association with the numerous administrators, faculty, and students he had worked with. He said he'd
enjoyed watching the medical facilities grow over the past few years, and his involvement in the growth and development of the research industry in the area
had made him proud to be affiliated with the institution and a resident of the
state of Michigan. Regent Nielsen commented that he was gratified by what has
happened at the University during his tenure, and looked forward to staying involved in the years to come.
There followed a ten-minute recess, after which the Regents reconvened in
executive session at 3:10 P.M.


199




December Meeting, 1992


Following the executive session, there being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 4:30 PM. The next meeting will be held on January 21 and
22, 1992. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous
expenses for the month of November 1992 totalled $999.35.

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
voted unanimously to adopt the following retirement memoirs:
Thomas L Coffey, professor of sociology/anthropology/social work at the
University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on December 31,
1992, after a most productive career as a teacher, advisor, and department leader.
Professor Coffey received his B.S. degree from Central Michigan University
in 1956 and his M.S.W. degree from the University of Michigan School of Social
Work in 1961. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan-Flint in 1973
as an associate professor without tenure; he received tenure in 1974, and was
promoted to full professor in 1977.
Having taught social work at UM-Flint for nearly 20 years, Professor Coffey
was responsible for the development of its highly successful B.A program in social work and the program minor in criminal justice. His most noted research endeavor was an extensive investigation of issues related to the death penalty in
Michigan, culminating in a first-rate video entitled "Trial and Error." Professor
Coffey provided additional service as chair of the Department of Sociology/Anthropology from 1985-87 and again from 1990-91.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Thomas L. Coffey Professor Emeritus of Sociology/Anthropology/Social Work.


211




January Meeting, 1993


Nathalie A. Drews, associate professor of social work, retired from active
faculty status on May 31, 1992, after 28 years of service to the University of
Michigan.
Professor Drews received her AB. degree from the University of Michigan
in 1948, and her M.S.W. degree from the University of Michigan in 1951. She
served as an assistant field director with the American National Red Cross from
1952-56 and a medical social worker at the University of Michigan Hospitals
from 1956-64. Professor Drews joined the faculty of the School of Social Work in
1964 as an assistant professor, she was promoted to associate professor in 1970
and attained tenure in 1973.
As one of the school's leading instructors in the area of interpersonal practice, Professor Drews was an authority on the family life cycle, particularly in the
areas of death and dying and working with families who are coping with loss and
grief. Her expertise was also shared for a time with the Institute of Gerontology
where she served as an associate research scientist (1983) and then as a faculty
associate (1984-87). Professor Drews was a member of the Turner Geriatric Services Advisory Committee, and served as consultant to many public and voluntary social service organizations. Her leadership contributions to the School of
Social Work include serving a year as acting director of student services in 1986
and as assistant dean of student services from 1987-91. Her retirement marks
the departure of one of the most dedicated members of the faculty of the School
of Social Work
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Nathalie A Drews
Associate Professor Emeritus of Social Work
Thomas J. Garbaty, professor of English language and literature, retired
from active faculty status on December 31, 1992.
Professor Garbaty emigrated to the United States with his family from Berlin in 1939. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Haverford College in 1951, he
received his M.A degree in 1954 and his PhD. degree in 1957 from the University of Pennsylvania. He came to the University of Michigan in 1960 as an instructor in the English department and as an assistant editor of the Middle English
Dictionary. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1962, associate professor
in 1966, and professor in 1970.
For over 30 years, Professor Garbaty has been one of the most valued and
popular members of the department. He is one of the few professors to be named
invariably to the honors list of the students' course evaluation booklet Advice,
and received the Amoco Award for Distinguished Undergraduate Teaching in
1968, the first State of Michigan Teaching Excellence Award in 1990, and the
first biennial award from the Learning Disabilities Society in 1991.
Professor Garbaty's earliest publications involve the late Victorian period,
but he found his true calling in the age of Chaucer. He is the editor of Medieval
English Literature, the standard anthology for the period, and is currently working on an edition of "Sir Thopas" for the Chaucer Variorum. He has served many
terms on the English department's executive committee, and outside the University has served as visiting professor at the University of Bern, Switzerland; chair
of the Chaucer Division of the Modern Language Association; reader for PMLA,
the Chaucer Review, and Studies in the Age of Chaucer; and member of the


212




January Meeting, 1993


editorial boards of three journals. Colleagues and former graduate students in
the English department will remember especially the stimulating colloquia he organized (and his droll introductions) during his seven years as chair of the Committee on Scholarly and Creative Activities.
The same talents that stamped Professor Garbaty's teaching made him a
leader among his professional peers. He repeatedly moved beyond the classroom
to the public stage as well, in response to requests from local high schools and organizations and from other colleges and universities. Professor Garbaty taped a
ten-program television series, "Chaucer's Canterbury Tales," which was adopted
by Educational Television of Ontario, by WNET in New York City, and by the
Central Television Network
The Regents now salute this esteemed teacher, scholar, and public servant
by naming Thomas J. Garbaty Professor Emeritus of English Language and Literature.
Beverly C. Payne, M.D., research scientist in the Institute for Social Research and clinical professor of postgraduate medicine and health professions
education in the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on June 30,
1992.
Dr. Payne received his B.A. and his M.D. degrees from the University of
Texas in 1939 and 1942, respectively, then completed his internship and residency in internal medicine at the University of Michigan Hospitals in 1945.
Throughout most of his career, he combined the active clinical practice of internal medicine with research and teaching at the University of Michigan. He was a
clinical instructor in internal medicine from 1953-63, clinical assistant professor
from 1963-76, and assistant dean in the Medical School from 1966-76. From
1976-79, Dr. Payne served as director of the Health Services Research Center and
associate professor in the Departments of Postgraduate Medicine and Health
Professions Education and Internal Medicine. He was appointed clinical associate professor in 1979 and clinical professor in 1992 in the Department of Postgraduate Medicine and Health Professions Education. He received his
appointment as research scientist in the Institute for Social Research in 1984.
Nationally recognized for his research in the evaluation and improvement of
physicians' performance in providing health care, Dr. Payne was among the first
to develop quantitative methods for measuring physicians' performance. During
his career, he pursued an expansion of the use of these methods to improve care
in hospitals and in ambulatory and specialized care settings. Dr. Payne has
served on the editorial board of the Annals on Internal Medicine, and has been
an advisor or consultant to numerous federal, state, and local organizations. For
his achievements in health services research, he received the American College of
Physicians Rosenthal Award; he has also been honored as a master of the American College of Physicians.
Dr. Payne's scholarly work has been complemented by his communitybased practice as a general internist. Highly regarded by his peers, he has held
elective positions in the Michigan State Medical Society and the American College of Physicians. His unique career has combined insight into practical issues
in medical care with scientific inquiry and development of methods to improve
care.

January Meeting, 1993


The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Beverly C. Payne
Research Scientist Emeritus.
Glenn E. "Bo" Schembechler, assistant professor of sports management and communication in the Division of Kinesiology and former head football
coach and director of athletics, retired from active faculty status on August 31,
1992, after an extraordinarily productive career.
A 1951 graduate of Miami University of Ohio, Professor Schembechler
earned his M.A degree in 1952 from The Ohio State University, where he also
served as graduate assistant coach. After serving in the U.S. Army, he coached at
Presbyterian College and at Bowling Green State, Northwestern, and Ohio State
Universities before being named head football coach at Miami University of Ohio
in 1963. In 1969, he commenced his record-setting career as head football coach
at the University of Michigan, a position he held until 1990.
Professor Schembechler never had a losing season in 27 years (including Miami University) as a head coach. His won-lost record of 234-64-8 ranks first
among all active coaches. Seventeen of his 21 UM teams ranked in the top 10 in
the wire service polls and went on to bowl games. Thirty-nine of his players
earned first-team All American honors, and nearly 100 earned first-team All Big
Ten honors. From 1988-1990, he also served as the University's director of athletics, overseeing 21 varsity sports and a budget in excess of $20 million.
With a reputation as one of the best academic advisors in the Division of Kinesiology, Professor Schembechler knew each of his players, their abilities, and
their career plans. He strongly emphasized academic achievement, always keeping the best long-term interests of his players foremost in his mind. He is a past
president of the American Football Coaches Association, and for many years,
conducted a highly-regarded annual coaching clinic for high school coaches. He
has also been a featured television sports commentator during the football season.
The Regents now salute this distinguished coach, teacher, and administrator by naming Glenn E. Schembechler Assistant Professor Emeritus of Sports
Management and Communication.
Memorials
The Regents were notified of the death of a faculty member, Frank M.
Andrews.
Anita Miller. In addition, Regent Power noted the death on January 18,
1993, of Anita Miller, who had a close association with the Regents in her position as director of university events. He observed that Ms. Miller had joined the
University staff in 1965 in the School of Public Health, and then after an absence
of several years had rejoined the University in the Office of Development. She
had held several leadership positions in the Campaign for Michigan, the $160
million fundraising effort, including director of campaign operations and assistant to the director of development for major gifts. She was appointed director of
university events in 1989.


214




January Meeting, 1993


Regent Power commented, "All of us who served with her were enormously
impressed by her capacity for detail, her imagination, her sense of excellence in
all things, her good will, and her loyalty to the University. I know that many
around this table join me in expressing our sorrow at her death, and wish to express our condolences to Roy Muir, her husband"
President Duderstadt observed that Anita was a warm, energetic, and courageous individual who had served the University very, very well. Besides having
had close relations with members of the Board and the administration, she had
frequently served as the face of the University in interacting with people from
the outside. He noted that she would be missed very much.
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
voted ulnnimously to adopt the following memorial statement:
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness the death on December 23, 1992, of Frank M. Andrews, professor of
psychology, professor of population planning and international health, and distinguished research scientist in the Institute for Social Research.
Born in Tenafly, New Jersey, on April 2, 1935, Professor Andrews received
his B.A degree from Dartmouth College in 1957. Following studies at the University of Sydney, Australia, and the New School for Social Research, he received
his Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1962. In 1959, he joined the
Survey Research Center at the Institute for Social Research; he was appointed to
the faculties of the Department of Psychology in 1963 and the Department of
Population Planning and International Health in 1979.
Professor Andrews conducted numerous studies on social indicators of wellbeing, scientific creativity, social science research methods, and other subjects.
He was the author or editor of more than a dozen books and monographs and of
many scientific articles and chapters. In the late 1960s, he participated in and later directed an eight-year project to assist the government of Peru in establishing
a survey research center to gather information about that country's labor force
and other social indicators.
Professor Andrews made extensive contributions to survey research methods and analysis techniques and is credited with the invention of a number of
measures, indicators, and statistical innovations. His work is widely used and
cited by many scholars. In addition to being a distinguished researcher, Professor
Andrews was a superb teacher. He established and taught several highly popular
courses in survey analysis techniques; served on numerous doctoral committees
and for many years directed the doctoral programs in population planning and
international health; and contributed to international research as both a teacher
and consultant.
In 1990, Professor Andrews received the University's Distinguished Research Scientist Award. His achievements also were recognized in 1992 by the establishment of the Frank M. Andrews Survey Research Center Summer Institute
Fellowship.
Professor Andrews will always be remembered by his students and colleagues with affection and universal respect for his breadth of expertise in the
areas of analysis of survey data and the study of the quality of life in


215

Se  6.05.  Divisions of the Universit
A division of the University may be established by the president and the Board on
request from faculty members interested in a common substantive field which cuts
across administrative lines, for the purpose of coordinating allied interests and activities. In the exercis of its functions, a division shall concern itself with the interrelations
ofprograms of instruction, the encouragement of individual research, the promotion of
cooperative investigations, and the perforance of extramural services. The functioning agency of a division shall be a general committee representative of the constituent
departments and constituted in such a manner as may be deemed appropriate in each
Division. The individuals constituting the general committee shall be nominated by appropriate agencies of the schools, colleges, and departments.

It may be reactivated by a request to the president from former constituent members.
The chair of each division shall be appointed by the president on recommendation of the division members.
This section shall not apply to the Division of Kinesiology, which is an operative
administrative and academic unit.
Sec. 11.034. The University of Michigan-Dearborn Division of Interdisciplinarv Studies Executive Committee
By action of the Board of Regents on October 18, 1991, Bylaw 11.034 was rescinde effective January 1, 1992.
The Michigan Mandate
President Duderstadt announced that two panels would be discussing aspects of the Michigan Mandate, and introduced members of the first panel: Harold R. Johnson, dean of the School of Social Work; Lee C Bollinger, dean of the
Law School, and Frederick C. Neidhardt, the Frederick G. Novy Distinguished
University Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, associate dean for faculty
affairs in the Medical School, and chair of the Committee on a Multicultural University (COMU).
President Duderstadt reviewed the history of the Michigan Mandate, which
was instituted five years ago with the goal of building a model of a multicultural
learning community which values, respects, and draws intellectual strength from
the rich diversity of people of different races, cultures, religions, nationalities,
and beliefs, while resisting pressures of separation, fear, and bigotry. It was decided to take a strategic approach to achieving fundamental, permanent change
in the nature of the University, a process that would be organic and evolve with
experience.
The president reviewed the progress that has been made as a result of the
Michigan Mandate, noting that a record was set in Fall, 1992, with over 7,000
minority students (21.4 percent of the student body) being enrolled at the Ann
Arbor campus. African American enrollment has increased by over 50 percent, to
a level of 7.8 percent of the student body, since the institution of the Michigan


218




January Meeting, 1993


Mandate. He also cited increases in the number of minority faculty and improvements in graduation rates among minority students.
Harold Johnson. The president called on Dean Harold Johnson, who
stated his belief that multiculturalism could be the single most important issue
facing society, and noted that the University reflects the imperfections of society
at large. Dean Johnson recounted his experience as chair of the committee
charged with reviewing University programs in minority affairs and services. As
a result of this review, the committee concluded that stereotyping of minority
students is a very big problem; rather than assuming that they will need extensive supportive services, what is needed is higher expectations for minority students. They should be treated as individuals, rather than as stereotypes.
The committee recommended that the title of the vice provost for minority
affairs be changed to vice provost for academic and multicultural affairs, and that
the person in this office should work more closely with the other units on campus. The University should encourage the development of a wider array of instructional and research initiatives that would promote multiculturalism, and
should institutionalize the initiatives already in place.
In the area of student services, the committee found that a number of units
offer the same services, and it recommended simplifying this service structure.
The final recommendation was that a system be established that would reward
people who focus their scholarly activities on multiculturlism, rather than
penalize them.
Lee Bollinger. The next speaker, Dean Bollinger, described the effect of
the Michigan Mandate on the Law School He noted that when he became dean
in 1987, there was a lot of conflict in the Law School between Black, white, and
Hispanic students. These students also were critical of the Law School admissions process, educational program, classroom dynamics, social interactions, the
placement process, and lack of diversity within the faculty.
To address these problems, a minority Law School graduate conducted confidential interviews with minority students and alumni, and minority students
also came to meetings of faculty and others to air their concerns. These interactions verified the uncongenial atmosphere that existed for minority students.
As a result of these findings, the Law School has revised the admissions process, hired a Black dean of admissions, revised its brochure, and generally made
the process more inviting. Minority enrollment has increased by 10 percent from
the level of six years ago, to a current total of about 22 percent (17 percent
Black). Minority students' performance has improved, there are more courses
that deal with race and gender issues, and classroom dynamics appear to have
improved. The Minority Affairs Program has improved, and an extremely successful one-week program for entering minority students, held prior to the first
week of school, has been developed. The Law School has also hired Mrs. Doris
McCree to provide counseling, advice, guidance, and job placement assistance for
minority students.


219




January Meeting, 1993


In the area of faculty recruitment, 20 percent of the offers made have been
to minorities, although the Law School has had difficulty retaining its minority
faculty. He also pointed out that Supreme Court decisions in the area of affirmative action have caused the Law School to change some of its admissions procedures.
Dean Bollinger concluded by praising the president for his leadership in
pursuing the Michigan Mandate.
Frederick Neidhardt. The president then called on Professor Neidhardt
to report on the Council on a Multicultural University (COMU), a group of 40 administrators formed three years ago, charged with helping to implement the
Michigan Mandate. Professor Neidhardt described the achievements of COMU,
and said that its current focus is based on the premise that
"progress in achieving a multicultural academic community at the
University of Michigan depends now on our success in complementing
the recruitment efforts that are designed to bring a greater diversity of
students, faculty and staff to the University. New efforts must address
the features of our environment that contribute to, as well as those that
impede, the creation of a sense of community in the University-a community based not on homogeneity of background and heritage, but on
shared values, personal aspirations, and goals for the American and the
global society. "
The Council decided to focus on the environment and how people are
treated when they come to the University of Michigan. The three projects it is
undertaking in 1992-93 are 1) Learning about progress in achieving a multicultural community at other institutions as well as within the University of Michigan; 2) Describing the nature of the community that we would like to achieve,
which involves identifying markers by which progress toward achieving multiculturlism can be measured; and 3) Assessing the current climate at the University, through conducting cultural audits.
Discussion. The panelists then responded to questions from the Regents.
Dean Bollinger described the impact that court cases have had on affirmative action programs in recent years. In response to a question from Regent Baker, Provost Whitaker described the way in which funds are made available for hiring
qualified minority faculty members who are identified in the course of the normal recruitment process. Dean Bollinger reported that it is very important to the
faculty to have diversity among its ranks, and described the positive impact that
the background and experiences of Black faculty have had on the Law School He
and President Duderstadt also noted that the Michigan Mandate and the methods used for recruiting minority faculty are within the guidelines set by the Supreme Court.
Regarding the current climate at the University, the panelists reported that
the climate for minorities varies from unit to unit, but in general, it appears that
most of the micro-environments are not as nourishing for people of color as they
should be. Discussion followed about the reasons for this and how the climate


220




January Meeting, 1993


can be improved. Dean Johnson observed that a multicultural perspective at the
institution will bring it closer to the truth. He believes that if the fundamental focus remains that of developing a more multiculturl community, this will guarantee a multicultural perspective on all issues, and the climate will automatically
improve.
Regent Baker reported that he had been contacted by two students within
the last three years who had wanted to write papers against affirmative action
and who had been told that they would fail the course if they did that. He observed that there is a lot of hostility within the University community toward the
idea of "changing behavior", of people being forced into a mold that they don't
agree with. He also cautioned that care must be taken to avoid any restrictions
on freedom of speech and thought at the University.
In response to a question from President Duderstadt, Professor Ejner Jensen, chair of SACUA, noted that he and others on the English Department faculty were at first very resistant to the idea of a having course on racism, but that
their opinions have since changed. He now agrees that the more students there
are who represent diverse elements of society, the more people will recognize that
common stereotypes are inaccurate.
In response to Regent Baker's comments, Dean Bollinger stated that any
faculty member who penalizes a student for writing against affirmative action
has violated as deep a principle of the University as anyone who behaves in a racist manner. He also pointed out that intellectual openness is as important as the
other issues, and that faculty members must be courageous in raising issues of
race in and out of the classroom.
President Duderstadt then introduced the second panel: Royster Harper,
associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students; Warren Whatley, professor of economics and associate dean for graduate recruitment and support; and David Schoem, lecturer in sociology and assistant dean for
undergraduate education.
Warren Whatley. Dean Whatley described the programs administered by
his office that are used in recruiting and supporting graduate students. He
pointed out that recruitment is important because there are many capable students who have never considered the option of attending graduate school and
who need to be encouraged to do so. The Summer Research Opportunity Program has been effective in building a pool of undergraduate students of color who
go on to graduate school. Summer research institutes, various forums and workshops, and mentoring are used to support students once they are in graduate
school
Dean Whatley's office also administers a very large fellowship program,
which provides extensive financial support to graduate students of color. He described improvements that have been made in the fellowship program, which
give incentives to the departments to provide teaching and research opportunities for students. This helps to make fellowship students more a part of the


221




January Meeting, 1993


ongoing activities of the department and provides a more nurturing environment
as they go through their graduate program.
Royster Harper. The president then called on Dean Harper, to speak on
the topic of the climate on campus for nonwhite and non-heterosexual members
of the University community. She pointed out that the common characteristic for
these people is that they have less power than the majority, they are not yet able
to take for granted that they are full and valued members of this community, because "they are not, and they know it." The challenge is to create a campus environment that moves from tolerating a diverse community to embracing it.
Dean Harper observed that the experience of being a nonwhite member of
the community is one of being tolerated; they are being "permitted" to be members of the community, rather than valued, accepted, and embraced. The reason
for this is that most people come from communities where people are just like
them, and have had little association with people outside of their own experience.
She noted that white men in particular have a difficult time understanding institutional and cultural forms of discrimination and in accepting the fact that
they are still privileged in society and therefore should take responsibility for
change that is inherent with this privilege.
Dean Harper observed that future survival will depend on an awareness of
and respect for other races and other cultures. She believes that many more opportunities for interaction among these diverse communities need to be created
at the University. Increased numbers of students of color have helped them feel
much more comfortable, has boosted their confidence, and has provided more social opportunities. On the other hand, white students who have looked forward
to the diversity of the campus bemoan the fact that students from different racial
groups seldom mingle. She pointed out that most adults also spend their spare
time with people just like them, so it is unrealistic to expect more of vulnerable
young people.
Self-imposed segregation creates a lot of tension, and the assumption among
the "privileged" is that the impetus for integrating the groups should come from
the students of color. In other words, according to Dean Harper, this means that
"one must bear both the brunt of being tolerated and the responsibility for being
accepted, included, and embraced" To allay this presumption, Dean Harper
urged that the University encourage self affirmation and group affirmation by
creating more opportunities for self-segregation where minority group members
can seek refuge.
Another challenge Dean Harper posed is to teach whites the responsibility
that comes with unearned privilege. This can be taught by example, through institutional policies and through personal behavior.
Dean Harper also addressed the climate as it relates to gay, lesbian, and bisexual students. She noted that these students have high expectations for college
life after leading tortured lives in high school, only to be disillusioned when they
encounter almost as much homophobia and stereotyping behavior at the
University as they did at home. These students also have to confront even more


222




January Meeting, 1993


complex developmental and identity issues around sexuality than straight people
do.
Dean Harper described the notion of political correctness as a "confusion
factor," designed to confuse legality with morality. Even though most of the University's hiring, promotion, and living practices are legal, students, staff, and faculty, often ask, "but are they just and are they fair?" Students, staff, and faculty
see, understand, and feel by example that diversity and respect for people expressed in words is not often reflected in behavior. In a university setting, they
will struggle to have integrity and courage not because it is politically correct, but
because it is fair and just. This is the standard by which leadership will be evaluated.
David Schoem. Dean Schoem then took the floor to describe the Program
on Intergroup Relations and Conflict, which was developed to educate students
about intergroup relations and conflict and to base this education in the curriculum. Students would become more aware, better informed, more knowledgeable,
and better able to understand and apply analytical tools to enable them to think
about these issues more broadly. This program was conceived as a systematic, intellectual approach meant to be part of the liberal arts education of all students.
Dean Schoem described the various components of the program, noting that
it reaches 400-500 students each semester. Classes in this program provide a safe,
educational environment in which students can speak openly and honestly about
these issues and can be self-reflective about how they live with others. Students
also learn more about themselves as individuals and as members of groups,
about others and their groups, and about commonalities and differences across
groups. Through this program, the notion that people within groups are all alike
quickly disappears, and students become aware of individual difference and intragroup conflict
The result of the program will be a core of students who will contribute as
leaders in a diverse, democratic society, by having experienced interactions in
substantive ways with people from different backgrounds, and who will feel comfortable in asserting their leadership in mixed gender, racial, and ethnic groups.
Dean Schoem noted that students do feel free to speak their minds in the environments created by this program.
In the discussion that followed, the speakers responded to a question from
Regent Deitch by stating that all of the various strategies they described can be
effective in addressing the problem of climate for non-majority students.
Regent McFee urged that the Regents be kept frequently apprised of how
these issues are being addressed on campus. Regent Power observed that the
Mandate sometimes provokes hostility because it creates the perception that a
politically correct attitude is being forced upon everyone. He also noted that more
instances of discomfort are being created because we-as a society and as a university-are trying to address problems that have never before been addressed
successfully. Creating an institution that values diverse people will get closer to


223




January Meeting, 1993


truth, and by doing so we will have contributed to the evolution of a better and
truer America.
Regent Deitch commended the president on behalf of the Board for his leadership in this effort. The meeting then moved to the Michigan Union to hear
public comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, all students,
and all on the topic of the proposed closing of the Program in Population Planning and International Health in the School of Public Health: Carol Ann Miller,
Christine Kolars, Suzinne Pak, Jonathan Gorstein, and Hollie Malamud.
Following Public Comments, the Regents returned to the Regents' Room to
meet in executive session. Then, there being no further business, the meeting
was adjourned. The next meeting will be held on February 18 and 19, 1993. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses
for the month of December 1992 totalled $230.55.

conflict of interest policies that apply to the Board and ex.cutive officers as well
as to faculty and staff. Recommendations would then be brought to the Regents
for consideration. Regents Deitch, McGowan, McFee, and Power expressed support of this idea, as did Regent Baker, while noting that previous Boards had
scrupulously adhered to the highest standards of conduct when conflict of interest might have been in question.
Following some discussion, Regent Waters moved, Regent McGowan seconded, and the Regents voted unanimously to receive the reports.
Voluntary Support
Vice President Cosovich submitted the Report on Voluntary Support for the
month of January 1993, noting that the seven-month period ending January 31,
1993, set a record in the amount of support received. On a motion by Regent
Power, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents voted unanimously to receive
the following gifts, with thanks, and in accord with their terms and conditions:
ARCO Exploration and Production Technology, Plano, Texas
for the Industrial Affiliates Program in Flow and Reaction in Porous Media, College
of Engineering........16,500

Werner H. Grilk, assistant professor of German in the Department of
Germanic Languages and Literatures, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1992.
Professor Grilk was bor in Davenport, Iowa, on January 9, 1928. He received his B.S. degree in 1951 from Northwestern University. He completed his
M.A degree in 1960 and his Ph.D. degree in 1966, both at the University of
Michigan. He joined the faculty in 1962 as an instructor and was promoted to assistant professor in 1965.
Since 1965, Professor Grilk has been a member of the Bibliography Committee, Germanic Section, of the Modem Language Association. He became cochair in 1973 and was its chair from 1977-80, thus contributing to one of the
most important and widely-used guides to international scholarship in literature,
linguistics, and folklore.
Although Professor Grilk's area of major scholarly interest is Austrian comedy, with special focus on the plays of Grillparzer and Nestroy, his teaching and
conference presentations have drawn on a widely-based knowledge of 19th and
20th century German literature, art, and political history. The breadth of his interests is cearly shown by the number of doctoral committees on which he has
served in units outside his home department. An active and committed teacher of
undergraduate courses in German literature, Professor Grilk regularly served on
undergraduate prize selection committees and fellowship committees, and participated in the Junior-Year-in- Freiburg selection process. He was the German
concentration advisor from 1965-76.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his outstanding accomplishments and contributions by naming Werner H. Grilk Assistant Professor
Emeritus of German.
Paul L Olson, research scientist in the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, retired from active faculty status on March 13,
1992, after a highly productive career as a researcher and administrator.
A native of Chicago, Paul Olson received his B.S. degree from the University
of Illinois in 1957 and his Ph.D. degree from Purdue University in 1959. He then
took a position as a senior research psychologist at General Motors Corporation's
Research Laboratories in Warren, Michigan, where he began his life-long study
of human behavior with regard to driver judgment, driver response, and driver
information processing.
In 1971, Dr. Olson came to the University of Michigan as a research
psychologist at the Highway Safety Research Institute. There he studied assessments of lighting and signaling systems, rear view mirror curvature and reflectivity, driver response to traffic signals, nighttime legibility and conspicuity of
traffic signs, and drivers' ability to judge spacing between vehicles in traffic. In
1975, Dr. Olson was appointed head of the institute's Human Factors Division
where he continued his investigations into driver perception and cognitive skills,
studying the effects of such variables as brain damage, driver age, and nighttime


245




February Meeting, 1993


driving. Dr. Olson's expertise included the effects of photometrics involved in a
driver's ability to recognize signals, signs, and other vehicles. Of particular note
is his pioneering work on older drivers and the special issues presented by this
rapidly growing segment of our population.
Dr. Olson's unique contributions to the field of traffic safety involved the
application of psychology, human performance, and behavior to problems of driving. Knowledge derived from his research has been applied to automobile design
and to the design of materials and laws affecting our nation's highways. For his
outstanding work, Dr. Olson has been honored by election as a fellow of the Human Factors Society and, in 1980, received the society's AR. Lauer Award for
outstanding contributions to the understanding of driver behavior. In 1987, he
received the Ralph H. Isbrandt Automotive Safety Engineering Award from the
Society of Automotive Engineers, given to the author of the best paper on safety

1962. He was appointed assistant professor in 1963, and was promoted to associate professor in 1965 and professor in 1970.
Professor Summerfield has been a member of the Macromolecular Science
and Engineering Center, which is indicative of his interdisciplinary research abilities and interests, for over 25 years. He has advised numerous undergraduate
and graduate students, many of whom have gone on to establish outstanding
reputations in their own fields. Professor Summerfield has also served on several
departmental and college-wide committees, including the Nuclear Engineering
Executive Committee, the Curriculum Committee, and the College of Engineering Scholastic Standing Committee.
During his early years at Michigan, Professor Summerfield contributed substantively to the theory of neutron transport, including a well-known paper that
proved the completeness of the half-range solutions to the linear Boltzmann
equation. During this period, the University of Michigan was acknowledged to be
the leading center of research in neutron transport theory, and Professor
Summerfield was a principal participant in this effort Having earned a national
reputation in neutron transport theory, Professor Summerfield has applied his
expertise in mathematics and physics to the investigation of extremely difficult
problems in slow neutron scattering, polymer dynamics, and crystal phase
changes. He has published over 50 papers in prestigious journals, which have
brought recognition and distinction to the University of Michigan. As a valued
member of the faculty for three decades, Professor Summerfield has helped the
Department of Nuclear Engineering earn its reputation as one of the best nuclear engineering departments in the United States.

Regent Brown moved, Regent McGowan seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved the University's entering into a license agreement with Audiocomp, Inc. ("Audiocomp"), a company whose shareholders include University
professors David Anderson and David Neuhoff and former University students
Donghoon Lee and Omar Nemri. Because Professors Anderson and Neuhoff are
both current University employees and parties to the contract, this arrangement
falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Audiocomp, a
corporation in which Messrs. Anderson, Neuhoff, Lee, and Nemri retain significant ownership interests.
2.  Terms of the contract include: a duration of the term of the last to expire of
any issuing patents and consideration to the University consisting of the
payment of royalties, including modest minimum annual requirements, on


249




February Meeting, 1993


products covered by patents; a share of sublicensing revenues received by Audiocomp; and reimbursement of any future University patent filing and prosecution costs, if applicable. Audiocomp will pay the University royalties at a
rate of 1.5 percent for products sold, except that no royalties shall be due on
products sold prior to 1995. Audiocomp will also pay the University 10.0 percent of any sublicensing revenues Audiocomp receives. Minimum royalties shall
commence in 1996 at $2,000 per year. The University retains ownership of all
technology. The University retains the right to use the technology for research,
teaching, and other educationally-related purposes. Audiocomp shall diligently
uue the commercial development and exploitation of the technology covered
by the proposed license agreement. There is no use of facilities or services of the
University included in the contract and no assignment of University employees
for fulfillment of the contract.
3.   The pecuniary interest of Professors Anderson and Neuhoff in the contract
arises from their ownership of shares of Audiocomp. This equity interest (as
well as the equity interests of Messrs. Lee and Nemri) will be in lieu of participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University, in accordance with
standard University policy.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and
Vetgen, Inc.
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the University's entering into a license agreement with
Vetgen, Inc. ("Vetgen"). Because two of the owners of Vetgen, George Brewer
and Vilma Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, are both University employees and parties to the
contract, this arrangement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. (Shareholders/employees at Michigan State University are also parties to
the contract and will be subject to Conflict of Interest Statute requirements
through Michigan State University.) The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Vetgen, a corporation owned in part by Dr. George Brewer and Dr. Vilma Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan.
2.   Summaries of the terms of the contracts follow:
Summnary of proposed "577 technology" license agreement between the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Vetgen, Inc.
License: Exclusive license of animal genetic probes and linkages to animal genetic diseases (IPO File #577) developed in performance of a research project
sponsored by the Morris Animal Foundation, currently scheduled to be completed in February, 1995 (the research project includes subcontracted research
to be performed by MSU - agreements are in effect allowing UM to license
MSU's ownership interest in the technology, and to share proceeds from licensing with MSU and the research sponsor);
Scope of technology licensed: In order for any particular developed probe or
linkage to be included as part of the exclusive license, Vetgen must have
reached agreement with the developer (whether from UM or MSU) of that
probe or linkage to provide for the sharing of the rewards of its commercialization through Vetgen (by partial ownership, employment or other compensation) rather than through the royalty sharing policies of the UM or MSU. In
any instance in which such an agreement between Vetgen and a developer
would result in the addition of a previously unnamed UM or MSU researcher to
the relationship between the Universities and Vetgen, full details will be provided to UM Medical School for review according to their conflict of interest
procedures (or to MSU for review according to their conflict of interest


250




February Meeting, 1993


procedures, as appropriate);
Field of Use: Veterinary uses only. The University agrees to negotiate in good
faith to allow Vetgen to expand its activities to include human uses of the
technology, if human uses are shown, provided Vetgen can demonstrate commitment to making such human uses available to the public;
Ownership: UM and MSU retain ownership of all licensed technology, and control of all patent application processes. UM and MSU retain the right to use the
licensed technology for research, teaching and other educationally-related
purposes; and for all purposes outside of the field of use. Any intellectual property relating to the technology that is developed by a UM or MSU employee simultaneously acting as employee or consultant to Vetgen shall be assigned to
the employing University,

by University patents not paid for by Vetgen. Minimum royalties shall commence in the year following the first sale of a product or service (no later than
1999), at $5,000, and progress thereafter, increasing to a requirement of
$25,000 in the sixth year following the first sale (and in each year thereafter
during the remainder of the agreement);
There is no use of facilities or services of UM or MSU included in the contract
and no assignment of UM or MSU employees for ffillment of the contract.
Summary of proposed "723 technology" license agreement between the University of Michigan. Michigan State University and Vetgen, Inc.
License: Exclusive license of four existing animal genetic probes and linkages
to animal genetic diseases developed through Dr. Brewer's 'short-cut' method,
and future probes which meet the following criteria: (i) a genetic probe developed using the 'short-cut' method, (ii) which is developed by UM or MSU researchers and disclosed to UM or MSU within 5 years from the start of the
agreement, (iii) for which neither University has conflicting obligations to a
third party, and (iv) which is not developed as a part of the Morris Animal
Foundation research Project (IPO File #723) (work on the 'short-cut' technology is proceeding at both UM and MSU. UM will collect all royalties, and share
them equally with MSU per a separate agreement to be put into effect between
UM and MSU);
Scope of technology licensed: In order for any particular developed probe or
linkage to be included as part of the exclusive license, Vetgen must have
reached agreement with the developer (whether from UM or MSU) of that
probe or linkage to provide for the sharing of the rewards of its commercialization through Vetgen (by partial ownership, employment or other compensation) rather than through the royalty sharing policies of the UM or MSU. In
any instance in which such an agreement between Vetgen and a developer
would result in the addition of a previously unnamed UM or MSU researcher to
the relationship between the Universities and Vetgen, full details will be provided to UM Medical School for review according to their conflict of interest
procedures (or to MSU for review according to their conflict of interest procedures, as appropriate);
Field of Use: Veterinary uses only. The University agrees to negotiate in good
faith to allow Vetgen to expand its activities to include human uses of the


251

agreement;
Consideration: Payment of royalties on sales of products or services by Vetgen
based upon the technology, including specified modest minimum annual royalties required in order to maintain exclusive rights. Royalties will be paid to the
University at a rate of 4% for products or services which are not covered by
University patents; 5% for products or services which are covered by University
patents paid for by Vetgen; and 6% for products or services which are covered
by University patents not paid for by Vetgen. Minimum royalties shall commence in 1996 at $4,000, and progress thereafter, increasing to a requirement
of $10,000 in 1998 and in each year thereafter during the remainder of the
agreement;
There is no use of facilities or services of UM or MSU included in the contract
and no assignment of UM or MSU employees for fulfillment of the contract.
3.   The pecuniary interest of Drs. Brewer and Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan in the contract
arises from their ownership of shares of Vetgen. This equity interest, as well as
the equity or other interest which may be provided to any other researcher at
the University who in the future contributes to this technology, will be in lieu of
participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University, in
accordance with standard University policy.
1993-94 Residence Hall and Family Housing Rates
Vice President Hartford announced that approval was being sought for a
rate increase of 4.6 percent for residence halls and 4.7 percent for family housing
apartments. She noted that the proposed increases had been recommended by
the Single Student and Family Housing Rate Study Committees.
Regent Brown moved approval of a rate increase of 4.6 percent for residence
halls and 4.7 percent for family housing apartments for the 1993-94 academic
year. Regent Waters seconded the motion.
In response to a question from Regent Deitch, Vice President Hartford
stated that although the opening date for the residence halls for the fall term had
not yet been determined, it will most likely be either the Thursday or Friday
prior to Labor Day. However, room and board fees will not be charged until the
traditional opening day, which is the Saturday prior to Labor Day. Some food
service will be available and students will pay for any meals eaten from the time
they move in until the first official day of food service begins on the following
Tuesday.
Regent Power commented that it was appropriate for the University to
withdraw a request for a residence hall fee increase that had been sought initially


252




February Meeting, 1993


because of an oversight on the part of the University in scheduling a football
game on the traditional move-in day.
Discussion then followed about orientation activities for new students. Vice
President Hartford reported that her office has been working with the provost's
office and the deans to plan a full week of welcome, in conjunction with a probable revision of the academic calendar. Full implementation of this plan would
occur in the fall of 1994. Regent Deitch observed that the first day of college is a
special day in the lives of both students and parents, as is the first football game.
President Duderstadt pointed out that the University is exceptional among
other universities in not starting the fall term before Labor Day, and that Provost Whitaker is exploring with deans and faculty the notion of changing the academic calendar to begin classes before Labor Day. He stated that the football
scheduling problem was created by the entry of Pennsylvania State University
into the Big Ten conference. Further discussion followed on the need for improved communication among the staff of all areas of the University in order to
prevent this type of problem from occurring in the future.
Regent Baker mentioned a letter Regents had received from housing staff
members that had raised concern about displays in certain residence halls in conjunction with Gay Pride Week. He asked for an examination of the issues raised
in this letter. President Duderstadt responded that this would be covered in an
upcoming Regents information session about student life.
Provost Whitaker observed that discussion of the academic calendar has
been underway for some time; the current calendar has been in place since 1962
and assumptions made at that time are no longer valid.
There being no further discussion, the vote was taken, and the motion to increase the 1993-94 room rates by 4.6 percent for residence halls and 4.7 percent
for family housing apartments was approved unanimously.
1993 Henry Russel Award
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved the appointment of Jessy W. Grizzle, associate professor
of electrical engineering and computer science, and John C. Mitani, assistant professor of anthropology, as recipients of the Henry Russel Award for 1993.
Implementation of the Regents' Policy on Research Grants and Contracts
Vice President Kelly submitted a report on implementation of the Regents'
Policy on Research Grants and Contracts for fiscal year 1992.
Changes in Bylaws, Rules, and Regulations of the Medical Staff
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved changes in the Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules, and Regulation as recommended by the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board.


253




February Meeting, 1993


May 1993 Regents' Meeting
The Regents unanimously approved a change in the date of the May 1993
Regents' Meeting from May 20-21 to May 6-7.
Medical Staff Appointments
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Brown, and on the recommendation of the University Hospitals Executive Board, the Regents unanimously approved several appointments to the medical staff.
Michigan Mandate Resolution
Regent Varner observed that a major portion the January meeting had been
devoted to a discussion of the Michigan Mandate, and moved approval of the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend the significant progress that has been made over the past five years toward achieving the goals of the Michigan Mandate. The Regents give this critical
effort their wholehearted support and encouragement, while at the same
time recognizing that much work remains to be done.
We, the Regents of the University of Michigan, therefore, pledge to
work diligently with the president and the rest of the University community to fulfill the vision of the Michigan Mandate in the years to come
Regent McFee seconded the motion, noting that it is very important for the
Regents to convey that they recognize the challenge involved in implementing
the Michigan Mandate and achieving a multicultural society.
Regents McGowan and Brown also expressed their support for the Michigan
Mandate and commended the president and officers for their leadership in putting it forth.
Regent Baker noted that while he supported the mandate, particularly the
part expanding opportunities for African-Americans, women, and others, he had
substantial disagreements with certain aspects of both the motion and the Mandate. He said that he intended to criticize both at appropriate times in the future,
and was not bound to unlimited support of either the motion or the program.
Further discussion ensued on the challenges posed by the Michigan Mandate. Regent Power observed that the change in the board's meeting format, with
the first day set aside for in-depth discussion of issues, will have a positive effect
on policy formulation.
Regent Baker stated that the resolution was premature. Regent Deitch responded that there can always be debates on tactics and implementation, but
that it was important to support the goal of the Mandate. Regent Waters stated


254




February Meeting, 1993


that he supports the Mandate and the efforts of the president, and pointed out
that actions speak louder than words.
Regent Baker reiterated that he did not want to be on record as supporting
every aspect of the Michigan Mandate. Following further discussion, Regent Baker attempted to read the letter from housing administrators that he had referred
to earlier. President Duderstadt and Regent Brown objected, stating that the letter was a different issue. Regent Baker responded that he disagreed, and that he
would read the letter at a future meeting.
The vote was then taken on the Michigan Mandate resolution and the motion was approved unanimously. Regent Baker stated that his vote was affirmative, but with the qualifications previously noted. He pointed out to the president
that not everyone in the campus community agreed with him on all issues, and
that he believed that most people on campus would not support the Mandate if a
vote were to be taken.
UM Hospitals Comparative Statistics Report
Vice President Womack introduced Mr. John Forsyth, executive director of
University of Michigan Hospitals. Mr. Forsyth gave a slide presentation that illustrated how UM Hospitals' financial position compares with that of other
teaching hospitals, AA-rated institutions, and all hospitals. He noted that in fiscal year 1992 the Hospitals were budgeted to lose about $7.8 million; instead they
gained $11.0 million. With prior year adjustments and non-operative income, the
Hospitals net income totalled $65,460,000, compared to a budget of about $14.0
million.
Mr. Forsyth reviewed figures on cost per case and displayed charts that illustrated comparative statistics regarding various measures of profitability, liquidity, capital structure, and patient activity. At the conclusion of his
presentation, Mr. Forsyth suggested that it would be worthwhile for the Board to
schedule an in-depth discussion on managed health care and the impact on the
Hospitals of changes taking place nationally in the area of health care. There followed some discussion about points raised in the report.
President Duderstadt then called on Provost Whitaker to comment about
the review of the Department of Population Planning and International Health
(PPIH).
Review of the Department of Population Planning and International
Health
Provost Whitaker noted that faculty and students in the Department of
Population Planning and International Health had demonstrated a great deal of
concern about the future of the department. He said that the dean had offered to
appear at Public Comments along with the faculty, but that he had counseled
against that. He pointed out that the procedures for program discontinuance, as
approved by the Regents in 1977 and amended in 1979 must be followed. Provost
Whitaker announced that the dean and executive committee of the School of
Public Health were going to reconsider placing a moratorium on admissions to

February Meeting, 1993


the Department of PPIH for the 1993 fall term, to ensure that the discussion will
be focused on issues of substance, rather than process.
Regent Baker stated that the board was sensitive to the concerns that have
been raised about this issue, both with regard to process and substance.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting will be held March 11 and 12, 1993. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses for the month of January 1993
totalled $1,693.04.

MARCH MEETING, 1993


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, March 11, 1993
The Regents met at 1:40 PM. in the Music Room, Henry Ford Estate-Fair
Lane, at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, and Varner. Vice
President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice Presidents Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones and Renick. Associate Vice
President Holbrook attended the meeting for Provost Whitaker, Regents Baker
and Waters were absent.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and thanked Chancellor
Renick for the opportunity to spend the day at the Dearborn Campus. He then
announced that Chancellor Jones would be stepping down from his position as
chancellor of UM-Flint on December 31, 1993, to resume his position on the faculty. He expressed the gratitude of the executive officers and Board of Regents
for the strong leadership Chancellor Jones has provided for the Flint campus.
There followed a round of applause.
Annual Report of Investments as of December 31, 1992
Vice President Womack introduced Ms. Elizabeth Hokada, associate investment officer, and Margaret Blakelock from Cambridge Associates, the University's investment consultant.
Ms. Hokada reported that the University had $1.7 billion in invested funds
as of December 31, 1992. The University Investment Pool (UIP), which is the investment pool for the working capital funds, totalled $883 million and yielded 6.2
percent. The University Endowment Fund (UEF), the next largest component of
the total invested funds, was valued at $684 million at the end of 1992, although
now it has surpassed $700 million. Regent Power pointed out that this is the
highest level the University Endowment Fund has ever reached.
Ms. Hokada pointed out that the long-term goal of the endowment fund is
to preserve the purchasing power of the endowment and of the distributions it
provides. Over the ten-year period ending December 31, 1992, 2.0 percentage
points per year in real value were added, with an average total return of 11.7 percent per year. The endowment fund returned 9.4 percent in 1992, compared with
the stock and bond indexes, which returned 7.6 percent. The domestic stock portfolio returned 13.6 percent and alternative fixed income investments returned
21.4 percent, while international stocks returned -6.5 percent.
The Donor Pooled Income Fund, an area of growth which has added 1.7
percent per year in ral value over the past ten years, returned 11.6 percent in
1992.


257




March Meeting, 1993


Ms. Hokada then turned to Ms. Blakelock to lead the discussion of investment strategy and investment performance.
Using a handout from Cambridge Associates, Ms. Blakelock gave an overview of the University's investment strategy, which is to have 70 percent of the
endowment in equities and 30 percent in fixed income investments. The strategy
includes diversification within the asset categories to reduce overall volatility and
increase return. Within the equity allocation, diversification has been accomplished by committing 10 percent to real estate, 5 percent to venture capital, and
5 percent to oil and gas investments. The domestic common stock portfolio is
hedged with the Common Fund Strategic Asset Allocation program.
Ms. Blakelock reviewed 1992 asset allocation and performance in more detail, and she and Vice President Womack responded to questions from the Regents. She then described the rationale and strategy for international equity
investing, and continued with a description of real estate investment vehicles and
strategies. In response to a question from Regent Power, Vice President Womack
described the difference between real estate investments and the University's
mortgage program for faculty and staff. This was followed by further discussion
about the status of the University's real estate investments.
Ms. Blakelock concluded her presentation by introducing the concept of an
energy hedge against future increases in natural gas prices. She described the
strategy options for such a hedge as long-term purchase agreements, purchase of
futures, and participation in a reserve acquisition program. Further discussion
ensued about the risks and benefits of participation in a reserve acquisition progranm
At the conclusion of the Report on Investments, the Regents turned to consideration of the regular business agenda

266




March Meeting, 1993


Martin G. Gold, professor of psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and research scientist in the Research Center for Group Dynamics, Institute for Social Research, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 1992.
Professor Gold received his AB. degree from Dartmouth College in 1953
and his M.A and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1955 and
1962, respectively. From 1953-61, he served as research assistant, teaching fellow, and then instructor in the Department of Psychology; he was appointed
study director at the Research Center for Group Dynamics in the Institute for
Social Research (ISR) in 1961. From 1962-65, he served as the training and program director at the University of Michigan Fresh Air Camp, assistant program
director at the Research Center for Group Dynamics, and assistant professor in
the Department of Psychology. He was promoted to program director (later
changed to research scientist) at ISR in 1965, associate professor of psychology in
1968, and professor in 1979.
Professor Gold made important scientific contributions to the scholarship
on adolescence, and in particular, on delinquency among adolescents. His national epidemiological studies establishing the incidence and prevalence of delinquency and documenting that delinquency cuts across social class groups are classics
in the field. Professor Gold's research on prevention and treatment of delinquency is also widely respected for its methodological and theoretical sophistication
and practical import.
In pursuing the social and cultural experiences that prevent delinquent behaviors, Professor Gold has noted the significance of schools. His work details the
influence and especially the critical impact of integrating less successful students
into school life. This work has affected the school reform movement as well as
the correctional system's treatment of delinquents.
Professor Gold has taught the core courses in social psychology and specialized seminars in adolescence and in delinquency. He was a devoted teacher, research mentor, and colleague in both the Department of Psychology and the
Institute for Social Research.
The Regents now salute this distinguished researcher and teacher for his
dedicated service by naming Martin G. Gold Professor Emeritus of Psychology.
Memorials
No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees

30-foot-wide easement along the southern boundary of the E /2 of the SE V4, Section 5, T47N, R2E, Sugar Island for a price of $500.
North Campus Roadway Improvement Program
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved proceeding immediately with Phase I of the North Campus roadway improvement program and with future phases as funding can be
identified.
Agreement between the University of Michigan and Aero Sport, Inc.
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, all six Regents
present unanimously approved the University's entering into an agreement with
Aero Sport, Inc. Because one of the shareholders in Aero Sport, Dr. Victor Katch,
is also a University employee, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance
with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Aero Sport, Inc.
2.  The agreement will provide reimbursement for 25 hours of use of University facilities, various supplies, computer time, and indirect cost at 32.5 percent. Dr.
Katch's salary will be cost-shared from his discretionary funds. The agreement
will be consistent with standard University research policies.
3.  Dr. Katch's stock ownership is his sole pecuniary interest in this project. He will
not be compensated outside of his University salary for these services.
Regental and Executive Officer Conflict of Interest Policy
Vice President Kennedy noted that the Regents had requested that the general counsel prepare a draft Regental and Executive Officer Conflict of Interest
Policy. Upon approval by the Regents, the policy would be incorporated into the


268




March Meeting, 1993


Regents' Bylaws, after following the procedure for amending Regents' Bylaws.
He called on General Counsel Elsa Cole to present the proposed policy.
Ms. Cole noted that the proposed policy is consistent with those in place at
other institutions, and with the model policy of the Association of Governing
Boards of Universities and Colleges. She reviewed specific points in the policy
and responded to questions.
Regent Power observed that this policy sets out an affirmative duty on the
part of the Regents or executive officers to disclose matters that might be considered conflicts. In response to a question from Regent Power, Ms. Cole stated that
this policy provides a much clearer guideline than state law about when a conflict
exists. This policy would supplement and clarify the state policy, and would not
be in conflict with it. Regent Power suggested that the University's policy should
state that it goes beyond current state statute and is controlling.
It was decided to delay consideration of the policy until Regent Power's suggestions had been incorporated.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Campus Bylaws
Chancellor Renick noted that revisions were the result of a two-year process
involving broad discussion on the Dearborn campus. In response to a question
from Regent Power, Professor John Devlin described the process that had been
undertaken by various faculty committees and policy-making bodies over a twoyear period that had resulted in the proposed revisions. On a motion by Regent
McGowan, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents unanimously approved revisions to the University of Michigan-Dearborn campus bylaws.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Deitch made the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(e) and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in
closed session on March 11, 1993, in the Music Room, Henry Ford
Estate-Fair Lane, at 3:15 PlM., for the purpose of consulting with our attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection with specific
pending litigation, and for considering material exempt from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. Such
exempt material consists of a written opinion from the Board's legal
counsel.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was adopted unanimously.
The Regents met in executive session from 3:15 PM. to 4:00 P.M., at which
time they reconvened for Public Comments.

Retirement Memoirs

voted unanimously to adopt the following retirement memoirs:
Thomas C. Adamson, Jr., professor of aerospace engineering, retired
from active faculty status on January 31, 1993, after an outstanding career as a
teacher and scholar.


280




April Meeting, 1993


Professor Adamson received his B.S. degree in aeronautical engineering
from Purdue University in 1949 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in 1950 and
1954, respectively, from the California Institute of Technology. He joined the
University of Michigan as an associate research engineer in the Engineering Research Institute in 1954 and was appointed lecturer in aeronautical engineering
in 1955. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1956, associate professor in
1957, and professor in 1961.
Professor Adamson's broad professional interests include fundamental aspects of high-speed aerodynamics, aircraft propulsion, and combustion, and he is
well-known for his work on detonation waves, transonic flows, and supersonic
jets. He has published widely and has given numerous presentations at other
universities and at professional meetings. His many doctoral students have
achieved distinguished careers in universities and research laboratories. In addition to his University service, Professor Adamson has been active in the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and has served on visiting
and review committees at other universities. One of the aerospace engineering
department's most popular teachers, Professor Adamson received the University's Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award in 1980. His achievements in research and education were further honored by his election as a fellow of the
American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics.
As chair of the Department of Aerospace Engineering from 1983-91, Professor Adamson was instrumental in attracting several highly-talented faculty members to the department. He also played a pivotal role in planning and fundraising
for the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Building. Throughout his career, Professor
Adamson has provided exceptional educational leadership and has always been
willing to share his time and effort on behalf of faculty, colleagues, and students.
His continuing commitment to the Department of Aerospace Engineering, the
College of Engineering, and the University of Michigan has been greatly appreciated.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his outstanding career by
naming Thomas C. Adamson, Jr., Professor Emeritus of Aerospace Engineering.
Marvin A. Brandwin, assistant professor of psychology in the Department of Psychiatry, Medical School, retired from active faculty status on July 31,
1992.
A native of New York City, Professor Brandwin received his AB. degree
from Brooklyn College in 1948. He then entered the University of Michigan,
where he received his A.M. degree in 1950 and his Ph.D. degree in 1965. From
1948-52, he served clinical internships at the Veterans Administration Medical
Centers in Detroit and Battle Creek. He also completed a clinical fellowship at
the Child Mental Hygiene Clinic of the Merrill-Palmer Institute in Detroit.
Professor Brandwin joined the University of Michigan staff as a lecturer in
psychology at the Extension Service in 1953 and was a teaching assistant in the
Department of Psychology in 1954-55. He served as a senior clinical psychologist
at the Veterans Readjustment Center at the University of Michigan Medical Center from 1953-62 and staff psychologist at the Neuropsychiatric Institute from
1963-68. He was appointed instructor in the Department of Psychiatry in 1965
and was promoted to assistant professor in 1968.


281




April Meeting, 1993


Professor Brandwin's primary expertise was in psychodiagnostic testing. He
served as psychological testing director for adult services from 1976-91 and also
provided sterling leadership as psychology training director for adult services
from 1982-91. For more than three decades, Professor Brandwin was involved in
the clinical supervision of psychology interns and psychiatric residents. He also
was instrumental in implementing the first outpatient continuing care clinic for
chronic psychiatric patients.
Professor Brandwin's devoted loyalty as a teacher-clinician has been recognized by legions of students during the past several decades, and he also contributed unselfishly to all administrative requests to aid the department. His
insightfulness, expertise, dedication, and support throughout his long tenure in
the department have been noteworthy.
The Regents now salute this distinguished member of the faculty for his
dedicated service by naming Marvin A Brandwin Assistant Professor Emetitus
of Psychology.
Memorial Statements
The Regents were informed of the death of Harry A Towsley, M.D., professor emeritus of pediatrics and communicable diseases and professor emeritus of
postgraduate medicine. Regent Baker commented on Dr. Towsley's distinguished
career and contributions to the University over many years of his life. President
Duderstadt noted the wise counsel he had received from Dr. Towsley throughout
his years in University administration. On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded
by Regent McGowan, the Regents unanimously approved adoption of the following memorial statement:
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness the death on March 31, 1993, of Harry A. Towsley, M.D., professor emeritus of pediatrics and communicable diseases and professor emeritus of
postgraduate medicine. Dr. Towsley spent his entire medical career at the University of Michigan, and his many contributions as a physician and teacher made
him a leading figure in patient care and medical education at the University and
throughout the state.
Dr. Towsley was heir to a vibrant family medical tradition, and he passed
this legacy of skill and dedication to the service of others on to his own children
and grandchildren. He was born in Midland on September 15, 1905, the son of
Dr. Frank A Towsley, physician and mayor of Midland, and Harriet Sias Towsley. After attending public schools in Midland, Dr. Towsley attended Kalamazoo
College and Michigan State University and completed the combined program
leading to the degree in medicine at the University of Michigan in 1931. In 1932,
he maried Margaret Grace Dow of Midland, a 1928 graduate of the University.
Dr. Towsley completed his medical internship and residency at the University of
Michigan. He joined the Medical School faculty as an instructor in 1934 and rose
to the rank of professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases in 1954. He was instrumental in establishing the extramural programs of
the Department of Postgraduate Medicine and became department chair in 1967.
He retired from both departments as professor emeritus in 1971.


282




April Meeting, 1993


During the Second World War, he served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps
from 1942-45, first as chief of the division of communicable diseases, with the
rank of major, in the 298th General Hospital in England and France, and then as
chief of laboratory services, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge.
In the best tradition of the medical educator, Dr. Towsley cherished concurrent ideals of enhancing the technical capabilities of physicians and making the
best medical service more widely available. In pursuit of those objectives, he led
campaigns for pediatric facilities and directed programs in postgraduate medical
training in Ann Arbor and throughout Michigan. The University's Towsley Center for Continuing Medical Education, financed through private sources, was designed, constructed, and opened under his leadership, and he worked closely with
his long-time friend Charles S. Mott in the establishment of the University's
Mott Children's Hospital. He was a pioneer in the use of radio and television in
the postgraduate training of practicing physicians, and was instrumental in establishing the University's association with residency training programs in community hospitals throughout the state. His foresight concerning the need for
primary care training in family practice led to the establishment of the family
practice residency program at the Mid-Michigan Regional Medical Center in Midland, the second oldest family practice program in the United States. A diplomate
of the American Board of Pediatrics since 1938, he served as president of the
American Academy of Pediatrics in 1964-65. He also served as president of the
Washtenaw County Medical Society (1948) and was a member of the governing
boards of the Michigan State Medical Society and the American Medical Association. He was president of both the Michigan Health Council and the Michigan
United Fund in 1967.
He served as vice chair of the board of governors of the Medical Center
Alumni Society (1962-67); a member of the board of directors of the Alumni Association (1966-69); and member (1962-83) and chair (1980-81) of the University
Development Council. As a faculty member, he served on the Board in Control of
Student Publications (1959-64); the Senate Advisory Committee on University
Affairs (1959-62); the University Committee on Broadcasting (1954-71); and the
Committee on Honorary Degrees (1960-63); he also took part in major faculty
councils at the medical center. The Harry A. Towsley Visiting Professorship in
Postgraduate Medicine was established at the time of his retirement in 1971 by
contributions from friends and colleagues in Ann Arbor and from faculty and
staff in university-affiliated hospitals and others in Michigan and across the
country.
Dr. Towsley's work on behalf of the University and the people of Michigan
continued long after his retirement in 1971. Under his direction from its establishment in 1960, the Hanry A and Margaret D. Towsley Foundation supported
innovative and highly effective programs in medicine, public health, education,
performing arts, and community services in the Ann Arbor area. In 1972, he
chaired the campaign for the Furstenberg Student Study Center at the Medical
School, and he generously assisted St Joseph Mercy Hospital (now the Catherine
McAuley Health Center) in establishing its continuing education center. In 1977,
with personal gifts and gifts from the Harty A and Margaret D. Towsley
Foundation, he helped establish an interdisciplinary program in the prevention


283




April Meeting, 1993


of child abuse in the University's Schools of Social Work, Law, and Medicine. He
also provided key leadership in bringing the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library
to the University of Michigan and in funding major facilities in the College of Engineering, the School of Business Administration, and the School of Music.
Dr. Towsley was recipient of the Founder's Award of the Michigan United
Fund (1969); the Michigan Health Council Hall of Fame Award (1970); the Special Community Services Award of the Michigan Public Health Association
(1974); the Book of Good Deeds Award of the Ann Arbor Echange Club (1975);
the University of Michigan Presidential Societies Leadership Award (1987); and
the Eugene B. Power Annual Service Award of the United Negro College Fund
(1991). He was awarded honorary Doctor of Science degrees by Siena Heights
College in 1975 and by Adrian College in 1989. He also served on the boards of
directors of Gerber Products Company from 1970-76 and the Ann Arbor Trust
Company (now Society Bank, N.A) from 1958-77.
By his devotion to the highest ideals of his profession and his tireless efforts
on behalf of the people of the state of Michigan, Harry A Towsley brought great
honor to the University as a graduate and a faculty member. His innovations in
residency and postgraduate training strengthened medical education at Michigan, and his generous leadership benefited many other programs throughout the
University. As we mourn the loss of this great physician, teacher, and humanitarian, our heartfelt condolences go to his wife, Margaret Dow Towsley; his
daughters, Margaret Ann Riecker of Midland, Judith Dow Alexander of Ann Arbor, and Susan T. Wyland and Lynn T. White, both of McLean, Virginia; and his
several grandchildren and great grandchildren.

On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved the final degree list for the December 1992 Law School
commencement, the tentative doctoral degree list for the May 1993 commencement of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, and certain specified changes to previously approved degree lists.

McFee, the Regents unanimously approved the following individuals to receive
honorary degrees: Albina du Boisrouvray, president, Association Frangois Xavier
Bagnoud; Hillary Rodham Clinton, first lady of the United States; and Margaret
Dow Towsley, humanitarian and philanthropist.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Bonds of the Issuer to be designated HOUSING REVENUE BONDS, SERIES 1993A in the original aggregate
principal amount to be determined by an Authorized Officer, but not to exceed $25,000,000, to be
dated as of a date to be determined by an Authorized Officer, for the purpose of providing funds
to pay part of the cost of the Project, to refund the Refunded Bonds, to fund a debt service reserve
fund for the Bonds in an amount, if any, to be determined by an Authorized Officer and to pay
costs incidental to the issuance of the Bonds. The Bonds may be serial bonds or term Bonds subject to redemption requirements, or both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but
the first maturity shall be not earlier than July 1, 1993 and the last maturity shall be no later
than December 31, 2021. The Bonds may bear no interest or interest at stated rates for the respective maturities thereof as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the highest rate
of interest for any maturity shall not exceed 7% per annum. The Bonds may be issued in whole
or in part as capital appreciation bonds, which for their term or any part thereof bear no interest
but appreciate in principal amount over time at compounded rates (not in excess of 7% per annum) to be determined by an Authorized Officer. The Bonds may be made noncallable or subject
to redemption prior to maturity at the times and prices and in the manner as shall be established
by an Authorized Officer, but the maximum redemption premium shall not exceed 5% of the
principal being redeemed. Interest on the Bonds, if any, shall be payable semiannually on the
dates to be determined by an Authorized Officer. The maximum annual principal and interest requirements on the Bonds shall not exceed $3,000,000. The Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form in denominations, shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be executed and
authenticated, all as shall be provided in the Indenture. The Bonds shall be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement for a price to be established by an Authorized
Officer (but the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of original issue discount, shall not exceed 0.8%
of the principal amount of the Bonds), plus accrued interest, if any, from the dated date of the
Bonds to the date of delivery thereof.
2. The Bonds shall be limited and not general obligations of the Issuer payable from and
equally and ratably secured by an irrevocable pledge of the Net Revenues (as shall be defined in
the Indenture) of the University's Housing System (as shall be described and defined in the Indenture) and moneys from time to time on deposit in certain of the funds created pursuant to the
Indenture, as shall be specified in the Indenture. The lien created by an Indenture on the portion
of the Net Revenues previously pledged for debt service on the Prior Bonds shall be subordinated
to the liens thereon securing the Prior Bonds until the respective related issues of the Prior
Bonds are defeased or paid. The Authorized Officers, or either of them, are authorized, if appropriate to renegotiate the security for any of the Prior Bonds listed on Exhibit A, to place it on
a parity with the Bonds authorized hereby. Except as provided in the Indenture, no recourse
shall be had for the payment of the principal amount of or interest or premium on the Bonds or
any claim based thereon against the State of Michigan, the Issuer or any officer or agent thereof
or of the University, as individuals, either directly or indirectly, nor shall the Bonds and interest
with respect thereto become a lien on or be secured by any property, real, personal or mixed of
the State of Michigan, the Issuer, or the University, other than the Net Revenues and the moneys
from time to time on deposit in the specified funds created by the Indenture.


286




April Meeting, 1993


3. The right is reserved to issue additional bonds, notes or other obligations payable from
Net Revenues or secured on a parity basis with the Bonds from the Net Revenues, upon compliance with the terms and conditions to be set forth in the Indenture.
4. The Authorized Officers or either of them, and the Treasurer and Investment Officer of
the University are hereby authorized and directed, in the name and on behalf of the Issuer and as
its corporate act and deed, to select a trustee and to prepare, negotiate, execute and deliver the
Indenture, in the form as an Authorized Officer shall approve upon recommendation of legal

April Meeting, 1993


Pack ard Haar, Willow Run Airport
Vice President Womack reported that Wayne County had submitted an offer to purchase Packard Hangar at Willow Run Airport, according to the terms
described in the Regents Communication. Regent Deitch moved that the University accept Wayne County's offer of $1.7 million for purchase of the Packard
Hangar, Willow Run Airport, subject to the terms outlined in the Regents Communication. Regent McGowan seconded the motion.
Regent Baker observed that when the airport was sold to Wayne County, he
had requested that an access clause be included for the Packard Hangar. He said
that it was churlish on the part of the Board to not be more fair-minded in this
matter.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
East Engineering Building Renovation
Regent McGowan made the following motion with respect to the East Engineering Building renovation project: approval of the project budget, authorization of soliciting bids, and awarding of a construction contract to the successfil
bidder, providing the contract values are within the approved budget. Regent
McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Michigan Stadium Renovation
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved proceeding with Phase III of the Michigan Stadium renovation, as described in the Regents Communication.
There followed some discussion about funding of capital facilities at the University. Vice President Womack observed that since the establishment of the infrastructure fee two years ago, a plan has been developed to attend to the
University's infrastructure maintenance needs. He noted that the ability to dedicate a fixed amount of money for the renovation of general fund facilities represents a very important landmark for the University.
Regent Power observed that this type of prudent management is extremely
important for the University, because in its absence, the cost of unattended-to
maintenance could reach insurmountable proportions, as it has in many other
institutions. Further discussion ensued on the importance of preventive maintenance for capital facilities.
State-Funded Capital Projects
Vice President Womack reported that the proposed capital outlay bill includes funding for projects totaling $89.5 million for the University of Michigan,
final authorization for which is contingent on final approval by the legislature
and the governor. These projects include the Integrated Technology Instruction
Center/College of Engineering Center ($57 million) and Central Campus renovations for the C.C. Little Building ($16.5 million) and Angell Hall ($16 million).


294




April Meeting, 1993


Regent Deitch moved to authorize proceeding with the projects as previously approved by the Regents, and for the Angell Hall project, appointment of Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. as the architect and authorization to initiate the
design process. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
UM-Flint Central Energy Plant Utility Distribution System Expansion
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously authorized award of a construction contract to the low bidder,
Spence Brothers, for construction of the UM-Flint Central Energy Plant Utility
Distribution System Expansion Project.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects: 1) West Medical Tunnel piping expansion joint replacement and support repairs; 2) Dana Building
renovations; 3) Kelsey Museum renovations; 4) Medical Science II Phase I
remodeling for the Department of Microbiology and Immunology; 5) Hutchins
Hall renovation of Classroom 132; and 6) Clements Library elevator installation.
UM Hospitals Radiology CT Scanner Equipment Upgrade
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved submission of a Certificate of Need application to the
Michigan Department of Public Health to upgrade a Radiology CT scanner and
purchase the equipment contingent upon Certificate of Need approval
Venture Capital Investment
Regent McGowan moved that $10 million of the University Endowment
Fund be committed to Endowment Venture Partners II, L.P. and that $2 million
of the University Endowment Fund be committed to Accel Partners IV, L.P.,
pending the general counsel's review of the partnership documents for legal acceptability.
Agreement between the University of Michigan and Science and Environmental Education-NORTH (SEE-NORTH)
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Varner, all six Regents
present unanimously approved authorization for the University to enter into a
subcontract with SEE-NORTH, a nonprofit organization. Because the executive
director of SEE-NORTH, Dr. Mary J. Whitmore, is also an employee of the University of Michigan, this arrangement falls under the terms of the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  The parties to the agreement will be the Regents of the University of Michigan
and Science and Environmental Education-NORTH (SEE-NORTH).


295

consistent with their fduciary responsibilities to the University and shall exercise particudar care that no detriment to the University results from conflicts between their interests and those of the University. If a Regent or an excutive/senior officer believes
that he or she may have a conflict of interest, the Regent or executive/senior officer shall
promptly and fully disclose the conflict to the secretary of the Board of Regents and
shall refrain from participating in any way in the matter to which the conflict relates
until the conflict question has been resolved. The minutes of a Regents' meeting where
a disclosure of a conflict or possible conflict of interest is made shall reflect the disclo
sure and that the Regent or  ecutive/senior officer having such abstained from participation in the matter.
A Regent or eecutive/senior officer is considered to have a conflict of interest
when the Regent or executive/senior officer or any of his or her family or associates, either (i) has an existing or potential financial or other interest which impairs or might
appear to impair the Regent's or executive/senior officer's independence ofjudgment in
the discharge of responsibilities to the University, or (ii) may receive a material, financial, or other benefit from knowledge of information confidential to the University. The
"Family" of a Regent or executive/senior officer includes his or her spouse, parents, siblings, children, and, if living in the same household and sharing expenses, other individuals. An "Associate" of a Regent or excutive/senior officer includes any person,
trust, organization, or enterprise of, in or with which the individual or any member of
his or her Family (i) is a director, officer, employee, member, partner, or trustee; or (ii)
has a financial interest that represents 5% or more of his or her assets or any interest
that enables him or her, acting alone or in conjunction with others, to exercise control
or to influence policy significantly, or (iii) has any other material association.
The secretary shall consult with the president and general counsel regarding all
conflict questions of which the secretary is informed and shall report regularly to the
Board of Regents regarding any unresolved conflict questions. This policy statement is
to be interpreted and applied in a manner that will best serve the interests of the
University. In some cases, it may be determined that after full disclosure to those concerned, the University's interests are best served by participation by the Regent or
executive/senio r offer despite the conflict. The University will assist the Board in
determining if such proposed participation violates the state conflict of interest laws.
This policy is in addition to any obligations imposed on a Regent or executive/senior officer by the state conflict of interest laws, PA 1968, Nos. 317 and 318, as
amended.
The secretary shall distribute annually a copy of this policy statement to each Regent and executive/senior officer.
Regent Baker observed that since he joined the Board of Regents 20 years
ago, there has been a loss of spirit, and the University has become less open than
it is now. He believes this is due to the ongoing codifying of people's duties and
responsibilities, and in that regard, he doesn't see a need for a conflict of interest
policy. He then made three suggestions for the proposed policy: 1) in the second
paragraph, number ii, he suggested that a "5 % or more" financial interest be replaced with "any" financial interest; 2) in the second paragraph, number iii, "has
any other material association," add the words, "of which the Regent or executive
officer has knowledge;" and 3) add a phrase stating that upon any Regent's or executive officer's request, a written opinion on the conflict of interest or apparent
conflict of interest will be provided.
General Counsel Cole responded that the 5 percent interest was included so
that a very slight interest would not prohibit the person's ability to participate.
Regent Baker stated that any interest should be disclosed. Regarding points two


298




April Meeting, 1993


and three, Ms. Cole stated she would not object to adding those points, as this
would be the standard procedure in any case.
There followed a discussion about the pros and cons of the "5% or more"
clause. Regent Power noted that deleting this would obligate Regents to disclose
their holdings of all public stock in any corporation that might have any dealing
with the University, and he doubted that this is the intent of the policy.
Regarding the need for the policy, Regent Deitch observed that it is a codification of the tradition of self-disclosure and good judgment that the Board and
the executive officers have adhered to in the past. He also noted that including
the 5% statement would not preclude anyone from making a more complete disclosure. He expressed agreement with Regent Baker's other two points.
Ms. Cole reported that the "5% or more" language is standard for this type
of policy, and further discussion ensued on this topic. Vice President Womack
pointed out that one is obliged to report what one believes puts you at risk. The
question is whether or not there is some deminimus number that requires one to
disclose; whether you ought to disclose it is not an issue in the policy.
Regent McFee suggested that the general counsel review the wording vis a
vis the issue of stock trading and the type of reporting that it would require, the
issue being whether the amount of one's holdings would be significant enough to
have an impact on one's vote.
Regent Deitch reiterated that the basis of the policy is self-disclosure, and
there is nothing that prevents anyone from disclosing everything. However, the 5
percent rule is a benchmark, and gives counsel something on which to base an
assessment. Ms. Cole pointed out that the term refers not to ownership of 5
percent of a company's stock, but whether one's shares in a company represent
greater than 5 percent of his or her total assets.
Following further discussion about the desire to avoid burdensome reporting requirements for trading of stock, Ms. Cole noted that this is not a "disclosure of assets" conflict of interest policy. It comes into play only as an agenda
item comes to the Board that involves an outside entity in which there might be a
conflict of interest. It does not impose an additional burden to what has been the
existing practice.
Regent Baker observed that he was still troubled by the "5 percent" requirement. Regent Deitch pointed out that the phrase "of which you have knowledge"
would address Regent Baker's objections.
President Duderstadt noted that all appear to be in agreement with Regent
Baker's suggestions to add the phrase "of which the Regent and executive officer
has knowledge" and adding a phrase requiring a written opinion of a conflict situation, and that the general consensus is that the "5 percent" benchmark is appropriate.
Regent Deitch moved that the proposed Bylaw 1.14 be adopted with instruction to counsel to add a phrase addressing the Regent's and executive officer's


299




April Meeting, 1993


knowledge of material association, and to add a phrase requiring the general
counsel to give a written opinion whenever requested by a Regent or executive
officer.
Regent Baker suggested amending the motion that the "5 percent" term be
included in the bylaw for a year and be examined after that time. Regent Deitch
did not accept that amendment, noting that a bylaw can be amended at any time.
Regent Power seconded Regent Deitch's motion. The vote was then taken, and
the motion to adopt the bylaw subject to the two modifications was approved
unanimously.
Regent Baker observed that that he intended to bring up the issue again in
a year or so for reexamination.
Revision to Regents' Bylaw Section 12.05 (Bentley Historical Library)
Provost Whitaker reported that the intent of the bylaw revision is to reflect
the current activities of the Bentley Historical Library and to codify the fact that
this library is the official repository for the University's records.
Regent Baker moved approval of the proposed revisions to Regents Bylaw
Section 12.05. Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was adopted unanimously. The text of the revised bylaw is as follows:
Sec. 12.056  Bentle Historical Librar
The Bentley Historical Library shall be organized as one administrative unit to
include the Michigan Historical Collections and the University Archives and Records
Program. The Michigan Historical Collections shall be maintained for the purpose of
collecting, preserving, and making available manuscripts and other materials pertainin to the state, its institutions, and its social, economic, and intellectual development.
The University Archives and Records Progrmn shall be maintained to o, preserve,
and make available the record generated by the University in the condu  of its business. The Bentley Library shall be in the charge of a director, responsible to the provst
and vice president for academic affairs, who shall be appointed by the Board on nomination by the president.
The director shall be assisted by an executive committee, charged with the formulation of policies in matters in relation to the budget, promotions, appointments, the
collections, publications, and other activities.
The xcecutive committee shall consist of five members, who shall be appointed by
the Board, upon recommendation by the president, for terms of five years, the terms to
be so adjusted that one vacancy will occur each year.
Medical Staff Appointments
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Varner, and on the recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board, the Regents unanimously approved several appointments to medical staff membership.
Resolution in Honor of 1992-93 Michigan Wolverines Basketball Team
Regent McFee made the following motion:


300




April Meeting, 1993


Resents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan take great pride in being
the only university governing board in the nation this year to be able to
adopt back-to-back resolutions commending the men's basketball team
and its coaches for their second consecutive participation in the NCAA
Final Four basketball championship.
The astounding performance of this group of young men last year
was an inspiration to the thousands of Michigan alumni and fans everywhere. That accomplishment, however, led to an expectation that they
could surely do it again this year, a feat rarely accomplished in collegiate athletics.
But repeat they did with an almost uncanny series of thrilling victories that matched or even surpassed their success of the previous year.
The Regents salute the 1992/93 men's basketball team, its coaches,
and all in the athletic department who supported this splendid season.
Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it was approved by acclamation.
Conflict of Interest
Regent Baker declared that he had a conflict of interest, in that he has government bonds and treasury bonds that exceed 5 percent of his investments.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting will be held on May 6 and 7, 1993. Regents' travel, accommodation, telephone, and other expenses for the month of March 1993 totalled $1,193.07.

Accusations against Professor David Goldberg. Regent Baker raised
the issue of accusations of racial and sexual harassment that have been made by
some students in his Sociology 510 class (statistics) regarding Professor Goldberg. Regent Baker noted that he does not know Professor Goldberg, but had
been apprised of the charges, his responses to them, and the response by the Department of Sociology, by an independent party.
Regent Baker observed that Professor Goldberg is known to be a confrontational, aggressive teacher who challenges his students and makes them think.
Regent Baker believes that the charges have more to do with his teaching style,
rather than his actually being a racist or a sexual harasser. After the charges
were made, the department's initial response was to remove Professor Goldberg
from teaching Sociology 510; it was later decided to add another section of the
class, so that one would be taught by Professor Goldberg, and the other to be
taught by someone else.
Regent Baker pointed out that the issue in this case, as noted by Professor
Carl Cohen in a letter published in the University Record, is the development of
an atmosphere at the University that tends to inhibit teachers in their classrooms. He believes that there ought to be a mechanism that protects professors


316




May Meeting, 1993


in such instances, as neither the department, the College of LS&A, nor the administration came to Professor Goldberg's defense. Regent Baker noted that
there is a chance that he did not merit defending, but that did not seem to be the
case. He concluded that University professors' careers should not be damaged
due to untrue accusations that have been made against them.
Provost Whitaker responded that this was the first time Professor Goldberg
had taught this class in several years, and that although concerns had been
raised in the anonymous letter, other concerns had been raised earlier about the
quality of his teaching. He noted that the department had tried to be sensitive to
both the academic freedom issues and the quality of the teaching for the students, as the course in question is a required course for sociology graduate students. Professor Goldberg did complete the term teaching the course, and two
sections will be offered next year. He stated that the issue had been dealt with at
the departmental level, and that although he had read all of the material and had
been apprised of all of the actions associated with it, he had not talked directly to
either Professor Goldberg or the department chair.
Regent Baker responded that once such accusations are raised, the damage
to the individual has been done, whether or not the accusations end up being
true. He noted that there ought to be a mechanism that will set the record
straight.
Regent Power observed that it would be helpful if the issues raised by this
incident could be presented as a policy discussion. He noted that he had been approached by two senior faculty members at the University who had expressed
sadness at the University's unwillingness to support and sustain faculty members who had been the subject of certain kinds of accusations. Regent Power
stated that the incident described by Regent Baker raises a legitimate policy
question that deserves some scrutiny. He requested that the materials surrounding this incident be assembled for the purposes of framing a discussion of the
larger policy issues associated with the questions it raises.
Provost Whitaker noted that the Senate Assembly was currently wrestling
with academic freedom concerns in the context of the harassment policy. Following further comments, it was agreed that a discussion would be planned along
the lines suggested by Regent Power and Regent Baker.

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
voted unanimously to adopt the following retirement memoirs:
Alan G. Billings, professor of theatre in the School of Music, will retire
from active faculty status on May 31, 1993.
Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Professor Billings was educated at the University
of Georgia (B.F.A, 1955), Carnegie-Mellon University (M.F.A, 1958), and the
University of Illinois (PLhD., 1967). He taught at the University of Louisville
from  1958-60, the University of Delaware from    1960-63, and the University of
Illinois from  1963-66 before joining the University of Michigan faculty as a
lecturer in 1966. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1967, associate professor in 1970, and professor in 1976. During 1990, he served as interim chair of
the Department of Theatre.
Professor Billings has been the designer for more than 150 staged productions both in connection with his academic appointment and for regional opera
and theater companies. He has also served as a theater consultant in the restoration of theaters and opera houses in Michigan, Ohio, and South Carolina. The
author of several articles, book chapters, and reviews, Professor Billings has also


318




May Meeting, 1993


presented papers for the American Theater Association and the Association for
Theater in Higher Education. He is a member of the Association for Theater in
Higher Education and of the United States Institute for Theater Technology.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Alan G. Billings
Professor Emeritus of Theatre.
Joseph L. Blotner, professor of English, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1993, after a highly productive career as scholar and teacher.
A native of New Jersey, Joseph Blotner received his B.A degree from Drew
University, his M.A degree from Northwestern University, and his PhD. degree
from the University of Pennsylvania After his first two years at an undergraduate at Drew, he served in the United States Air Corps from 1943-45, rising to the
rank of Second Lieutenant in the Eighth Air Force. He taught at the University
of Pennsylvania, the University of Idaho, the University of Virginia, and North
Carolina at Chapel Hill before joining the faculty of the University of Michigan as
professor of English in 1972. During his tenure at Michigan, Professor Blotner
was a senior fellow in the Michigan Society of Fellows from 1979-83. He received
the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award in 1990. He has also received
many honors and awards outside the University, including two Guggenheims
and grants or fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the
American Council of Learned Societies, and the Rockefeller Foundation. He was
appointed the First William Faulkner Lecturer at the University of Mississippi in
1977. He has been a Fulbright Lecturer in American Literature at the University
of Copenhagen, and visiting professor at the University of Arizona and the University of Rome.
Professor Blotner has published widely as a critic, biographer, and editor.
He is known all over the world as the authorized biographer of William Faulkner. He has lectured widely in the United States and Europe on Faulkner's life
and writings, as well as on other topics in American literature. His landmark biography of Faulkner was published by Random House in 1974 and published
again in a revised and condensed version in 1985. Blotner has also been a leading
editor of Faulkner's writings. He has edited Faulkner's letters, poems, manuscripts, and uncollected stories and is the general editor for Faulkner's novels in
the Library of American Literature. In addition, he has written books on the fiction of J. D. Salinger (1959) and on the modern American political novel (1966).
Currently, he is engaged in preparing and writing a biography of Robert Penn
Warren. Before his death in 1989, Warren made Joseph Blotner his authorized
biographer and gave him full access to his papers and correspondence. The biography is scheduled for publication by Random House in December 1993.
Professor Blotner has guided the work of many graduate students in American literature and is known for the scrupulous precision of his teaching of undergraduates, especially in lecture courses on such subjects as the American novel

Janice A. Clark, associate professor of music (music education) in the
School of Music and lecturer in education in the School of Education, retired
from active faculty status on May 31, 1993.
Professor Clark was born and raised in Canton, Ohio, where she was active
in public school music programs. She continued her studies at Westminster
Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey, where she graduated with a B.M. degree
in 1951. She taught music at the Charles Ellis School for Girls in Pennsylvania
from 1951-54; concurrently, she served as the organist-choir director at Marple

she received the M.Mus. degree in 1956. In 1955, she began an association with
the Dixboro Methodist Church as organist (later director of music) that extends
to the present. Following completion of her graduate studies, Professor Clark became a consultant in elementary vocal music for the Livonia Public Schools. She
was appointed to the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer (music education) in 1958, was promoted to assistant professor in 1962, and to associate professor in 1969.
An active participant in music educators' associations at state and national
levels, Professor Clark has been especially energetic as a traveler to International
Society of Music Education meetings in Perth (1974), Montreux (1976), Warsaw
(1980), and Bristol (1982).
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Janice A. Clark Associate Professor Emeritus of Music.
Gwendolyn S. Cruzat, professor of information and library studies in the

Dorothy Donabedian, professor of nursing, will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 1993, following 27 years of service to the University of Michigan.
A native of Beirut, Lebanon, Professor Donabedian earned her B.S.N. degree from the American University of Beirut in 1943, her M.S.N. degree from
Boston University in 1955, and her M.P.H. degree from the University of Michigan in 1966. She joined the University of Michigan School of Nursing faculty as
an instructor in 1966, and was promoted to assistant professor in 1969, associate
professor in 1972, and professor in 1977.
Early in her tenure, Professor Donabedian identified three areas of need in
the school's instructional programs: utilization of computer-assisted learning
technologies; development of a freestanding nursing practice to provide
community-based educational experiences for undergraduate students; and incorporation of material on the health and welfare systems into the curricula
Over the next two decades, she focused on achieving each of these visionary
goals.
Well before computers became common in the classroom, Professor Donabedian developed two computer exercises for undergraduate nursing students. Regarded as a significant advance in nursing education, her work was published in
a now-classic article in Nursing Outlook, and over 50 copies of the computer
exercises have been sold.
In 1973, Professor Donabedian initiated an unconventional setting for the
practice of community health nursing. Having provided clinical learning experiences for over 300 senior nursing students, this program is recognized nationally
as an excellent teahing-learning model for nursing students. This work was
published and continues to be cited as an exemplar for nontraditional approaches
to undergraduate nursing education. Professor Donabedian also developed a
module on the health and welfare systems that continues to be used in the instruction of students at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University.
Each of these innovations has provided the faculty with a vision of what is possible.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Dorothy Donabedian Professor Emeritus of Nursing.

Frances A. arkin, associate professor of nutrition in the Department of
Community Health Programs, School of Public Health, will retire from active
faculty status on May 31, 1993.
After receiving her B.S. degree from The Ohio State University in 1952, Professor Larkin worked as a dietitian at Duke University from 1952-54 and at St.
Luke's Hospital in Cleveland from 1954-56. She was a fellow at the Mayo Clinic
from 1956-57, and then went to the University of Minnesota, where she received
her M.S. degree in 1958. She served as an assistant professor at California State
College in Long Beach from 1958-61 and as an advisor to the College of Home
Economics in Dacca, East Pakistan, from 1961-64. After completing her Ph.D.
degree at Cornell University in 1968, Professor Larkin joined the faculty of the
University of Michigan as an assistant professor of nutrition. She was promoted
to associate professor in 1972.
Professor Larkin's professional career was notable for her service in developing countries, which reflected her constant concern for food adequacy in the
Third World. She has conducted surveys among groups at nutritional risk in
Central America, Bangladesh, Nepal, and in several African countries, including
Ghana, which was the site of her doctoral dissertation research.
Professor Larkin served as director of the Human Nutrition Program in the
School of Public Health for two years, and as assistant dean for curriculum for
eight years. Active in her field, she has chaired the Faculties of Graduate Programs in Public Health Nutrition and the nutrition section of the Michigan Public Health Association, and served as editor of the Journal of the American
Dietetic Association. Professor Larkin's expertise in methods of measuring dietary intake made her a valuable team member for a number of diet-related research studies. Her ability to complete her tasks on time, her expertise in getting
along with other people, and her willingness to collaborate in a team setting
made Professor Larkin a popular member of several research teams in major studies throughout her career. An excellent teacher, Professor Larkin was very popular among her students, always managing to find time for individual
consultation when needed.
In recognition of her dedicated service, the Regents now salute this faculty
member by naming Frances A Larkin Associate Professor Emeritus of Nutrition.
Lorraine Nadelman, associate professor of psychology, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1993.
Professor Nadelman received her B.A and Ph.D. degrees in psychology from
New York University in 1945 and 1953, respectively. From 1951-55, she served
as an assistant professor at Mount Holyoke College. In 1963, she joined the faculty at the University of Michigan as a lecturer and was promoted to associate professor in 1969.
Professor Nadelman has been in the field some four decades. She has been a
devoted and strikingly successful undergraduate teacher, both in a small liberal
arts college and here in a larger research university context. Whether in large lecture courses or in multi-section hands-on advanced laboratory sections, she has
truly been a "master teacher": utterly dedicated, energetic, handsomely organized, innovative, and endlessly capable of individualizing instruction. She has


322




May Meeting, 1993


inspired scores of students on to careers in psychology. Especially noteworthy is
the sharing of her teaching expertise in her widely respected book Research
Manual in Child Development, and while less visible, there are a substantial
number of graduate students whose later research focus on siblings was derived
from Professor Nadelman's earlier work and graduate program.
The department and the college are especially indebted to her for the years
of stellar performance at every level of service. Lorraine Nadelman has been the
prototypical good citizen playing an active role in numerous area, departmental,
college, and University committees. She has also acted as a representative of
serious developmental psychology and as its ambassador to other units of the
University and to the local community. Multiple pages could be filled with the list
of schools, daycare centers, religious groups, camps, dubs, service organizations,
museums, senior citizens groups, and PTOs in Ann Arbor and surrounding communities to whom she has given freely of her time and energies.
The Regents now salute this devoted teacher and scholar for her dedicated
service to the department, the University, and the community by naming Lorraine Nadelman Associate Professor Emeritus of Psychology.
Roy Pierce, professor of political science in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and faculty associate in the Center for Political Studies, will
retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1993, after a career at the University
of Michigan that has lasted for 37 years.
Born in New York City, Professor Pierce earned his B.A, M.A, and Ph.D.
degrees in 1947, 1948, and 1950, respectively, from Cornell University. He interrupted his graduate training to serve as an auditor at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris in 1949. Before joining the Michigan faculty, he taught at Smith
College. From 1952-53, he served as director for the Junior Year in International
Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. He has had visiting appointments in France as a
Fulbright Lecturer in Nice, at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales
in Paris, and has been a visitor at the University of Oslo, Norway.
Professor Pierce has made important contributions to our understanding of
comparative politics across a range of topics from French political theorists to
French political institutions to the spatial location of parties and electorates on
the Left-Right dimension. His landmark analysis of representation in France,
Political Representation in France, co-authored with Phil Converse, won the
Woodrow Wilson prize in 1987. This is the discipline's top prize. The work delves
deeply into the political orientations of mass publics and political elites, as well as
the linkages between them. He has published widely in the major political science
journals on elections and public opinion France.
Professor Pierce has trained a large number of scholars in the area of Western European and comparative politics and has served graduate students well
and often as director of graduate studies and placement officer in the Department of Political Science. He has been a devoted and engaged teacher of undergraduates.
The Regents now salute this distinguished political scientist for his dedicated service by naming Roy Pierce Professor Emeritus of Political Science.

Regents' Bylaw Section 1.14 (Regental and Executive/Senior Officer
Conflict of Interest Policy)
The Regents received the final version of the Regental and Executive/Senior
Officer Conflict of Interest Policy, which incorporates changes suggested when
the policy was adopted at the April 1993 meeting. The bylaw text is as follows:
Sec. 1.14.  Regntal and Executive/Senio       r      er Conflict of Interest Policy
Regents and executive officers of the University of Michigan, and the senior
officers of the University at Dearborn and at Flint, shall at all times act in a manner
consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities to the University and shall exercise particular care that no detriment to the University results from conflicts between their interests and those of the University. If a Regent or an excutive/senior officer believes
that he or she may have a conflict of interest, the Regent or executive/senior officer shall
promptly and fully disclose the conflict to the secretary of the Board of Regents and
shall refrain from participating in any way in the matter to which the conflict relates
until the conflict question has been resolved. The minutes of a Regents' meeting where
a disclosure of conflict or possible conflict of interest is made shall reflect the disclosure
and that the Regent or executive/senior officer having such abstained from participation in the matter.
A Regent or executive/senior officer is considered to have a conflict of interest
when the Regent or executive/senior officer or any of his or her family or associates, either (i) has an existing or potential financial or other interest which impairs or might
appear to impair the Regent's or executive/senior officer's independence ofjudgment in
the discharge of responsibilities to the University, or (ii) may receive a material, financial, or other benefit from knowledge of information confidential to the University. The
'family' of a Regent or executive/senior officer includes his or her spouse, parents, siblings, children and, if living in the same household and sharing expenses, other individuals. An "associate of a Regent or executive/senior officer includes any person,
trust, organization, or enterprise in or with which the Regent or executive/senior officer
has knowledge that he or se or any member of his or her family (i) is a director, officer, employee, member, partner, or trustee, or (ii) has a financial interest that represents 5% or more of his or her assets or any interest that enables him or her, acting
alone or in conjunction with others, to exercise control or to influence policy significantly, or (iii) has any other material association.
The secretary shall consult with the president and general counsel regarding all
conflict questions of which the secretary is informed  shall report regularly to the
Board of Regents regarding any unresolved conflict questions. This policy statement is
to be interpreted and applied in a manner that will best serve the interests of the University. In some cases it may be determined that after full disclosure to those concerned
the University's interests are best served by participation by the Regent or executive/senior officer despite the conflict. The University will assist the Board in determining if
such proposed participation violates the state conflict of interest laws. The general
counsel will provide a Regent or executive/senior officer, upon his or her request, a
written opinion as to whether a conflict of interest situation exists.
This policy is in addition to any obligations imposed on a Regent or executive/se
nior officer by the state conflict of interest laws, PA 1968, Nos. 317 and 318, as
amended.
The secretary shall distribute annually a copy of this policy statement to each Regent and executive/senior officer

The lien of the pledge of the Student Fees, and on the Bond Fund, shall be valid and binding from the date of issuance and delivery of the Bonds and all moneys or properties subject

parties having claim in tort, contract or otherwise against the Issuer (except for the holders of
any other indebtedness of the Issuer payable from a first lien on Student Fees) irrespective of
whether such parties have notice of the lien.
Section 602. Student Fees s Source of Payment of Bonds. To the extent that on the fifth
day preceding any Bond Payment Date the moneys then on deposit in the Bond Fund are not
sufficient to meet the interest, or principal and interest, payment coming due on such Bond Payment Date, the Issuer shall, commencing the fifth day prior to the first Bond Payment Date, and
on each subsequent fifth day preceding each Bond Payment Date while the Bonds remain outstanding, pay to the Transfer Agent for deposit into the Bond Fund all Student Fees thereafter
received until the amount on deposit in the Bond Fund is sufficient to pay the interest, and

Student Fees as the Issuer deems appropriate.
Section 603. Funds Legally Available Therefor as Source of Payment for the Bonds. The

any of the Bonds remain outstanding and unpaid, as to either principal or interest, it will establish and maintain Student Fees to be collected from the students attending the University in an
amount sufficient to provide annually sums equal to at least two hundred percent (200%) of the
maximum future annual debt service requirements on all outstanding bonds or obligations payable on a first lien basis from said Student Fees or allocations therefrom. Such collections shall
be sufficient, together with other available funds, to provide such sums as are necessary for the
operation, administration and maintenance of the University and its facilities and programs.
Section 605. Limitations of Obligations. No recourse under any obligation, covenant,
stipulation or agreement contained in this Resolution or in any Bond issued hereunder or caused
by the creation of any indebtedness hereby authorized, shall be had against the State of Michigan, or the Issuer or any member or officer of the Issuer or any officer of the University; nor
shall any such obligation ever be or become a charge against the State of Michigan, nor shall the
same become a lien on or secured by any property, real, personal or mixed, of the State of Michigan or the Issuer, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Bonds and the obligations
created hereunder are secured by and payable only from Student Fees and moneys in the Bond
Fund, and that no other liability whatsoever shall attach to or be incurred by the State of Michigan, the Issuer, or any member or officer of the Issuer or any officer of the University, or its successors; all other liability, except as herein provided, being expressly waived.

the Issuer to refund all or a portion of the Prior Bonds, as determined by an Authorized Officer
(hereinafter defined) (the portion of the Prior Bonds to be refunded being herein called the "Refunded Bonds"); and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties, and in order to prudently control
and direct expenditures from the University's funds, the Issuer determines it is necessary and desirable to authorize the issuance pursuant to the terms of the Master Indenture of a series of hospital revenue obligations (the "Bonds"), in the aggregate original principal amount of not to
exceed Fifty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($51,500,000) to provide funds which,
together with other available funds, may be used to refund the Refunded Bonds and to pay certain costs incurred in connection with the issuance and sale of the Bonds and the refunding of

plus accrued interest, if any, from the dated date of the Bonds to the date of delivery thereof. In
connection with the issuance of the Bonds, either of the Authorized Officers may, on behalf of
and as the act of the Issuer, enter into an interest rate swap agreement or agreements (the
"Swap Agreement") with a counter-party or counter-parties to be selected by the Authorized Officer.

limitations set forth herein.
2. The Bonds, and any obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement, shall be limited and not general obligations of the Issuer payable from Hospital Gross Revenues (as defined
in the Master Indenture) and equally and ratably secured with all other Revenue Obligations (as
defined in the Master Indenture) by an irrevocable pledge of the Pledged Hospital Gross Revenues (as defined in the Master Indenture) and funds from time to time on deposit in certain of
the funds created pursuant to the Master Indenture and shall be additionally secured by the
funds from time to time on deposit in certain of the funds created pursuant to the Series Indenture.
Except as provided in the Master Indenture and the Series Indenture, no recourse shall be
had for the payment of the principal amount of or interest or premium on the Bonds or any
obligation of the Issuer under the Master Indenture, the Series Indenture, or the Swap Agreement, or any claim based thereon against the State of Michigan, the Issuer, or any officer of
agent thereof, as individuals, either directly or indirectly, nor shall the Bonds or any obligation of
the Issuer under the Master Indenture, the Series Indenture, or the Swap Agreement become a

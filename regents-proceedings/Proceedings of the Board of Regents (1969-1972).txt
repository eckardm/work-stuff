Mammals in the Museum of Zoology, has received permission to relinquish  Memoir
his active status at the age of sixty-six, after thirty-four years on the

A native Kansan, Professor Burt earned bachelor's and master's degrees
from the University of Kansas, and proceeded to earn a doctorate from the
University of California in 1930. After gaining additional experience in field
research and museum methods at the California Institute of Technology, he
came to Michigan in 1935 as Assistant Curator of Mammals and Instructor
in Zoology. The University appointed him Curator in 1938 and advanced him
through the several academic ranks to Professor of Zoology in 1949.

the systematics, distribution, and ecology of mammals, and made Ann Arbor
a national center of -professional training in mammalogy. A highly competent
curator in his field, he also edited all Museum publications and was a
respected voice on the Museum's Executive Committee. Within the Zoology
Department, he remained an able and enthusiastic undergraduate teacher as
well as a proficient trainer of specialists. His authoritative volumes on The
Mammals of Michigan and The Mammals of the Great Lakes Region were
supplemented by upwards of a hundred articles in professional journals and
by a popular Field Guide to the Mammals. He edited as well the Journal of
Mammalogy and served for two terms as president of the American Society
of Mammalogists. For all of his expert qualifications, he retained also the
perspective of an amateur in the etymological sense of that word, delighting




16


JULY MEETING, 1969


in all wildlife and associating himself with the causes of conservationists,
nature lovers, and enlightened sportsmen.
As they appoint him Professor Emeritus of Zoology and Curator Emeritus
of Mammals, the Regents of the University salute this most able and attractive scientist with grateful esteem, and invite him long to sustain his distinguished research and writing in association with his fellows here.
H. O. Crisler   HERBERT     ORIN    CRISLER, Professor of Physical Education and
Memoir Director of Physical Education and Athletics, has formally retired from the
active faculty at the statutory age of seventy.
Born and schooled in Illinois, Mr. Crisler earned his baccalaureate from
the University of Chicago. While a student there, he won nine letters in
major sports, was named an All-American end, and was honored as well with
the Western Conference Medal for concurrent proficiency in scholarship and
athletics. Remaining at Chicago to assist the storied Amos Alonzo Stagg, he
embarked upon an independent coaching career in 1930-first at Minnesota,
then at Princeton, and, after 1938, at Michigan.
Professor Crisler retired from coaching after a decade here, in the middle
of an unbroken skein of victories for the Michigan team; it was characteristic of him to bow out at so gracious a juncture. As athletic director of the
University since that time, he has overseen the marked expansion of the
physical plant and has skillfully adjudicated among innumerable competing
claims, academic, financial, and political. On the national scene, where he
came to be an immensely respected elder statesman, he significantly influenced
the rules and procedures of college football and the total doctrine and practice of intercollegiate athletics. And in his every action, he maintained a poise
and decorum which shed honor on him personally and on the institution with
which he was affiliated.
The Regents of the University tender him their own warm gratitude as
they appoint him to the titles for which he is eligible: Professor Emeritus of
Physical Education and Director Emeritus of Physical Education and
Athletics. They trust that he will long enjoy every personal satisfaction as
well as the respectful esteem which he has earned among his professional
peers.
F. B. Fralick   FRANCIS BRUCE FRALICK, the distinguished ophthalmic physician,
Memoir is retiring as Professor of Ophthalmology at the age of sixty-six.
Dr. Fralick earned his medical degree here in 1927, and in 1929, upon
completing his internship and residency at University Hospital, was appointed Instructor in Ophthalmology. After teaching for a year at the
University of Chicago, he returned to Ann Arbor in 1932 as Assistant
Professor, and was advanced to Associate Professor in 1933 and to
Professor and Chairman of Ophthalmology in 1938. By the latter date
he had already served for more than a year as Acting Chairman, and
had for some three years before that, since the age of thirty, been carrying
out a chairman's duties without official appointment.
In the best tradition of the great medical teacher, Dr. Fralick concurrently refined his own clinical proficiency, advanced scientific knowledge
in his field, and trained young men to carry on his work. As a physician
and surgeon of commanding skill, he has preserved the vision of hundreds
of patients. As a research scientist, he has initiated and carried out programs of inquiry into diseases of the eye and into the physiology and
psychology of vision. As a teacher, he has been generous of his time and
concern, and has now the satisfaction of seeing men whom he has
trained train others in their turn.
Cognizant of the need for organization in both the practice and the
pedagogy of medicine, Dr. Fralick did yeoman service as a consultant,
committeeman, and officer of professional associations. In 1957-58, he
was chairman of the American Board of Ophthalmology. In his research,




JULY MEETING, 1969


17


he ably served the National Society for the Prevention of Blindness. In
the Medical Center, he administered his own Department with efficiency
and skill and participated in the most influential councils of the Medical
School and the Hospital. He found time, as well, to serve on the Senate
Advisory Committee on University Affairs. In the fall of 1967, the University fittingly conferred on him its Distinguished Faculty Achievement
Award.
The Regents of the University confess themselves deeply in his debt,
as well for the honor he has brought to this institution as for the specific
services he has capably performed within it. Appointing him now Professor
Emeritus of Ophthalmology, they cordially extend to him the privileges
perquisite to that rank.
HAZEL    MARIE    LOSH, beloved teacher and campus personality,    H. M. Losh
has entered upon her retirement after forty-two years on the faculty of  Memoir
the Department of Astronomy.
Born in Blanchester, Ohio, Professor Losh was graduated with honors
from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1920. She proceeded to earn a doctorate
from The University of Michigan in 1924, to teach for a year at Smith
College, and to serve for two years in the Solar Department of the Mt.
Wilson Observatory. Returning to the University as a research assistant,
she was appointed an instructor in 1928 and was raised through the several
ranks to a professorship in 1965. Two articles of published research, on
"The Spectrum of Zeta Tauri" and "The Distribution of Sunspots in
Longitude," established her capabilities in astronomical inquiry. After the
beginning of the Second World War, however, when she assumed a
disproportionate academic load, she devoted her primary energies to undergraduate teaching.
Professor Losh's unflagging enthusiasm in the classroom and her
friendly interest in individual students had many happy effects. Many
undergraduate majors whom she advised and taught enjoyed success in
graduate study. And former students throughout the nation remember
her affectionately as teacher and as friend. On campus, she was endeared
to the student body generally and to athletes in particular by her unfeigned
fondness for intercollegiate sports. Throughout the State, her talks and news
releases ably mediated between the rigors of astronomical science and the
popular public interest in the changing format of the skies.
The University Regents, in appointing Hazel Losh Professor Emeritus
of Astronomy, join her students and faculty peers in thanking her most
warmly for her devoted offices. And they cordially invite her to participate
still in the life of the institution in which she is already a legend.
EARL NELSON RISKEY, who has served for forty-one years in the      E. N. Riskey
Department of Physical Education for Men, has retired from  his active  Memoir
offices at the statutory age of seventy.
Mr. Riskey earned a baccalaurate in Ypsilanti, at the school which
is now Eastern Michigan University, and came to The University of
Michigan two years later as an Instructor in Physical Education. He was
promoted to Associate Supervisor in 1942-in which year he earned also
a master's degree-and subsequently to Supervisor and to Director. Last
year his title was changed to Professor.
A specialist in intramural sports, Mr. Riskey had charge of the
Intramural Program here for an even thirty years. Being fertile of
invention and having a capacity for infinite pains, he was able to augment
the program continually, sometimes with activities appearing at first
exotic or offbeat, and to accommodate ever-increasing complexities of
arrangement. Other universities and colleges rendered him the sincerest
form of flattery by imitating his patterns of innovation and organization.
His efficient and kindly presence is missed in the Sports Building




18


JULY MEETING, 1969


by students and faculty alike. The Regents of the University, too, would
gratefully acknowledge his long and faithful ministry as they name him
Professor Emeritus of Physical Education for Men and extend to him
their warmest personal good wishes.
F. C. Shiel    The Regents of the University take the occasion of his retirement to
Memoir salute FRANCIS CAMERON SHIEL, Manager of Service Enterprises,
who has concluded forty-two years on the University staff.
A native of Chicago, Mr. Shiel moved to Hillsdale as a boy and
attended Hillsdale College for two years. Following further study in the
Department of Civil Engineering here, he joined the University staff
in 1927 as a draftsman for Buildings and Grounds. Transferred to the
Business Office in 1930, he assisted variously in planning, equipping, and
maintaining the residence halls built during that decade. In 1939 he was
appointed Business Manager, and in 1941 Acting Director, of the Residence Halls. In 1951, his responsibilities being significantly broadened,
he was given the title which he is now relinquishing.
The dutes of general management in a vast university are at once
exacting and diverse. Mr. Shiel has himself supervised operation so various
as those of the Printing Office, the Laundry, Martha Cook Residence,
Radrick Farms Golf Course, and the Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre. Neither
his capacity for taking pains nor his spirit of service has ever flagged.
Among Big Ten schools, and also nationally, he has been a respected
authority on the operations and financing of student housing.
The Regents extend to him their hearty thanks for his long and able
fidelity. They would add, as well, their warm good wishes for his personal
happiness during his well-merited retirement years.
F. S. Turneaure   FREDERICK STEWART TURNEAURE, the distinguished economic
Memoir geologist, has recently attained the age of seventy and is retiring from
the active faculty of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
Professor Turneaure was born and schooled in Madison, Wisconsin,
and earned a Bachelor of Science in Mining Engineering from The University of Wisconsin in 1921. In the period before he came to Ann Arbor,
he served as a mining engineer in Mexico, taught at the Michigan College
of Mines, earned a master's degree and a doctorate from Harvard University, and spent a total of seventeen years as an industrial geologist,
twelve of them in Bolivia. Coming to The University of Michigan in 1947
as an associate professor, he was advanced to a professorship in 1952.
Professor Turneaure's skill and experience in metalliferous geology
significantly enhanced the fame of his Department and the attractiveness
of its program. His research was authoritative and his judgment sound.
The Bolivian Government was guided by his surveys; the United States
Congress heard his counsel on mining taxation; the National Science
Foundation sought his advice on the needs of minerals research; and he
was a perennial officer, councillor, or committee chairman of professional
societies.
His faculty fellows hold him in high regard. The University Regents,
who now appoint him Professor Emeritus of Geology and Mineralogy,
express their own admiration for him and their gratitude for his thorough
and inspiring teaching. They trust that he will long benefit his colleagues
by partaking of the privileges perquisite to his new title.
E. H. Watson     ERNEST    HAMILTON      WATSON, Professor of Pediatrics and DiMemoir rector of the Outpatient Department in Pediatrics, is formally retiring
from the medical faculty at the age of sixty-six.
A native of Indiana, Dr. Watson was schooled in Evansville and earned
his baccalaureate from Evansville College. He came then to this University,
earning his medical degree in 1932, and he completed his residency in the
Detroit area, at Herman Keifer and Henry Ford hospitals. The American




JULY MEETING, 1969


19


Board of Pediatrics certified him in 1937. The next five years he spent in
the Professional Service Division of Parke Davis and Company, where
he gained experience in scientific editing and research. He returned to the
University in 1942 as Instructor in Child Health in the School of Public
Health, with a joint appointment in the Pediatrics and Communicable
Diseases Department of the Medical School. In succeeding years he increased his commitment to clinical practice and teaching. He rose through
the several ranks to Professor of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases
in 1954 and, after 1956, distributed his time entirely between teaching in the
Medical School and directing outpatient services in Pediatrics in University
Hospital. Before entering upon his retirement furlough, he had within his
purview some twenty-five thousand patients, was involved with several
specialty clinics, and carried also a substantial load of teaching.
Possessing a gift for organization as well as a sound and comprehensive clinical knowledge, Dr. Watson was steadily active in professional
medical circles. Nationally, he was on the Rheumatic Fever Committee and
the Adoptions Committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He
served as well on state committees concerned with the adoption of children,
with licensing of foreign-trained specialists, and with supervising school
health. In the City and the area, he was consultant to the schools and to
child-health and service organizations. Within the Hospital, he chaired
the Outpatient Department Committee and served on the Senior Medical
Advisory Committee.
His colleagues in the Medical Center will sorely miss his energies, his
talents, and his devotion. In proportion as he has richly earned an early
retirement, they are reluctant to see him go. The Regents of the University now tender Dr. Watson their grateful esteem for past services and their
cordial good wishes for his future as they appoint him Professor Emeritus
of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases.

There were no deaths reported since the June 20 meeting.

Bookstore    The proposal of Student Government Council concerning the
operation of a bookstore was defeated by unanimous vote.




JULY MEETING, 1969


23


On behalf of the administration, President Fleming presented
the following alternative plan for a University operated bookstore:
We recommend to the Regents the establishment of a University operated bookstore within the following guidelines:
1. Rental space to be authorized in either the Union or the SAB building
at a figure which will equate with other rental charges currently being
made. (The University presently rents space from the Union for certain other purposes at $2.75 per square foot with utilities paid by the
University, or $3.25-$3.50 with all costs paid by the renter.)
2. Merchandise sold in the bookstore to be limited to textbooks, general
school supplies (pens, paper, etc.), cosmetics, hair care items, LP
records and stereo tapes, and general art school supplies.
3. Capitalization in a minimum amount of $150,000-$200,000, to be
obtained either through outside gifts or voluntary student contributions.
4. The managerial structure to include a professional manager, working
with a student-faculty committee, and subject to University business
office controls.
If a bookstore is organized along the lines which we propose, it will be
self-supporting, it will recognize a legitimate and constructve student interest,
and it will not constitute unfair competion for local merchants since it will
not be the recipient of any University subsidy. At worst it will fail because
it cannot compete with private bookstores and/or because the Legislature
removes the sales tax exemption. At best it will be successful in offering
modest savings to students. In either event it will recognize a deep interest
which they have, and it will provide a genuine educational experience for
those who are involved.
Following discussion of the administration's bookstore proposal, Regent Dunn submitted the following resolution:
We, the Regents, conclude:
1. That it is unknown whether there would be student interest
in or support for the bookstore proposal prepared by the
Administration;
2. That in the event there is student support for the bookstore
plan proposed by the Administration, and provided that the
necessary capital in the amount of $200,000 could in fact be
raised on a voluntary basis in one year, the Regents would
look favorably on that proposal. Therefore, Be It Resolved,
That the matter be referred back to Student Government
Council for an expression of interest or disinterest in the proposal prepared by the Administration.
The motion failed on a tie vote, with Regents Smith, Huebner,
Dunn and Nederlander voting yes, and Regents Cudlip, Goebel,
Lindemer and Brown voting no on a roll call vote.
Request for space allocation by the discount store was referred    Discount Store
to the executive officers for disposition (p. 71).
The following budget resolutions were approved (R.P., 1966-        Budget
69, p. 1338):                                                          Resolution

The Regents approved the following public members of the
Board in Control of the University Medical Center (R.P., 1966 -69, p. 1727):
John H. Burton, for a three-year term
William Mazer, Sr., for a two-year term
Andrew Pattullo, for a one-year term.
The following were named as alternates in case any of the first
three choices should decline to serve:
Dr. Stuart F. Harkness
Dr. Dean C. Burns
Mrs. Paul Zimmerman.
Regent Cudlip suggested that the University inquire into the
possibility of obtaining the statue of Father Gabriel Richard, one
of the founders of the Unversity, and having it moved to Ann
Arbor. The statue, which is now stored at Fort Wayne in Detroit,
was removed from the old City Hall in Detroit before the building
was razed.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents of the University for the month of June 1969 totaled
$861.68.
The Board adjourned to meet on September 18 and 19.

interest on this bond or any claim based thereon against the State
of Michigan, the Borrower or any member of the Borrower, or
any officer or agent thereof, as individuals, either directly or indirectly; nor shall these obligations become a lien on or secured
by any property, real, personal or mixed, of the State or the
Borrower, other than the Student Fees, as defined in the Trust
Indenture, which is pledged to meet the payment of said obligations; and the liability of the Borrower, as a body corporate,
shall be limited to said Student Fees, all other liability, except as
expressed in said Trust Indenture, being by the acceptance hereof and as a part of the consideration for the issuance thereof expressly waived.

of the Trust Indenture is on file in the office of the Trustee.
As provided in the Indenture, this bond is exchangeable at the
sole expense of the Borrower, at any time, upon ninety days notice

of this bond to the Borrower at the office of the Trustee in the
City of Detroit, Michigan, for negotiable coupon bonds, payable

Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars each, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of this bond,
and in the form of such coupon bond as provided for in the Indenture.
The Borrower shall have the right to prepay, on any interest
payment date on or after April 1, 1979, the entire principal
amount hereof then remaining unpaid, or such lesser portion
thereof as it may determine upon, in inverse chronological order

optional prepayment shall be given at least thirty days prior
to the prepayment date by mailing to the registered owner of this
bond a notice fixing such prepayment date, the amount of principal and the premium, if any, to be prepaid.

Trustee by registered mail, and the Alternate Payee shall surrender the same to the Trustee, either, in exchange for a new
fully registered bond or for transfer on the registration records
and verification of the endorsements made on the Payment

hereof and interest hereon paid or prepaid, and every such assignee shall take this bond subject to such condition.

Section 2.02. Execution of Bonds and Coupons and Authentication of Bonds. All bonds issued hereunder shall be signed
the name and in behalf of the Borrower by its Vice-President
or Controller, and shall have the corporate seal affixed thereto,
and the coupons shall be executed by the facsimile signature of




52


JULY MEETING, 1969


said Vice-President, printed, lithographed, or engraved thereon.
All bonds issued hereunder, after execution by the Borrower as
herein provided, shall be delivered to the Trustee, and the
Trustee shall thereafter authenticate and deliver said bonds, in
whole or in part, upon the written order of the Borrower,
given from time to time by the Vice-President or Controller.
Before authenticating the fully registered bond issued hereunder,
the Trustee shall make an appropriate notation on such single
fully registered bond to the effect that Borrower is not liable for
interest with respect to any expired interest date. Before authenticating any of the coupon bonds, the Trustee shall detach and
cancel all matured coupons, if any, thereto appertaining. The
bonds and coupons so executed and authenticated may be issued
even though the officers whose signatures appear thereon shall
have ceased to be officers of the Borrower at the time of the
issuance thereof or shall have become officers subsequent to the
date of said bonds.
Section 2.03. Bonds Payable to Bearer or Registered Owner.
All coupon bonds issued hereunder shall be payable to bearer and
transferable by delivery unless and until the same shall have been
registered by the holder thereof, or his attorney thereunto duly
authorized, in writing, at the main office of the Trustee, in Detroit, Michigan; which registration shall be endorsed by the
Trustee on the bond so registered. The principal of any bond so
registered shall thereafter be payable only to the registered owner
thereof, and any payment so made shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the liability upon such bond to the
extent of the sum or sums so paid: Provided, However, that the
registration of any bond shall not in any way affect payment of
interest thereon or the negotiability of the interest coupons
thereto attached, which shall be payable to bearer in accordance with the terms of and on presentation of said coupons.
Any bond so registered may be transferred on the books of the
Borrower maintained in the office of the Trustee by the registered owner thereof, or his attorney thereunto duly authorized,
in writing, which transfer shall be endorsed thereon by the
Trustee, and any bond registered to bearer shall thereupon
again become payable to bearer and transferable by delivery
in the same manner as before the registration thereof. The single
bond issued in acordance with the provisions of Section 2.01 of
this Article II shall be payable and exchangeable for coupon
bonds, all as provided in the form of single bond hereinbefore set
forth and in subsection (b) of this Section 2.04.
Section 2.04. Registry of Coupon Bonds. (a) The Borrower shall keep at the office of the Trustee, in the City of
Detroit, Michigan, books for the registration and transfer of
coupon bonds, and upon presentation for such purpose, at such




JULY MEETING, 1969


53


office, the Trustee shall register thereon, as herein provided, and
under such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, any coupon
bond or bonds issued hereunder. The trustee shall be the agent
of the Borrower to keep such books and to make such registration and transfer.
The holder of any coupon bond issued hereunder may have
the ownership thereof registered as to principal, as provided in
this section, on said books at such office, in the City of Detroit,
Michigan, and such registration noted on the bond. After such
registration, no transfer shall be valid unless made on said books
at the request of the registered owner or by his duly authorized
attorney and noted by the Trustee on the bond; but the bond may
be discharged from registration by being in like manner transferred to bearer, and thereupon transferability by delivery shall
be restored; and such coupon bond may again, from time to
time, be registered or transferred to bearer as before. Such
registration, however, shall not affect the negotiability of the
coupons, but every such coupon shall continue to be transferable
by delivery and shall remain payable to bearer.
(b) The Borrower covenants and agrees that within ninety
(90) days after the receipt by the Borrower of the written request of the registered owner of the fully registered bond, it will,
at its own expense, prepare and execute to bearer coupon bonds
of the denomination of Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars, in
the form hereinbefore set forth, of type composition printed on
paper of customary weight and strength, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such registered bond, and having maturities corresponding to the principal
installments of such registered bond then unpaid, with coupons
annexed thereto maturing after the date to which interest on
such fully registered bond has been paid. Such coupon bonds
shall be authenticated by the Trustee and delivered to the
registered owner of such fully registered bond upon the surrender and cancellation of such fully registered bond. Any fully
registered bond so surrendered shall be cancelled by the Trustee
and delivered to the Borrower. The Trustee shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate or order delivered to it
under the provisions of this section.
Section 2.05. Bonds Valid When Authenticated. All bonds
issued and authenticated hereunder shall stand upon equality
without regard to date of issue, authentication, delivery or negotiation, but only such bonds as shall bear thereon the authentication certificate of the Trustee shall be valid or obligatory for any
purpose or entitled to any benefits hereunder; and such authentication certificate shall be conclusive and the only evidence that
the bond so authenticated has been duly issued hereunder and




54


JULY MEETING, 1969


entitled to the benefits of the trust hereby created. No holder
of any bond authenticated by the Trustee shall be under any
duty to ascertain whether the same shall have been duly issued,
authenticated and delivered according to the provisions hereof.
Section 2.06. Mutilated Bonds. In case any bond and the
coupons belonging thereto shall have been mutilated, lost, stolen
or destroyed, then upon production of such multilated bond or
evidence satisfactory to the Borrower and the Trustee of the
loss, theft or destruction of such bond and the coupons thereof,
and receipt of indemnity satisfactory to the Borrower and
Trustee, the Borrower, in its discretion, may execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver substitute bonds in exchange for and upon cancellation of the ones which have been

issued hereunder, the Trustee shall, upon the written request of
the Borrower, use said funds in the Bond and Interest Fund and
the Debt Service Reserve Fund for the purpose of redeeming said
outstanding bonds.

of thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given to the
Borrower by the Trustee, which notice the Trustee must give upon
the written request of the holders of twenty-five per cent (25%)
in amount of bonds then outstanding, the Trustee may proceed
to protect or enforce the right of the Trustee and the holders of
bonds, either by mandamus to compel the Borrower to perform
each and every covenant herein contained, or by injunction to

62


JULY MEETING, 1969


The Borrower expressly authorizes the Trustee to bring any of
the actions at law or in equity hereinbefore mentioned, and hereby
waives any immunity to being proceeded against, as herein
authorized, which may exist by reason of its being a Department
of Government of the State of Michigan.
Section 7.02. Bondholders May Direct Action on Default.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of bonds
outstanding hereunder shall have the right to direct the method
of conducting any and all proceedings hereunder for the enforcement of this agreement, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to
take any action under this agreement and said direction unless it
shall first be tendered indemnity sufficient to pay all necessary
expenses incidental thereto, including court costs and attorney's
fees.
Section 7.03. Evidence of Rights of Bondholders. Any request
or other instrument which this agreement may require or permit
to be filed and executed by the bondholders may be in any number
of concurrent instruments of similar tenor, and may be filed or
executed by such bondholders in person or by attorney, in writing. Proof of the execution of any such request or other instrument, or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any person of bonds, shall be sufficient for any purpose of
this agreement if made in the following manner:
(a) The fact and date of the execution by any person
of such request or other instrument in writing may be
proved by the certificate of any Notary Public or other
officer authorized to take acknowledgements of deeds
to be recorded in any State that the person signing such
request or other instrument acknowledged to him the
execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such
execution;
(b) The amount of bonds transferable by delivery held
by any person executing such request or other instrument as a bondholder, and the issue numbers thereof,
held by such person, and the date of his holding them,
may be proved by a certificate executed by any trust
company, bank, bankers or other depository wherever
situated, if such certificate shall be deemed by the
Trustee to be satisfactory, showing that at the date
therein mentioned such person had on deposit with
such depository the bonds described in such certificate;
(c) The ownership of registered bonds shall be proved by
the registry books.
The Trustee may, however, in its discretion, require further
proof in cases where it deems further proof desirable.

The Trustee shall not be bound to recognize any person as a
bondholder unless and until his title to the bonds held by him is
proved in the manner in this Article VII provided.
Section 7.04. Limitation on Right of Bondholders To Act.
No holder of any bond or coupon secured hereby shall have any
right to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at
law for any remedy hereunder or relating thereto unless such
holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of
such default and of the continuance thereof, as herein provided;
nor unless also the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of bonds outstanding shall have made written request
upon the Trustee and shall have afforded it a reasonable opportunity either to proceed to exercise the powers herein granted or to
institute such action, suit or proceedings in its own name; nor
unless also they shall have offered to the Trustee adequate security
and indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred therein or thereby, and have or shall have agreed to
deposit their bonds with the Trustee upon request; and such
notifications, requests and offers of indemnity are hereby declared
in every such case, at the option of the Trustee, to be conditions
precedent to the exercise of the powers and trusts of this agreement
for the benefit of the bondholders, and to any action or cause of
action, or for any other remedy hereunder or relating thereto; it
being understood and intended that no one or more holders of
bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever, by his or their
action, to affect, disturb or prejudice the lien under this agreement,
and to enforce any rights hereunder except in the manner herein
provided, and that all proceedings at law or in equity shall be
instituted, had and maintained in the manner herein provided and
for the equal benefit of all holders of such outstanding bonds.
Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed as granting
to the holder of any bond or coupon secured hereby the right to
bring any action or proceeding at law or in equity which the
Trustee is not expressly authorized to bring: Provided, However,
if the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of bonds
issued hereunder shall have complied with all conditions prerequisite to the requiring of action on the part of the Trustee and said
Trustee shall refuse to act, then one or more bondholders may
have the right to bring any action or actions at law or equity as
the Trustee might have instituted for and in behalf of the owners
of all outstanding bonds.
Section 7.05. Upon Curing of Default, Rights of Parties To
Be Re-Established. In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to
enforce any rights under this agreement in the manner set forth
in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of Section 7.01 of this Article VII,
and the default or defaults complained of by the Trustee shall




64


JULY MEETING, 1969


have been cured, and it be reasonably certain that if the management and control of the project is returned to the Borrower it
will manage the same in such manner that it will be able to meet
the obligations herein imposed, then, and in every such case, the
Trustee shall restore the Borrower to its former position in relation
to the project, and the rights of the Borrower, the Trustee and the
holders of bonds shall be the same as if no default had occurred.
Section 7.06. Power to Waive Default. The Trustee may,
and upon written request of the holders of a majority in amount
of bonds outstanding hereunder shall, waive any default hereunder
upon compliance by the Borrower with all of the covenants, conditions and provisions hereof, including payment in full of all
amounts then due under the terms hereof and any expenses incurred by the Trustee. No such waiver shall extend to or affect
any subsequent or other then existing default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

Any proceeds received by the Trustee under the provisions of this
Article VII shall be applied as follows:

fees, and including repayment of any moneys advanced

and his title satisfactorily established, if disputed;
(e) The Trustee may select and employ suitable agents and

hereunder. Upon proper and legal showing, the Borrower may
demand and obtain the resignation of the Trustee and secure the
appointment of a successor Trustee. Any successor to the Trustee

on such sums, except to the extent of income actually earned from
investments herein authorized, if the provisions of this agreement
are carried out.
Section 8.04. Trustee's Right To Recognize Holder of Bonds,
Etc. The Trustee and the Borrower shall be protected in treating

and shall not be charged with any notice to the contrary.
Section 8.05. Successor Trustee. Any corporation into which
the Trustee may be merged or with which it may be consolidated,
or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which the Trustee shall be a party, or any state or national bank

business of the Trustee or of any successor Trustee as a whole or
substantially as a whole, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding. In case any of the bonds

The Secretary reported the retirement of four faculty members.
The following memoirs were adopted:
JOSEPH PAXTON CHANDLER, having served for twenty years on             J. P. Chandler
the faculty in biological chemistry, completed his retirement furlough and  Memoir
relinquished his active status this past summer.
Professor Chandler was born in Minnesota in January of 1903 and
earned a bachelor's degree from Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois, in
1924. Commencing graduate study at this University in summer sessions, he
earned his master's degree in 1927 and proceeded to a doctorate in 1930.
During the next seven years, he served as a research associate, first in the
Hospital for Joint Diseases and then in the Medical College of Cornell
University. From 1937 to 1948 he was Assistant Professor of Biochemistry
at Cornell. He returned to Ann Arbor in 1948 as a biochemist in the clinical
laboratories of the Hospital and Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry
in the Medical School, and was advanced to Associate Professor in 1950.
In 1962 he was given charge of biochemistry in the Clinical Research Unit of
his Department.
Professor Chandler greatly enhanced the efficiency of the laboratories
which he supervised, having a gift for organization and a lively and creative
interest in methodology. He served fittingly as president of the Science
Research Club in 1958-59. His teaching, whether of medical students, graduate students, or laboratory technicians, was thorough and sympathetic.




92


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969


He supplied, as well, invaluable liaison between the interests of the Hospital
and of his Medical School department.
Gratefully mindful of his long devotion, the Regents of the University
have deferred willingly, though with regret, to his desire for an early
retirement. As they appoint him Associate Professor Emeritus of Biological
Chemistry, they extend to him their warm good wishes and cordially invite
him to partake of the privileges perquisite to emeritus rank.
W. M. Hoad      WILLIAM    MARVIN HOAD, for twenty-two years a specialist in small
Memoir business in the School of Business Administration, has been granted permission formally to retire from the active faculty in his sixty-fourth year.
A native of Lawrence, Kansas, Professor Hoad came to Ann Arbor when
his father joined the engineering faculty, and entered the University in 1923.
He proceeded to earn a baccalaureate in 1927, a master's degree in 1930, and
a doctorate in 1942. In the years from 1930 to 1933, he taught in the Department of Economics here, and in the nine succeeding years served as Economist
and Senior Economist with the United States Central Statistical Board, and
as Senior Economist and Assistant Division Chief wth the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. In 1936-37, he was a fellow of the Brookings Institution. Before
returning to the University, he gained additional experience as a principal
economist in the Bureau of the Census and as a research specialist with the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Appointed a Lecturer and Research
Associate in the School of Business Administration in 1947, he was elevated
to Associate Professor in 1952 and to Professor in 1956.
At the University, Professor Hoad developed courses in establishing and
operating small businesses, wrote texts and carried out research in that field,
advised the state and federal governments on small-business policies, and lent
counsel and direction to many individual companies and business associations.
Concurrently, he helped direct the annual Public Utility Executive Program
and counseled pre-business students in the Literary College. His keen social
consciousness was exhibited in his concern for industrial retirees and for the
small businesses of developing nations. Throughout his tenure here, he was
perceived, both by his colleagues and the general public, as at once an efficient
specialist in his field and a man with a mission.
The Regents of the University join the business administration faculty in
extending to this devoted man their warmest gratitude. They wish him
personal satisfaction as holder of the title which they now confer: Professor
Emeritus of Small Business.
W. G. Rice       WARNER GRENELLE RICE, for twenty-one years Chairman of the
Memoir Department of English Language and Literature and for thirteen years
Director of the General Library, has completed his retirement furlough and
is formally joining the emeritus faculty.
A native of Aurora, Illinois, Professor Rice earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Illinois in 1920 and 1922 respectively.
Proceeding then to Harvard, he earned a doctorate in 1927 and instructed in
English for two additional years. He came to Michigan as Associate Professor
in 1929 and was advanced to Professor in 1936. From 1941 to 1954, he
served as Director of the General Library, and from 1947 until he commenced his retirement furlough, as Chairman of the English Department.
Professor Rice's primary scholarly interest was John Milton, whose
works he taught with eloquence and upon whom he has written interpretive
essays which are standing admirably the test of time.
Himself setting an example of thoughtful and rigorous pedagogy, he
became deeply concerned with the doctrine and discipline of education and of
teacher training at all levels from the secondary school through the university.
Like his philosophical mentor, Matthew Arnold, he traversed the area on
school visitations.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969

On campus he served on committees treating of teacher education, adult
education, vocational education, University services to state schools, and
teaching fellowships. Through his offices for the National Council of Teachers
of English, the Commission on Trends in Education of the Modern Language
Association, the Association of Departments of English, and numbers of
other agencies, and through formal and informal consultation with makers
of policy at many individual universities and colleges, he exerted as well an
incisive influence on learning and teaching nationally.
His voice was heard in an astonishing variety of other executive and
advisory committees of his College and of the University. As Director of the
General Library, he oversaw a vast proliferation of services and became, as
in every interest which he pursued, an active and respected member of professional councils. In the English Department, he proved a sensitive, sympathetic, and meditative chairman, with a concurrent capacity for infinite pains.
His obligations in that office were regularly equivalent to those of the president of a sizable liberal arts college.
On the occasion of his retirement, the Regents of the University salute
Professor Rice with warm admiration, deep gratitude, and a kind of wonder
at all he has accomplished. They trust that, as Professor Emeritus of English
from henceforward, he will continue to share with his colleagues the wisdom
and conviction which have earned him a universal esteem.
LEO ANTON SCHMIDT, Professor of Accounting, who has completed         L. A. Schmidt
his retirement furlough after twenty-one years of teaching in the School of  Memoir
Business Administration, is now eligible for an appointment to the emeritus
faculty.
Born in Manistee in 1899, Professor Schmidt earned a bachelor's degree
from the University in 1921, taught in the Manistee High School for two
years, and then returned to Ann Arbor for graduate study. Earning his
master's in 1924, he taught for a year at Washington State College and for
seventeen years at Marquette University, where, in 1931, he rose to a professorship and also met state requirements as a Certified Public Accountant.
From 1942 to 1947 he taught accounting at the Harvard Business School
with the rank first of visiting lecturer and later of associate professor.
Returning to Ann Arbor as Associate Professor of Accounting in 1947, he
was elevated to Professor in the following year.
On campus, Professor Schmidt assumed leadership of the accounting
faculty and developed the instruction in controllership and in the uses of
electronic computation for accounting. He helped guide, as well, the programs
in business administration in Dearborn and in the Extension Service. Enjoying
a national reputation as a specialist in text construction for the American
Institute of Accounting, he confirmed his authority by his text on controllership and his several texts on accounting, both general and specialized. His
articles appeared in the leading professional journals, and his many lectures,
in which he concurrently displayed his technical expertness and his breadth
of outlook, enhanced his own name and fame and that of his School. The
Defense Department, the United States Navy, the Dow Chemical Company,
and many other companies and associations sought his professional counsel.
It is a happy irony that, as the Regents of the University appoint him
Professor Emeritus of Accounting, they also welcome him back to active
teaching as a visiting professor for this year. They find in his present dual
appointment an augury that he will long enjoy the esteem and gratitude
which this institution owes him.
VII. DEATHS
There were no deaths reported since the July 18 meeting.

There was no objection to a second draft letter which would  Osteopathic
be sent to the State Board of Education regarding the establishment of a school of osteopathy at The University of Michigan
(R.P., 1966-69, p. 1764).
Discussion on the Flint and Dearborn report and on Chapter  October Meeting,
VII of the Bylaws was to be held over to next month.       Ites heldover
At the October meeting members of the Board of Visitors and
others would meet with the Regents on visitation policies (p. 21).
Further discussion of the intramural report would be in
October.
The ruling by the Attorney General concerning open meetings  Open Meetings
was discussed and placed on file.
Regent Smith said that by way of introduction to the question  Bookstore
of a bookstore, the matter had been discussed at the July meeting.
In fact, the issue appeared for discussion every several years. Last
month the Regents discussed fully the Student Government Council proposal for a bookstore and believed that it had merit, but
that there were still many things about it with which they could
not agree. Therefore, they voted unanimously not to approve that
particular proposal.
Continuing, he said that the administration presented an
alternate proposal in July; it had been fully aired, but this was
defeated by virtue of a 4-to-4 tie. Some of the Regents felt matters of major importance that were decided by a tie vote were not
entirely satisfactory. Other Regents might not agree with this
analysis, but they were free to comment on it later if they so
desired.
In the interim of two months since that tie vote was taken,
there was no question, he continued, that the matter had not been
finally disposed of, as indicated by the enormous amount of discussion devoted to the issue. The hearing yesterday with members
of Student Government Council was a further indication that
every conceivable issue that surrounded the question had been
discussed.
Following the meeting with Student Government Council, the
Regents continued to speak about the issue, and presented their
own alternatives to the question. All of these were fully aired.
The result, therefore, was the possibility for a composite viewpoint,
which is expressed in the resolution which Regent Smith intended
to read and support:
In view of the tie vote on the bookstore question at the July meeting of




98


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969


the Regents and the continuing interest in the subject, the Regents have
reconsidered the matter. They have been troubled by at least six questions:
1. Since experience with bookstores elsewhere suggests that the discounts
which students anticipate may not be available, will the venture produce the
expected results?
2. Since the capital available to bookstores at other universities appears
to be considerably in excess of the $250,000 suggested by SGC, will such a
bookstore be viable?
3. In the event the bookstore does not succeed, will The University of
Michigan be responsible for its debts?
4. Is it fair to impose a compulsory assessment on all students, particularly since the $1.75 figure used in the earlier referendum is inadequate?
5. Will whatever assessment is made against students eventually appear
as a deduct from legislative appropriations?
6. Is there a need for a University bookstore in view of the services
rendered by other bookstores in the community?
As a matter of judgment, the Regents have doubts as to all of these
questions. Nevertheless, they will approve a bookstore if it is established
pursuant to the following plan:
1. The store is to be capitalized at a minimum of $200,000.
2. The Regents will authorize the use of $100,000 from the so-called
Student Vehicles Fund.
3. The remaining $100,000 must be obtained from a compulsory one-time
assessment on students in the various colleges (which will indicate
whether there is genuine student financial support for the project)
under the following arrangement:
a. The duly recognized student government of each of the 16 colleges
and schools in Ann Arbor may vote to bind the students in that
college, or
b. The duly recognized student government of each of the 16 colleges
and schools in Ann Arbor may conduct a referendum within that
college on the question of whether students are to be bound by
the compulsory assessment.
c. In the event the college has no duly recognized student government, Student Government Council may conduct a referendum
limited to the students of that college, with the results to be
binding.
d. All referenda must be conducted not later than the fall term of 1969.
4. Since the $1.75 assessment, which was voted on in an earlier referendum is inadequate to supply the necessary capital, the Regents will
approve an assessment of not more than $5 per person, with the
referendum question to read as follows and to be uniform as to language and amount (which may be set by SGC) throughout all
referenda:
Should the Regents assess a one-time uniform assessment on all
students in your college (and a like assessment on students in all
colleges which approve) not to exceed $, the funds obtained
to be used to establish a University Bookstore?
5. Space needed is to be provided in the Michigan Union and will be
rented at the then current rental rates. There will be no subsidy from
other funds for the bookstore.
6. The management of the bookstore will be the responsibility of the
Office of the Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, with an
appropriate advisory group consisting of faculty and students.
7. Assessment of students in those schools and colleges which affirm
their willingness will be made either at the beginning of the Winter




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969


99


Term, 1969-70, or the beginning of the Fall Term 1970, depending on
the wishes of Student Government Council.
8. Depending upon the availability of the necessary capital, the store
will begin operations either in September, 1970, or January, 1971.
Regent Goebel asked why the Regents should approve an
assessment of not more than five dollars per person for the
bookstore.
President Fleming responded that he felt the Regents did not
wish to set a limit for the total amount.
Regent Smith replied that the total seemed to be a maximum
realistic assessment, that quite possibly this figure should be
flexible inasmuch as Student Government Council might get
additional funds elsewhere.
President Fleming stated that another reason was that one
should have a uniform amount from referenda to referenda in
the various schools and colleges.
Regent Lindemer responded that he wanted to be sure that
each of the schools and colleges would give clear evidence that
they were behind the proposal.
Regent Goebel moved an amendment which would remove the
requirement of a $5.00 maximum assessment because he felt that
the discretion for the size of the assessment should be left to the
judgment of SGC since that body would be responsible for raising
the students' $100,000 contribution to the bookstore. The amendment failed because of a lack of a second.
Regent Dunn said that any time you have a deliberative body
there would be a difference of opinion among its members. He said
that the Regents tried to obtain a consensus out of the diversity
of opinions. He was not particularly happy with the resolution
before them, but he would vote for it when the time came. He was
particularly in support of the idea of turning over to the bookstore
all the monies currently in the Student Vehicle Fund, and that
there be no more referenda on the issue.
Regent Smith stated that an additional reason for asking for
another referendum was that the last one was based on an assessment of $1.75, whereas this program would require more money
and hence an increased assessment. Furthermore, when one wished
to place monies into a business venture, one must go back to the
people and see whether or not there was a strong mandate for that
position, particularly when a larger amount was requested. Another
reason, he said, was that a referendum taken at an earlier period
may not reflect the wishes of those students that were here now,
particularly if there was to be an increase in student assessment.
Regent Lindemer said he would like to comment upon the six
questions that Regent Smith had read. The degree of trouble




100


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969


varied from question to question, but he wanted it made clear that
any assessment made against the students would not jeopardize
any budget considerations for the University as a whole.
President Fleming responded that the University would make
every effort to protect itself against such a contingency.
Regent Lindemer went on to say that a concept of a bookstore
in the minds of the students would bear little relationship to what
it would be in actuality. He said that he hoped a way could be
found to reduce all student book costs by five to ten per cent,
but he was convinced that such would not be the case in the store.
He believed that the issue was of concern to many students, but
again, if the proposal were adopted he did not wish the students
to be led astray into believing that the store would do something
that it would find impossible to do. If the above points were kept
in mind, and if the preamble to the resolution and all the points
mentioned in the resolution were treated as a whole and represented fairly in the press and by those who would be working
with these various referenda, he would be prepared to support the
resolution.
Regent Brown commented that one problem he had with the
proposal was question 6, which read "Is there a need for a University bookstore in view of the services rendered by other bookstores
in the community?" He felt that no convincing evidence had been
presented him that there was such a need. He said that for him to
say that if a bookstore were created that discounts would be available therein would at this time be a fraud and a hoax. He hoped
there might be some other way to reduce the expenses of students;
currently, the bookstore did not appear to be the proper vehicle.
He wished to further support the last point of Regent Lindemer,
that is, that he hoped that the student leaders would present the
facts clearly and precisely concerning the possibilities of a bookstore.
He wished to raise one other question. In the referenda that
were going to be authorized, would the decision be based upon the
majority of the students enrolled in the college or the majority
of those students who vote?
President Fleming responded that the decision would be based
on the majority of those voting in the particular school or college.
Regent Smith said that he had a particular preference for
Point b, that is, that each of the recognized student governments
in the sixteen schools and colleges in Ann Arbor conduct a referendum with the majority of those voting then determining the
decision for that school or college.
Regent Goebel said he wished to be emphatically clear that if
the bookstore were established it would be run by the University,




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969


101


specifically, by the Office of the Vice-President and Chief Financial
Officer.
President Fleming noted that the management of the store
would be the responsibility of the University inasmuch as one of
the questions of concern was that of financial responsibility in
case the bookstore did not succeed.
Regent Goebel further asked whether the administrative costs
-all overhead costs-would be charged against the operation.
President Fleming said that it was his understanding that the
cost of a manager for the bookstore would be attributable to the
expenses of the store, that in so far as that operation related to
Vice-President Pierpont's general structure, there were not additional costs allocated any more than there would be in other kinds
of auxiliary enterprises at the University. In effect, the store would
become an auxiliary enterprise, operated along the pattern of
other auxiliary enterprises at the University.
Regent Goebel wanted it to be explicitly clear, prior to the
various colleges' referenda, that the University could give no
assurance to the voting students that the University's bookstore
could, or would, offer prices lower than those offered in the Ann
Arbor private market.
Regent Smith responded by saying that whosoever was installed as manager with the advice and consent of the FacultyStudent Advisory Committee could decide whether or not it would
be possible to pass on discounts to the consumer. The decision
could be made at a particular time. He felt that there might be a
possibility for offering a discount.
Regent Goebel said he well understood that if the University
bookstore would show a profit, these savings would be passed on
to those making purchases. He predicted that the bookstore operation would provide many administrative headaches, which would
not be offset by the few, if any, advantages gained.
Regent Goebel further stated that the University's primary
responsibility was to educate and not to engage in commercial
operations. It should do so only in those instances where private
enterprise could not meet the needs of the University community.
Regent Goebel went on to say that he was opposed to placing
any University funds into this type of unnecessary commercial
operation, particularly in view of the fact that so many urgent
academic needs with high priorities were not being funded.
Regent Smith said that with respect to the monies from the
Student Vehicle Fund it was derived largely from funds collected
from students in the hope of improving student parking facilities.
As an overall proposition he would not contend that there was




102


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969


any account which belonged to a segment of the University, but
he thought if there could be such an account, the Student Vehicle
Account was such a one.
Regent Nederlander said he had one short comment to make:
that the people assembled to hear the discussion should realize the
amount of time and effort that had gone into the consensus proposition. He hoped that in deliberations in the future, particularly
ROTC, students would show a rational approach as the Regents
had tried to show in their deliberations on the bookstore. Although
all of the Regents were not completely happy with the end result,
he concluded, it was arrived at through mutual compromise in
trying to solve the problem.
Regent Huebner commented that she too was in favor of a
bookstore and would support any proposal that would bring about
such a result.
The motion was then put to a vote, with Regents Smith,
Huebner, Dunn, Nederlander and Lindemer voting yes, and
Regents Brown and Goebel voting no. The motion carried.
Since a faculty-student committee had been previously scheduled to appear before the Regents at 2:00 P.M., and the members
of this committee were present and prepared to discuss the
Regental bylaws, Regent Goebel offered a motion, which failed
of a second, to continue the Regents' meeting, as scheduled, and
then proceed to the Assembly Room in the Michigan Union to
discuss further the Regents' bookstore action.
With Regents Goebel and Brown voting no, a recess of one
hour was approved to enable the Regents to meet the members of
SGC and others to explain and answer questions regarding the
bookstore proposal approved earlier.
Subsequent to the above recess the Regents returned to the
Regents' Room and voted to adjourn.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents of the University for the month of July 1969 totaled
$618.65.
The Board adjourned to meet on October 16 and 17.

HONORARY DEGREES, AUGUST 10, 1969
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison and Herbert W. Hildebrandt
Voted May 16, 1969 (R.P., 1966-69, p. 1759)
DOCTOR OF LAWS
GEORGE WELLS BEADLE, geneticist, President Emeritus of
the University of Chicago, Director of the Institute for Biomedical
Research.
Mr. Beadle, having considered that genes control the growth
and development of all living organisms, raised the technical question
how these little potencies actually work. And he did not rest until he
had almost literally seen with his own eyes an individual gene controlling biosynthesis in an individual cell. For his accomplishments,
he has earned virtually every award possible to a biologist, including
a portion of a Nobel prize. Remaining committed also to the larger
communities of scientists and scholars, he has, in such capacities as
President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
and President of the University of Chicago, devoted his notable
resources of wisdom and geniality to the general public good.
It is a privilege to entertain this scientist and statesman and to
tender him the degree Doctor of Laws.
JASON LESTER HONIGMAN, Bachelor of Arts in the Class of
1924, Juris Doctor in 1926; Detroit lawyer.
Emigrating from Russia at the age of six, Mr. Honigman was
graduated with distinction from the Michigan Law School at twentyone, and proceeded to the eminently successful practice of corporate
and financial law. A landmark in his early career was his handling of
the Deep Rock Oil Case, which secured new rights for public stockholders as against controlling groups. As a leader of the Michigan
bar, he has inspired the successful movement for both procedural and
substantive reforms of state law, and has personally advised courts and
judges on legal procedure. The legal profession, the schools of law,
and the entire population of the State have benefited from this generous expense of time and talent.
The University takes cordial satisfaction in extending to this
gifted and devoted alumnus the degree of Doctor of Laws.

DOCTOR OF SCIENCE
WALTER THOMAS JAMES MORGAN, Professor of Biochemistry, Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, University of London.
We are schooled to think of nature as uniform in all its walks
and ways. Yet some novel medical techniques, of which organ transplants are the most dramatic, apprise even the laity of significant
variations within the human species. Professor Morgan, who has
studied the compounds distinguishing the several human blood-types,
has greatly extended our knowledge of the chemical bases of these
variations, supplying both goals of inquiry and techniques for smoothing the way to them. His fellows attest, furthermore, that he is as
generous in sharing scientific ideas as he is fertile in conceiving them.
When he is honored here next month at the International Symposium
on Blood and Tissue Antigens, it is fitting that this most eminent
and welcome guest possess the University of Michigan degree Doctor
of Science.

Appendix
MICHIGAN MENTAL RETARDATION RESEARCH CENTER
Program Statement
1. Introduction
The purpose of this statement is to outline the program concepts
inherent in the operation of Michigan Mental Retardation Research
Center. This is done for two distinct purposes: to inform the interested reader, and to provide a guideline for the Policy Committee
which will govern the operation of the Center. The statement is not intended to be definitive or immutable as a description of the Center's
purposes and guiding principles. Rather, it is intended to describe and
guide Center policy by outlining the intentions of those who had the responsibility of planning and authorizing the formation of the Center.
The research program of the Center will be focused on mental retardation and related health problems. Although the contributions of
individual staff members in a variety of disciplines will be important,
there will be an emphasis on interdisciplinary studies, especially those
which are not likely to be undertaken in the absence of this jointly conducted research program. This does not mean that the research program will be narrowly restricted. On the contrary, research will be
directed toward a variety of problems in order to improve the total
understanding of mental retardation and related health problems, and
to provide sound bases for carrying out service, training, and preventive functions. These problems will be both specific and generic to
mental retardation and related areas. Some will be peculiar to the
State of Michigan. Others, while derived from the needs of the state,
will have much broader implications.
In developing this statement, two questions, apart from the nature
and quality of the research program per se, seem critical. These
questions are relevant for almost any research organization, but have
not always been dealt with adequately in the past. First is the evaluation of the research program to insure that the goals of the Center are
being met. Second is the interaction between the Center research staff
and the practitioner in the field. These questions can best be addressed




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969


by including staff within the Center who have specific responsibilities
in these areas. Proposed approaches are outlined in Sections 2.3 and 3
below.
The Center will conduct research, disseminate research findings,
and provide a field setting for training researchers in mental retardation. Sections 2, 3, and 4 deal with these three functions in that order.
Section 2 is concerned with the content of the research, the interdisciplinary nature of the research approach, and the evaluation of the
research program.
Section 3 is concerned with the dissemination and use of research
findings, and with the need to bring the problems of practitioners to
the attention of researchers who might be able to help solve them.
Section 4 is concerned with training of the staff, including a program of visiting scholars; and training of students from participating
colleges and universities. These can be thought of as in-service and
pre-service training of research personnel, both of which are to be
considered as integral components of the Center's operation.
2. The Research Program
2.1  Disciplinary and interdisciplinary research will be directed
at (a) exploring, (b) understanding, and (c) integrating all aspects
of mental retardation and related health problems, e.g., uncovering
the causes of mental retardation, developing a more meaningful
taxonomy of the different syndromes of mental retardation, and
elucidating the basic biological and behavioral processes characterizing these syndromes. In addition, the research thrust will be
directed at how best to apply this knowledge to prevention, care,
rehabilitation, and education of the mentally retarded.
A close liaison will exist among all of the disciplines represented in the Center. Scientists in the Center will be challenged to
collaborate with colleagues in other disciplines. For example, a
fundamental concern of the Center might be the study of native
human intelligence, which is essential if scientists are to separate
those subjects who appear to be mildly retarded due primarily to
such factors as cultural-economic deprivation from those subjects
who have specific or general mental defects due to innate genetic
or organic causes. It is clear that in order to attack such a prob



SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969


175


lem, interdisciplinary collaboration is needed among geneticists,
neurochemists, neurophysiologists, behavioral psychologists, educational psychologists, sociologists, and representatives of other
relevant disciplines.
Another fundamental concern should be devising more effective training systems and techniques for the mentally retarded and
for the people who work with them. The theory and practice of
learning and teaching have developed significantly in the last ten
years. Center staff of all disciplines will collaborate to explore
the implications of these developments, to carry them still further,
and to apply them to the field of mental retardation. These efforts
will be strengthened by the availability of the staff and retarded
subjects at the Plymouth State Home and Training School, the staff
and resources of The University of Michigan, and the population
base concentrated in southeastern Michigan.
It will be the policy of the Center to draw upon the scientific
resources of all of the nearby universities and other facilities in a
full scale attack on mental retardation. For example, the role of
mutant genes and of genetic polymorphisms in producing different
syndromes of mental retardation should be investigated much more
fully. An outstanding resource for a collaborative effort is the
Department of Human Genetics of The University of Michigan
Medical School. Similarly, there are many other resources among
the various universities in the area, plus public and private residential facilities, a broad spectrum of educational programs, and
an extensive reservoir of skilled personnel readily available for
collaborative projects. Through the identification of and interaction
with these resources, the Center will promote an optimal research
effort in mental retardation while minimizing duplicative activities.
Factors to be considered in establishing program and project
priorities for the Center include:
1. relevance to the basic understanding and solution of
the problems of mental retardation;
2. excellence of experimental design;
3. combining the appropriate expertise in an interdisciplinary attack on the problem to be studied; and




176                 SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969
4. applicability to the immediate problems of mental
retardation.
Since the Center will provide an unusual opportunity for interdisciplinary research on mental retardation, the realization of
this opportunity will neither be left to chance nor to wishful thinking, but will be incorporated into the Center's mode of operation.
For example, in the recruitment of staff priority will be given to
senior scientists who have evidenced interest in, or are primarily
concerned with, collaborative research.
It should be noted that the preceding in no way precludes disciplinary research at the Center so long as it is appropriate to the
Center's programs.
2.2  Service Systems Research
The research program in this area will exploit the resources
of ecology, statistics, systems analysis and other relevant disciplines primarily to investigate the effectiveness of agencies and
service system patterns in meeting the needs of the retarded and
their families. It should be emphasized that the term agencies in
this context includes all organizations in the human services field.
Part of the service research function will be the accurate definition
of the characteristics and needs of individual retardates and relevant retarded populations (i.e., regional, state). The findings will
be used to describe and define guidelines for such things as: (1)
agency role definitions, (2) patterns of service, (3) staffing patterns,
(4) manpower training needs, (5) interrelationships of agency location and services, and (6) administrative and organizational systems.
2.3  Evaluation of the Research Program
The Center staff will continually and systematically evaluate
the Center's programs in order to determine how well the Center
is meeting the objectives for which it was established. These
evaluations will serve several functions. They will provide feedback to the staff as to the effectiveness of their activities and thus
make possible self-correcting procedures. They will identify gaps
or imbalances in the programs. They will assist those who make
program and budget decisions.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969                       177
The evaluative activities can be classified as: (1) periodic
evaluation by site visitors; (2) annual Center-wide self-evaluation;
and (3) individual project evaluation.
1. Site visits by distinguished persons not affiliated with
the Center will be scheduled for the purposes of observing and reviewing the activities of the Center. The resulting findings will be
reported to the staff and administration of the Center.
2. There will be a Center-wide system of annual evaluation,
using measures and procedures to be designed and implemented by
Center staff to determine if the research activities are appropriate
to the Center's mission and how well the activities are being performed.
3. Each researcher will evaluate his own research activities
in a systematic way, and will provide information and reports to the
Center administrators on the plans and progress of individual research projects.
The last two types of evaluation should rely heavily on quantitative measures to minimize subjective judgments which could be
shaped to suit special interests. The first category will be evaluations by scholars and other experts from appropriate disciplines
and professional fields. Site visits will be scheduled to observe
and discuss the activities of the Center, and reporting mechanisms
will be established to convey the findings of the visitors to the staff
and administration of the Center.
Assessment of the adequacy of Center facilities and support
should be included in all evaluations of the research program.
Modern technology should be exploited fully and continually, including access to whatever computer and other facilities might be needed.
3. Dissemination, Utilization, and Problem Input
A critical element of the Center's research program will be its
reference to practitioners and ongoing programs. The Center staff
must be aware of problem areas as seen by practitioners; the research
findings and implications must be brought to the attention of practitioners;
and the Center staff must assist in the application of research findings
to field settings.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969
The model for this component is the Extension Service of the
United States Department of Agriculture that operates through the land
grant colleges. Through this service, the results of agricultural research are transmitted to users in a form which allows them to be put
into practice. Similarly, the problems of the users are transmitted to
researchers in a form which allows them to be worked on. If this model
is followed, there must be staff in the Center responsible for translating
research findings to users and user problems to researchers.
As translators they must be able to work with the researcher and
his written materials, to select the findings which might be useful to
the practitioner, and to present them in a manner which will help insure
the understanding, acceptance, and use of these findings. On the other
hand, they must also be able to work with practitioners to help identify
their problems, select those which are pertinent to the researcher,
and present them to the researcher in a manner which will insure an
understanding of those problems.
To be most effective, the translator must be sufficiently knowledgeable about research and the areas of research to be fully acceptable to
researchers. He must also be sufficiently knowledgeable about practice
to be fully acceptable to practitioners. Thus the ideal translator must
be a special sort of person, knowledgeable about both research and
practice, but probably not a specialist in either area.
This is not to say that only specially equipped people are to be responsible for two-way communication between research and application,
or that the two-way communication cannot take place without them. Indeed, it may be that the function can be carried out by people whose
primary responsibilities are in research, practice, or administration.
Or it may be that translation is the primary responsibility of some,
and a secondary responsibility of others. In any case, the two-way
communication function is a specific responsibility of the Center. Accordingly, the Center will develop and evaluate the procedures, training,
and special staff required for this function.
4. Training in Research
In addition to conducting and disseminating research, the Center
will provide, under the aegis of the Institute for the Study of Mental Retardation of The University of Michigan, a field setting for training in




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969


179


research. In part, this will be for training the Center staff in the modes
of research of the Center, with particular emphasis on learning to be
comfortable with, and to make full use of, interdisciplinary collaboration. Equally important is the training of students to plan and conduct
research. The two can be thought of as in-service and pre-service
training, respectively.
In-service development of staff will include emphasis on such
things as interdisciplinary staff meetings, project critiques, and seminars. Visiting scholars will be brought in for lectures, demonstrations,
and special research projects. Outstanding scientists will be invited to
spend several months or years in residence at the Center, both to further their own research and to stimulate the staff of the Center by continual exposure to the finest minds in various fields. At least one outstanding visiting scholar should be in residence at any given time. The
visiting scholar program will probably be most effectively implemented
through The University of Michigan.
Students from many disciplines will be employed as research assistants or will participate as research trainees and fellows. Such participation might be part-time or full-time, for brief or extended periods.
In all cases, these people should be seen as students as well as assistants; as people who are there to learn as well as to help. Responsibility
for the education of these students must be accepted routinely as part of
the professional commitment of the various staff members. In this the
staff will work closely with the faculties of the colleges and universities
from which the students come.
5. Summary
This program statement is intended as a description of some of the
concepts underlying the operation of the Michigan Mental Retardation
Research Center. As such it is intended also to serve as a guide in
formulating Center policy. For this reason it is included by incorporation in the Memorandum of Agreement between the Michigan Department
of Mental Health and The University of Michigan, which prescribes the
organization and administration of the Center.
The program statement lists the three primary responsibilities of
the Center as the conduct of research, the dissemination of research




180                  SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1969
findings to practitioners, and the provision of a field setting for the
training of research personnel. Concepts underlying each area of responsibility are described.

VII. DEATHS
Secretary Hildebrandt reported the death on October 1, 1969,
of Thomas Francis, Jr., Henry Sewall University Professor of
Epidemiology. The following memoir was adopted:
This entire academic community joins the faculty in Public Health in
mourning the death of THOMAS FRANCIS, JR., on the first of October,
at the age of sixty-nine. Developer of the first effective vaccine for influenza,
he attained a general public prominence as a health scientist when he supervised the successful testing of the Salk polio vaccine.
After his graduation from Allegheny College in 1921, Dr. Francis compiled
a superior record at the Yale Medical School and remained in New Haven as
intern, as resident, and, for a year, as medical instructor. Serving successively
thereafter in the hospital of the Rockefeller Institute and in the International
Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation, he launched his distinguished
career in immunological research, laying the scientific groundwork for massive future programs of immunization from influenza. From 1938 to 1941 he
served as Professor of Bacteriology in New York University. In the latter
year he came to Ann Arbor to chair the Department of Epidemiology in the
newly founded School of Public Health, and he held that chairmanship until
his resignation from it last summer. In 1947 the University appointed him
also Henry Sewall University Professor of Epidemiology.


Resignations, etc.


Thomas Francis,
Jr., Memoir




192


OCTOBER MEETING, 1969


During the Second World War, Dr. Francis assisted in vast and complex
programs of investigation and immunization on behalf of the United States
Army. In 1954 and 1955, being one of few men who combined the necessary
administrative experience with expert knowledge in the field, he supervised
the nation-wide medical experiment which established as safe and effective the
polio vaccine developed by his former student Jonas Salk. In addition to
these dramatic accomplishments, he presided over an instructional program
ranging from the very general to the highly specialized, continued to build
upon his early interest in the immunology of influenza, and oversaw programs
of research on the basic structure of viruses, the virus etiology of cancer, and,
in recent years, the epidemiology of heart disease.
The scope of Dr. Francis' accomplishments was attested by the many
honors conferred on him. These came from sources civil and military, professional and academic, native and foreign. But his most signal honor, as seen
from the perspective of his University, is a strong and versatile department
which preserves the contours of his devotion and his gifts.
The sorrow of his colleagues is at once deepened and tempered by their
sense of his enduring achievement. The Regents of the University, even as
they mourn his death and tender their sympathy to Mrs. Francis and his son
and daughter, would make known that within the University he reached
fulfillment of an eminent and devoted life.
Edmund Wooding      Mr. Hildebrandt reported the death on September 27, 1969,
Memoir of Edmund Wooding, Professor of Journalism. The following
memoir was adopted:
The sudden death of EDMUND WOODING on the twenty-seventh of
September has deeply distressed his colleagues in the Department of Journalism and is keenly felt by all who have known him here during the past twenty
years. He possessed both expertness in the theory and practice of advertising
and a sense of values for transcending those of the market place.
Born in Hammondsport, New York, in December of 1914, he earned a
baccalaureate degree from Cornell University in 1937. Shortly thereafter he
entered the field of advertising in New York City. There he enjoyed an
increasing success, working on accounts like those for the Aluminum Company of America and International Telephone and Telegraph, and coining
phrases, such as "The Life you save may be your own," which have become
universally familiar. In 1949, he left the advertising profession at a significant
sacrifice to embark on a teaching career. Coming to The University of
Michigan as a Visiting Associate Professor of Journalism, he accepted a
permanent appointment at the end of his first year and was advanced to a
professorship in 1955.
In the Journalism Department, Professor Wooding virtually created a
curriculum in advertising and public relations, undertaking the needful
coordination with other units of the University and with practicing professionals. Concurrently, he continued to examine the place of advertising in the
American economy and society, and the educational purposes which a
course of training in mass communications should fulfill. All the collateral
duties which fell to his lot, moreover-within his department, his school, and
the University-he carried out with grace, fidelity, and good cheer.
His skill and far-ranging knowledge are hard indeed to replace. His
wisdom and integrity, bearing the stamp of a highly individual intellect
and character, are entirely irreplaceable. The Regents of the University pay
grateful tribute both to his talents and to his personal devotion as they join
his fellows in mourning his untimely death. And they extend a deep and
sincere sympathy to Mrs. Wooding, his children, and his other surviving kin.

RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN AUTHORIZING THE BORROWING
OF FUNDS FOR COMPLETION OF THE
UNIVERSITY LAUNDRY BUILDING
WHEREAS, The Regents of the University of Michigan in the exercise
of its constitutional duties has determined that it is necessary and expedient
to construct, furnish, and equip a building on the North Campus to be
known as the University Laundry Building to provide laundry services to
the University Medical Center, the Residence Halls, the Michigan Union, the
Michigan League, and other University departments requiring such services;
and
WHEREAS, it is anticipated that the costs incidental to such construction
and to the furnishing and equipping of said Building, as set forth in the
approved Project budget, will be $1,586,000; and
WHEREAS, in the opinion of the said Regents it is necessary and
expedient that it borrow by means of a commercial bank loan the sum of
$800,000 to be used by it, together with other funds available, in paying the
costs incidental to the construction and to the furnishing and equipping of
said Building; and
WHEREAS, there has been submitted for consideration of this Board a
proposed Term Loan and Security Agreement whereby the sum of $800,000
may be borrowed from National Bank and Trust Company of Ann Arbor and
Ann Arbor Bank for a term of approximately 7'2 years starting November 1,
1969;
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved That The Regents of the University of
Michigan borrow for such purposes the sum of $800,000 from the National
Bank and Trust Company of Ann Arbor, a national banking corporation, and
Ann Arbor Bank, a Michigan banking corporation, upon the terms and
conditions more fully set forth in the Term Loan and Security Agreement,
hereinafter referred to as the Agreement. Said loan is to be for a term of
approximately 7X2 years starting November 1, 1969, at an interest rate of
6 per cent per annum for so long as the interest payable hereunder is exempt
from federal and state income tax. From and after the effective date of the
removal of the tax exemption, the interest rate payable hereunder shall be
7I2 per cent per annum. In the event the tax exemption is removed in part
from time to time, an equitable adjustment will be made to equate the




196


OCTOBER MEETING, 1969


effective interest rate hereunder to the 72 per cent interest rate. The repayment of this loan is to be secured by a pledge of the Net Income derived
from the operation of the University Laundry; and
Be It Further Resolved That The Regents of the University of Michigan
will charge and collect from the budgeted funds of the University Medical
Center, the Residence Halls, the Michigan Union, the Michigan League, and
any other University departments using the Laundry Facilities amounts
sufficient to pay the installments of principal and interest on said loan as they
fall due. The University further covenants and agrees that it will charge and
collect as aforesaid for laundry services amounts sufficient so that the Net
Income from the Project shall not be less than $145,000 per year; and
Be It Further Resolved That the interest and principal payments accruing during the term shall be paid from the Net Income as defined in the
Agreement; provided, however, the University reserves the right to prepay
the Notes in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Agreement;
and
Be It Further Resolved That Wilbur K. Pierpont, Vice-President of The
Regents of the University of Michigan, and Herbert W. Hildebrandt, its
Secretary, be and they are hereby authorized, empowered, and directed in the
name of The Regents of the University of Michigan and as its corporate act
and deed to execute and enter into a Term Loan and Security Agreement and
separate Promissory Notes in the amount of $400,000 to each of the Banks
substantially in the form as that submitted herewith; and
Be It Further Resolved, That the said officers be and they are hereby
authorized, empowered, and directed for and in the name of The Regents of
the University of Michigan and as its corporate act and deed to make, consent
to, and agree to any changes in the terms and conditions of said Term Loan
and Security Agreement and Promissory Notes which they may deem necessary, expedient, and proper prior to or at the time of execution of the said
Agreement and Notes, but no such amendment shall change the provisions
therein for the amount to be borrowed, the interest to be paid thereon, the
payments required to be made, or the security pledged; provided, however,
nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting the right of said
officers to alter or change the date of issue of said Notes, the date of payment
of interest, or the dates fixed for payments in the said Agreement; and
Be It Further Resolved That the said officers, in the execution of said
Agreement and Notes, shall not pledge the credit of or create any liability on
the part of the State of Michigan, The Regents of the University of Michigan,
or any member or officer of this Board, or any of their successors, other than
to pledge the Net Income of the Project defined; and
Be It Further Resolved That the proposed Term Loan and Security
Agreement and Notes as presented to the Regents are hereby approved as to
form and substance and that they be incorporated in the minutes of this
meeting; and
Be It Further Resolved That should it develop that Wilbur K. Pierpont,
Vice-President of The Regents of the University of Michigan, through
illness, absence, or otherwise, be unable to perform the acts he is herein
authorized, empowered, and directed to perform, then in that case, Herbert
W. Hildebrandt, Secretary of The Regents of the University of Michigan, is
hereby authorized, empowered, and directed to perform any and all acts and
deeds herein authorized and directed to be performed by said Wilbur K.
Pierpont, and any action so taken by said Herbert W. Hildebrandt shall be
as binding on The Regents of the University of Michigan as if performed by
said Wilbur K. Pierpont; and

Be It Further Resolved That should it develop that Herbert W. Hildebrandt, Secretary of The Regents of the University of Michigan, through
illness, absence, or otherwise be unable to perform the acts he is herein

I hereby certify that the foregoing is a full, true, and correct copy of a
resolution, and the whole thereof, of The Regents of the University of

WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the University, in the exercise of its constitutional duties,
has determined that it is necessary and expedient that it construct, furnish
and equip a building on the North Campus of The University of Michigan
to be known as the University Laundry Building to provide laundry services

budget, will be $1,586,000; and
WHEREAS, the University, by proper resolution, has determined to
borrow by means of a commercial bank loan the sum of $800,000 which,
together with other available funds, shall be used by it for paying the costs
incidental to the construction, furnishing and equipping of said building; and
WHEREAS, the Banks are willing to make the said loan for the said
purposes upon the terms and conditions more fully set forth herein;
Now, Therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein contained, the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:

signed, $800,000. Such loan shall be evidenced by a note of the University
to each of the Banks in the amount of $400,000 in the form annexed as
Exhibit A, bearing the date as of which this Agreement shall be signed, and
maturing and bearing interest as provided in Exhibit A, and payable solely
from the funds and in the manner herein stipulated (such notes are herein
sometimes referred to as the "Notes").
Section 2.

Net Income. The term "Net Income" as used herein shall mean and
include all income received and to be received from operation of the laundry
by the University from charges made for laundry service to the University
Medical Center, the University Residence Halls, the Michigan Union, the
Michigan League, and other University departments and collected from the
budgeted funds of these departments, after deducting from the aggregate
thereof the actual expenses of operation, administration costs (consistent
with heretofore established accounting procedures, but excluding all general
administrative expenses of the University), ordinary maintenance of and
ordinary repairs to the Project and equipment, and a properly allocated
share of charges for insurance for the Project and equipment.
Section 3.
Prepayment of the Notes
Upon five business days' notice, the University may from time to time
prepay the Notes in whole or in part by paying the principal amount so to be
prepaid, together with accrued interest. In making any payments to the
Banks herein provided for, the University reserves the right to use any
funds in its possession which it may appropriate for that purpose. No such

applied to installments of principal of the Notes in the inverse order of their
maturities: Provided, however, that the minimum partial prepayment made
hereunder shall be $10,000; and Provided further that, in the event that the
Notes are prepaid in full within two years from the date hereof with funds

Halls, the Michigan Union, the Michigan League, and other University
departments requiring such services.
b) That it will at all times charge and collect from the budgeted funds of

The Banks shall have a first lien upon the Net Income, as defined above,
as security for the payment in full of the Notes and for the performance of
the covenants hereof from and after the date when the Project shall be placed
in operation, and the University hereby assigns and pledges to the Banks and
grants to the Banks a security interest in all of said Net Income for the

above, shall be security for or be levied upon or sold to satisfy this loan.
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant, stipulation, or agreement contained in this Agreement or the Notes annexed hereto shall be had
against the State of Michigan, or against the corporate body known as The
Regents of the University of Michigan, except the remedies provided in

at its main office in the City of Ann Arbor, Michigan, the sum of Four
Hundred Thousand ($400,000) Dollars, together with interest thereon at the

from time to time, an equitable adjustment will be made to equate the effective interest rate hereunder to the 7'2 per cent interest rate. Payment shall
be as follows:
Accrued interest on May 1, 1970, and $36,250 on November 1, 1970, and
a like sum on the first day of each May and November of each succeeding

XI. OTHER    ITEMS
There was consensus regarding recommendations on the Flint
and Dearborn reports, with the matter to be discussed again.
The following statement was made by Regent Lindemer and
was concurred in by the other Regents:
The Regents have discussed from time to time improvements in communications between various elements of the on-campus University community. We are pleased at the reasoned and constructive interchange of ideas that
have occurred from time to time and recognize that some enforcement may
be beneficial in providing the occasion for such interchange. All of us have
varying ideas. Regent Dunn and others have expressed viewpoints which go
further than what I am to suggest. However, we have agreed to request that
you (the President) undertake to establish a regular period of approximately
one and one-half hours during the Thursday afternoon of our monthly
meetings for a conference between the Regents and representatives of the
faculty and students. We think the structure might approximate that of
yesterday afternoon. Our hope is that this will afford those who want to
convey ideas or opinions to the Regents the opportunity to do so, and
enable all participants to ask questions and volunteer answers. We hope this
can commence at the November meeting.
The following recommendations were approved:
(1) The title of the Vice-President for University Relations be changed
to the Vice-President for University Relations and Development.
This will give recognition at the executive level to the importance
of development and acknowledge by title what already exists in fact.
(2) The name of the University's central fund-raising office be changed
from Development Council to Development Office, since the term
"Development Council" under the new charter refers to the volunteer group and not the staff office.
(3) Authorization and funding be provided for the expansion of the
Development professional staff by the addition of new staff positions concerned with annual giving, deferred giving, prospect
research, and related clerical and stenographic support.
Approval was given to authorize a change in the designation of
the Center for Comparative Ancient and Modern Studies (p. 21)
to the Center for Coordination of Ancient and Modern Studies.
Approval was given to change the name of the Department of
English in the College of Engineering to the Department of Humanities, effective immediately.
A discussion was held on the subject of the report of the
Advisory Committee on Recreation, Intramurals, and Club Sports.
A discussion of conduct regulations was held with Deans Hays,
Robertson, and Van Wylen.

Regent Smith said the matter of the bookstore had again fully Bookstore
been discussed. Yesterday, he said, a wholesome interchange on
the subject was held between the Regents, students, and members
of SACUA. To that end, he was prepared to recommend the
following:




204


OCTOBER MEETING, 1969


A majority of the Regents continue to support a bookstore.
They will approve modifications in the plan they adopted in the September meeting in accordance with suggestions developed by faculty and students
under the leadership and coordination of SACUA subject to development of
the details thereof, provided:
1. The proposed non-profit corporation qualifies on its sale of books and
supplies for the sales tax exemption, and
2. The University is to be insulated from any liability.
Regent Brown wondered if one of the faculty members in the
audience could answer the question of the need for another bookstore in Ann Arbor.
Professor Knauss said the service was adequate, but that there
was a desire for more competition, a desire to make use of the nonprofit features, and a desire to take advantage of the sales tax
exemption.
Regent Brown also wondered whether the faculty had made
any additional studies of need beyond that which the students had
made. Professor Knauss indicated that he thought that was right,
but he said there were studies done by other groups.
The motion when put to a vote was approved, Regents Smith,
Huebner, Dunn, Lindemer and Nederlander voting yes, and
Regents Goebel, Brown and Cudlip voting no.
President Fleming then said that there were some unresolved
problems. First, no one had asked the tax commission whether the
form proposed would qualify for the four per cent exemption.
Everyone, President Fleming went on to say, desired to have
that exemption, and the format should be such in order to
achieve it.
The second reservation was that the University should be
insulated from any liability. Thus, in essence, what the resolution
stated was that the Regents were prepared to approve modifications in their September plan to meet the proposal advanced
yesterday by the joint student-faculty group provided the above
two reservations were cleared up.
He emphasized that if on exploration one could not do those
two things-the tax commission not permitting the absence of a
four per cent sales tax-then everyone would look again at the
situation. Furthermore, if the proposal presented on insulating the
University from liability did not work out, some other way must
be sought.
Meanwhile, all the other things which the proposal spoke to,
for example, the student referendum on the five-dollar deposit, the
discussions with faculty and how they would subscribe could
proceed. The escheat question raised yesterday could perhaps be




OCTOBER MEETING, 1969


205


handled by a properly drafted statement. In brief, said the President, a lot of floating details still had to be resolved.
Regent Cudlip stated that he was concerned with the question
of liability: he hoped the University would receive an independent
opinion on the matter.
Regent Smith said that the resolution passed as of last month
still stood; what the statement today did was amend the plan voted
upon last month. He was in support of the proposal, but wanted it
also to be made clear that certain questions had to be answered
before proceeding further.
A discussion on Chapter VII of the Bylaws was held between
the Regents and the following committee members: Professors
Galler and Knauss, and students Martin McLaughlin, William
Price, Robert Nelson, and Chris Block.
The following resolution was approved:
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate and welcome
Dr. Clifton Wharton as fourteenth President of Michigan State University.
The Regents congratulate the Trustees of Michigan State University on
selection of a scholar who also has a record of public service.
We pledge anew the cooperation of this University in the mutual endeavor
of serving State and Nation.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents of the University for the month of September 1969 totaled
$467.59.
The Regents adjourned to meet on November 20 and 21.

of my estate which would have gone to the Alma S. Hofmann Foundation
unto The Regents of the University of Michigan and I direct that such

the Arnold E. Hofmann Memorial Scholarship Fund, the income from each
fund to be awarded needy students as tuition grants of not more than one
thousand dollars per student per scholastic year, all in accordance with such

W. E. Stirton   The Secretary, Mr. Hildebrandt, reported the retirement of
William  E. Stirton. The following memoir was adopted:
WILLIAM EDWARD STIRTON, who concluded a distinguished career
in education and public affairs by serving for twelve years as Vice-President
of the University and for ten years as Director of the Dearborn Campus,
has completed his retirement furlough and is eligible for an emeritus
appointment.
Mr. Stirton was born in Imlay City, but was schooled at Cass Technical
High School in Detroit. Entering the Engineering College of the University
in 1920, he was graduated in course in Electrical Engineering, worked
for a year at Michigan Bell Telephone Company, and then, in 1925, returned
to Cass Technical High School as an instructor. To equip himself the better
for his duties, he undertook further university work in education here and at
Wayne, earning a master's degree from the University in 1927. He holds also
honorary degrees from three area schools.
During a twenty-five year career at "Cass Tech," Mr. Stirton was
successively teacher, counselor, assistant principal, and principal, with an
intervening stint as Director of Vocational Training for War Production in
the Detroit area. In 1950, he joined the administrative staff at Wayne
University, and two years later became Vice-President there. In 1956 The
University of Michigan extended him an appointment as Vice-President.
In 1958 he assumed charge of the unique program of the new Dearborn
Campus.
Mr. Stirton's public service in Detroit and the state of Michigan is a
source of admiration and almost of awe. He was a director of the Family
Service Society and of related organizations, a manager of civic festivals,
and a trustee, committeeman or member of the Great Lakes Commission, the
St. Lawrence Seaway Commission, the Wayne County Board of Supervisors,
the Youth Guidance Commissions of the City, County, and State, the
Metropolitan Commission on Aging, the Michigan Council on Economic
Education, the Detroit Council of Churches, the Economic Club of Detroit,
and the Public Relations Society of America. He was president, also, of the
Detroit Schoolmen's Club, the Michigan Schoolmaster's Club, the Engineering Society of Detroit, and the Vocational Guidance Association of Metropolitan Detroit. Shortly before joining the University staff, he led an ICA
survey party to Thailand and Indonesia to inquire into education there.




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1969

Within the University, his energy, skill, and wide acquaintance proved
of daily advantage in state and area relations. His offices on behalf of the
Dearborn Campus established the nexus of industrial ties supporting the
terms of work for the student body, and his concurrent devotion to educational values sustained the needful academic balance in this eminently successful and widely admired venture. The fund of geniality and kindness
which facilitated these accomplishments, furthermore, earned him enduring
friendships throughout the University community.
The Regents of the University are grateful for his services and respectful
of his achievements. They tender him as well their affectionate personal good
wishes as they appoint him Vice-President Emeritus of the University and
Director Emeritus of the Dearborn Campus.
President Fleming said additionally that he and the other
Regents wanted again to recognize the distinguished service given
by Mr. Stirton to the University.
VII. DEATHS
Secretary Hildebrandt reported the death on October 30, 1969,
of Richard A. Deno, Professor of Pharmacognosy. The following
memoir was adopted:
The faculty and students of the College of Pharmacy are deeply grieved  R. A. Deno
by the death of RICHARD ANTHONY DENO, for seventeen years Profes-      Memoir
sor of Pharmacognosy, on the thirtieth of October at the age of sixty-three.
A native of Holly, Michigan, and a graduate in pharmacy from Ferris
Institute in Big Rapids, Professor Deno earned a baccalaureate degree from
the University in 1930 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1935. He taught
then for rather brief periods at Bowling Green State University and the
Medical College of Virginia, and for a longer period at Rutgers University,
where he became Professor of Biological Sciences. Returning to Michigan in
1952, he committed himself wholeheartedly to pharmaceutical education
and quickly won the affectionate esteem of his fellows. His sincere concern
for students was expressed through his close personal involvement with
trainees in pharmacy and through his service on the Student Relations
Committee of the faculty Senate. His unique textbook, The Profession of
Pharmacy, enhanced his national influence. He held high offices, as well, in
national associations concerned with pharmaceutical training.
The Regents of the University join his colleagues in mourning the death,
and honoring the memory, of this gifted, kindly, and devoted man. And
they extend to his surviving relatives their sincere condolence.
Mr. Hildebrandt reported the death on November 10, 1969, of
Karl Litzenberg, Professor of English. The following memoir was
adopted:
A career of able and versatile service to the University was cut short by  Karl Litzenberg
the sudden death of KARL LITZENBERG, on the tenth of November, in      Memoir
the sixty-fifth year of his age. He had taught in the Department of English
for more than forty years.
A native of Minneapolis and a graduate of the University of Minnesota,
Professor Litzenberg came to Ann Arbor in 1928 to pursue post-graduate
study in English literature. He began to teach here in the following year,
and, after earning his doctoral degree in 1933, he rose through the several
ranks to a professorship in 1949. During a four-year period from 1939 to
1943, he was Director of Residence Halls, in which capacity he was a
principal architect of the widely admired Michigan House Plan. From 1943




220


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1969


through 1945 he served as a lieutenant and, later, lieutenant commander in
Naval Aviation.
Professor Litzenberg's scholarly interests ranged between Victorian
England and his ancestral Scandinavia. He studied and subsequently lectured
at the University of Copenhagen, and enjoyed the unique distinction of
chairing, at different times, both the Victorian English and the Scandinavian
sections of the Modern Language Association. His latest published works were
delicate and precise translations of Danish prose and poetry.
On campus he willingly assumed a diversity of duties and carried them
out with efficiency and devotion. He was chairman, for varying periods, of
the Honors Program and the Graduate Committee of his Department, and
the Curriculum Committee and the Dearborn Campus Committee of his
College. He served also on the Executive Committee of the Graduate School,
the Senate Advisory Committee, the Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics, the Committee on Radio and Television, and the Executive Committee of the Alumni Association.
In his public demeanor he preserved a certain courtliness-the relique,
perhaps, of a formal Scandinavian heritage. Yet in all personal relations he
exhibited a signal generosity and kindliness visible to colleagues and students
alike. His loss is poignantly felt by his immediate fellows and sorrowfully
acknowledged by a host of friends of both town and gown. The Regents of
the University, too, mourn his death, honor his memory, and extend their
sincere sympathy to Mrs. Litzenberg and to his sons and his daughter.
Mr. Hildebrandt reported the death on October 18, 1969, of
Kenneth L. Yourd, Assistant Dean of the Law School. The following memoir was adopted:
K. L. Yourd       It is a sad obligation to acknowledge the death of KENNETH LYTHE
Memoir         YOURD, Assistant Dean of the Law School, on the eighteenth of October at
the age of fifty-eight.
Holding the degrees Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor from the University, Mr. Yourd practiced law in Illinois and New York, earned a Master of
Laws degree from Harvard University, and served in a number of capacities
with the Columbia Broadcasting System, becoming at length Director of
Network Business Affairs. In 1953 he returned to Ann Arbor as an official of
the National Educational Television Center, and, when the Center moved to
New York in 1962, he chose to remain here and join the University staff. He
carried out administrative offices in the Medical School for four years and in
the Law School until his death. In the Law School he became in effect dean
of students, and was given an academic appointment as Assistant Dean in
the summer of last year.
Kenneth Yourd was sound of judgment, efficient in controlling detail,
responsible in all duties, and gracious in his personal associations. His fellows
in the Law faculty, the students whose interests he ably and earnestly served,
and his many friends in the Ann Arbor community are deeply saddened by
his untimely death. The Regents of the University, too, mourn his passing
and extend to Mrs. Yourd, his children, and other members of his family,
their deep and heartfelt sympathy.
H. M. Randall's    Vice-President Norman indicated that Professor Harrison M.
Death Noted    Randall, long since retired from   the University (R.P., 1939-42,
p. 512), had died on November 10, 1969. He said that with Professor Randall's death the University had lost a great name and a
distinguished researcher.

The Board denied the appeal of Stephen Dudley Stitt from
classification as a nonresident student.
Discussions were held on matters pertaining to ROTC and to
Extension Services activities in the Upper Peninsula and at
Port Huron.
In conjunction with the appointment of Vice-President Spurr
(p. 217), the President proposed that the following amended
recommendations concerning the Flint and Dearborn report be
approved:
1. That the University commit itself to the continued support of a strong
four-year undergraduate program at Flint, and the expansion of the
Dearborn program to a full four-year undergraduate program. In making
this recommendation, it is understood that there are special difficulties in
this respect at Dearborn, that there are many sensitivities involved, and
that care must be taken to proceed amicably. The question of spin-off for
Dearborn should remain open for the time being.
2. That the University proceed to develop master's level programs where
appropriate and justified at each campus, and that phased steps to place
these programs under local control be taken as quickly as possible, on terms
to be developed jointly with the Rackham School.
3. That the separate budget status of Dearborn be acknowledged, and that a
gradually phased move toward the same status for Flint be undertaken.
4. That, as developments warrant, the University move towards a chancellor
system at Flint and Dearborn subject to two qualifications: (1) that
faculty and student representatives be afforded an opportunity to participate in the process of choosing a chancellor, and (2) that the retirement
at 65 rule, presently in effect for Executive Officers on the Ann Arbor
campus, be applied to chancellors.
5. That the administrative relationship of the two branch campuses to Ann
Arbor be re-examined, with a view towards: (1) providing more time and
attention from the University administration to assist in the solutions of
the development of the branch campuses, and (2) maximizing the potential interrelationships in administrative and educational areas to achieve
both quality and economy. (Specifically, high-cost, low enrollment courses
at the two campuses should not be offered without exploring the potential
for providing such educational service out of Ann Arbor. Likewise, computer, TV, and other services from Ann Arbor should be exploited.)
6. That in the development of educational programs at the two campuses,
neither be committed to traditional departmental or college lines and that

emphasis be placed upon innovative programs particularly related to area
and community problems.
7. That similar cognizance of the educational programs and the educational
needs of the geographic area served be taken in the development of admissions standards and practices.
8. That within these general guidelines, the Executive Officers proceed with
the implementation of the Study Reports.
Approval was given to the above recommendations.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents of the University for the month of October 1969 totaled
$773.59.
The Regents adjourned to meet on December 18 and 19.

The President stated that the question of ROTC had been on        President's Statethe agenda for the Regents and that he had distributed to them        men
the following document:
TO:        The Regents
FROM:       R. W. Fleming, President
DATE:       December 16, 1969
SUBJECT: ROTC Proposals
The first ROTC unit was established at The University of Michigan in
1919. In the intervening 51 years, approximately 5,000 students have received
both an undergraduate degree and a commission. Despite occasional differences of opinion, the years have been characterized by mutual respect. It was,
in fact, the willingness of the Services to locate training programs on campus
during World War II which enabled the University to utilize its facilities
while at the same time maximizing educational opportunities for those who
were being called into service.
In recent months both the Services and the Universities have been reviewing ROTC programs on campuses. Some of the sensitive questions, e.g.
whether military personnel should have professorial titles, whether credit
should be given for all ROTC courses, etc., are matters of long-standing dispute. Others, such as the extent to which the University should provide
financial support for the ROTC program, are more recent, mostly because of
severe financial pressure on academic institutions and the fact that other
federal programs on campus carry funds with which to meet expenses such as
those for supporting staff and supplies.
The University of Michigan faculty recently made a thorough study and
report on ROTC. This report has been widely misunderstood. It did not
recommend abolition of ROTC on campus. The faculty committee did not
allow its view of the proper place of ROTC to be skewed by present emotions
over the war. In that connection, it is important to repeat two key paragraphs
from the report:
We have found, in short, that one man's moral position is another
man's propaganda, and that both the retention and the rejection of
ROTC programs are open to symbolic evaluation, whereby support
or condemnation of something else is intended. The question then
becomes whether we should comment on extra-University problems
symbolically by manipulation of our own institutions, or whether it
might not be more fruitful to attack those problems directly. The
members of the Committee have strong feelings about the war, about
militarism, about the University's responsibility before the state and
the country. But we are not persuaded that either to confirm or to
reject the ROTC programs on this basis is to accomplish anything.
The University should be made aware of the limits of action if we
turn our back and leave the training of officers to others. The ROTC
programs can be removed from the campus by abrogation of the
contracts on one year's notice. We will have washed our hands of
them, which some will welcome, but ROTC as an institution will continue elsewhere. Not only do some 375 colleges and universities




240


DECEMBER MEETING, 1969


throughout the country maintain one or more ROTC units, but still
others have applied to open new programs as they become available.
If the University expels its units, there will be no effective result as far
as the larger questions of the role of the military in this country are
concerned. Those questions ought indeed to be pursued with all vigor,
our concerns made known, and action of every kind undertaken to
ensure that the power of the University is exercised against improper
military influence in our society. But the ejection of the ROTC programs from the University will have no more than a symbolic significance. To suppose that such will "strike a blow at the workings of
the military," as some of our campus literature has argued, is an
illusion. Even if ROTC were abandoned everywhere, officers will
continue to be trained, at greater cost to the nation.
The faculty report recommended, in the alternative, that several changes
be made in present ROTC contracts or that ROTC programs be reconstituted
as extracurricular activities. It is the view of the Executive Officers that the
first of these alternatives should be adopted. Toward that end, the specific
recommendations are now stated, along with our own comments on them.
Recommendation I, A, is "that the military departments of the University
be replaced by 'programs' without departmental status."
Comment:
This recommendation does not appear to raise any particular
problems, and there is reason to suppose that it is acceptable to the
Services. It is true that ROTC units are not parallel with the normal
concept of a "department" as the term is understood within a university. There are many "programs" at the University which do not
have departmental status, e.g. Centers, Institutes, Laboratories, etc.,
and they are nevertheless highly respected parts of the academic
community.
Recommendation I, B, is "that staff members of the ROTC programs be
recognized by their military titles, academic titles being granted only to those
holding regular appointments in a school or college."
Comment:
The acceptance of this recommendation will remove a longfestering sore between the academic community and the military.
Both military and professorial titles are respected, but the qualifications for one are normally not the qualifications for the other.
The change represents no "downgrading" of position. Throughout
the University there are highly skilled people who make great contributions to the institution, but who do not hold academic titles.
Examples would be found in scientific laboratories, service operations,
business affairs, etc. The recommendation contemplates that some
military officers might have qualifications which would result in joint
appointments with a department. In such cases, a professorial title
would ensue. This is the normal situation. The highly respected Institute for Social Research, for instance, has many extremely able staff
people who do not have professorial titles. But it has others who have
a professorial joint-appointment with one or another department.
There is reason to suppose that this recommendation is acceptable
to the Services.
Recommendation I, C, is "that the Department of Defense maintain its
own services, or reimburse the University for services at full cost. Space for
the programs should be provided at the rental obtaining locally for comparable commercial property."




DECEMBER MEETING, 1969


241


Comment:
Budgeted out-of-pocket expenditures for ROTC in the year
1969-70, amounted to $53,229. If DOD were to reimburse the
University for heat, light, power, water, custodial services, etc., an
additional $35,859 would be required. In round numbers, this adds
up to about $89,000. In addition, the recommendation suggests that
space be provided at normal local rentals. In the case of ROTC,
depending upon how one calculates the use of the building, this
could add another one to two hundred thousand dollars. In order to
maintain the present ROTC programs on campus, the Department of
Defense is currently spending approximately $980,000, including over
$400,000 for scholarships, stipends, and books for students enrolled
in the programs.
In asking the Defense Department to reimburse the University for
the full cost of the program, the faculty is making neither a capricious
nor a unique request. A study commissioned by the Defense Department itself (the so-called Benson Report) makes such a recommendation, and both the National Association of State Universities and
Land-Grant Colleges, and the Association of American Universities
have passed strong resolutions making the same request.
There is nothing either anti-military or hostile to ROTC in a
request for full federal funding. In the years since ROTC programs
were initiated on campuses, training programs of all sorts have come
into being at universities supported by federal funds. The perfectly
normal practice is to include with such training programs an institutional allowance which is designed to compensate the University for
the kind of expenses now sought in connection with ROTC. It is
difficult for a faculty to understand why extremely tight university
resources should be expended in support of ROTC programs when
in practically every other area of their relationship with federal funding such costs are recognized as perfectly legitimate.
The Services are known to be sympathetic to the faculty request.
The Secretary of Defense has stated publicly that he has the question
under review. We have been advised that the Secretary wishes to
discuss this question with representatives of higher education.
Since there is every evidence that both the Services and the
Universities wish to resolve the problem of cost reimbursement, the
Regents can accept the recommendation that cost reimbursement be
sought and that negotiations toward that end be undertaken. The
assumption that an agreement can be reached should be indulged.
Recommendation I, D, is that "a new University-wide ROTC Committee be established, composed of student, faculty and administration members,
with the following responsibilities (of which the first two are to be taken
out of the sole jurisdiction of the military):
(a) Evaluation of the qualifications and approval of the appointment to
the University staff of all ROTC personnel, with a particular charge
to encourage the appointment of instructors with better academic
qualifications, more teaching experience, and a stronger inclination
toward scholarly research than has been the case hitherto.
(b) General supervision of the curricula of the several ROTC programs.
(c) Mediation in all matters brought to its attention with respect to the
status of students enrolled in the ROTC program.




242


DECEMBER MEETING, 1969


Comment:
Another of the long-festering sores between the academic community and the military has been the matter of staff appointments
and curricula development. In any other area of the University,
teaching appointments and course approvals would come through
the academic community. For historical reasons, the pattern has
been different in ROTC.
To some extent, we already have what the Committee asks for.
That is, there has long been an ROTC committee which has approved
or disapproved ROTC commandants as they have been suggested.
Proposed appointees have not automatically been accepted, and there
are on record a number of rejections. Interviews and vita files for
such personnel have long been required. The ROTC Committee has,
to a lesser extent also provided curricula supervision and mediation
of student problems. The substance of the faculty recommendation
is that a new University-wide committee perform this function, and
that its authority extend deeper into the program than it has in
the past.
The report does not speak to the questions of how the members
of the new Committee are to be chosen, and their procedures. Presumably they are to be appointed by the Regents on recommendation
of the President. It would seem obvious that those appointed should
be sympathetic with an ROTC program, since nowhere else in the
University would one appoint to such a committee one who was
opposed to the program. It would seem equally obvious that major
representation should come from the schools and colleges which
provide the principal enrollment, since it is their students who are
interested. The pattern of enrollment in ROTC during the current
year is as follows:
Engineering              238
LS&A                     164
Law                       48
Graduate                  18
Natural Resources         17
Business Administration   16
Architecture and Design    8
Education                  4
Music                      1
Public Health              1
Presumably, the procedures applicable to personnel selection and
curriculum development and administration, would be the normal
university procedures. There would appear to be no major problems
in accepting this recommendation, and in appointing the committee
with the functions suggested.
Recommendation I, E, is "that the several schools and colleges allow
credit only for courses taught by instructors holding regular academic
appointments."
Comment:
This recommendation is addressed to the various faculties, and is
not presently before the Regents. If and when proposed changes
appear at the college levels, they will once again come before the
Regents. Though credit for ROTC courses toward his degree is
obviously an incentive to the student to enroll, such credit is not




DECEMBER MEETING, 1969


243


necessarily decisive. There are three things to remember about the
credit aspect of ROTC. The first is that the military has increasingly
substituted regular university courses for ROTC courses and credit.
This practice will continue, and probably accelerate. The second is
that the Engineering College has for years given a maximum of four
hour's credit towards the degree for ROTC (often Engineering students get no credit), yet students from that college continue to constitute the largest single representation in the program. Likewise, the
Law School and the Graduate School give no degree credit at the
present time. LS&A has given twelve hours, and can be expected to
reduce this total, perhaps even eliminate it. The third thing is that
an ROTC course, though not counting towards a degree, is recorded
on the transcript as evidence that the course has been completed.
This practice finds its parallel in college procedures under which only
X number of hours in a given area count towards the degree but
other courses in that area appear on the transcript.
The key to a successful ROTC program on campus does not lie
in whether or not credit toward graduation is given. Thus there is
nothing to be feared from leaving the power of decision in the various
colleges, subject only to the approval of the Regents.
Upon hearing the President discuss the above statement in          Resolution on
some detail the following resolution was moved and supported:          R.O.T.C.
WHEREAS, The University of Michigan and the Reserve Officers Training
Corps have worked together cooperatively for more than fifty years; and a
continuance of the relationship is desired, and
WHEREAS, Both the Department of Defense of the United States and
Educational Associations representing all the colleges and universities of the
country have for some time recognized the necessity for reevaluating and
improving the relationship, and have completed such studies; and
WHEREAS, The University of Michigan desires to negotiate with the
Department of Defense certain program matters referred to in the President's
report to the Regents of December 16, 1969, and believes that it can successfully do so; therefore
Resolved, That (1) the Administration of The University of Michigan be
directed to begin immediate negotiations with the Department of Defense
designed to produce substantial agreement on the proposed changes, and
(2) the Administration report back to the Regents and The University community as soon as possible on the success of these negotiations.
Regent Brown said that the whole matter represented to him
the recognition that the worthwhile training University students
receive could be of service to the country. The resolution as proposed, he felt, did suggest the University wished to continue
having ROTC on campus. Furthermore, he felt that the same
principle of review, as was done with other University units, was
now being applied to the ROTC program on campus.
Regent Cudlip indicated that the open hearing on the matter
of ROTC the preceding day was useful to clarify further some of
the issues. What struck him was the similarity between the current
resolution and the Benson report. He felt that ROTC would continue at the University, that it would be improved, that men would




244


DECEMBER MEETING, 1969


be encouraged to participate, and that when negotiations were
undertaken-as was currently being done at other universitiessmall differences would exist. The resolution, therefore, provided
the necessary mechanics for beginning these negotiations.
Regent Lindemer said that he was never leary in accepting
responsibility for those things which the Board did, but he was
leary about accepting responsibility for the things which the press
said the Board did. He hoped they would use extreme accuracy in
reporting what was being done concerning ROTC at this time.
He felt that yesterday, also, was useful, inasmuch as persons with
great depth of feeling expressed their views, and that the remarks
were worthwhile, well reasoned and constructive.
His final comment dealt with the committee which would be
set up. His concept of that committee, he said, was not that the
Regents would appoint a fox in charge of the chicken coop, rather
that the committee would include people who would view their
participation in a constructive manner.
Regent Smith said the Benson Report had been largely written
by academic people and some from the military. This was important, he felt, because it put the problem in perspective. The University of Michigan was not one isolated campus discussing the
problem; it was a national issue. He said he had high regard for
the citizen soldier in the whole scheme of things. We were in no
position, he continued, to dissolve the armed services; this question
of disarming was one for the whole world. Then it might be possible to limit our concern with defense, he noted. Until that day
arrives we need defense and one of the ways to provide the officer
corps was in a civilian surroundings.
With respect to federal funding there appeared to be an ambivalence. There were people willing to receive federal monies for
other purposes, but if they came marked 'military' there was an
inclination to evaluate the value of the contribution. Scholarship
support for students who wished to take military training was
also quite substantial. State-supported universities, he felt, should
also offer some support.
He regretted that he and the other Regents had not heard from
students taking ROTC courses. Perhaps some policy was operating
here. He resented anyone drumming the military off campus.
Rather, students should be given the choice of taking ROTC
training if they wished.
He too felt relationships should be re-evaluated, as discussed
in the President's report, as other schools and colleges across the
country were doing. In short, he wished our negotiators well.
Regent Nederlander indicated that the large concern to him
was the one of freedom of choice. People should be given the




DECEMBER MEETING, 1969


245


opportunity to choose the area and courses they wish to become
involved in. No one should deny them that opportunity, he concluded.
The resolution was then put to a vote and approved.
Consensus was expressed to hold the March 1970 Regents' March 1970
meetings on Wednesday, March 18, and Thursday, March 19.    Changed
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents of the University for the month of November 1969
totaled $651.76.
The Regents adjourned to meet on January 15 and 16, 1970.

OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison and Herbert W. Hildebrandt
Voted July 18, 1969 (p. 20)        Conferred November 22, 1969
ROGER WILLIAM BROWN, Bachelor of Arts in 1948,
Doctor of Philosophy in 1952; Professor of Social Psychology
and Chairman of the Department of Social Relations at Harvard
University.
Fulfilling the rich promise which he had shown as a student
here, Professor Brown quickly established his authority in the
field of psycholinguistics, a somewhat novel specialty which he
himself helped open up to systematic study. In subsequent work,
he has united technical expertness with breadth of vision and
maturity of mind, exemplifying the rare quality of intellectual
coherence. His expression, moreover, has combined scientific precision with elegance and wit.
In offering Roger Brown this Outstanding Achievement Award,
the University honors him for academic proficiency and for
humane wisdom.
RAYMOND K. DYKEMA, Bachelor of Laws in the Class
of 1911; lawyer in the Detroit firm of Dykema, Wheat, Goodnow,
and Trigg.
Founding partner of a firm which has grown steadily in stature
and distinction for more than forty-five years, Mr. Dykema has
left a decisive imprint on the practice of law in Detroit and has
exercised as well a strong and beneficent influence on the business
community in that city. He has espoused public causes, moreover,
with the same devotion and energy which he has exhibited in his
private career. And he has retained a lifelong interest in the
Michigan Law School, in which his partners have affectionately
established, as a permanent memorial, a scholarship fund bearing
his name.
His Alma Mater takes delight in tendering this loyal son and
elder statesman its Outstanding Achievement Award.
LINN CHARLES SMITH, Bachelor of Science in Architecture in 1942; architect; President of Linn Smith, Demiene, Adams,
Incorporated.
Since entering practice in Birmingham, Michigan, Linn Smith
has concentrated on school architecture, contributing both exemplary specific designs and wise general counsel to the school system
there. The fame of his fertile imagination and seasoned judgment
has so spread, furthermore, that his advice is now sought by school




248           DECEMBER MEETING, 1969
personnel throughout the nation. He has maintained a devoted
interest in architectural education, both national and local: specifically, he has been for twenty years a visiting juror, and for
twelve years chairman of an architecture scholarship fund, at the
University, which now, with grateful pride, extends him an Outstanding Achievement Award.
LOUIS DIJOUR SMULLIN, Bachelor of Science in Engineering in 1936; Chairman of the Department of Electrical
Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Professor Smullin's early research contributed to the electronic
detection systems which proved of crucial importance in the
Second World War. One of his recent inventions has enabled
advanced research in controlled thermonuclear fusion. He elicits
from students and colleagues, furthermore, a creativity akin to
his own. He possesses, also, both a depth of theoretical understanding appropriate to his office in one of the nation's foremost
technical institutes, and an administrative talent equal to the
complexities of modern engineering management.
It is a privilege to extend this Outstanding Achievement Award
to a man whom we may aptly call the complete engineer.

thereof, and any payment so made shall be valid and effectual to

discharged from registration by being in like manner transferred
to bearer, and thereupon transferability by delivery shall be
restored; and such coupon bond may again, from time to time,

Section 6.01. REMEDY ON DEFAULT. In event default shall
be made in the due and punctual payment of principal or interest
on any bond secured hereby, or in the due observance or performance of any covenant, condition or provision herein required to be
kept or performed by the Borrower, and such default, other than
payment of principal and interest, shall continue for a period of
thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given to the Borrower by the Trustee, which notice the Trustee must give upon
the written request of the holders of twenty-five per cent (25%)
in amount of bonds then outstanding, the Trustee may:
(a) Proceed to protect or enforce the rights of the Trustee and

to be made therefor, and to hire and discharge all employees and

and enforce all orders and requirements of such general manager
or general managers, subject only to such reasonable rules and

DECEMBER MEETING, 1969


Such rights and remedies shall be cumulative, and any one or
more thereof may be exercised by the Trustee successively from
time to time.
The Borrower expressly authorizes the Trustee to bring any of
the actions at law or in equity hereinbefore mentioned, and hereby
waives any immunity to being proceeded against, as herein authorized, which may exist by reason of its being a Department of
Government of the State of Michigan.
Section 6.02. BONDHOLDERS MAY DIRECT ACTION ON DEFAULT. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of bonds outstanding hereunder shall have the right to direct the
method of conducting any and all proceedings hereunder for the
enforcement of this agreement, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to take any action under this agreement and said direction
unless it shall first be tendered indemnity sufficient to pay all
necessary expenses incidental thereto, including court costs and
attorneys' fees.
Section 6.03. EVIDENCE OF RIGHTS OF BONDHOLDERS. Any
request or other instrument which this agreement may require or
permit to be filed and executed by the bondholders may be in any
number of concurrent instruments of similar tenor, and may be
filed or executed by such bondholders in person or by attorney,
in writing. Proof of the execution of any such request or other
instrument, or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the
holding by any person of bonds, shall be sufficient for any purpose
of this agreement if made in the following manner:
(a) The fact and date of the execution by any person of
such request or other instrument in writing may be proved by
the certificate of any Notary Public or other officer authorized
to take acknowledgments of deeds to be recorded in any State
that the person signing such request or other instrument acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of
a witness to such execution;
(b) The amount of bonds transferable by delivery held by
any person executing such request or other instrument as a
bondholder, and the issue numbers thereof, held by such
person, and the date of his holding them, may be proved by a
certificate executed by any trust company, bank, bankers or
other depositary wherever situated, if such certificate shall be
deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory, showing that at the
date therein mentioned such person had on deposit with such
depository the bonds described in such certificate;
(c) The ownership of registered bonds shall be proved by
the registry books.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1969


277


The Trustee may, however, in its discretion, require further
proof in cases where it deems further proof desirable.
The Trustee shall not be bound to recognize any person as a
bondholder unless and until his title to the bonds held by him is
proved in the manner in this Article VI provided.
Section 6.04. LIMITATION ON RIGHT OF BONDHOLDERS To
ACT. No holder of any bond or coupon secured hereby shall have
any right to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at
law for any remedy hereunder or relating thereto unless such
holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice
of such default and of the continuance thereof, as herein provided;
nor unless also the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of bonds outstanding shall have made written request
upon the Trustee and shall have afforded it a reasonable opportunity either to proceed to exercise the powers herein granted or
to institute such action, suit or proceedings in its own name; nor
unless also they shall have offered to the Trustee adequate security
and indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred therein or thereby, and have or shall have agreed to
deposit their bonds with the Trustee upon request; and such
notifications, requests and offers of indemnity are hereby declared
in every such case, at the option of the Trustee, to be conditions
precedent to the exercise of the powers and trusts of this agreement for the benefit of the bondholders, and to any action or cause
of action, or for any other remedy hereunder or relating thereto;
it being understood and intended that no one or more holders of
bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever, by his or their
action, to affect, disturb or prejudice the lien under this agreement, and to enforce any rights hereunder except in the manner
herein provided, and that all proceedings at law or in equity shall
be instituted, had and maintained in the manner herein provided
and for the equal benefit of all holders of such outstanding bonds.
Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed as granting
to the holder of any bond or coupon secured hereby the right to
bring any action or proceeding at law or in equity which the
Trustee is not expressly authorized to bring: Provided, However,
if the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of bonds
issued hereunder shall have complied with all conditions prerequisite to the requiring of action on the part of the Trustee and said
Trustee shall refuse to act, then one or more bondholders may
have the right to bring any action or actions at law or equity as the
Trustee might have instituted for and in behalf of the owners of
all outstanding bonds.
Section 6.05. UPON CURING OF DEFAULT, RIGHTS OF PARTIES
To BE RE-ESTABLISHED. In case the Trustee shall have proceeded
to enforce any rights under this agreement in the manner set forth




278


DECEMBER MEETING, 1969


in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of Section 6.01 of this Article VI
and the default or defaults complained of by the Trustee shall
have been cured, and it be reasonably certain that if the management and control of the project is returned to the Borrower it will
manage the same in such manner that it will be able to meet the
obligations herein imposed, then, and in every such case, the
Trustee shall restore the Borrower to its former position in relation
to the project, and the rights of the Borrower, the Trustee and the
holders of bonds shall be the same as if no default had occurred.
Section 6.06. POWER To WAIVE DEFAULT. The Trustee
may, and upon written request of the holders of a majority in
amount of bonds outstanding hereunder shall, waive any default
hereunder upon compliance by the Borrower with all of the covenants, conditions and provisions hereof, including payment in full
of all amounts then due under the terms hereof and any expenses
incurred by the Trustee. No such waiver shall extend to or affect
any subsequent or other then existing default or impair any right
consequent thereon.
Section 6.07. PROCEEDS FROM ACTION OF TRUSTEE OR BONDHOLDERS. Any proceeds received by the Trustee under the provisions of this Article VI shall be applied as follows:
(a) To the payment of all costs of any suit or suits undertaken to enforce the provisions hereof, together with reasonable fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
and including repayment of any moneys advanced by the
Trustee or by any of the holders of bonds, with interest at a

may resign at any time by executing and filing with the Borrower

been previously appointed, in which event it shall take effect
immediately upon such appointment and the acceptance of the
trust hereunder. Upon proper and legal showing, the Borrower
may demand and obtain the resignation of the Trustee and secure
the appointment of a successor Trustee. Any successor to the

this agreement are carried out.
Section 7.04. TRUSTEE'S RIGHT To RECOGNIZE HOLDER OF

Trustee hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or
any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything
to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding. In case any of
the bonds shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any
such successor Trustee may adopt the certificate of the Trustee or

would include a revolving fund feature, encouraging voluntary
reimbursement so that such funds could be kept at a high level.

JANUARY MEETING, 1970


opportunity clause as may be imposed upon contractors and subcontractors by the FAA and the Secretary of Labor pursuant to

that the sponsor fails or refuses to comply with its undertakings, the
FAA may cancel, terminate or suspend in whole or in part any contractual arrangement it may have with the Sponsor, may refrain
from extending any further assistance under any of its programs
subject to Executive Order 11246 until satisfactory assurance of
future compliance has been received from such applicant, or may
refer the case to the Department of Justice for appropriate legal
proceedings.
9. It is understood and agreed that each contract awarded for construction
work under this project is subject to the provisions of the Work-Hours
Act of 1962, Public Law 87-581. It is further understood and agreed that
each contract will contain stipulations requiring the contractor or subcontractor to pay wages to all laborers and mechanics employed on work in
conformance with the provisions of the Act and that the Sponsor may
withhold or cause to be withheld from the contractor or subcontractor so
much of the accrued payments as may be considered necessary to pay
laborers and mechanics employed by any such contractor or subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by the contract
and such sums as may administratively be determined to be necessary
to satisfy any liabilities of such contractor or subcontractor for liquidated damages as provided by the Act. It is also understood and agreed
that, in the event of failure of any contractor or subcontractor to pay
any laborer or mechanic employed or working on the site of the work all
or part of the wages required by the contract, the FAA may, after written
notice to the Sponsor, withhold from the Sponsor so much of the accrued
payments or advances representing unpaid wages and liquidated damages.
10. The Sponsor hereby covenants and agrees that its financial records of the
project, established, maintained and made available to personnel of the
FAA in conformity to Section 151.55 of the Regulations of the Federal
Aviation Agency (14 CFR 151) will also be available to representatives
of the Comptroller General of the United States.
11. By its acceptance of this Grant Offer the Sponsor agrees that insofar as
is within its powers and to the extent reasonable, the Sponsor will take
action to restrict the use of land adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity
of the airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal airport
operations, including landing and take-off of aircraft, in furtherance of
its undertaking as set forth in Paragraph 13 of Part III-Sponsor's
Assurances of the aforesaid Project Application.
12. By its acceptance hereof, the Sponsor hereby covenants that to the extent
it has or may have either present or future control over each area identified on the Exhibit "A" as "clear zone", and unless exceptions to or
deviations from the following obligations have been granted to the
Sponsor in writing by the FAA, it will clear said area or areas of any
existing structure or any natural growth which constitutes an obstruction
to air navigation with the standards established by Section 77.23 as
applied to Section 77.27, Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations;
and the Sponsor further covenants that it will control the subsequent
erection of structures and control natural growth to the extent necessary
to prevent the creation of obstructions within said standards.
13. The Sponsor hereby further covenants that it will not permit any permanent-type structures, other than structures required for aids to air navigation and such other structures as may be specifically excepted in writing
by the FAA, to be erected on, and that it will cause any existing struc



JANUARY MEETING, 1970


299


tures to be removed from, each area identified on the Exhibit "A" as
"clear zone" or any portions thereof, concerning which the Sponsor has
acquired a fee interest with Federal financial assistance, irrespective of
whether such structures constitute an obstruction to air navigation.
14. It is hereby understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that
Paragraph 7 of Part III-Sponsor's Assurances of the aforesaid Project
Application shall be considered to be amended by deletion of the words
"Section A of FAA Technical Standard Order No. N18 or Advisory
Circular (AC) No. 150/5300.1, whichever is applicable according to the
currently approved Airport Layout Plan", and by substitution therefor
of the following: "Section 77.23 as applied to Section 77.27, Part 77 of
the Federal Aviation Regulations."
15. It is understood and agreed that the terms "Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Agency", "Administrator" or "Federal Aviation Agency" wherever they appear in this Agreement, in the Project Application, plans and
specifications or other documents constituting a part of this Agreement
shall be deemed to mean the Federal Aviation Administrator or the
Federal Aviation Administration as the case may be.
16. The Sponsor(a) Will not grant or permit any exclusive right forbidden by section
308(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1349 (a)) at
the airport, or at any other airport now or hereafter owned or controlled by it;
(b) Agrees that, in furtherance of the policy of the FAA under this
covenant, unless authorized by the Administrator, it will not, either
directly or indirectly, grant or permit any person, firm or corporation the exclusive right at the airport, or at any other airport now or
hereafter owned or controlled by it, to conduct any aeronautical
activities, including, but not limited to, charter flights, pilot training,
aircraft rental and sightseeing, aerial photography, crop dusting,
aerial advertising and surveying, air carrier operations, aircraft sales
and services, sale of aviation petroleum products whether or not
conducted in conjunction with other aeronautical activity, repair and
maintenance of aircraft, sale of aircraft parts, and any other activities which because of their direct relationship to the operation of
aircraft can be regarded as an aeronautical activity;
(c) Agrees that it will terminate any existing exclusive right to engage
in the sale of gasoline or oil, or both, granted before July 17, 1962, at
such an airport, at the earliest renewal, cancellation, or expiration
date applicable to the agreement that established the exclusive right;
and
(d) Agrees that it will terminate any other exclusive right to conduct
any aeronautical activity now existing at such an airport before the
grant of any assistance under the Federal Airport Act.
17. The Sponsor further covenants that it will not cause or permit any structure or object of natural growth to extend above the plane of the light
path within the land area (presently, or hereafter owned or controlled
by the Sponsor) comprising the site of any Approach Light System
serving the aforesaid airport (an ALS site being an area extending 3200
feet outward from the approach end of the runway served and 400 feet
in width located symmetrically about the projected runway centerline).
18. The Federal Aviation Administration in tendering this Offer on behalf of
the United States of America recognizes the existence of an agency relationship between the University of Michigan, as principal, and the Michigan Aeronautics Commission, successor to the Michigan Department of
Aeronautics, as agent, created by the Agency Agreement on Airports




300


JANUARY MEETING, 1970


entered into on 13 June 1952. The Sponsor agrees that it will not amend,
modify, or terminate said Agency Agreement without prior approval, in
writing, of the FAA.
19. It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that this
Grant Offer is made and accepted upon the basis of preliminary plans and
specifications submitted with the Project Application; and the parties
hereby covenant and agree that the Sponsor shall furnish final plans and
specifications to the FAA within 90 days after acceptance of this Grant
Offer and that no construction work shall be commenced hereunder nor
will there be any advertisement for bids for accomplishment of such work
until the said final plans and specifications have been approved by the
FAA; and the parties do hereby further covenant and agree that any
reference made in this Grant Offer or in the aforesaid Project Application
to plans and specifications shall be considered as having reference to said
final plans and specifications as so approved.
20. The Federal Government does not now plan or contemplate the construction of any structures pursuant to Paragraph 9 of Part III-Sponsor's
Assurances of the Project Application dated 30 September 1969, and therefore, it is understood and agreed that the Sponsor is under no obligation
to furnish any areas or rights without cost to the Federal Government
under this Grant Agreement. However, nothing contained herein shall be
construed as altering or changing the rights of the United States and/or
the obligation of the Sponsor under prior Grant Agreements to furnish
rent-free space for the activities specified in such agreements.
21. It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that notwithstanding the fact that the plans and specifications submitted with the
Project Application provide for the installation of 2-7X2 KW and 1-4
KW regulators, Federal participation in this item will be limited to the
cost of installing 2-4 KW and 1-752 regulators. It is further understood
and agreed that, to the extent the said work excluded from Federal
participation is accomplished by the Sponsor, the Sponsor shall maintain
as a portion of the cost records covering this project, separable cost
records pertaining to the above-identified work excluded from Federal
participation under this project, which records shall be made available
for inspection and audit by the FAA to the end that the cost of the
excluded work may be definitely determined.
22. It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that the
United States shall not make, nor shall it be obligated to make, any grant
payment until the Sponsor has submitted to the FAA
(a) a revised Airport Layout Plan indicating the abandonment of the
N/S runway as a runway.
(b) a satisfactorily revised Exhibit "A".
The Sponsor's acceptance of this Offer and ratification and adoption of
the Project Application incorporated herein shall be evidenced by execution
of this instrument by the Sponsor, as hereinafter provided, and said Offer
and Acceptance shall comprise a Grant Agreement, as provided by the Federal
Airport Act, constituting the obligations and rights of the United States and
the Sponsor with respect to the accomplishment of the Project and the
operation and maintenance of the Airport. Such Grant Agreement shall become effective upon the Sponsor's acceptance of this Offer and shall remain
in full force and effect throughout the useful life of the facilities developed
under the Project but in any event not to exceed twenty years from the date
of said acceptance.

APPENDIX A


HONORARY DEGREES, DECEMBER 13, 1969
Characterizations by Alexander W. Allison and Herbert W. Hildebrandt
Voted July 18, 1969 (p. 20)
DOCTOR OF LAWS
ROBERT P. BRIGGS, Bachelor of Arts in the Class of 1925, Master of Business Administration in 1928; Michigan Commissioner of Financial Institutions.
Perhaps no other living man has enjoyed so various an association
with the University, and few men have served it so faithfully and well.
Holder of faculty appointments in economics and accounting, a former
Vice-President in Charge of Business and Finance, and a founder of the
Development Council, he has more recently lent his wisdom and forthright
honesty to the University's Board of Regents. In his business career, he was
for sixteen years Executive Vice-President of the Consumers Power Company. In his public and civic career, he has overseen war production
in Detroit, presided over the state Chamber of Commerce, and been
director and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. He now
watches over this state's financial institutions with the efficiency and
sound judgment which have distinguished all his offices.
His regental colleagues and the University greet this loyal and
devoted son with the warmest esteem as we tender him the degree
Doctor of Laws.
The Honorable PHILIP A. HART, Juris Doctor in the Class of 1937;
senior Senator from the State of Michigan.
There are some political interests which are powerful by virtue either
of wealth or organization and which legislators espouse as by second
nature. There are other interests or constituencies, such as debtors, migrant
workers, and retail shoppers, which lack any comparable power and must
rely, for legislative spokesmen, on a few unusually responsible and sympathetic men, like Philip Hart. His championing of the inarticulate and the
dispossessed represents a labor quite purely of love and conscience. He
is a public servant who truly fulfills his high calling; he is also, as we
have this day seen, a man of signal courtesy and charm.
The University of Michigan fittingly extends to him the degree
Doctor of Laws.
DOCTOR OF HUMANE LETTERS
ALFRED A. KNOPF, publisher.
Over the past half-century, the firm of Alfred Knopf has published
an astonishingly high proportion of the best contemporary literature
303




304


JANUARY MEETING, 1970


of Europe and the Americas, including significant works by six Nobel Prize
winners. In the interest of eliciting new talent or advancing the cause
of learning, Mr. Knopf has incurred financial risks and even predictable
losses. More typically, however, being canny as well as devoted, he has
seen books which he has loved and authors whom he has counted among
his personal friends flourish and endure in the market place. It is a
pleasure to contemplate so happy a union of vocation and avocation. It
is a privilege to honor a sponsor of literary artists whose own life possesses
the authority and grace of a work of art.
The University of Michigan confers upon this elder statesman of
American publishing the degree Doctor of Humane Letters.

JULY MEETING, 2008

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
July 17, 2008
The Regents convened at 3:05 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill,
Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Interim Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice
President Kelch, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Vice
President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice
President Wilbanks.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order.
Regents Resolution in Honor of Jack Kay
Regent Maynard called Interim Chancellor Jack Kay to the podium. She
commented that during his service as interim chancellor he had been "such a wonderful
and positive part of the Flint community and the UM-Flint community," and read the
following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan salute Jack Kay as he
completes his term as interim chancellor, University of Michigan-Flint,
on August 17, 2008, to resume his position as provost and vice
chancellor for academic affairs and professor of communication.
Interim Chancellor Kay has led the Flint campus for nearly 19
months, first as acting chancellor, and then as interim chancellor.
Under his leadership, the campus has thrived. Following approval for
construction of the campus's first residence hall, he moved the project
forward to the point where it will be providing a home for its first
residents during the fall 2008 semester. Chancellor Kay oversaw the
establishment of Genesee Early College, the state's first early college
high school, on the Flint campus in 2007, providing a unique education
for students with career aspirations in the health professions. During
2007 as well, enrollment on the Flint campus increased by more than 5
percent, including a 20 percent increase in first year students and a 13
percent increase in graduate students. These enrollment increases are
partly the result of new degree programs, increased online options, and
scheduling flexibility, all of which have been instituted under Chancellor
Kay's leadership. His efforts at maintaining the strong campus tradition
of community service and civic engagement were recognized earlier this
year when the Flint campus was named to the President's Higher





July Meeting, 2008

Education Community Service Honor Roll for exemplary service efforts
and service to disadvantaged youth.  This is the highest federal
recognition a school can achieve for its commitment to service-learning
and civic engagement.
The Regents express deep gratitude to Jack Kay for his
forthright, insightful, and gracious leadership and for providing stability
during an important transitional period for the Flint campus. We are
happy that we will have the benefit of his service in the years to come.
A round of applause followed. Interim Chancellor Kay thanked the Regents and
President Coleman for allowing him the privilege of serving in this capacity.
President's Opening Remarks.     President Coleman reported that the
University of Michigan had just been recognized as one of the best colleges to work for
in a Chronicle of Higher Education survey. She also made note of grants that had
recently been awarded by the Michigan Initiative for Innovation and Entrepreneurship,
a consortium of the state's 15 public universities working in partnership with private
foundations, meant to accelerate the state's economy. President Coleman called
attention to the University's solar car team, which is participating in the 2008 North
American Solar Challenge, and to the fact that a number of Michigan students, staff,
and alumni are participating in the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Finally, she noted
that alumnus Dr. Benjamin Carson was recently awarded the Presidential Medal of
Freedom.
Dean's Report: College of Pharmacy
President Coleman introduced Frank Ascione, dean of the College of Pharmacy.
Dean Ascione noted that the college is recognized nationally and internationally as the
first pharmacy school to emphasize a science-based curriculum. It is a research
intensive college that offers the Doctor of Pharmacy (professional) degree and a Doctor
of Philosophy graduate degree, in addition to a small Bachelor of Science program. He
pointed out that while the College of Pharmacy is a small school with 395 students, it
plays a significant role within the University and plans to eventually increase its
enrollment to about 450. He reported that the college has intensely loyal alumni and a
very active donor base, with the highest giving rate among University units.
Dean Ascione noted that his faculty work extensively with a number of other
schools and colleges, including the Medical School, College of LS&A, College of
Engineering, College of Dentistry, School of Nursing, and the business school in its
major research area of the drug discovery, development, and use process. He described
the educational path followed in obtaining the various pharmacy degrees, the types of
positions available to graduates, and plans that are underway to expand professional
educational experiences and develop additional degree programs. Although the
college's research quality and productivity are highly ranked, there are plans to improve
the research infrastructure and hire additional faculty and staff. He also reported that
10 of the 13 scientists hired by the University from Pfizer Corporation were placed in
the College of Pharmacy.





July Meeting, 2008

Conflict of Interest/Conflict of Commitment Policies
Professor Christina Whitman updated the Regents on the University's Conflict
of Interest/Conflict of Commitment Initiative. She reported that every unit in the
University now has a policy that conforms to the University's guidelines, and the units
understand that these policies are the first point of reference when a potential conflict
arises. There are resources and tools available to help new units or units with existing
policies to develop or revise their policies as necessary.
Professor Whitman discussed examples of a policies from non-academic and
academic units; these have quite different emphases due to the nature of the focus of
these units. She noted that faculty with joint appointments are subject to the policies of
each unit. As a follow up on this initial work in establishing policies in each unit, she
suggested that a it might be worthwhile to examine whether the policies are being
consulted regularly and their expectations being taken seriously, and to consider
whether any changes or additional specificity might be advisable.
Regent White thanked Professor Whitman for her efforts in leading this
initiative.
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report - Ann Arbor Campus
Professor Fred Askari, chair of the Ann Arbor CESF, presented the committee's
annual report. He noted that because a large percentage of faculty here and elsewhere
are eligible to retire, Michigan will be competing with universities nationwide in hiring
the best faculty. Therefore, benefits, salaries, and other aspects of employment at the
University will need to be highly competitive. The committee therefore made a number
of recommendations aimed at making the University a model academic employment
destination for both faculty and staff. The committee also made recommendations with
respect to benefits, including providing dependent tuition support for the Ann Arbor
campus that is at least consistent with that provided at Dearborn and Flint, if not the
level of tuition support that is provided at peer academic institutions.
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report - Dearborn Campus
Professor Lee Redding submitted the report for the Dearborn campus. He
emphasized the importance of merit pay, both for recognizing the achievements of
current faculty and as a recruiting tool for new faculty. He praised the efforts of the
administration in recognizing the importance of this and other economic status issues,
especially given the challenging economic times for the state.
Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) Report - Flint Campus
Professor Shan Parker presented the CESF report for the Flint campus. She
praised the efforts of the current administration for recognizing and supporting faculty
concerns about salary compression issues, but pointed out that University of Michigan-
Flint salaries remain lower than those at peer and regional competitive institutions,
especially at the associate and full professor levels. Another concern of Flint faculty is
the fact that salary growth for Flint faculty has been lower than that on the Ann Arbor
and Dearborn campuses. The committee recommends that 2008-2009 salary increases
be comparable to those at peer institutions, including the Dearborn campus, and that the
"loyalty penalty" affecting salaries of full professors be addressed.





July Meeting, 2008

Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of this
committee, reported that she and fellow committee members Regents Maynard,

executive director of university audits.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner,
chair of this committee, reported that he and fellow committee members Regent Darlow

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for four
faculty members.
Vincent E. Castagnacci, M.F.A., Arthur F. Thurnau Professor and professor of
art in the School of Art and Design, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2008.
Professor Castagnacci received his B.S.Ed. degree in 1963 from Tufts
University and his B.F.A. and M.F.A. degrees from Yale University in 1964 and 1966,
respectively. Following service on the faculty of Old Dominion University from 1966-
73, he joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1973 as an assistant professor. He
was promoted to associate professor in 1977 and professor in 1983.

12





July Meeting, 2008

Professor Castagnacci's abstract work in painting, printmaking, and drawing has
been centered in the principle of variational development. He has worked across these
multiple media and in collaboration with musicians and composers to develop a unique
visual language and means of communication. His works have been exhibited in the
United States and abroad, and he has lectured and published nationally and
internationally. He is the recipient of a citation and grant from the American Academy
in Rome and in 2004 was recently named a Mellon Scholar at Kalamazoo College.
Professor Castagnacci is a distinguished educator who is highly respected by
students and colleagues for his rigorous, challenging, and thoughtful teaching. His
passion and commitment to excellence are legendary, and his leadership in the
instruction of drawing and mark-making has helped build a core curriculum in the
School of Art and Design. In 1999, he was named an Arthur F. Thurnau Professor in
recognition of his dedication to teaching.
The Regents now salute this distinguished artist and educator for his dedicated
service by naming Vincent E. Castagnacci Arthur F. Thurnau Professor Emeritus and
professor emeritus of art.
John C. Drach, Ph.D., professor of dentistry in the School of Dentistry and
professor of medicinal chemistry in the College of Pharmacy, will retire from active
faculty status on August 31, 2008.
Professor Drach received his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University
of Cincinnati in 1961, 1963 and 1966, respectively. From 1966-70 he was a research
biochemist at Parke Davis Laboratories. He joined the School of Dentistry faculty as
an assistant professor in 1970 and was promoted to associate professor in 1974. In
1978, he was also appointed associate professor of medicinal chemistry in the College
of Pharmacy. He was promoted to professor of dentistry and professor of medicinal
chemistry in 1980.
Professor Drach's research focuses on the discovery, mode of action, and
metabolism of antiviral drugs. The overall objective of his research group's work was
to identify new compounds that have the potential to become useful antiviral drugs and
to investigate how promising compounds act at the cellular, molecular, and biochemical
level. His most current work seeks to understand the molecular basis for the activity of
new compounds against HCMV and HIV. His work has earned him numerous awards
and honors, including being named a Fellow of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in 2002. Professor Drach's research, which has been
continuously funded since 1970, has led to over 50 patents. He has published one
textbook, more than 200 papers and articles, and over 200 presentations and abstracts.
From 1985-95, Professor Drach served first as interim chair and then as chair of
the Department of Biologic and Materials Sciences in the School of Dentistry. He also
served on numerous committees within the School and throughout the University. He
is a member of a number of professional associations, including the American
Association of Dental Schools, which he chaired from 1990-91, and the International
Society for Antiviral Research, where he served as president from 2002-04.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming John C.
Drach professor emeritus of dentistry and professor emeritus of medicinal chemistry.

election to the International Academy of Ceramics in Geneva. In 2005, she was
awarded the Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award for Creative and Performing
Arts from DePauw University.

14





July Meeting, 2008

Professor Zirbes is indisputably one of the best professional ceramics educators
in the country, and her career evidences a passionate commitment to undergraduate
education. She has spearheaded initiatives to build a more inclusive and innovative
curriculum in the School of Art and Design, has organized professional and educational
conferences around the globe, and has actively promoted international exchange in
higher education. In 2006, she was named an Arthur F. Thurnau Professor in

service by naming Georgette M. Zirbes Arthur F. Thurnau Professor Emerita and
professor emerita of art.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted a memorial statement for
Loretta J. Dauwe, professor of physics at the University of Michigan-Flint.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death on June 15, 2008, of Loretta J. Dauwe, professor of physics, College of Arts
and Sciences, University of Michigan-Flint, at the age of 61.
A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Professor Dauwe received her B.S. degree from
the University of Dayton in 1968, her M.S.T. degree from the University of Missouri-
Rolla in 1973, and her Ph.D. degree from Purdue University in 1980. She was a
research associate at the University of Notre Dame from 1981-83 and at the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory from  1983-85.  She joined the faculty of the
University of Michigan-Flint in 1985 as an assistant professor, and was promoted to
associate professor in 1990 and professor in 2005.
Professor Dauwe was an experimental particle physicist who studied the
fundamental behavior of nature at the smallest scales possible. During her career, she
authored or co-authored more than 60 refereed papers, and was associated with a team
of 125 physicists in the SELEX (Segmented Large X baryon Spectrometer)
collaboration at Fermi National Laboratory. She received a significant amount of grant
funding for her research, taught physics courses at all levels, and spent a great deal of
time working with students in laboratories. Beyond the classroom, she supervised
independent study courses and provided many research opportunities for her students at
Fermi National Laboratory. Professor Dauwe served for several years as chair of the
Department of Computer Science, Engineering Science and Physics. She was a
member of the College of Arts and Sciences Executive Committee and served on the
Flint Campus's Graduate Board, Academic Affairs Advisory Committee, and the
Committee on Admissions and Scholarships. In 2001, the student government awarded
Professor Dauwe its Distinguished Professor Award.
Professor Dauwe was well-liked and respected by all of her friends and
colleagues; her untimely passing will leave a void in the department, the college, and
entire University. As we mourn the loss of this great scholar and teacher, our
condolences go to her brother, Daniel, her sister, Joyce Anderson and brother-in-law
David Anderson, and her beloved nieces and nephews.

17





July Meeting, 2008

Lease Agreement with Oakwood Healthcare, Inc.
The Regents approved a lease agreement for 14,769 square feet of property
located at Oakwood Rotunda Center, Rotunda Boulevard, Dearborn, Michigan, to be
leased from Oakwood Healthcare, Inc. Because Daniel Little, a University of Michigan
employee, is also a member of the board of trustees of Oakwood Healthcare, Inc., this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. The parties to the lease agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Oakwood Healthcare, Inc.
2. The service to be provided is the lease of 14,769 gross square feet in a building at
Oakwood Rotunda Center, Rotunda Boulevard, Dearborn, Michigan, for 18 years,
estimated to commence on September 1, 2008 through August 31, 2026, at a monthly
rate of $17,759.72 for years 1-3; $18,990.47 for years 4-6; $20,221.22 for years 7-9;
$21,451.97 for years 10-12; $22,682.72 for years 13-15; and $23,913.47 for years 16-
18. Tenant will be responsible for electric usage and 38.14% of the operating
expenses of the building. Approximately $300,000 of leasehold improvements will
be needed, to be constructed by the landlord and reimbursed by the University. In
addition, the University, subject to its approval, will pay increased operating
expenses for future capital improvements.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Daniel Little, a University of
Michigan employee, is serving on the Board of Trustees of Oakwood Healthcare, Inc.
License Agreement between the University of Michigan and LivingText
The Regents approved a license agreement for licensing of the University of
Michigan technology "Web-based Interactive Classroom System: LectureTools" (UM
File OTT No. 3536) to LivingText. Because Perry Samson, a University of Michigan

compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
LivingText.
2. Agreement terms include giving LivingText a non-exclusive license. The University
will retain ownership of the licensed technology and may continue to further develop
it, use it internally, and license it to others. No use of University services or
facilities, nor any assignment of University employees, is obligated or contemplated
under the agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees and indemnification apply,
and the contract may be amended by consent of the parties. University procedures
for approval of these changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest
review will be done as appropriate.
3. Perry Samson's pecuniary interest arises from his ownership interest in LivingText.
Purchase from Accuri Cytometers, Inc.
The Regents approved a purchase from Accuri Cytometers, Inc. ("Accuri") of

Sec. 1.14: Regental and Executive/Senior Officer Conflict of Interest Policy (revised Sept. 1994;
(See also "Supplemental policy for conflicts involving regents"; "Supplemental policy for conflicts
involving the president")
Regents and executive officers of the University of Michigan, and the senior officers of the university at
Dearborn and at Flint, &ha14 will at all times act in a manner consistent with their fiduciary
responsibilities to the university and sha14 will exercise particular care that no detriment to the university
results from  conflicts between their interests and those of the university.  If a regent or an
executive/senior officer believes that he or she may have a conflict of interest, the regent or
executive/senior officer ha14 will promptly and fully disclose the conflict to the secretary of the Board of
Regents and &ha14 should refrain from participating in any way in the matter to which the conflict relates
until the conflict question has been resolved. The minutes of a regents' meeting where a disclosure of
conflict or possible conflict of interest is made uha14 will reflect the disclosure and that the regent or
executive/senior officer having such abstained from participation in the matter.
A regent or executive/senior officer is considered to have a conflict of interest when the regent or
executive/senior officer or any of his or her family or associates, either (i) has an existing or potential

24





July Meeting, 2008 - Appendix

financial or other interest which impairs or might appear to impair the regent's or executive/senior
officers independence of judgment in the discharge of responsibilities to the university, or (ii) may
receive a material, financial, or other benefit from knowledge of information confidential to the
university. The family of a regent or executive/senior officer includes his or her spouse, parents,
siblings, children, and, if living in the same household and sharing expenses, other individuals. An
associate of a regent or executive/senior officer includes any person, trust, organization, or enterprise in
or with which the regent or executive/senior officer has knowledge that he or she or any member of his or
her family (i) is a director, officer, employee, member, partner, or trustee; or (ii) has a financial interest
that represents 5% or more of his or her assets or any interest that enables him or her, acting alone or in
conjunction with others, to exercise control or to influence policy significantly, or (iii) has any other
material association.
The secretary shall will consult with the president and general counsel regarding all conflict questions of
which the secretary is informed and shall will report regularly to the Board of Regents regarding any
unresolved conflict questions. This policy statement is to be interpreted and applied in a manner that will
best serve the interests of the university. In some cases, it may be determined that, after full disclosure to
those concerned, the university's interests are best served by participation by the regent or
executive/senior officer despite the conflict. The university will assist the board in determining if such
proposed participation violates the state conflict of interest laws. The general counsel will provide a
regent or executive/senior officer, upon his or her request, a written opinion as to whether a conflict of
interest situation exists.
This policy is in addition to any obligations imposed on a regent or executive/senior officer by the state
law on conflicts of interest, P.A. 1968, Nos. 317 and 318, as amended.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in state law, it shall will be a conflict of interest for a
regent in any capacity to be employed by or associated with a professional service firm which directly or
indirectly provides services to the university. In accordance with Op.Atty.Gen. 1979, No. 5489, in the
event that a firm is providing services to the university prior to one of its employees becoming a regent, it
may complete all work in progress for the university but may not be engaged for any additional work
until the regent is no longer employed by or associated with the professional service firm.
The secretary shall will distribute annually a copy of this policy statement to each regent and
executive/senior officer.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 2008

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
September 18, 2008
The Regents convened at 3:05 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill,
Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch,
Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Vice President Scarnecchia,
Executive Vice President Slottow, and Provost Sullivan. Vice President Lampe and
Vice President Wilbanks were absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She welcomed Ruth Person, the
new chancellor of the University of Michigan-Flint. President Coleman noted that this
fall, enrollment on both the Flint and Dearborn campuses had increased significantly,
and that the Ann Arbor freshman class had the best academic credentials of any class in
recent times. She reviewed highlights of the upcoming academic year, which include a
theme semester devoted to the study of energy use, the re-opening of the Museum of
Art, and the opening of the new Ross School of Business building.
President Coleman commented on two deaths that had occurred since the Regents
last met in July. One was that of David J. Smith, an employee of Schindler Elevator
Corporation, who was killed in August at the construction site of the Ross School of
Business. The other person who passed away was Peggy Norgren, associate vice president
for finance, who had worked closely with many regents and administrators. She noted that
"Peggy was an exceptionally talented, dedicated and kind administrator, and she is missed
by so many people at the University."
Regent McGowan commented that from her perspective as a regent who worked
with Peggy quite closely while serving on the Finance, Audit and Investment
Committee, "This was one remarkable woman. We all know how talented she was at
her day job, but what a lot of people didn't know about Peggy was her remarkable life.
She was a flyer, she was a world backpacker, and the mother of three perfectly
wonderful kids. She was, in my view, gutsy, gorgeous, and genuine, and absolutely
unforgettable."
Resolution in Honor of University of Michigan Solar Car Team
President Coleman said that members of the team were in the audience and
called them to the front of the room. She announced that the team had taken first place
in the North American Solar Challenge in July, and had dominated the competition by
finishing 10 hours ahead of the next competitor. She called on Regent White, who read
the following resolution:

31





September Meeting, 2008

Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate the
University of Michigan Solar Car Team for winning the 2008 North
American Solar Car Challenge with its car, "Continuum," on July 22,
2008. This victory marks Michigan's second consecutive-and fifth
overall-national championship, the most of any university team since the
race began in 1990.
Continuum won the 2,400 mile race from Dallas, Texas, to
Calgary, Alberta, in convincing fashion, finishing about 10 hours before
the second place team. This is a testament to the talent and dedication of
team members, who came back after competing in the 2007 World Solar
Challenge and completely redesigned many of the car's systems for the
North American competition.
In addition to winning the North American Solar Car Challenge
(NASCC), the UM team was especially honored to receive the NASCC's
Teamwork Award, recognizing the strong sense of "team" and
responsibility, coupled with a healthy and relaxed attitude, that the team
displayed throughout the race.
The Regents proudly salute the University of Michigan Solar Car
Team for its victory in the 2008 North American Solar Car Challenge.
There could be no finer example of the Michigan difference.
A round of applause followed, after which team members introduced themselves
and engaged in a discussion with the Regents about the experience of participating in the
Solar Car Team.
Emergency Preparedness Update
President Coleman introduced Robert Winfield, the university's chief health
officer, who gave an update of the university's emergency preparedness efforts, which
are being led by the Department of Occupational Safety and Environmental Health
(OSEH). Dr. Winfield stated that the guiding principles of emergency preparedness are
to protect life, safety, and university resources, to facilitate recovery in order to resume
full functions of the university, and to learn from the experiences of others.
The university takes an all hazards planning approach to determine where to
focus resources. The strategic planning effort is led by an all hazards planning team,
which in addition to the chief health officer, includes staff from OSEH, DPS,
communications, human resources, the provost's office, risk management, student
affairs, the health system, and other university units. DPS is in charge of first response
for incidents of violence or natural disaster, and OSEH is responsible for incidents
involving hazardous materials. Both units cooperate with the cities of Ann Arbor and
Ypsilanti, with counties in southeast Michigan, and with state and federal agencies. The
University of Michigan Health System Safety and Emergency Management Department
is responsible for Health System preparedness, working closely with OSEH. The
Dearborn and Flint campuses operate independently but work with OSEH and local
officials in emergency planning.

32





September Meeting, 2008

Dr. Winfield described the current status of preparedness at the university,
noting that an emergency notification system is in place, a pandemic continuity plan
has been developed, and current efforts are focusing on cross-unit emergency response
planning and business continuity planning. He said that public communications in the
event of an emergency would be centrally controlled by the Office of the Vice
President for Communications, and that phone centers, web pages, and templates for
various contingencies have all been developed. He then described business continuity
planning, noting that these efforts span all campus units, including student affairs,
business operations, and the Health System.
Dr. Winfield reported that table top exercises took place in May 2007
(pandemic) and May 2008 (active shooter) involving the president, executive officers,
and more than 100 administrators. These are theoretical explorations of specific
emergency situations and responses whose purpose is to educate campus leadership,
evaluate preparedness, and identify gaps. Functional exercises involving simulations of
actual events involving mock casualties and other scenarios have also been organized
by the Health System and Department of Public Safety.
The table top exercises have shown that the university leadership and units are
prepared to handle mass and focused emergencies. Incident management will always
be provided by DPS, operational control in major events will be centralized at the
Emergency Operations Center utilizing "NIMS" (National Incident Management
System), and policy questions will be responded to centrally at the executive officer
level. Much has been learned as a result of the table top exercises, but emergency
preparedness requires a long-term commitment with regular exercises to reinforce,
evaluate, and improve training.
During the discussion that followed, it was noted that city officials and local
police, fire, ambulance and other agencies have been and will continue to be involved
in exercises. It was recognized that more involvement on the school and college level
is needed, and current efforts are addressing this need. It was pointed out that there are
a number of challenges in providing training for emergency situations to students and
other nonprofessionals, but options are being considered as part of the long-term
planning and preparedness efforts underway.
Annual Report on Development
Vice President May reported that 2007-2008 was an extraordinary year, during
which 120,000 donors contributed $342 million--a record amount and 14% more than
the previous year. Of this amount, $17.4 million was in the category of expendable
student support compared to $8 million in 1999. The endowment increased by $112
million in new additions, almost double the amount contributed in 1999. Vice
President May commented that the "President's Challenges" were one of the key
elements that stimulated giving, especially among alumni. Faculty, staff, and retiree
donations increased by several million dollars, for a campaign total of $146 million,
and there was also an increase in the number of trusts. He noted that $57 million in
cash was added to facilities during this fiscal year.

September Meeting, 2008

Comments from Mayor John Hieftje
Mayor Hieftje addressed the board about concerns that have been raised by
citizens and by the Ann Arbor City Council about the University's plans for the
development of the Wall Street corridor. He noted that, while the city has been aware
of the University's plans for development of that area for some time, he believes that
recent conditions, along with the city's status as a leader in the "green" movement,
have made reconsideration of current development plans more of an urgent concern.
Recognizing the progress that has been made in the development of two local
commuter rail systems, along with concerns about the rising cost of gasoline for
automobiles, raise questions in the mind of community leaders and citizens about the
need for two new parking structures in that area. He suggested such alternatives as an
underground parking structure or a park-and-ride lot at a more remote location, and he
urged university officials to re-examine Wall Street development plans in conjunction
with city officials and citizens and move forward in a more cooperative fashion.
If the project does go forward as currently envisioned, Mayor Hieftje urged the
University to ensure that the residents of the Wall Street area are insulated as much as
possible from the effects of having to live in a construction zone for the next few years.
Public Comments on Agenda-Related Topics
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals on the topic of
Wall Street development: Kittie Morelock, citizen and board member of Riverside
Park Place Condominiums; Stephanie Munz, student; Raymond Detter, alumnus and
chair of Ann Arbor Downtown Area Citizens Advisory Council; Rosemary Sarri,
professor emerita and research professor; and Eliana Moya-Raggio, lecturer emerita.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of this
committee, reported that she and fellow committee members Regents Maynard,
McGowan, and Deitch, as well as President Coleman, had attended this meeting. The
committee discussed the 2008 external audit results with members of the external audit
team from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and with Greg Tewksbury, treasurer and
interim associate vice president for finance, Cheryl Soper, University controller and
director of financial operations, and Dave Morlock, UMHS chief financial officer.
Regent White reported that the University had received a clean, unqualified audit
report, and she congratulated the team who had worked with the external auditors on
the audit.
The second agenda item concerned Sarbanes Oxley work plan tasks and
involved Interim Associate Vice President Tewksbury, Executive Director of
University Audits Carol Senneff, Brent Haase, internal controls compliance manager,
and members of the Pricewaterhouse-Coopers audit team. She noted that staff is on
schedule in completing the tasks set forth in the Sarbanes Oxley work plan, and the
committee is pleased with the progress to date.
President's Salary. Regent Richner moved that the president's base salary be
increased by 4% for this academic year, to a total of $553,500, effective August 1,
2008. Regent Newman seconded the motion. He made the following comments:

34





September Meeting, 2008

The Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, consisting of Regents Darlow,
Newman, Taylor, and myself reviewed market comparison data, including salaries of presidents of
public and private university peers, our athletic conference peers, public universities in Michigan, as
well as compensation of faculty, deans, staff and executive officers. The salary increase we are
proposing is consistent with this data and is intended to reflect the full and unqualified support that this
board wishes to express for the performance of President Coleman in leading our university.
By any objective measure, the university is doing exceedingly well under the leadership of
President Coleman. As we heard earlier from Vice President May, the Michigan Difference campaign is
surpassing all expectations in what is one of the most significant public university fundraising successes
ever. President Coleman's efforts, along with those of the strong leadership team she has assembled,
have resulted in dramatically increased financial aid for our students, new endowed chairs, hiring of
new faculty, more graduate fellowships, and new and renovated facilities.
We have seen continued progress with the University of Michigan Health System, including C.S.
Mott Children's and Women's Hospital construction and the opening of the Kellogg Eye Center; athletic
campus improvements and financial sustainability; renovated residence halls and new dining facilities;
continued progress on the North Quad Residential and Academic Complex, North Campus
enhancements; and the opening of residential housing in Flint and enrollment growth in both Flint and
Dearborn.
This year, University of Michigan research expenditures amounted to a record $825 million.
Economic development activities included  the formation  of the Michigan   Innovation  and
Entrepreneurship Initiative and opening of the Business Engagement Center, which have helped recruit
companies to Michigan, as well as further development of the University Research Corridor.
President Coleman has shown excellent stewardship of our financial resources that have put the
University in a strong financial position in the face of challenging economic times. We have experienced
exceptional investment returns on our endowment and another AAA bond rating. Cost-cutting
efficiencies, energy conservation measures, and significant efforts to contain rising health care costs
have helped in relieving some of the burdens placed on our students.
We recognize the academic and intellectual leadership President Coleman has shown, including
successes in recruitment of the highest achieving faculty and students and efforts to enhance diversity
and expanding the University's financial focus.
In short, it's been a terrific year, and a job well done.
President Coleman thanked the board for their confidence in her leadership.
The vote was then taken, and the motion to increase the president's salary to $535,500
was approved unanimously.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner,
chair of this committee, reported that the committee had received a report from Provost
Sullivan on compensation of tenure track faculty for 2007-2008. Provost Sullivan also
gave her regular report on dean and senior leadership issues, and reported on quality
assessment issues. Dean Terry McDonald attended the meeting to present an overview
of the natural science division in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of July 17, 2008.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report,
the Plant Extension Report, and the University Human Resources Report. He noted
that agreements had been reached with the skilled trades and nurses bargaining units.

35





September Meeting, 2008

Litigation Report. Vice President Scarnecchia submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report. Vice President Forrest submitted the Report of Projects
Established, July 1 - August 31, 2008. He reported that the Large Hadron Collider had
been turned on recently in Switzerland, and the University of Michigan has one of the
largest teams at the site, led by physics professor and former interim president Homer
Neal. He also announced that the University's research volume had recently reached
$876 million, an increase of 6.4% from 2006-2007. Of particular note is that industry
support has risen by 11%, to $43 million.
University of Michigan Health System. There was no additional report from
the University of Michigan Health System.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper reported that the fall move-
in had been successful, with 100% occupancy in the residence halls. She noted that the
grand opening ceremony for the new Hill Dining Center and the renovated Mosher
Jordan residence hall is being held September 25, and that the new facility has been
very well received by students.
University   of Michigan-Dearborn.          Chancellor Little   reported   that the
Dearborn campus has the largest freshman class in its history this term, and a total of
1,670 new undergraduate students. He commented on a partnership that had been
formed with a Detroit public television station meant to help students get involved in
the presidential election.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Person reported that the new
residence hall has 100% occupancy and a waiting list. She thanked the Regents for
their support of this project.

Monica N. Starkman, M.D., associate professor of psychiatry, Medical
School, will retire from active faculty status September 30, 2008.
Dr. Starkman received her A.B. degree from Brandeis University in 1959, and
her M.D. and M.S. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1963 and 1965,
respectively. She completed her psychiatry residency at the University of Michigan
from 1969-72. She joined the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry as an instructor
in 1972, and was promoted to assistant professor in 1974 and associate professor in
1986.
Dr. Starkman is recognized as a leading researcher in the neurobiology of
Cushing's syndrome and depression. Her research has demonstrated and elucidated
how the stress hormone cortisol adversely affects human brain structure, cognition, and
mood, and she has also studied the extent and manner in which these alterations are
reversible. She was the first to show volume decreases of the hippocampus, the brain
structure involved in learning and memory, in humans with elevated cortisol levels and
demonstrated how increasing hippocampal volume leads to improvements in learning
and memory once hormone levels are normalized with treatment. These studies help
illuminate brain plasticity, and shed light on the potential role of stress hormone
elevation levels that frequently occur with aging, depression, and Alzheimer's disease.
From 1979-95, Dr. Starkman served as chief of the Adult Consultation-Liaison
Service in the Department of Psychiatry, caring for patients who have both psychiatric
and other medical conditions. She has been director of education for medical students
and for residents within the department, and has participated in a number of committees

OCTOBER MEETING, 2008

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
October 23, 2008
The Regents convened at 3:30 p.m. in the Harding Mott University Center on
the campus of the University of Michigan-Flint. Present were President Coleman and
Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Taylor, and White. Also
present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor
Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive
Vice President Slottow, and Provost Sullivan. Regent Richner was absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She announced that 31
University of Michigan students have recently been awarded Fulbright scholarships,
more than any university in the country. She also noted that the World University
Rankings, published by the Times Higher Education of London, had recently ranked
the University of Michigan as the best public university in the country and the 18 best
institution in the world.
President Coleman called attention to the campus-wide celebration of the end of
the Michigan Difference campaign, to be held in November. Noting that election day
would be coming up in less than two weeks, she urged voters to educate themselves on
Proposal 2, which would loosen current restrictions on embryonic stem cell research.
This would allow the University of Michigan to perform greater research in this area,
thereby expanding the development of therapies and cures for a number of diseases.
She also highlighted the Law School and C.S. Mott Children's and Women's
Hospital capital projects requests in the current agenda.
Regent Deitch complimented President Coleman and thanked her for her
advocacy on behalf of Proposal 2. He stated that passage of this proposal "is
extraordinarily important for the future of the University and for the future of the state,
putting aside the potentiality for helping the human race. Too often, people in positions
of leadership remain silent or are wishy-washy on things that they actually believe in,
lest they offend anyone, and your leadership has been extraordinary and exemplary on
this matter." Regent Taylor expressed agreement with Regent Deitch, noting "we
expect for you to do more."
Flint Residence Hall Living/Learning Communities
Chancellor Person noted that earlier that morning, the Regents had toured the new
Flint campus residence hall. She introduced Ms. Jeanine Bessette, director of housing and
residential life on the Flint campus, who described the process of opening up the campus's
first residence hall. She noted that participation in residence hall programs and living-
learning communities has been extraordinary, with a high percentage of student
engagement. The campus has been working with business, civic, and other community

October Meeting, 2008

leaders to enhance opportunities for involvement with the university's programs and
facilities, and overall, the project has been a huge success.
Comments from Regent White about Financial Markets
Regent White made the following statement:
I'd like to say a few words about the impact of the current financial markets crisis on the
University. The president and the executive officers have thoroughly briefed the board and answered our
questions regarding the possible effect of the crisis on all aspects of the University's operations, from
student financial aid to ongoing construction, and I am pleased to report that the University of Michigan
is overall in sound financial shape. This relative stability arises from the University's diversified
investment strategies, its conservative debt situation, and it's prudent cash management policies. It is
clear that not only has the University invested wisely, but it has also worked to contain costs to improve
the efficiency of its operations. Cost containment measures continue to be investigated and implemented
on a continuous basis.
The administration continues to be vigilant in assessing the effects of further economic
developments in the regional, national, and international economies. For example, the down economy is
contributing to a reduction in operating margins at the hospital, and further stress in the state economy
could impact the University's appropriation. Factors such as these will be evaluated and adjustments
will be made as necessary to preserve the excellence of the University's programs.
Our underlying financial strength means the University of Michigan will be able to move
forward as planned in the coming fiscal year, fulfilling its mission in education, research, and health
care. This also means that the University is in a good position not only to complete construction projects
already underway on campus, but also to continue planning for such projects as the Law School
buildings and the C. S. Mott Children's and Women's Hospital projects included in today's agenda.
These projects are critical to our state. Not only do they provide jobs today, but they also lay the
groundwork for tomorrow. Higher education is the cornerstone of innovation, growth, and prosperity in
Michigan, and in these troubled times, it is more important than ever for the University to maintain the
steady flow of the people and ideas that will help the state realize its potential. We all take the
stewardship of our resources and the public's trust very seriously, and we are committed to continuing
our investment in the future of our state and our region.
Committee Reports

committee, reported that she and fellow committee members Regents Deitch, Maynard,
and McGowan, as well as Executive Vice President Slottow, President Coleman and
Regent Taylor, had attended this meeting. The committee met with Chief Investment

update from Carol Senneff, executive director of university audits.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted 6 faculty retirement
memoirs.
Janice G. Bernsten, Ph.D., associate professor of linguistics in the College of
Arts and Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status
on June 30, 2008.
Professor Bernsten received her B.A. degree from Whitman College in 1968,
her M.A. degree from the University of Illinois in 1973, and her Ph.D. degree from
Michigan State University in 1990. She joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty
in 1990 as a visiting assistant professor, and was promoted to assistant professor in
1991 and associate professor in 1997.

October Meeting, 2008

Professor Bernsten   was   internationally  known  for her research   on
sociolinguistics, the study of language and society. Her work on African languages
appeared in some of the top journals in the field, including the International Journal of
the Sociology of Language and World Englishes. More recently, she examined gender
and discourse issues at auto plants in the mid-Michigan region and in California; the
resultant work was part of a collection published by the Oxford University Press.
Within the department, she instituted several key pedagogical changes in the
curriculum, taught an impressive range of courses at the undergraduate and graduate
levels, and was a perennial favorite with students.
Professor Bernsten served on and chaired numerous departmental, college, and
university-wide committees. She was instrumental in helping the linguistics program
on the Flint campus grow to its current strength and also contributed her energy and
expertise to the campus's International and Global Studies Program.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and scholar for her
dedicated service by naming Janice G. Bernsten associate professor emerita of
linguistics.
Dorothy G. Davis, M.L.S., associate librarian at the University of Michigan-
Flint, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2008.
Ms. Davis received her B.A. degree from Centenary College of Louisiana in 1964
and her M.L.S. degree from the University of Oklahoma School of Library Science in
1965. From 1965-77, she was an assistant reference librarian and then a documents
librarian at the Charles Stewart Mott Library of Flint Junior College (later renamed Mott
Community College). She joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty as an associate
librarian in 1977.
Ms. Davis was among the first librarians hired to organize the newly-independent
library at the University of Michigan-Flint. The library had been designated as a federal
depository, and Ms. Davis was responsible for administering its collection of U.S.
government publications. Ms. Davis built the library's collection of federal publications to
more than 100,000 documents and for many years she provided reference service and
instruction in the legislative process and the use of federal publications not only to University
of Michigan-HFlint faculty and students, but to citizens throughout the congressional district.
Later, always alert to technological innovation and the educational potential of digital access
to federal documents, Ms. Davis had the foresight to propose that the library withdraw from
the print-oriented federal depository program and redirect its resources to other direct-
instruction library services to students. With the concurrence of the library director, she
worked through the meticulous federal process for deaccessioning the library's collection of
print materials, replacing it with a digital documents collection. Ms. Davis was also involved
in reading programs for the blind, and was instrumental in securing for the library a Kurzweil
reader for vision-impaired users. During her lengthy career as a professional librarian serving
faculty, students, and citizens of the greater Flint region, Ms. Davis earned the respect,
admiration, and affection of all with whom she worked.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated service
by naming Dorothy G. Davis associate librarian emerita.

Flint.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death on September 13, 2008 of I. Douglas Moon, Ph.D., professor of operations
management, School of Management, at the University of Michigan-Flint.
Professor Moon was born in South Korea on November 15, 1945. He received
his B.S. (1973) and M.S. (1974) degrees from the University of Texas, and his Ph.D.
degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 1976. From 1976-82
he was a faculty member at Columbia University, and from 1982-89 he was a faculty

Law School Academic Building and Hutchins Hall Law School Commons Addition
Dean Caminker reported that in the 75 years since the construction of the
original Law School buildings, there have been additions for library space, but not for
academic space. The size of the faculty, student body, and administrative staff has
grown significantly since the original law quad was constructed, and the way in which
legal education is delivered has changed and requires different kinds of spaces than the
current traditional classrooms. Updating of the school's facilities will ensure that the
school will continue to be able to provide the best legal education in America well into
the twenty-first century.
Executive Vice President Slottow introduced Lee Becker, partner in Hartman &
Cox Associates, to present the schematic design. Mr. Becker provided a three-
dimensional model of the new structure and displayed a diagram of the Law School

108





October Meeting, 2008

complex indicating where the new structures would be located. He noted that the
project has four areas of scope: adding the North Commons infill (16,000 square feet);
construction of South Hall, a new classroom, office, student services, and faculty office
addition (100,000 square feet); replacement of the aluminum facade on the connection
between the law quad buildings and the library stacks wing; and infrastructure
upgrades, including construction of a new chiller plant in South Hall and renovations in
Hutchins Hall.
Mr. Becker displayed schematic drawings illustrating the interiors of all of the
components of the project. He noted that the exterior of the new structures will
maintain the feeling of being within the family of buildings that form the current law
quad. Provost Sullivan added that the project is consistent with the pedagogical needs
of the Law School, and stated that she is enthusiastic about it.
Regent Deitch moved approval of the schematic design for the Law School
Academic Building and Hutchins Hall Law School Commons Addition Project as
presented at the meeting. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Great Lakes Camp, Unadilla Township, Livingston County, Michigan
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the majority of this property is
currently known as the Fresh Air Camp, and it has remained largely unused since the
1970s. The current proposal is to lease the property to the Great Lakes Camp, which
intends to construct new facilities to create a camp for children with chronic or life-
threatening illnesses or other serious medical conditions. The Great Lakes Camp will
need to work with local government agencies to obtain their permits and approvals in
order to build the camp. Similar to the Humane Society lease, this agreement will be a
ground lease. The University will not be reviewing construction plans or issuing
permits.
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Darlow, the Regents
unanimously approved authorizing the executive vice president and chief financial
officer to execute a ground lease for approximately one hundred acres of University
land in Unadilla Township, Livingston County, Michigan, to the Great Lakes Camp at
$1 per year for thirty years, with the possibility of two ten-year extensions as outlined
above.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers C.S. Mott Children's and Women's
Hospitals Replacement Project Shell Space Completion Project
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that the Regents had already
approved the schematic design for the hospitals replacement project, and this project
provides for completion of shell space within that project. He introduced Pat Warner,
associate director and chief administrative officer, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. Ms.
Warner gave a presentation reviewing the history of the C.S. Mott Children's and
Women's Hospitals replacement project, including photos of the current state of
construction. She noted that the project currently is scheduled for patient occupancy in
June 2011.

109





October Meeting, 2008

Ms. Warner reviewed the guiding principles that have been used throughout the
project planning process. She noted that the current project with the unfinished shell
space will have exceeded the number of beds required for 90% occupancy when it
opens; completion of the shell space will meet anticipated demand by adding additional
beds, an operating room, an intraoperative MRI suite, and 2 MRIs. Ms. Warner
emphasized that the project is consistent with the strategic plan for the entire health
system. The shell space completion project will add $231 million to the current project
budget of $523 million for a total of $754 million, and will change the patient
occupancy date to September 2012.
Regent Newman moved approval of the University of Michigan Hospitals and
Health Centers C.S. Mott Children's and Women's Hospitals Replacement Shell Space
Completion Project as described, and authorized issuing the project for bids and
awarding construction contracts providing that bids are within the approved budget.
She complimented Ms. Warner and other officials on the amount of effort they have
expended on this project, noting that this may be the largest single project the Regents
have ever voted on. Regent Darlow supported the motion.
Regent Darlow observed that the Regents have a high level of comfort in the
economics of going forward with this project, but asked officials to clarify why it is
important to proceed at this time, given the current difficult state-wide and national
financial situation. Ms. Warner explained that there is a window of opportunity at the
current stage of construction to complete the space in the least costly, least disruptive
manner.
Executive Vice President Kelch noted that one of the guiding principles for the
original project was to maximize the use of the land on which the hospital was to be
built. When the project was originally conceived, it was estimated that completion of
the entire project would have cost $650 million, and officials were not confident at the
time that there would be sufficient cash flow from operations to be able to fund this
amount. The project has now come to be viewed as being the highest priority and is
seen as the quickest way to obtain high-quality, single-occupancy rooms and an
updated operating room system for the medical campus.
Dr. Kelch noted that hospital officials will be updating the 10-year capital plan
to incorporate this shell space completion project; however, the current economic crisis
is creating a need for longer term planning and a reassessment of all priorities. Dr.
Kelch concluded by stating that the Hospitals and Health System is confident that it can
afford this project, although longer term planning for future projects will require further
analysis. The vote was then taken, and the University of Michigan Hospitals and
Health Centers C.S. Mott Children's and Women's Hospitals Replacement Project
Shall Space Completion Project was approved unanimously.
W.K. Kellogg Eye Center Chiller Replacement
On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the W.K. Kellogg Eye Center Chiller Replacement Project as
described, and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding construction
contracts providing that bids are within the approved budget.

NOVEMBER MEETING, 2008

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
November 20, 2008
The Regents convened at 2:10 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill,
Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice
President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Vice
President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Provost Sullivan.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She congratulated Regent
Deitch on his reelection to a third term on the Board of Regents, and extended
congratulations to Denise Ilitch for her election as a regent whose term will begin in
January 2009. She noted that Regent McGowan would be stepping down next month at
the conclusion of her second term.
President Coleman reported that the conclusion of the Michigan Difference
campaign had been celebrated last week, and she commended Vice President May and
his staff for having raised the largest amount ever-more than $3.1 billion-by a public
university. She noted that while the University's endowment and overall finances
remain strong, donor support is critical at this time of acute fiscal pressures facing the
state and the country and the ramifications for higher education.
President Coleman said that the University understands that many students and
families are being affected by the current financial crisis and the University is prepared
to help. She encouraged students and families who may be facing difficulty to contact
the Office of Financial Aid for assistance so that no student has to leave school because
of the economic downturn.
President Coleman announced that the University had recently been recognized
as a "Tree Campus USA" by the Arbor Day Foundation. She also called attention to
the inauguration ceremonies held earlier that day for Susan Martin, former provost of
the Dearborn campus, as president of Eastern Michigan University. Finally, she
recognized Bill Bess, executive director of the Department of Public Safety, who is
stepping down from that position following ten years of service.
Annual Report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA)
Professor David Potter, chair of SACUA, presented the annual report of
SACUA. Professor Potter observed that this had been a good year from the perspective
of the faculty, especially in the area of openness of communications between SACUA
and the central administration. He praised President Coleman and Provost Sullivan for
including faculty in the development of academic policy and for keeping the University
community informed about the impact of the financial crisis, and pointed out how much

117





November Meeting, 2008

faculty value the Faculty Budget Committee established by Provost Sullivan. He noted
that the major areas of concern for faculty are enhancement of Ann Arbor as a brand in
order to attract the very best faculty, development of the new benefits policy,
development of the new grievance policy, and changing policies in financial aid for
graduate students.
University Library Update
President Coleman called on Paul Courant, dean of the University Library, to
update the board on the current status of the University Library. Dean Courant noted
that the library ranks seventh among the Association of Research Libraries in total
expenditures, that 4 million people enter the libraries in the course of a year, and that
there are currently over 5.8 million pages of locally-developed digital resources online.
He described some of the benefits that will ensue from the settlement of the suit that
had been brought against the Google digitization project, including the fact that the
University of Michigan's collection will be accessible to patrons of every library in the
country. Some of the most recent additions to the library include a machine at the
Shapiro Undergraduate Library that can produce books on demand from the out-of-
copyright digital collection, resources that help faculty become comfortable with the
latest technology, and a popular new coffee shop at the Shapiro Library, "Burt's Caf6."
Among the challenges faced by the library are the intellectual property rights
issues raised by easy-to-share digital technologies, rising journal prices, materials
preservation, and access issues created by the expiration of licensing and subscription
agreements. He concluded by noting that as one of the nation's leading academic
libraries and as the "information experts in the information age," Michigan is well
positioned to set the standard for dealing with these and the other challenges and
opportunities facing the modemrn academic library.
President Coleman pointed out that Dean Courant and his team had been deeply
involved in the negotiations with Google, and throughout the process, they had
maintained a steady emphasis on the rights of access. This was enormously important,
she said, and the University owes them all a debt of gratitude.
Veterans Services Initiatives
Senior Vice Provost Lester Monts noted that while military veterans receiving
their education at the University of Michigan are valued and are an important part of
our campus community, for many veterans the transition to campus life has not been
easy.  Campus officials learned that many of the problems that veterans have
encountered in the past stem from challenges emanating from the Department of
Veterans Affairs and from a lack of coordination of services on the part of the
University. The newly coordinated veterans services initiatives will ensure that these
students' needs will be accommodated from this point forward, that student veterans are
aware of the campus resources available to them, and that student veterans will feel
welcome on campus.
Veterans services are coordinated by the Office of New Student Programs, and
he introduced Ann Hower, director of that office, to describe the new initiatives that
have been established to meet the needs of veterans. The Student Veterans Assistance
Program addresses the concerns expressed by student veterans by providing resources

118





November Meeting, 2008

and referrals, advocating to help resolve problems and to identify and eliminate
institutional obstacles, assisting deployed students with efficient departures and returns,
supporting a campus student veteran network, and collaborating with other units across
campus to support student veterans.
Dr. Hower reported that a Michigan student had founded the Student Veterans
Association, which has now become a national organization with over 85 chapters. The
Council on Student Veterans has been established, consisting of representatives from
11 units across campus, with the goal of increasing awareness about student veterans
concerns and addressing institutional obstacles that impede the progress of student
veterans. In addition, a transition specialist, who is a veteran himself, has been hired to
coordinate the services and resources for new and current student veterans, and a web
site has been established to serve as a central information source for veterans at the
University. Preparations are being made for welcoming a large influx of veterans
returning from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars who will be taking advantage of the new
GI Bill.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of this
committee, reported that she and fellow committee members Regents Maynard,
McGowan, and Deitch, as well as Executive Vice President Slottow and President
Coleman, had attended this meeting. The committee first reviewed the annual lease
portfolio for FY 2007 with Associate Vice President Hank Baier, UMHHS chief
financial officer Dave Morlock, and Mark Eboch, manager of real estate and space
information. The next session, led by Associate Provost Phil Hanlon and Assistant
Vice Provost Anne Berens, involved an overview of the Budget Administrators
Academy. This academy is a new professional development program designed to
prepare staff members with high potential for future leadership positions in budget and
resource management.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Darlow,
chair of this committee, reported that she, along with Regents Newman and Taylor, had
attended the meeting, along with Vice President Churchill, and that Provost Sullivan
and President Coleman had also been present for portions of the meeting. The first
agenda item was the SACUA annual report, presented by Professor David Potter; chair
of SACUA, with Tom Schneider, director of faculty and operational support activities,
also in attendance. The next session was an assessment by Dean Terry McDonald of
the institutional quality of the social sciences division of the College of LS&A. This
was the second of three reports the committee will be receiving from Dean McDonald.
The final session was a report from Provost Sullivan on dean and senior leadership
searches.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of October 23, 2008.

119





November Meeting, 2008

Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report
and Plant Extension Report. There was no report from University Human Resources.
He noted that the Regents had received the FY 2008 Financial Report, which has a
section on the Michigan Difference campaign and an explanation of the endowment
and the public university financial structure. He pointed out that, while the investment
report does not include results for October, results are down. However, he expressed
confidence that the University will be able to meet the goal for the endowment to
provide a dependable stream of income for the schools and colleges in the years to
come, even in the face of continued volatile market performance. He announced that
the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners had recently recognized the
University for "contributing to the inclusiveness and employment opportunities for
persons with disabilities in Washtenaw County."
Litigation Report. Vice President Scarnecchia submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report. Vice President Forrest submitted the Report of Projects
Established, October 1-October 31, 2008. He announced that for the first four months
of 2009, research expenditures are up by 6.7% from the same period of last year.
University of Michigan Health System. There was no additional report from
the University of Michigan Health System.
Division of Student Affairs. There was no additional report from the Division
of Student Affairs.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little called attention to two
new graduate programs being recommended this month for the College of Engineering
and Computer Science.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Person reported that there had been
a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the reopening of the Kearsley Street corridor.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Ms. Sabrina Shingwani, president of
MSA, updated the Regents on current projects and initiatives underway in MSA. These
include the street lighting initiative, a landlord plan, a health fair, a student government
luncheon, and a good sportsmanship project in conjunction with the Ohio State
University student government. She reported that MSA will be chartering buses to take
students to the presidential inauguration in January.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted the report of voluntary
support for October 2008. He gave a final overview of the $3.1 billion in receipts from
the Michigan Difference campaign, which include $519 million in student support, a
67% increase in endowed professorships, 22 building projects, and more than $910
million added to the endowment. He reported that 98% of pledge payments have been
paid on time or paid early. The president's challenge had resulted in 21 new
professorships and more than $70 million each for need-based undergraduate student
support and graduate and professional student support. Vice President May noted that
60% of the funds raised in the campaign came from the 40% of campaign donors who
reside out-of-state, although the largest number of donors came from the greater Detroit
area and the state of Michigan. Faculty, staff, and retiree giving accounted for $155
million from 16,575 donors.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted a retirement memoir
for Donald F. Anderson, professor of political science at the University of Michigan-
Dearborn.
Donald F. Anderson, Ph.D., professor of political science in the College of
Arts, Sciences, and Letters at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active
faculty status on April 30, 2008.
Professor Anderson received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of
Detroit in 1959 and 1961, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from Cornell University in
1968. He joined the UM-Dearborn faculty as an assistant professor in 1969, and was
promoted to associate professor in 1973 and professor in 1979.
Professor Anderson is a nationally-recognized expert on the American
presidency and is considered a leading authority on the presidency of William Howard
Taft. His study of the Taft presidency (William Howard Taft: A Conservative's
Conception of the Presidency, Cornell University Press, 1973) won an outstanding
book award from the Ohioana Library Association and was classified by the Library of
Congress Bulletin as the best single-volume work on the Taft Administration. He is
currently at work on a second Taft book, focusing on Taft's six appointments to the
Supreme Court.
Within   the  Department of Social Sciences, Professor Anderson        was
instrumental in developing a joint undergraduate program in criminal justice with
Henry Ford Community College and was a leader in developing the Master of Public
Policy Program. He served as chair or interim chair of the department for a total of ten
years between 1975 and 2005 and served several terms on the executive committee of
the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters. Professor Anderson played a central role in
the creation of the Dearborn campus' Faculty Senate, where he served in numerous
leadership roles. He was also a staunch supporter of the American Association of
University Professors and served as president of the campus chapter for many years.
He is a past president of the Michigan Conference of Political Scientists and received
its Founder's Award in 2007. Throughout his career, Professor Anderson has been
recognized by colleagues and administrators for his unwavering commitment to due
process, procedural rectitude, and fairness in administrative decision making.

November Meeting, 2008

The Regents now salute this dedicated and accomplished faculty member by
naming Donald F. Anderson professor emeritus of political science.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported to the Regents
this month.
Degrees. Provost Sullivan submitted for approval a request for awarding of a
posthumous Bachelor of Science degree for Milo Radulovich. She noted that Mr.
Radulovich, who died in 2007, had attended the University of Michigan in the early
1950s and was labeled a security risk by the U.S. Air Force during the McCarthy era.
His experiences in fighting the baseless charges against him, which were later
withdrawn, and in dealing with the national publicity surrounding his case, caused him
to leave the University before receiving his degree.  The University therefore
recommends awarding of a posthumous Bachelor of Science degree to Milo Radulovich
at the Winter 2008 Commencement. She said that members of his family are expected
to be present at the commencement ceremony. Regent Taylor said that he knows some
Radulovich family members and they are delighted that the University is taking this
action. Regent Maynard said that she regrets this was't done during his lifetime.

Regent Richner, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.

DECEMBER MEETING, 2008

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
December 18, 2008
The Regents convened at 3:05 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill,
Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice
President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Vice
President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Provost Sullivan.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She called attention to the
recent announcement that Michigan State University would become the home of a new,
$550 million Department of Energy facility for rare isotope beams, noting how the
economic impact this facility will have exemplifies the effect that the University
Research Corridor has had in this region.
Regents Resolution in Honor of Rhodes Scholar Recipient
President Coleman announced that alumnus and medical student Abdul El
Sayed recently had been named a 2009 Rhodes Scholar. She invited him to the podium
and called on Regent Katherine White, who read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The  Regents of the    University of Michigan  commend
Abdulrahman M. El-Sayed on his selection as a 2009 Rhodes Scholar.
Abdul El-Sayed is a Michigan man who is the epitome of the
Michigan difference. A native of Bloomfield Hills, he graduated from the
University of Michigan in 2007 with a B.S. degree in biology and
political science, and is now pursuing simultaneous M.D. and Ph.D.
degrees through the University's prestigious Medical Scientist Training
Program. As an undergraduate, he was a leader in the Muslim Students
Association and a starting defenseman on the lacrosse team, graduating
with highest distinction as an Angell Scholar and a member of Phi Beta
Kappa. As the    student commencement speaker in     2007, his
commencement address made such an impression on the main speaker,
President Bill Clinton, that Clinton was moved to remark, "I wish every
person in the world could have heard you speak today."
Abdul has been praised by his academic advisors as being "the
epitome of the engaged intellect" and "one of the most accomplished,
mature and goal-directed students at Michigan." Since entering the
M.D./Ph.D. program, he has led a medical mission to Peru, founded a
student neurosurgery interest group, cofounded a student community

147





December Meeting, 2008

service organization, won an award for his research, and been elected
president of the Muslim Medical Students Association.
An idealistic, humane, and determined young man, Abdul El-
Sayed has impressive goals for using his talents and skills to benefit his
fellow human beings. There is no doubt among anyone who crosses his
path that he will achieve all he sets out to accomplish and more. It is
with great pride and admiration that the regents congratulate
Abdulrahman El-Sayed on his Rhodes Scholarship and look forward to
marveling at his achievements in the years to come.
Following a standing ovation, Mr. El-Sayed thanked the Regents and noted that
it was only due to the community of mentors, coaches, and other supporters at the
University of Michigan that he has been able to achieve this honor, and that he looked
forward to proudly representing the University at Oxford University and then returning
to complete his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees.
Regents' Resolution in honor of Regent Rebecca McGowan
President Coleman announced the Regent McGowan was retiring this month
after having served 16 years on the board. President Coleman acknowledged Regent
McGowan's commitment to diversity as perhaps one of her signature contributions,
pointing out her work to expand benefits for domestic partners and her willingness to
challenge the status quo. She called on Regent Maynard.
Regent Maynard said that she was thankful for the twelve years she had served
with Regent McGowan, and that during that time they had taken on some worthwhile
challenges. "Beckie, you've given Michigan your wisdom, your vision, and your
caring, and no institution could ask for more," she said. "Your impact has been
profound, and will remain part of your legacy. You are a friend and important
colleague." She then read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend heartfelt
gratitude and appreciation to Rebecca McGowan as she concludes
sixteen years of exemplary service on the Board of Regents.
Few regents have approached their service on the board with as
much diligence, devotion, and determination as Regent McGowan, and
all of the initiatives she has pursued have been marked by the themes of
inclusivity, equity, and access. During her first year in office, she and
Regent Deitch sponsored a motion to include "sexual orientation" in the
regents' nondiscrimination bylaw; fifteen years later, with her advocacy
and full support, the bylaw was further expanded to include "gender
equity and gender expression." Regent McGowan also spearheaded
creation of the University's Childcare Task Force in 1996, which
resulted in comprehensive improvements to the University's child care
initiatives for students, faculty, and staff Regent McGowan's staunch
advocacy of the University's decision to defend its affirmative action
policies all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court perhaps most exemplifies

148





December Meeting, 2008

how her personal principles so closely match those of the University.
Regent McGowan's legacy     also includes taking  on  the
challenging task, with her colleagues, of reorganizing the leadership
structure of the Health System to ensure its long-term viability,
culminating in establishment of the position of the executive vice
president for medical affairs.  Other important programs she has
championed include the Life Sciences Initiative and the Cardiovascular
Center. Regent McGowan has served with five presidents, both interim
and permanent, and helped lead two presidential searches. She was
chair of the board in 2004-2005, and has served two terms as chair of
the board's Finance, Audit and Investment Committee.
Regent McGowan has been an active, gracious, and principled
supporter of the University, and her support and encouragement have
inspired all of us - regents, presidents, administrators, staff faculty - to
do our best. We are a better institution because of the generous and
unstinting commitment she has given of her time, wisdom, and talents
throughout her sixteen years on the board. It is with deep gratitude and
esteem that the regents name Rebecca McGowan Regent Emerita of the
University of Michigan.
A round of applause followed. Regent McGowan stated that "I have loved every
single minute of this responsibility." She also commented about how her daughter,
Margot, who was born the year she was first elected regent, had been a good natured
partner throughout her tenure and had served as her consultant on a number of youth-
related issues over the years. She said that her decision to step down after two terms
had been made jointly with her daughter. She thanked her daughter and thanked the
regents and administrators, noting that "It's been fantastic."
2008 Annual Environmental Update
President Coleman called on Associate Vice President Hank Baier to present the
annual environmental update.  Mr. Baier pointed out that copies of the 2008
environmental report had been distributed and that the report was also available on the
sustainability website.
Mr. Baier stated that during the past five years total energy use had decreased
by 4%, even as the amount of occupied space has grown by 10% and the University
population has grown by 7%. During this time, carbon dioxide emissions from
University buildings and vehicles has also decreased, and water usage has decreased.
The amount of solid waste disposal has slowly increased, but the amount of recycling
also continues to increase, with about 29% of the waste stream being recycled. Mr.
Baier reported that a solar array has been installed on the central power plant for pre-
heating water as a pilot project to see how the University might employ solar energy.
In the area of alternative transportation, Mr. Baier described some of the
programs in use at the University, including the "GreenRide" ride-share program, the
van pool program, and the "M-Ride" program, which gives free city bus rides to
anyone with a University of Michigan identification card. He reported that there are
currently about 2.2 million rides per year on the M-Ride program, and that ridership on

149





December Meeting, 2008

University-owned buses continues to increase, to the current level of about 6 million
rides per year.
With respect to new construction activity, Mr. Baier reported that the North
Quad Residential and Academic Complex, currently under construction, is designed to
exceed current energy code standards by 35%, which will save about $300,000/year in
energy operating expenses once the complex opens. He also described how the "Planet
Blue" initiative is engaging campus building occupants in projects that will save energy
and money over the short and long term.
Comments from Regent White
Regent White acknowledged a recent gift to the University from President
Coleman and her husband, Kenneth, of $25,000 for a challenge fund to promote study-
abroad participation among Michigan students and to help ensure that greater numbers
of Michigan alumni are prepared to work and lead in our increasingly interconnected
world. She continued,
"Since her arrival in 2002, President Coleman repeatedly has backed up her words
with action, whether in the realm of fundraising, policy, or the great public issues of our day. In
the plan for her second, five-year term, President Coleman announced her intent to double the
number of UM students who study abroad. Again, in this instance, she and Kenneth, himself an
international studies scholar specializing in Latin America, have contributed their personal
resources to help realize an important University goal.
This follows the Coleman's extraordinary, 2003 leadership gift of $500,000 in support
of the Life Sciences Institute, the Institute for Social Research, Trotter House renovations, the
Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, and other initiatives. And, in 2007, President
Coleman donated her entire salary increase of more than $15,000 to enhance financial aid for
graduate and professional students. Following President Coleman's superb leadership of the
successful, $3.1 billion, Michigan Difference campaign, which broke all existing records in
public higher education, this most recent gift reminds us of the ongoing importance of
philanthropy in the future of this university. Thank you President Coleman, and Kenneth, for
again leading by example."
Committee Reports Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent
White, chair of this committee, reported that she and fellow committee members
Regents Maynard and McGowan, as well as Executive Vice President Slottow and
President Coleman, had attended this meeting. Associate Vice President Laura
Patterson and Chief Information Technology Security Officer Paul Howell met with the
committee to review the Information Technology Security and Disaster Recovery
Program. Following this session, the committee met with Interim Associate Vice
President for Finance and Treasurer Greg Tewksbury and Assistant Treasurer Milagros
Dougan for a review of the debt program, rating and strategy. Next, the committee met
with Provost Sullivan, Associate Provost Phil Hanlon, and Dean Janet Weiss for a
review of the University Press. Finally, the committee reviewed the bi-monthly audit
report with Carol Senneff, executive director of University audits.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Darlow, chair
of this committee, reported that she and fellow committee member Regent Taylor, had
attended the meeting, along with Vice President Churchill, and for various portions,
President Coleman, Provost Sullivan, Vice President Scamecchia, Athletic Director Bill
Martin, Senior Associate Athletic Director Jason Winters, Associate Vice Provost

December Meeting, 2008

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted 11 retirement
memoirs, calling attention to 3 faculty members who had served more than 4 decades
each.
Violet H. Barkauskas, Ph.D., associate professor of nursing in the School of
Nursing, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2008.
Professor Barkauskas received her B.S. degree from Saint Joseph College in
1962, her M.P.H. degree from the University of Michigan in 1968, her certificate in
nurse midwifery from The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public
Health in 1969, and her Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois at the Medical
Center, Graduate College in 1980. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
associate professor in 1980.
Within the School of Nursing, Professor Barkauskas developed and taught
graduate-level community health nursing courses, supervised sizeable numbers of
master's student research papers and doctoral dissertations, conducted research projects,
and provided national leadership through her professional activities. As chair of
community health nursing from 1982-86, she led the development of undergraduate and
graduate community health nursing courses and programs, research programs, and
service-related initiatives. She also initiated the first federally-funded graduate program
in nursing home care. As the associate dean for organizational planning and support
from 1987-96, Professor Barkauskas was responsible for strategic plan development,
administrative systems, faculty and staff development, faculty recruitment, facilities
management, and information technology development.
In addition to her administrative contributions, Professor Barkauskas was also
dedicated to students, and her efforts have been consistently marked by high standards
and the desire to create exceptional future nurse leaders. Her ten years of consulting
work with the nursing programs at Vilnius University and Kaunas Medical Academy in
Lithuania, where she had been a Fulbright teacher and scholar in 1995, brought an
important international perspective to her teaching, research, and service activities.
The Regents now salute this distinguished nursing educator for her dedicated
service by naming Violet H. Barkauskas associate professor emerita of nursing.
James A. Chaffers, D.Arch., professor of architecture in the A. Alfred
Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, will retire from active faculty
status on December 31, 2008.
Professor Chaffers received his B.Arch. degree from Southern University in
1964. Following service as a captain in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1964-
68, he came to the University of Michigan, where he received his M.Arch. degree in
1969 and D.Arch. degree in 1971. From 1971-73, he taught at Southern University.
He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1973 and was
promoted to associate professor in 1975 and professor in 1979.
Professor Chaffers was both the first person to graduate from the University of
Michigan's new doctoral program in architecture and the first person in the United
States to receive a doctoral degree in architecture. As a faculty member, Professor
Chaffers served as chair of the Doctoral Program in Architecture (1991-94), interim
chair of the Architecture Program (1993-94), a member of the Advisory Board on

163





December Meeting, 2008

Intercollegiate Athletics (1991-94), and founder and director of Taubman College's
West African Studio in Ghana (2000-08). He also served for over eight years on the A.
Alfred Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning Executive Committee.
A creative and gifted teacher and professional, Professor Chaffers worked on a
range of projects throughout his career. His work focused on the design links between
spatial quality and human spirituality. Since 1997, he has served as the senior design
juror and urban design consultant for the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial in
Washington, D.C. In 1999 Professor Chaffers was honored with the University's
Harold R. Johnson Diversity Service Award. In recognition of his contributions to the
academy and to the architectural profession, he received the President's Award from
the American Institute of Architects of Michigan in 2006 and was named a fellow of
the American Institute of Architects in 2007.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming James A. Chaffers
professor emeritus of architecture.
Joseph D. Dennison, D.D.S., M.S., professor of dentistry, School of Dentistry,
will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2008.
Dr. Dennison received his D.D.S. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in
1962, and earned two M.S. degrees from the University of Michigan, in 1970 and 1995.
He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1971, and was
promoted to associate professor in 1974 and professor in 1979.
Dr. Dennison has been a dedicated teacher with high standards. He served as
chair of operative dentistry from 1986-87, and was interim chair of the Cariology,
Restorative Sciences and Endodontics Department from 1987-92. He is known for his
ability to motivate students and faculty members towards superior performance, and for
promoting a strong culture of cooperative learning within his department.
Dr. Dennison has received a wide range of grants from the National Institutes of
Health and from corporate clinical research contracts. He was the second person in
dentistry to receive a clinical research grant from the National Institute of Dental and
Craniofacial Research within the NIH at a time when this focus had not yet become a
priority for action. He constantly championed clinical research in dentistry and was
responsible for many of the procedures and evidence which exists regarding restorative
dental materials. He has published 15 book chapters, 75 peer-reviewed papers, and 137
research abstracts, and has participated in more than 300 scientific and continuing
education presentations. From 2001-2005, Dr. Dennison held the School of Dentistry's
Marcus L. Ward Professorship, and in 2006, he received the Floyd Peyton Award for
Clinical Research from the American Association of Dental Research.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Joseph D.
Dennison professor emeritus of dentistry.
Eric J. Essene, Ph.D., William C. Kelly Collegiate Professor of Geological
Sciences and professor of geological sciences, College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2008.
Professor Essene received his B.S. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1961, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Berkeley,
in 1967. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1968,

164





December Meeting, 2008

and was promoted to associate professor in 1976 and professor in 1980. He was named
the William C. Kelly Collegiate Professor of Geological Sciences in 2001.
Professor Essene's interests spanned the fields of metamorphic petrology,
mineralogy, geochemistry, and general petrology. The basic theme of his research was
the application of chemical thermodynamics to the reconstruction of P-T-X histories of
the earth's crust and mantle. He made seminal contributions to the development and
critical evaluation of geothermobarometers in metamorphic systems. He is an authority
on the innovative applications of geothermobarometry and phase equilibria to a variety
of metamorphic systems to evaluate quantitatively the P-T evolution of metamorphic
terranes and the roles of fluids in metamorphic processes. These contributions advanced
our understanding of petrogenetic and tectonic processes in the earth's crust. One
measure of his impact in geological science is that he is named as one of the original
highly cited researchers of the ISI Web of Knowledge and is among the top 100
geoscientists in the world in terms of total citations.
During his long and distinguished publishing career, Professor Essene
contributed numerous articles, essays and book chapters on a variety of subjects and in
countless numbers of scientific publications. He has directed or co-directed 72 master's
degree students and 36 doctoral students, many of whom have gone on to distinguished
careers in the geosciences.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Eric J. Essene
professor emeritus of geological sciences.
Luis O. G6mez, Ph.D., Arthur F. Thurnau Professor, professor of Asian
languages and cultures, and professor of psychology and religious studies in the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 2008.
Professor G6mez received his B.A. degree from the University of Puerto Rico
in 1963 and his Ph.D. degree in Buddhist Studies from Yale University in 1967. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty as an associate professor in 1973 and was
promoted to professor in 1979. In 1997 he completed a second Ph.D. degree in clinical
psychology from  the University of Michigan.  He was appointed professor of
psychology and religious studies in 1999.
Professor G6mez founded Michigan's highly regarded Ph.D. program in Buddhist
studies and served as chair of the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures from
1981-89 and as acting chair from 2002-03. That his students specialized in Chinese,
Japanese, Indo-Tibetan, Indian, Thai, and Burmese Buddhism testifies to his wide-
ranging knowledge and to his high level of proficiency in Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan,
Chinese, and Japanese, as well as several European languages (in addition to his native
Spanish). Professor G6mez's scholarship on Buddhism covered a remarkable range of
important topics, including Indian, Tibetan, Chinese, and pan-Asian Buddhism, with a
particular emphasis on the literature and religious vision of the Mahayana. He wrote a
number of groundbreaking articles devoted to the "sudden vs. gradual" dichotomy in both
early Chinese Chan and at the Samye Debate in Tibet. His book, Land of Bliss: The
Paradise of the Buddha of Measureless Light (1996) is considered the definitive study of
a highly influential Buddhist scripture. Professor G6mez was named the Charles O.
Hucker Professor of Buddhist Studies in 1986 and in recognition of his outstanding

165





December Meeting, 2008

undergraduate teaching, was named Arthur F. Thumrnau Professor in 1997. His work as a
graduate mentor was honored in 1995, when he received the John H. D'Arms Award for
Distinguished Graduate Mentoring in the Humanities.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
Luis O. G6mez Arthur F. Thumrnau Professor Emeritus, professor emeritus of Asian
languages and cultures, and professor emeritus of psychology and religious studies.
Margaret I. Lomax, Ph.D., research professor, Kresge Hearing Research
Institute, and research professor, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology,
Medical School, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2008.
Professor Lomax received her B.A. degree from Case Western Reserve
University in 1960 and her Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1964. She
joined the University of Michigan faculty as a research associate in 1964 and was an
instructor from 1967-68. She was appointed assistant research scientist in 1974, and
was promoted to associate research scientist in 1991, senior associate research scientist
in 1997, senior research scientist in 1998, and research professor in 2004.
From 1988-93, Professor Lomax was co-director of the Michigan Diabetes
Research and Training Center, Molecular Biology Core Facility, then director of the

173.5 Acres of Land with Buildings Located in Washtenaw County, Ann Arbor, Michigan
Executive Vice President Slottow announced that the University has an
opportunity to purchase 173.5 acres of land with approximately 1,975,000 gross square

174





December Meeting, 2008

feet of buildings, commonly known as the Pfizer Ann Arbor campus, and located at
Huron Parkway and Plymouth Road in Ann Arbor.
Executive Vice President Kelch stated that he enthusiastically recommends this
"bold investment in the community and the University in the future of the state," and
said that hospital and medical school executives Doug Strong and James Woolliscroft
also strongly support this proposal. Dr. Kelch observed that, while the University has
been extremely successful in procuring research funding over the years, the availability
of top notch research and laboratory space has never quite kept pace with the demand.
The purchase of this property would enable the University to do a planned expansion
into collaborative and thematic research and to build a new research campus. It also
allows the University to partner with the private sector, and eliminates constraints
caused by lack of suitable research space that could otherwise hinder opportunities for
collaboration.
Dr. Kelch noted that extensive financial analyses have been conducted about the
affordability of this project, and it has been deemed to be a very prudent investment.
"It will take us a while to fill the space," he said. "But we will fill it up wisely, with the
University's and the Health System's interests first and foremost, and we will work
with the community in every way we can to develop the economy of this region." He
concluded, "We believe in the city, we believe in the broader community, we believe in
the region, we believe in the state, and most importantly, we believe we can do this and
do it well."
Vice President Forrest commented that the University of Michigan is one of the
top five research organizations in the country, but because available federal funding has
flattened, it has to increase its market share in order to continue to grow. He stated,
"Experience has shown that when we have grown our facilities, our research
infrastructure, and our faculty, we win. The purchase of the Pfizer property and its
world-class built environment, along with the ability to grow and expand into the
vacant land, will really catapult the U of M into the forefront of the world's best public
and private universities."
Vice President Forrest noted that although Michigan is at the center of the
current economic contraction, "this action will send a powerful message that we are
committed to the state and to the region, and that we're growing. It will give people
confidence that the University of Michigan will maintain its excellence and will grow
the local and regional economy through innovation, employment, and partnerships with
business.
Provost Sullivan reported that, after having completed a disciplined examination
of its space, the University has determined that there is a dearth of high quality
laboratory space. She noted that this land, contiguous to North Campus, provides the
opportunity to bring together some of the University's very best scientists and faculty
members from a variety of disciplines in close proximity to each other. The ability to
cross disciplinary boundaries will promote the development of new directions in
research.
President Coleman thanked the team who had worked on exploring this
opportunity. She also thanked the Regents, whose prodding and encouragement of the

175





December Meeting, 2008

administration as they pursued the project made for a better outcome.    "I
enthusiastically bring this recommendation to you, and I second everything my
colleagues have said. This is a very big deal for the University of Michigan."
Regent McGowan moved, "with great pleasure," that the University acquire the
property in Washtenaw County, Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the price of $108,000,000,
subject to the University satisfying itself of the environmental condition of the site, the
condition of the facilities and infrastructure, and completing due diligence, and that the
executive vice president and chief financial officer be authorized to take all appropriate
and necessary steps to complete the transaction. She said, "It has been said in some of
our meetings, and I think it's really true, that this is a 100-year decision, and it's the
right one." Regent Taylor seconded the motion.
Regent Deitch noted that the Regents did not want Pfizer to leave Ann Arbor
and they were as shocked as anyone when the company announced it was closing its
Ann Arbor facility. He recounted that the University had reluctantly sold 55 acres of
land to Pfizer in 2001, but had retained the right of "first opportunity" to purchase the
land in the event that Pfizer decided to sell. That provision was a key to this current
transaction. Regent Deitch said that if a private sector employer had come forward
with a proposal to purchase the property and create high value, quality jobs, the
University would have been pleased. But the reality is that this was not going to
happen in the current climate. "However," he said, "it will happen tomorrow because
of what we're going to do on this property today and into the future."
Regent Deitch described the work that had been done during the past two years
to examine the feasibility of the University's acquiring the property. "We've looked at
this every single way. Our team has negotiated a deal that is beneficial and fair to both
sides, and I am thrilled to move this forward... and to prove that the state of Michigan
has a vibrant, viable future ahead of it."
Regent Taylor expressed support for the proposal, noting that the University
does have the capacity to undertake it, noting that "if we don't invest in ourselves, how
can we expect anyone else to invest in us?"
Regent Maynard commented that it has been a long, hard discussion, and
thanked President Coleman and the other members of the leadership team for their
toughness and persistence in the endeavor. She said that the board has spent the last two
years thoroughly discussing the opportunity from every angle possible. She said "I am
very proud today to vote yes for the real future of this university and its vision, and for
the future of the city and the state of Michigan. I am proud to be a U of M person
today."
Regent Newman noted that "the people in this room       have worked
extraordinarily hard to do this, to do it right, and to get it done in a manner that kept the
board informed always." She said that as soon as Pfizer announced it was leaving, the
team had gone to work to examine what role, if any, the University should play. She
praised the team that had done the work to accomplish the agreement once the decision
had been made to acquire the property, noting that "to get this done, in the time frame it
has been done, with the way the board was kept informed, was nothing less than
miraculous."

176





December Meeting, 2008

Regent Richner commented that everyone on the team that worked on this
transaction deserves our praise, and said, "This is a momentous day for the University
and is important to our future. I support the project."
Regent Darlow said that "this is a visionary and solid decision going forward
and I am very proud and excited to be here." Regent White associated herself with the
other regents' remarks, and then made the following statement:
During the University's bicentennial, which will be celebrated in 2017, we will be
celebrating all that our academic community has accomplished in the first two centuries. But
today, with this acquisition, we have begun the University's journey into its third century. In
1817, when the University of Michigan was established as the first university in the state of
Michigan, our founders envisioned an institution of higher learning that would lead and
enlighten our citizens and that would stand among the great institutions of the nation. Today's
announcement is another step, and it is a firm step, in advancing their vision. It is also
commensurate with our vision for the university as an active participant in the economic
development of the state and the region.
In taking the step we are taking today, we see the university that leads the nation in
academic-based research, a university whose students learn and conduct research at the
pinnacle of their fields, a university that has helped lead our state's transformation to a
knowledge economy, a university whose health system continues its sustained history of medical
breakthroughs for the well-being of our own patients and those around the world.
I know that all of us sitting around this table are gratified to be serving the university at
this time. When this exceptional opportunity has arisen, it is the sort of opportunity that
promises to make a difference in this eminent and remarkable institution and the lives of our
community of scholars, of our health system clients, and of the great state of Michigan.
The vote was then taken, and the motion to acquire the property commonly
known as the Pfizer Ann Arbor campus at Huron Parkway and Plymouth Road, in Ann
Arbor, was approved unanimously.
Executive Vice President Slottow recognized the Pfizer team as a "class act."
He noted that the University has a long history, spanning more than 50 years, of a very
strong, productive, strategic relationship with Pfizer in its current and earlier corporate
iterations. He also thanked the internal team that had worked so hard at exploring all of
the risks as well as the benefits of the transaction.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 4:35 p.m. The
next meeting is scheduled for January 22, 2009.
Sally J. Churchill
Vice President and Secretary of the University

founder of Google, is being recommended for an honorary degree and will be the
commencement speaker at the Spring 2009 undergraduate commencement. She also
announced that Dr. David Kuhl, professor of radiology, had been awarded the 2009
Japan Prize, one of the most prestigious awards in the fields of science and technology.
President Coleman announced that in December 2008 former regent Thomas A.
Roach, who had served on the board for 16 years, had died. Regent Maynard and
Regent Deitch shared some personal recollections of their friendship with Regent
Emeritus Roach.
Annual Report on Research
Vice President Forrest presented the report of research scholarship for FY 2008.
He said that the role of the Office of the Vice President for Research ("OVPR") is to
provide strategic leadership so as to position the University to thrive and lead in the
research arena. This is done by giving faculty the tools they need to succeed, and by
recognizing them when they do so.
Vice President Forrest reported that in FY2008, the total volume of research had
risen to a record high of $876 million, an increase of 3.5% over the previous year, with
Medical School funding now ranked seventh nationally. Industry spending has
increased by 11%, to a total of $43 million. He pointed out that the research portfolio
provides a level of stability in the University's overall financial picture during times if
turbulence in the financial markets.
The University's industry partnerships yielded 13 spin-off companies in
FY2008, among the highest in the country, and licensing income reached $25 million.
He reported that the Michigan Initiative for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, an
economic development effort involving all of the state's public universities and led by
the University of Michigan, is being looked to as a possible national model for regional
economic development.

January Meeting, 2009

Vice President Forrest reported that efforts to change the University culture by
recognizing and rewarding faculty for working with industry are bearing fruit. He
introduced Professor Farnam Jahanian, winner of the 2009 Distinguished University
Innovator Award, who founded a successful computer network security company. He
also described the Business Engagement Center, a collaboration between OVPR and
the Office of Development, which provides a gateway for university and business
entrepreneurs to engage with each other.
Vice President Forrest noted that the reputation of faculty strongly influences
university rankings, and that rankings can make a big difference in the quality of
students and recruitment and retention of faculty. To help improve the University's
ranking, the OVPR is working with the units to significantly increase recognition of
faculty by national and international organizations. He also pointed to efforts the
University has made in the area of maintaining faculty excellence, including providing
funding for new faculty hires in strategic areas and redesigning career paths for non-
tenure track research faculty.
Vice President Forrest reported that a new associate vice president for research
position has been created to develop a comprehensive cyber infrastructure to expand
the university's large-scale computational research capacity. Finally, he reported that
the University is positioning itself for taking advantage of new opportunities in the area
of developing new generation batteries and other renewable energy sources to update
our energy infrastructure. This is a priority for both the state and federal governments,
and is an area in which the University can help set the national agenda.
President Coleman affirmed that the administration has been encouraging deans
and department chairs to nominate faculty for recognition by important professional
associations and to recognize those who have received such recognition.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.

the U.S. Army as a Green Beret, Special Forces, during the Vietnam War, and in 1969
was awarded the Purple Heart. He earned his B.A. degree from the University of
Michigan-Flint in 1972 and his M.S.W. degree from the University of Michigan in
1977. He joined the University of Michigan-Flint faculty as a lecturer in 1977, and was
promoted to assistant professor in 1980 and associate professor in 1987.
Professor Bailey carried out an active research program and served on numerous
campus-wide and departmental committees. He was director of the Social Work
Program from 1991-96, and chair of the Department of Social Work from 1996-2008.
He also co-founded the Substance Abuse Treatment Program in the Department of
Social Work, the first such program east of the Mississippi. In recognition of his many
contributions, he received the University of Michigan-Flint's Distinguished Service
Award in 2008. An active member of the community, he had served on the board of
directors of the Michigan Consortium on Substance Abuse Education and at the time of

212





January Meeting, 2009

his death was chair of Community Recovery Services of Flint and the Genesee County
Community Mental Health Services.
Professor Bailey will be greatly missed by his students and colleagues and will
be remembered as an inspiration by all of those whose lives he touched. As we mourn
the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our condolences to his wife, Susan,
and their three children, Tyler, Logan, and Madison.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Frank E. Filisko, professor of materials and metallurgical engineering and
professor of macromolecular science and engineering, who died on November 11, 2008
at the age of 66.
Professor Filisko received his B.A. degree from Colgate University in 1964, his
M.S. degree from Purdue University in 1966, and his Ph.D. degree from Case Western
Reserve University in 1969. He joined the University of Michigan School of Engineering
faculty in what is now the Department of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering as an
assistant professor in 1970, and was promoted to associate professor in 1976 and professor
in 1983. He was also active in the Macromolecular Science and Engineering Program
(MSE) since its founding in 1978, and served as its acting director from 1987-93.
Professor Filisko loved teaching and loved research and taught a broad range of
courses. He excelled at teaching the introductory MSE and he also taught courses on
polymers and kinetics, a senior design course, and a junior-level lab. His courses in applied
polymer processing and biomaterials were very popular with students in both the materials
science and engineering and biomedical engineering departments. Professor Filisko also
had a long and productive association with the Department of Biologic and Materials
Science in the School of Dentistry.
In his research, Professor Filisko believed that as a mentor he would be most
successful when he worked alongside his students, experiencing their successes and
setbacks. His research focused on thermodynamic measurements on polymers early in his
career, and then turned to electrorheological fluids (fluids that change their flow properties,
especially viscosity, in the presence of electric fields), an area for which he received
international acclaim.
Professor Filisko will be greatly missed by faculty, students, and staff in the
College of Engineering. As we mourn the loss of this valued faculty member, the
Regents express their condolences to his wife, Doris, his children, friends, and
colleagues.
Degrees. President Coleman submitted a recommendation for an honorary
Doctor of Engineering degree for Larry E. Page, to be presented at the Spring

Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She noted that Forbes
Magazine had recently recognized the city of Ann Arbor as the best town in America
for college sports and for its other cultural amenities. She called attention to the 25th
anniversary celebration of the Department of Musical Theatre on March 21, and
announced that Associate Professor Amy Stillman had received a Grammy Award for
her work on the Hawaiian music album, "Ikena."
President Coleman noted that the University of Michigan Health System makes
numerous contributions to the region and the state, and called on Mr. Doug Strong,
director and chief executive officer of the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health
Centers.
Report: Community Benefit Provided by the University of Michigan Health System
Mr. Strong gave a presentation describing the range of benefits provided to the
community by the University of Michigan Health System. He noted that a commitment
to "improv[ing] the health of patients, population and communities" is spelled out in
the health system's mission statement, and "partnering with the community to improve
the health of the population" is one of the stated goals and objectives of the Hospitals
and Health Centers.
Mr. Strong reported that the health system brings more than $340 million of
federal research funding annually to the Michigan economy and provides high quality
care to more than 300,000 patients per year. More than one-third of the physicians it
trains remain in Michigan to practice. Through uncompensated direct patient care
($170 million), community health programs and services ($11 million), and research
costs in excess of funding ($142 million), the UMHS contributed a total community
benefit of $323 million in FY 2008. He reported that in conjunction with the St. Joseph
Mercy Health System, the Washtenaw County government, and other county agencies,
the UMHS has helped to develop a Washtenaw County Health Improvement Plan
which includes 52 objectives to be achieved by 2020. He pointed out that the UMHS
participates in the Washtenaw County Health Plan, whose mission is to expand access
to health care and improve the health of uninsured county residents, and the Washtenaw
Community Health Organization, whose mission is to develop and implement

219





February Meeting, 2009

integrated mental health, substance abuse, and physical healthcare for Medicaid and
indigent consumers in the county. The Health System also participates in other
community programs, including the Housing Bureau for Seniors, Meals on Wheels,
projects that serve children in public schools throughout the county, as well as donated
health care services provided at various non-profit clinics. He concluded by observing
that health care needs for the underinsured and uninsured are growing and that the
UMHS has significantly expanded its commitment to community benefit in recent
years.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.

a goal over the next year to achieve 30% additional energy efficiency improvements
over the 2007 building standards. He also announced that he plans to seek funding to
establish a sustainability office to assist with coordination of sustainability efforts,
establish a stronger leadership presence, and to set goals and standards for sustainability
operations on campus.
Vice President Forrest commented that environmental sustainability has also
become a focus of the Office of the Vice President for Research, and that it is working
with the EVPCFO's office to incorporate new developments in energy-saving
technology into the broader campus operation.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice          President Churchill submitted      two   faculty
retirement memoirs.
Barbara Everitt Bryant, Ph.D. research scientist in the Stephen M. Ross
School of Business, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2008.
Dr. Bryant received her A.B. degree from Cornell University in 1947, and her
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Michigan State University in 1967 and 1970,
respectively. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as an adjunct research
scientist in 1993 and in September 2008 the title was changed to research scientist.
In 1989, Dr. Bryant was appointed by President George H.W. Bush as director
of the Bureau of the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce, the first woman to head
the bureau in its 200-year history. When her term ended in 1993, she was recruited to
join the faculty of the School of Business Administration as an adjunct research

February Meeting, 2009

scientist in the National Quality Research Center (NQRC), which had just received
start-up funding to launch the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). NQRC
faculty had designed the econometric model to be used for ACSI, but the model
required a massive input of survey interview data. Dr. Bryant designed sampling and
survey methodology for simultaneously interviewing representative national samples of
recent customers of over 200 major corporations. That methodology is still in use.
From 1994-2001 she served as managing director of the ACSI, after which time she
continued her research work with the ACSI.
Dr. Bryant is the author of five books, four book chapters, and more than 50
articles in academic journals and popular publications. She received the Warren E.
Miller Award for meritorious service to the social sciences from the Inter-University
Consortium for Political and Social Research and an honorary doctorate of letters from
the University of Illinois.
The Regents now salute this distinguished researcher by naming Barbara Everitt
Bryant research scientist emerita.
Stephen Cooper, Ph.D., professor of microbiology and immunology, Medical
School, retired from active faculty status on January 2, 2009.
Professor Cooper received his B.A. degree from Union College in 1959 and his
Ph.D. degree from the Rockefeller Institute in 1963. From 1963-65 he completed NSF
fellowships at the University Institute of Microbiology in Copenhagen and at the
National Research Council in London. From 1965-70 he was a faculty member first at
Tufts University School of Medicine and then at the State University of New York at
Buffalo. Professor Cooper joined the University of Michigan faculty as an associate
professor in 1970 and was promoted to professor in 1978.
Professor Cooper's research has focused on the central issues of the biology of
living cells, notably their growth and cell division. His career began with studies on the
molecular means by which RNA bacteriophages replicate within their bacterial hosts,
but he soon shifted his interest to the host cells themselves and their replication. In the
late 1960s his work revealed fundamental aspects of DNA synthesis and chromosome
replication during the bacterial cell cycle.  Working with collaborator Charles
Helmstetter, his data and elegant interpretation of the pattern of chromosome
replication and its integration with growth rate led to what is now known as the Cooper-
Helmstetter model of this process. Forty years later, this model remains one of the
fundamental tenets of bacterial physiology, taught as a first principle in every
microbiology course. Professor Cooper studied other aspects of the segregation of
DNA molecules at cell division, but later turned his attention to eukaryotic cells,
making fundamental discoveries of their growth and division, and leading to his
continuum model of the cell division cycle. His many contributions to cell cycle
studies will continue to influence this core field of cell biology.
A   dedicated  teacher, Professor Cooper directed  the  Introduction  to
Microbiology course for many years and has taught medical and dental students
throughout his career. He has been a generous mentor and friend to students,
postdoctoral trainees, staff, and faculty.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scientist and educator for his
dedicated service by naming Stephen Cooper professor emeritus of microbiology and
immunology.

February Meeting, 2009

Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted memorial statements for two
faculty members.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Janet L. Elkins (Yanosko), associate librarian, Mardigian Library,
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Ms. Elkins died on December 24, 2008, at the age
of 36.
Ms. Elkins received her B.A. degree, with a double major in English and music
history/theory, from Oberlin College in 1994 and her M.L.I.S. degree from Wayne
State University in 1999. She joined the University of Michigan-Dearborn as an
assistant librarian in 1999 and was promoted to associate librarian in 2002.
In 2001, she became the library systems administrator, expanding her role to
include supervising systems department staff, maintaining the library's automated
cataloging system, overseeing public and staff computers, and collaborating with the web
team to develop and maintain the library's website. Ms. Elkins also offered her talents
and unique insights to various library committees, including management committees,
the Campus Relations Committee, and the Staff Webpage Committee. Within the
University community, she served on the Commission for Women (2005-06), the
Information Technology Advisory Committee, and the Web Strategy Team, where she
assisted in the design of the Dearborn campus's current website. She was instrumental in
the design and development of the Voice/Vision Holocaust Survivor Oral History
Archive website.
Library staff members will always remember Ms. Elkins' candid, courageous
battle against breast cancer and will miss her wit and love of the library. As we mourn
the loss of our valued colleague, our sincere condolences go to her husband, Brian; her
parents, Barbara A. Jur and Kenneth Yanosko; and her brother, John F. Yanosko.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of David L. Wigston, professor of biology at the University of Michigan-Flint,
who died on December 30, 2008, at the age of 65.
Born in London, England, Professor Wigston received his B.S. degree in botany
in 1965 and his Ph.D. degree in forest ecology in 1972, both from the University of
Exeter, United Kingdom. Prior to his appointment at the University of Michigan-Flint,
he served in several professorships and chair/department head positions in the United
Kingdom, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and the United States. He joined the University
of Michigan-Flint faculty in 1996 as director of research and professor of biology and
served as director of research until June 30, 2002. During his term as director of
research, Professor Wigston also served concurrently as acting dean of graduate
programs and research from 1998-2002, and director of the Master's of Public
Administration Program from 1999-2001.
Professor Wigston brought to the University of Michigan-Flint a distinguished
record of scholarship, teaching, and service. He taught in two departments: biology and
earth and resource science. As director of research, he used his vast experience to foster a
wide variety of faculty development opportunities for both junior and senior faculty, and

"State") and the Regents of the University of Michigan, a Michigan constitutional body corporate (the
"Educational Institution"), providing for the rights, duties and obligations of the Authority, the State and

the conveyance of the Facility to the Authority, (b) the conveyance of the Facility to the Authority, (c) a
lease (the "Lease"), by and among the Authority, the Educational Institution and the State, for the purpose
of leasing the Facility to the State and the Educational Institution and (d) an easement and/or other
agreement (the "Easement Agreement") between the Authority and the Educational Institution, if
necessary and/or desirable in connection with access, parking, utilities, pedestrians, encroachments,
and/or other matters pertaining to the interactions between the Facility and real property owned by the

the State, including institutions of higher education created pursuant to Section 4, 5, 6 or 7 of Article 8 of
the Michigan Constitution of 1963 (the "State Constitution"), or any of its agencies; and
WHEREAS, the Educational Institution has been maintained and created pursuant to Sections 4
and 5 of Article 8 of the State Constitution; and
WHEREAS, the State and the Educational Institution desire that the Authority finance the

Retirement     Memoirs. Vice      President Churchill submitted        two   faculty

Fernando Coronil, Ph.D., professor of anthropology and professor of history
in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 2008.
Professor Coronil received his B.A. degree from Stanford University in 1967
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago in 1970 and 1987,

260





March Meeting, 2009

respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1988 as a fellow in the
Michigan Society of Fellows. He was appointed assistant professor of anthropology
and assistant professor of history in 1991, and was promoted to associate professor in
1997 and professor in 2008.
Professor Coronil's research has focused on Latin American history, politics,
and economics in a context of globalization. His initial work, an ethnography of the
Venezuelan state, focused on Venezuela's inner workings and its setting in a global
politics of oil; subsequent studies included the Chavez regime and the attempted coup
of April 2002. Other areas of research included the cultural and political history of
Cuba up to the 1959 revolution, and explorations on the linked themes of
postcolonialism and globalization, especially as seen from a Latin American
perspective. He has produced innovative works on imperialism and political violence
and is a major figure in anthropology and in the history of modern Latin America.
Professor Coronil's teaching was spread across four units: anthropology,
history, the interdepartmental program in anthropology and history, and Latin
American and Caribbean Studies. He served as director of the Joint Doctoral Program
in Anthropology and History in 2007 and as director of the Latin American and
Caribbean Studies Program in the International Institute from 2003-07. In each unit he
contributed essential, academically rigorous courses to the curriculum at all levels,
including the innovative, year-long core graduate seminar in anthropology and history
which he helped to found. He worked with an impressive number of graduate students
and was a highly-valued colleague. His presence in international arenas as a
commentator on public issues, and his continuing engagement with colleagues in Latin
America, the United States, and Europe, made him a model of engagement outside the
academy.
The Regents salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
Fernando Coronil professor emeritus of anthropology and professor emeritus of history.
Charles E. M. Dunlop, Ph.D., David M. French Professor and professor of
philosophy in the College of Arts and Sciences, University of Michigan-Flint, retired
from active faculty status on December 31, 2008.
Professor Dunlop received his A.B. degree from Stanford University in 1965,
his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Duke University in 1969 and 1973, respectively, and
an M.S. degree from Wright State University in 1987. He joined the University of
Michigan-Flint faculty as assistant professor in 1972, and was promoted to associate
professor in 1977 and professor in 1985. He was named David M. French Professor in
1998.
Professor Dunlop served two terms as chair of the philosophy department
(1982-85, 1996-2001) and was on many college and university-wide committees,
including the College of Arts and Sciences Executive Committee, the Academic
Computing Advisory Committee, and the Budget Priorities Committee. He has a
strong record of research, and has published three books: Philosophical Essays on
Dreaming; Computerization and Controversy: Value Conflicts and Social Choices; and
Glossary of Cognitive Science, as well as over a dozen articles and many critical
reviews. Professor Dunlop presented at numerous professional conferences and taught
a wide variety of courses on such topics as computers and society, philosophy of mind,
philosophy of cognitive science, and ancient Greek philosophy, all of which were

261





March Meeting, 2009

extremely popular with students from a wide variety of disciplines. Professor Dunlop
received a pedagogical fellowship to support the design of the interdisciplinary course
"Ancient Greek Philosophy in its Cultural Context" from the Thompson Center for
Learning and Teaching in 2003. He received numerous awards for excellence in
teaching and in research, including the University of Michigan-Flint Faculty
Achievement Award for Distinguished Contributions to Research (1994); and the
Michigan Association of Governing Boards Distinguished Faculty Member Award
(1995).
The Regents now salute this outstanding scholar and educator by naming
Charles E. M. Dunlop David M. French Professor Emeritus and professor emeritus of
philosophy.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill commented that there were no deaths of
active faculty members to report, but that a memorial statement for Professor Hilton-
Watson would be submitted in April.
Degrees. President Coleman submitted recommendations for approval of
honorary degrees to be awarded to the following individuals: Ismael Ahmed, director
of Michigan Department of Human Services and director of ACCESS, Doctor of Laws;

the University's variable rate debt, and execute and deliver the required documentation
for the transaction; 4) obtain and approve any agreements for the issuance of Build for
America Bonds or Qualified School Construction Bonds. See Resolution in Appendix,
page 267.
Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman announced that the agenda includes 4 conflict of interest
items, each of which requires 6 votes for approval. These would be considered as a
block, since no regent had requested recusal from any item. On a motion by Regent
White, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents unanimously approved the following
agreements:
Authorization for an additional purchase from Arborwind Farm, LLC
The regents approved an additional purchase from Arborwind Farm, LLC
("Arborwind") for construction of a custom-designed behavioral testing chamber
required for animal testing research. Because Nicholas Douglas Luma and Jill Becker,
University of Michigan employees, are also owner and member, respectively, of
Arborwind, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.  The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1. The parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and its
MBNI and Arborwind.
2. The purchase is to pay for the labor to construct and fabricate one additional testing
chamber at Arborwind's facilities. The actual labor hours per chamber are 47 hours
at a cost of $75 per hour. Total cost for the additional chamber is $3,525 for work to
be completed by February 27, 2009.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that University of Michigan employees
Douglas Luma and Jill Becker are owner and member, respectively, of Arborwind.
Authorization for Payment to Harriet Tubman Center for Recruitment and Development
of Organizers
The regents approved a payment by the Ginsberg Center to the Harriet Tubman
Center for Recruitment and Development of Organizers ("Harriet Tubman Center") for
conducting a workshop on community organizing. Because Gregory Markus, a
University of Michigan employee, is also chair of the board of directors of the Harriet
Tubman Center, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest

263





March Meeting, 2009

Statute.   The following    information   is provided   in  compliance with    statutory
requirements:
1. Parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and its Division
of Student Affairs Ginsberg Center and the Harriet Tubman Center.
2. The payment is for two facilitators from the Harriet Tubman Center to lead a
workshop on community organizing at East Quadrangle on January 31, 2009. Total
payment is $800.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Gregory Markus, University of
Michigan employee, is also chair of the board of directors of the Harriet Tubman
Center.
Collaboration Agreement between the University of Michigan and Matabolon, Inc.
The regents approved a collaboration agreement with Matabolon, Inc., (the
"Company") that will enable the Company to fund a project in the Michigan Center for
Translational Pathology under the direction of Dr. Thekkelnaycke Rajendiran. Because
Dr. Christopher Beecher and Dr. Arul Chinnaiyan, University of Michigan employees,
are also part owner (Beecher) and holder of stock options (Chinnaiyan) in the
Company, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.
The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Matabolon, Inc.
2. Under terms of the agreement, the Company will support an effort under the direction
of Dr. Thekkelnaycke Rajendiran, Department of Pathology, to identify and validate
candidate metabolomic prostate cancer markers capable of differentiating between
early stage indolent tumors and aggressive tumors. The collaboration agreement will
enable Dr. Rajendiran to participate in the performance of this funded collaborative
research. The period of performance of the project is twenty-four (24) months and
the amount of funding support is $228,000.
3. The pecuniary interests of Dr. Beecher and Dr. Chinnaiyan arise from Beecher's
ownership interest in the Company and Chinnaiyan's possession of stock options in
the Company.
License Agreement between the University of Michigan and Metabolon, Inc.
The regents approved a license agreement with Metabolon, Inc., allowing
Metabolon to license the following technology from the University: UM File No. 3740,
"Metabolic Profiling of Prostate Cancer." Because Dr. Christopher Beecher and Dr.
Arul Chinnaiyan, University of Michigan employees, are also part owner (Beecher) and
holder of stock options (Chinnaiyan) in Metabolon, this agreement falls under the State
of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Metabolon, Inc.
2. Agreement terms include granting Metabolon an exclusive license with the right to
grant sublicenses. Metabolon will pay a royalty on sales and reimburse patent costs.
The University will retain ownership in the licensed technology and may continue to
further develop it and use it internally. No use of University services or facilities, nor
any assignment of University employees, is obligated or contemplated under the
agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees and indemnification apply, and the
agreement may be amended by consent of the parties. University procedures for
approval of these changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest review
will be done as appropriate.
3. The pecuniary interests of Dr. Beecher and Dr. Chinnaiyan arise from their
ownership interests in Metabolon, Inc.

RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF
GENERAL REVENUE BONDS AND PROVIDING FOR
OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO
WHEREAS, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer") is a constitutional body
corporate established pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as
amended, with general supervision of The University of Michigan (the "University") and the control and
direction of all expenditures from the University's funds; and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties and in order to properly serve the needs
of students attending the University, the Issuer has authorized the acquisition, construction, installation
and equipping of the capital improvements described in Exhibit A (collectively, the "Project"); and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously issued its General Revenue Bonds (the "Outstanding
Bonds"), in several series, and other obligations secured by a lien on General Revenues, and has reserved
the right to issue additional series of General Revenue Bonds, secured on a parity basis with the
Outstanding Bonds and other obligations by General Revenues (as defined in Trust Agreements pursuant
to which the Outstanding Bonds were issued), and it may be appropriate and economic to refund all or a
part of the Outstanding Bonds; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously issued and has outstanding bonds, notes or other
obligations (collectively, the "Senior Lien Indebtedness") payable from and secured by liens on certain
revenue streams of the University, including housing revenues, and Medical Service Plan Revenues
(sometimes known as Patient Care Revenues), and it may be appropriate and economic to refund all or a
part of the Senior Lien Indebtedness; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has issued and has outstanding Commercial Paper Notes, Series H (the
"Series H Notes"), and Series E (Taxable), (the "Series E Notes", and together with the Series H Notes,
the "Notes"), which are payable from and secured by General Revenues and it may be appropriate and
economic to refund all or a part of the outstanding principal of the Notes; and
WHEREAS, the financing of all or a portion of the Project and the refunding of all or a portion
of the Outstanding Bonds, the Senior Lien Indebtedness and the Notes through the issuance of General
Revenue Bonds will serve proper and appropriate public purposes; and
WHEREAS, the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
("ARRA"), effective February 17, 2009 may allow the economic and efficient use of financing structures
for the bonds authorized hereby which are different from or alternative to the normal tax-exempt bond
structures, including but not limited to the issuance of taxable "Build America Bonds" or "Qualified
School Construction bonds", with related tax credits available to the Issuer or the holders of such bonds,
or assignees thereof; and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties, and in order to control and direct
prudently expenditures from the University's funds, the Issuer determines it is necessary and desirable to
authorize the issuance of General Revenue Bonds (the "Bonds") in order to provide funds which, together
with other available funds, will be used to pay all or part of the costs of the Project, the costs of refunding
all or a portion of the Outstanding Bonds, the Senior Lien Indebtedness and the Notes, and costs
incidental to the issuance of the Bonds and the refunding; and
WHEREAS, one or more trust indentures (collectively, the "Trust Indenture") must be entered
into by and between the Issuer and one or more trustees (collectively, the "Trustee") to be designated by
an Authorized Officer (hereinafter defined), pursuant to which the Bonds will be issued and secured; and
WHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Authorized Officers to negotiate the sale of the
Bonds with one or more underwriters or groups of underwriters to be selected by an Authorized Officer

267





MARCH MEETING, 2009-APPENDIX

(collectively, the "Underwriter") and to enter into one or more bond purchase agreements (collectively,
the "Bond Purchase Agreement") and, if deemed appropriate, one or more Remarketing Agreements
(collectively, the "Remarketing Agreement") and one or more tax credit sale agreements (collectively, the
"Tax Credit Agreement") with the Underwriter or other parties, setting forth the terms and conditions
upon which the Underwriter or any other party will agree to purchase the Bonds or any tax credits related
to the Bonds and the interest rates thereof and the purchase price therefor; and
WHEREAS, in order to be able to market the Bonds at the most opportune time, it is necessary
for the Issuer to authorize the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Associate Vice
President for Finance, and the Treasurer (each an "Authorized Officer") or any one of them individually,
to negotiate, execute and deliver on behalf of the Issuer, the Trust Indenture, the Bond Purchase
Agreement, the Remarketing Agreement, the Tax Credit Agreement, and other related documents, to
establish the specific terms of the Bonds and to accept the offer of the Underwriter to purchase the Bonds
and the tax credits, all within the limitations set forth herein; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has full power under its constitutional authority for supervision of the
University, and control and direction of expenditures from the University funds, to acquire, construct,
furnish and equip the Project, to pay all or a portion of the costs of the Project and the costs of refunding
all or a portion of the Outstanding Bonds, the Senior Lien Indebtedness and the Notes by issuance of the
Bonds, and to pledge General Revenues (as hereinafter defined) for payment of the Bonds;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to determine (i) the specific amount of the cost of each
component of the Project to be financed from the proceeds of the Bonds, (ii) the portion, if any, of the
Notes to be refinanced using the proceeds of the Bonds, and (iii) the portions, if any, of the Outstanding
Bonds or of the outstanding Senior Lien Indebtedness to be refunded using the proceeds of the Bonds,
based on whether such refinancing would produce interest costs savings, more favorable debt service
schedules, more flexible documentation or a more favorable security structure for the Bonds, and to
cause to be called for redemption such of the Outstanding Bonds or Senior Lien Indebtedness as is
appropriate and consistent with the foregoing objectives. Subject to the Issuer's policies regarding
approvals of capital projects, any Authorized Officer may subsequently approve additional components of
the Project and specify that such additional components shall be financed in whole or in part from the
proceeds of the Bonds, upon which occurrence such components shall thereupon become components of
the Project hereunder.
2. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Bonds in one or more series
to be designated GENERAL REVENUE BONDS, with appropriate series designations, if any, in the
aggregate original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but not to exceed the
principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of Two Hundred Eighty Million Dollars ($280,000,000),
plus the amount, if any, required to refund any portion of the Outstanding Bonds, Senior Lien
Indebtedness and Notes and costs related to the refunding. The Bonds shall be dated as of the date or
dates established by an Authorized Officer, and shall be issued for the purpose of providing funds which,
together with other available funds, will be used to pay all or a portion of the costs of the Project, all or a
portion of the costs of refunding all or a portion of the Notes, the Outstanding Bonds and the Senior
Lien Indebtedness and the costs related to the issuance of the Bonds and the refunding, including
capitalized interest, if any for such period as an Authorized Officer may determine appropriate, and bond
insurance premiums, if appropriate. The Bonds shall be serial Bonds or term Bonds, which may be
subject to redemption requirements, or both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first
maturity shall be no earlier than July 1, 2009 and the last maturity shall be no later than December 31,
2043. The Bonds may bear no interest or may bear interest at stated fixed rates for the respective
maturities thereof as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the weighted average yield
(computed using the stated coupons and the stated original offering price) for the Bonds shall not exceed
7.0% per annum for tax-exempt Bonds or 11% per annum for taxable Bonds, and the Bonds may be
issued in whole or in part as capital appreciation bonds, which for their term or any part thereof bear no
interest but appreciate in principal amount over time at compounded rates (not in excess of 7.0% per
annum for tax-exempt Bonds or 11% per annum for taxable Bonds) to be determined by an Authorized

268





MARCH MEETING, 2009-APPENDIX

Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds may bear interest at a variable rate of interest for all or a
portion of their term, and the variable rate of interest shall not exceed the lesser of the maximum rate
permitted by law or the maximum rate, if any, to be specified in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds may be
subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the times and prices and in the manner as
shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but no redemption premium shall exceed 3% of the
principal amount being redeemed unless the redemption price is based on a "make whole" formula, in
which case no redemption premium shall exceed 40% of the principal amount being redeemed. Interest
on the Bonds shall be payable at such times as shall be specified by an Authorized Officer. The Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered form in denominations, shall be payable as to principal and interest in
the manner, shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be executed and authenticated, all as shall
be provided in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds shall be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond
Purchase Agreement for a price to be established by an Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's
discount, exclusive of original issue discount, shall not exceed 1.0% of the principal amount thereof) plus
accrued interest, if any, from the dated date of the Bonds to the date of delivery thereof.
All or any portion of the Bonds may, subject to the parameters set forth above, be issued as
Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds or under any other structure established or
enhanced by the provisions of ARRA, and in connection therewith, each of Authorized Officers is
authorized to make, for and on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, any and all designations or elections
(revocable or irrevocable), to execute and deliver any agreements, certificates or other instruments to or
with the federal government or any agency thereof or the State of Michigan or any agency thereof, and to
take any other actions necessary for the Bonds, the holders of the Bonds and the Issuer to receive any
benefits, funds or federal subsidies available under ARRA. In addition, each Authorized Officer, is
authorized to negotiate, execute and deliver, for and on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, any Tax
Credit Agreements or similar agreements relating to the sale or other disposition of any tax credits or
other benefits, funds or federal subsdidies available under ARRA.
In relation to the debt service on all or any portion of the Bonds, or in relation to debt service on
all or any portion of the Senior Lien Indebtedness or of the Outstanding Bonds, any of the Authorized
Officers may, at any time, on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into an interest rate swap, cap,
forward starting swap, option, swaption, rate lock or similar agreement or agreements (collectively, the
"Swap Agreement") with a counter-party or counter-parties to be selected by the Authorized Officer.
Such Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the Issuer and the counter-party related to
interest on all or a portion of the Bonds, the Senior Lien Indebtedness or the Outstanding Bonds, or to
indexed or market established rates. If the Swap Agreement is entered at approximately the same time
as the issuance of the Bonds, the expected effective interest rates on the Bonds, taking into account the
effect of the Swap Agreement, shall be within the limitations set forth herein. Any Swap Agreement in
the form of an option, swaption or forward starting swap, may, if the Bonds to which such agreement
relates are not ultimately issued, be required to be terminated, with a possibility of a resulting
termination payment due by the University.
Any or all of the Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the option of the holder
thereof or to mandatory tender. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any Bonds subject to tender
options may be made payable from General Revenues, from available cash reserves of the University,
subject to such limitations as may be specified in the Trust Indenture, or from, directly or as support for
the cash reserves, a letter of credit, line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity
device, or one or more of the same, or any combination thereof (collectively, the "Liquidity Device"), all
as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer. The Liquidity Device, or any part thereof, may also be
used to provide liquidity for any other indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer, including the Notes, the
Outstanding Bonds, any variable rate Senior Lien Indebtedness and any variable rate Hospital Revenue
Bonds. Any reimbursement obligation for draws under the Liquidity Device shall be a limited and not a
general obligation of the Issuer, payable from, and may be secured by a pledge of, General Revenues.
Any portion of the Liquidity Device which provides liquidity for any Senior Lien Indebtedness or
Hospital Revenue Bonds may, but shall not be required to, be additionally or alternatively payable from,
and may be secured by a lien on, any revenue stream securing the obligations for which the liquidity is
provided. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer,
any agreements or instruments necessary to obtain, maintain, renew or replace, and provide for

269





MARCH MEETING, 2009-APPENDIX

repayments under, any Liquidity Device deemed by such officer to be required for the purposes of this
Resolution.
Any Bonds authorized and issued hereunder, may, at any time, upon direction of an Authorized
Officer, be subsequently converted to another mode or structure authorized hereby, either through
procedures established in the Trust Indenture pertaining thereto, or through the issuance hereunder of
refunding Bonds to refund and replace the outstanding Bonds to be converted. Any such refunding
Bonds issued hereunder shall be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in this
Resolution. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer,
any documents or instruments, including but not limited to, any amendments to the Trust Indenture,
necessary or convenient for the purpose of accomplishing the conversion as described in this paragraph.
3. The Bonds, and the obligations of the Issuer under the Tax Credit Agreement, the Swap Agreement
and the Liquidity Device, if any (except as specifically provided otherwise in Section 2 hereof), shall be
limited and not general obligations of the Issuer payable from and secured, by a lien on the General
Revenues (as shall be defined in the Trust Indenture in a manner generally consistent with the definition
thereof contained in the Trust Agreements pursuant to which the Outstanding Bonds were issued), subject
only to the senior liens on portions of General Revenues securing the respective series of Senior Lien
Indebtedness ( until each respective series of such Senior Lien Indebtedness is paid or defeased in
accordance with its terms). The lien on General Revenues securing the Bonds shall be on a parity basis
with the lien securing the Notes and the Outstanding Bonds. The Bonds and the obligations of the Issuer
under the Tax Credit Agreement, the Swap Agreement and the Liquidity Device, if any may also be
payable from and secured by a lien on moneys, securities or other investments from time to time on
deposit in certain funds created pursuant to the Trust Indenture or agreements entered into in connection
with the Tax Credit Agreement, the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount of or interest or premium on
the Bonds, or for the payment of any amounts owing under the Tax Credit Agreement, the Swap
Agreement or the Liquidity Device, if any, or any claim based thereon against the State of Michigan, or
any officer or agent thereof or of the Issuer or the University, as individuals, either directly or indirectly,
nor, except as specifically provided in the Trust Indenture or the instruments entered into in connection
with the Tax Credit Agreement, the Swap Agreement or the Liquidity Device, if any, against the Issuer,
nor shall the Bonds and interest with respect thereto, or any obligations of the Issuer in connection with
the Tax credit Agreement, the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device, if any (except as otherwise
specifically provided in Section 2 hereof), become a lien on or be secured by any property, real, personal
or mixed of the State of Michigan or the Issuer, other than the General Revenues and the moneys from
time to time on deposit in all or part of the funds established by the Trust Indenture or the agreements
entered into in connection with the Tax Credit Agreement, the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device, if
any.
Any pledge of General Revenues, and funds specified in the Trust Indenture or agreements
entered into in connection with the Tax Credit Agreement, the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device, if
any, shall be valid and binding from the date of the issuance and delivery of the Bonds or such
agreements, and all moneys or properties subject thereto which are thereafter received shall immediately
be subject to the lien of the pledge without physical delivery or further act. The lien of said pledge shall
be valid and binding against all parties (other than the holders of any outstanding bonds, notes or other
obligations secured by a senior or parity lien on any portion General Revenues) having a claim in tort,
contract or otherwise against the Issuer, irrespective of whether such parties have notice of the lien.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any obligations of the Issuer under the Tax
Credit Agreement, the Swap Agreement or any agreement with respect to the Liquidity Device may, if
determined appropriate by an Authorized Officer, be payable and secured on a subordinated basis to the
Bonds and other General Revenue obligations of the Issuer, or may be unsecured.
4. The right is reserved to issue additional bonds, notes or other obligations payable from and secured on
a parity basis with the Bonds from the General Revenues, upon compliance with the terms and
conditions, if any, as shall be set forth in the Trust Indenture.

APRIL MEETING, 2009

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
April 16, 2009
The Regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Ilitch, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice
President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Vice
President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice
President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She reported that three UM
students had recently won NCAA national championships, and introduced two of them:
Tyler Clary, who earned two national championships in swimming, and Steve Luke, the
NCAA wrestling champion at 174 pounds, who was also the first University of
Michigan wrestler in 35 years to have an undefeated season. The third student, Tiffany
Ofili, who could not be present, is the NCAA champion in the 60-meter hurdles.
President Coleman also commended senior Eszter Zavodszky, recipient of the
prestigious Churchill Scholarship.
President Coleman further noted that two faculty members, Laura Kasischke
and Heidi Kumao, had received 2009 Guggenheim Fellowships, and another, Steven
Wright, is being recognized by the Presidents Council, State Universities of Michigan,
as the state's Distinguished Professor of the Year.
President Coleman reported that the inauguration of Ruth Person as the seventh
chancellor of the University of Michigan-Flint would take place on April 17, and that
this meeting would be the last that Dr. Robert Kelch would attend as executive vice
president for medical affairs.
President Coleman highlighted the agenda item regarding the proposed
renovation of Couzens Hall, noting that it would be the latest project in the Residential
Life Initiative. She concluded by announcing that she recently had a campus
conversation with students about tuition, financial aid, and the University's budget
situation, and that a concise explanation of the budget would be posted on the
University's website.
She then called on Provost Sullivan.
Financial Aid Update
Provost Sullivan gave a presentation highlighting the effect of the provisions of
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, or "stimulus legislation") on
financial aid. The most significant provision, she noted, is a tuition tax credit, known
as the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides up to a maximum amount of

273





April Meeting, 2009

$2,500, effective for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years. The University
estimates that over 22,000 UM families will qualify for the tax credit, and that $2,500
represents more than 20% of current resident undergraduate tuition. In effect, she
noted, a significant portion of the student body will receive more than 20% of next
year's tuition from the federal government, representing a total of about $55 million, or
half again the amount the University itself has been able to offer in financial aid.
Provost Sullivan pointed out that this tax credit will be of particular benefit for middle-
income families.
Provost Sullivan reported out that the ARRA also calls for increasing the
maximum Pell Grant by $619, to $5350. The increase in Pell funds, which are targeted
to low-income students, will free up institutional grant aid which can then be
distributed to other students; this increased funding at the University will total
approximately $2 million.
The third aspect of the stimulus legislation provides for increased Federal Work
Study funding that will provide an additional $1.6 million in one-time funding for all
three campuses. This means that the campuses will be able to fund about 440 more
student jobs for 2009-10. Provost Sullivan pointed out that the tax rebates distributed
as part of the Stimulus Act of 2008 are excluded when calculating the expected family
contribution for financial aid.
Provost Sullivan concluded that the federal economic stimulus legislation will
help to defer the cost of attending the University of Michigan, but at the same time,
additional institutional investment in financial aid continues to be a top priority.
It was noted that the University would make information available through its
website to inform families about the benefits being offered through the stimulus
legislation, and that the University would continue to emphasize its policy of meeting
the full demonstrated financial need for resident undergraduate students.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that attendees had included
Regents Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, and Executive Vice President Slottow. The first
agenda item was a review of the financial challenges facing WFUM-TV, the
University's television station. Vice President David Lampe and the director of
Michigan Public Media, Steve Schram, were present for this discussion.
The second agenda item was the FY 2010 General Fund budget update. In
addition to members of the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, Regents
Darlow, Newman, Richner, and Taylor, President Coleman, Provost Sullivan, Associate
Provost Phil Hanlon, Chancellor Little, and Chancellor Person also attended this
session.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Darlow,
chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that
Regents Taylor, and Newman, along with Provost Sullivan, President Coleman, and
Vice President Churchill, had attended the committee meeting that morning.

274

reappointments under consideration.  Dean Terry McDonald of the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, along with associate deans Derek Collins and

the College of LS&A, the third in a series of reports on various aspects of the college.
This committee then joined the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee for the

President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.

for Ms. Shingwani.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Person had no additional report, but
noted that she was looking forward to her inauguration celebration the following day.
University of Michigan-Dearborn.   Chancellor Little reported that the
University of Michigan-Dearborn public safety officers had done an outstanding job of
securing the campus in the wake of a tragic murder-suicide that had occurred on the
campus of Henry Ford Community College, which is adjacent to the Dearborn campus.
He also noted that as part of the campus's continuing series of "conversations about
race," guest Gwen Ifels had commended the campus community for its easy way of
talking about racial subjects.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Ms. Sabrina Shingwani, outgoing
president of MSA, reviewed her accomplishments during the year of her presidency,
and thanked the administration and the Regents for their ongoing efforts on behalf of
students. She then introduced Abhishek Mahanti, newly-elected president. Mr.
Mahanti noted that his initiatives will focus on reaching out to the student body at large,
and doing small things to promote communication among students. He then listed
some of the specific efforts he has planned for the coming year.

April Meeting, 2009

Cynthia S. Pomerleau, Ph.D., research professor in the Department of
Psychiatry and in the University of Michigan Substance Abuse Research Center,
Medical School, will retire from active faculty status on April 30, 2009.
Professor Pomerleau received her B.A. degree from Smith College in 1964, her
M.A. degree from Columbia University in 1966, her Ph.D. degree from the University
of Pennsylvania in 1974, and a second M.A. degree from the University of Hartford in
1985. She joined the University of Michigan Department of Psychiatry in 1985 as a
research associate and director of the Nicotine Research Laboratory in the Behavioral
Medicine Program and was promoted to senior research associate in 1993, assistant
research scientist in 1994, senior research scientist in 2003, and research professor in
2004. In 1997 she was appointed assistant research scientist in the University of
Michigan Substance Abuse Research Center (UMSARC); she was promoted to senior
associate research scientist in 1998 and research professor in 2008.
As director of the Nicotine Research Laboratory, Professor Pomerleau has received
national and international recognition for her sponsored research on smoking and nicotine
dependence. She has focused particularly on the impact of smoking on women, including
its effect on the menstrual cycle, post-cessation weight gain, and depression. She has
produced more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific publications, including parts of the 2001
Surgeon General's Report on Smoking in Women. She is sole author, coauthor, or coeditor
of four books, with a fifth in preparation.
Within the Medical School, Professor Pomerleau has served on the operating
committee of the UMSARC and on the Advisory Committee on Primary Research
Appointments, Promotions, and Titles. She is a council member of the University of
Michigan Chapter of Sigma Xi, the national scientific honor society. Within the broader
scientific community, she is a charter member of the Society for Research on Nicotine and
Tobacco and founding editor of its newsletter. She is a fellow of Divisions 28, 38, and 50
of the American Psychological Association and served as editor of the Division 28
Newsletter.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Cynthia S.
Pomerleau research professor emerita.
Ovide F. Pomerleau, Ph.D., professor of psychology in psychiatry in the
Medical School, will retire from active faculty status on April 30, 2009.
Professor Pomerleau received his B.A. degree from Bowdoin College in 1962
and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University in 1965 and 1969,
respectively. He was a faculty member at Temple University from 1969-72, and at the
University of Pennsylvania from 1972-78. In 1979 he was appointed professor of
psychology in psychiatry at the University of Connecticut, where he served as director
of the University of Connecticut Behavioral Medicine Program and chief of
psychology, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, in Newington, Connecticut. Professor
Pomerleau joined the University of Michigan Department of Psychiatry faculty in 1985
as professor of psychology and director of the Behavioral Medicine Clinics and the
Nicotine Research Program.
Professor Pomerleau has been principal investigator on 38 funded research
projects, and his bibliography includes 115 peer-reviewed articles and three books on
substance abuse and behavioral medicine. His early investigations involved clinical
process studies on alcohol abuse and smoking. Subsequently, his research interests

286





April Meeting, 2009

shifted to underlying mechanisms and his laboratory was the first to carry out systematic
explorations of nicotine's pituitary hormone effects. Later studies examined key
subjective and physiological manifestations of nicotine's neuroregulatory effects. He
also conducted critical investigations on individual differences in sensitivity to nicotine,
setting the stage for his current research on smoking-risk phenotypes and genotypes.
Professor Pomerleau is a fellow of the American Psychological Association, the
Society of Behavioral Medicine, and the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research.
In 1994 he became the founding president of the Society for Research on Nicotine and
Tobacco, and in 2004 that organization awarded him the Ove Ferno Award for
Outstanding Clinical Research.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Ovide F. Pomerleau
professor emeritus of psychology in psychiatry.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted a memorial statement for
Professor Matthew Hilton-Watson, associate professor of foreign languages at the
University of Michigan-Flint.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death on March 16, 2009, of Matthew Hilton-Watson, associate professor of
foreign languages in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Michigan-
Flint.
Professor Hilton-Watson was born in Lexington, Kentucky on October 28, 1968.
He earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Kentucky in 1991 and 1993,
respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 2000. He joined
the University of Michigan-Flint faculty as a lecturer in 1999, and was promoted to
assistant professor in 2000 and associate professor in 2006. He had been serving as chair
of the Foreign Languages Department since July 1, 2008.
An active researcher, Professor Hilton-Watson's primary interests were in the
areas of pedagogy and the scholarship of teaching, romance languages and literature,
and most recently, French Canada. In addition to teaching French, Professor Hilton-
Watson taught in and contributed actively to the Honors Program and the International
and Global Studies Program. He was a committed advisor and mentor, and was
instrumental in enhancing and expanding study-abroad opportunities for students. In
fact, at the time of his death, he had just returned from leading a group of students to
Montreal, Canada for an alternative spring break experience. A popular teacher, he was
chosen by students to receive the University of Michigan-Flint Professor of the Year
Award in 2004.
Professor Hilton-Watson served on the Travel Abroad Insurance Committee, the
Channel 28 Community Advisory Board, and the Ross Learning Resource Center
Advisory Committee. He was perhaps best known as the director of the International and
Global Studies Program from 2006-08, and also served on its advisory committee. He
was elected as a member at large in the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters
in 2005.
Professor Hilton-Watson's enthusiasm, passion, and love of knowledge were
infectious and inspiring, and he had a lasting impact on everyone who knew him. As we
mourn the loss of this scholar, teacher, and friend, our condolences go to his wife, Sarah,
and their two children, Alexander and Catherine.

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
May 14, 2009
The Regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Henry Ford Estate-Fair Lane on the
campus of the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Present were President Coleman and
Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Ilitch, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White. Also
present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice
President Harper, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,
Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia,
Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order and thanked Chancellor Little
and his staff for all of their efforts in hosting the regents on the Dearborn campus. She
welcomed Dr. Ora Pescovitz to her first meeting as executive vice president for medical
affairs, and noted that she had just been named one of the 25 most influential women in
health care by Modern Healthcare magazine.
President Coleman reported that the University had recently announced plans
for all three campuses to become smoke-free beginning in the summer of 2011, noting
that this objective is in keeping with the goals of the MHealthy initiative to improve the
health of the University community.
President Coleman made note of the fact that the University had recently
received triple A bond ratings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor
Services, pointing out that this reflects diligence on the part of Executive Vice
President Slottow and his team, particularly during these challenging economic times.
President Coleman reported that several faculty members have been appointed
to positions in the Obama administration, including Rosina Bierbaum, dean of the
School of Natural Resources and Environment, Rebecca Blank, former dean of the
Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, and Robert Groves, professor of sociology and
director of the Survey Research Center. She also congratulated three faculty members
who have recently been elected to the National Academy of Sciences.
She then called on Chancellor Little.
Presentation: Civic Engagement Project
Chancellor Little observed that as part of the Dearborn campus's metropolitan
mission, it aims to combine the educational excellence of the University of Michigan
with a genuine, sustained ability to impact the Detroit and southeast Michigan
metropolitan area. In keeping with that effort, the University emphasizes civic
engagement, with the goal of finding ways of bringing students into real, sustained
engagement with their communities. He introduced Professor Troy Murphy, director of
the Center for Civic Engagement. Professor Murphy gave a presentation on the Civic

299





May Meeting, 2009

Engagement Project, whose mission is to nurture practical action in the community
while fostering a vision of higher education in which notions of citizenship, democracy,
and civic engagement become an integral part of the learning experience.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that attendees at that morning's
meeting had included Regents Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, and President Coleman, in
addition to Executive Vice President Slottow. The first agenda item was a review of
the FY 2010 Athletic Department draft budget, presented by Bill Martin, athletic
director, and Jason Winters, executive director of athletics business operations.
Regents Darlow and Richner joined the committee for the discussion of the
second agenda item, the draft FY 2010 Hospitals and Health Centers budget. Executive
Vice President for Medical Affairs Pescovitz, HHC Director and Chief Executive
Officer Doug Strong, and HHC Chief Financial Officer Dave Morlock also participated
in this session. The meeting concluded with the bi-monthly audit update, presented by
Carol Senneff, executive director of University audits.
Regent White then made the following comments about the University's budget
and financial situation:
"The Board of Regents is deeply engaged in monitoring the fiscal health of the
University. We take seriously our responsibility as the stewards of both its finances and its core
mission.
Since the national financial crisis first unfolded last fall, the Regents have met monthly
with several of the University's executive officers to discuss our financial status and to hear
about any progress on cost saving measures, investment strategies, and related issues. We will
maintain this important dialog going forward. It is gratifying that through prudent investment
and aggressive cost-cutting measures, the University remains financially stable, allowing us to
maintain our core priorities and commitments.
In anticipation of the challenges and difficult choices that we certainly face the next
fiscal year, we began our work on the 2010 budget in December, which is earlier than we
usually do. Since that time, we've met monthly with leadership in order to give this critical task
the full, deliberate consideration it warrants. The budget we consider for approval next month
will be the product of that thorough and thoughtful process. It will be lean, with substantially
lower expenditure increases than in recent years. Inevitably, there will be unavoidable cost
increases, but we are taking advantage of every opportunity to keep costs under control.
Throughout this process, we have been mindful of the delicate tradeoffs required in
these troubled times in order to sustain the University's simultaneous commitments to access
and affordability, excellence in teaching and research, and to public service, particularly efforts
to help revive the state's economy. Our focus on those commitments are our top priority, and we
will be voting on that budget next month."
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Darlow,
chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that the
committee had met that morning with she and Regent Newman in attendance, along
with Vice President Churchill, Provost Sullivan, and Chancellor Little.
Provost Sullivan reported on various dean searches and reviews that are
underway, including those for the dean of the School of Kinesiology and director of the
Museum of Art. Other agenda items included review of a proposed bylaw amendment,

300





May Meeting, 2009

discussion of the regental approval process for personnel appointments, and board self-
assessment procedures. Chancellor Little reported on the issue of faculty recruitment
and retention on the Dearborn campus.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of April 16, 2009.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report,
Plant Extension Report, and the University Human Resources Report. He noted that
the University had recently received AAA ratings and report of a stable outlook from
both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, which speaks highly of the efforts of the board
and university administrators in maintaining the strength and quality of the University
over time. Positive factors cited by the ratings agencies were continued focus on
quality, the strength and stability of the research enterprise, and the continued focus on
cost containment. Negative factors include the state's economy and the resultant
downward pressure in state appropriation, health care market volatility, and the
volatility of the capital markets.
Update on due diligence process related to the pending Pfizer site purchase
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that since December, the University
has been working with external consultants to perform due diligence related to the
purchase of the Pfizer property. The property consists of about 2 million gross square
feet on 175 acres. Its purchase has no direct impact on the general fund, and no state
appropriation or tuition dollars will be used for the purchase. He announced that the
due diligence period would formally end on May 18, 2009, and the conditions have
been found to be generally acceptable. Barring some unforeseen issue, plans are to
close on the transaction within 30 days of the end of the due diligence period.
Executive Vice President Slottow said that the following members of the due
diligence team were present in case the regents had questions: Associate Vice
President Hank Baier; assistant general counsel Ciara Comerford; Fred Blickle, vice
president, Conestoga-Rovers & Associates; John G. Cameron, Jr., partner, Dickinson
Wright PLLC; Jeffrey Hausman, vice president, SmithGroup; and Sharon R. Newlon,
partner, Dickinson Wright PLLC. The consultants responded to questions from the
regents about the condition of the site from an environmental perspective and the
methods used to assess environmental conditions; whether there are any issues with
respect to the title or survey work; the methods used to assess the site infrastructure and
whether there was adequate time to complete a detailed assessment of such a large site;
and how they would characterize the interactions between Pfizer and University of
Michigan officials during the due diligence period. Other than the mention of Parcel D,
no significant environmental issues were encountered.
President Coleman expressed her appreciation to the entire team for their
diligence and to the board for being so supportive of this transaction.
Litigation Report. Vice President Scarnecchia submitted the Litigation Report.

301





May Meeting, 2009

Research Report. Vice President Forrest submitted the Report of Projects
Established, April 1 - April 30, 2009. He noted that the University of Michigan had
just received a $19.5 million grant for establishment of an "energy frontier research
center" which will investigate solar and thermal-electric materials and devices.
University of Michigan Health System. There was no additional report from
the University of Michigan Health System.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper thanked the board for its
support of the Residential Life Initiative (RLI), which has supported revitalization of
residence halls. She noted that the agenda includes a request for approval of the 2009-
2010 University Housing residence hall and Northwood Community Apartments rates,
which incorporate continued funding for the RLI. She thanked staff and students
participating in the rate-setting process. She reported that cost containment efforts for
fiscal year 2010 include reduction in overtime and temporary employment, savings in
residential dining services, and reduced expenses in residence hall room telephone
service. Two percent of the proposed residence hall rate increase is devoted to the RLI,
and 1.9% for the general cost of operations.
Vice President Harper also highlighted the recommended appointment of Laura
Blake Jones as associate vice president and dean of students.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little highlighted the proposed
appointment of Catherine A. Davy as provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Person reported on several events
that had recently occurred on the Flint campus, and also welcomed Dr. Pescovitz,
noting that that they are former colleagues from the University of Indiana.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Mr. Abhishek Mahanti, president of
Michigan Student Assembly, reported that the presidents of each of the three campus's
student government body planned to form a presidents' council to enhance
collaboration. He reviewed a variety of initiatives being planned for the upcoming
year.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted the report of voluntary
support for April 2009. He described an event that had recently been held-the first of
its kind-to thank all of the donors who had given tens of millions of dollars for
University-wide scholarships.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted 23 faculty retirement
memoirs.
Dorit D. Adler, M.D., professor of radiology in the Medical School, will retire
from active faculty status on May 31, 2009.
Dr. Adler received her B.A. degree from the University of California, Los
Angeles in 1974, her M.P.H. degree from the University of Michigan in 1975, and her
M.D. degree from McGill University in 1980. She returned to the University of
Michigan in 1980 to pursue a residency and fellowship in the Department of Radiology.
She joined the faculty as an instructor in 1984 and was promoted to assistant professor
in 1985, associate professor in 1991, and professor in 2000.
Recognized as a national authority in the field of breast imaging, Dr. Adler is
the author of over 70 publications in scientific journals and 7 published book chapters.
She participated in a variety of funded research investigations, reviewed many
scientific manuscripts, and was an invited lecturer at national meetings. She has served
as a guest examiner in breast radiology for the American Board of Radiology, and in
1994 was named by Working Woman Magazine as one of the top 16 radiologists
specializing in mammography.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for her dedicated
service by naming Dorit D. Adler professor emerita of radiology.

Professor Windfuhr's research focuses on the fields of Iranian languages and
linguistics, Iranian dialectology and Zoroastrian studies. His innovative research has
centered on the metaphysical dimensions of Zoroastrian thought, exploring the social
and cosmic settings of Zoroastrian texts. His studies on Zoroastrian ritual, calendar,
and astrology have provided an important window on how ancient Iranians saw and
experienced their world. He is the author of a pioneering textbook for the teaching of
modem Persian language, which is used widely throughout the academy in the United
States. He has written extensively on the ancient Iranian language of Avestan and on
the Iranian dialects of Behdinan, Boir-Ahmadi, Luri and Talyshi, and his research has
been funded by awards from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1974-
75) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (1985-88).
Professor Windfuhr taught undergraduate and graduate courses in Zoroastrian
religion, Avestan, Pahlavi, and modern Persian language and literatures, and served as
chair of the Department of Near Eastern Studies for a decade (1977-87). He was an
academic advisor to undergraduate students concentrating in AAPTIS (Arabic,

Paul W. Zitzewitz, Ph.D., professor of physics, College of Arts, Sciences, and
Letters, and professor of science education, School of Education, University of
Michigan-Dearborn, retired from the active faculty status on April 30, 2009.
Professor Zitzewitz earned his B.A. degree from Carleton College in 1964, and
his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University in 1965 and 1970, respectively.
Between 1970-73, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Western Ontario,
and then a senior scientist at Corning Glass Works. He joined the faculty of the
University of Michigan-Dearborn as an assistant professor of physics in 1973, and was
promoted to associate professor in 1978 and professor in 1983. He was appointed
professor of science education in 2004.
Professor Zitzewitz's research focused on positrons and positronium, and in
particular, precision measurements of the decay rate of orthopositronium. During his
long career, Professor Zitzewitz taught most of the courses in the physics curriculum
and also made important contributions in other areas, including the upper-division
laboratory courses, electronics and the advanced laboratory, reform of both the
pedagogy and laboratories of the introductory calculus-based mechanics course, and
development and teaching of three courses for pre-service and in-service elementary
school teachers. He has authored four integrated science textbooks for middle and
early high school students.
Within the Dearborn campus, Professor Zitzewitz served as chair of the
Department of Natural Sciences and associate dean of the College of Arts, Sciences,
and Letters. He is active in many physics and physics teachers' organizations, and
served as president of the Michigan Section, American Association of Physics Teachers
(AAPT), and treasurer and executive board member of the national AAPT. He received

Jens C. Zorn, Ph.D., professor of physics in the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2009.
Professor Zorn received his A.B. degree from Miami University in 1955 and his
M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale University in 1957 and 1961, respectively. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1962 as an assistant professor, and was
promoted to associate professor in 1967 and professor in 1970.
Professor Zorn's research focus was on atomic and molecular physics. He and
his students did precision measurements of atomic polarizabilities, molecular structure,
and nuclear shapes using molecular beam methods that included the first observation of
individual molecules absorbing photons of sub-kilohertz frequencies.  Their
experiments on metastable atoms and molecules created by impact of low-energy
electrons revealed a previously unobserved state of molecular hydrogen and also
showed a novel way to produce and trap ultra-slow atoms and molecules. His
experiments on the electron-proton charge difference ruled out theories that had
proposed electrostatic force as a mechanism for the expansion of the universe.
Professor Zorn's teaching ranged from introductory courses on elementary physics to
graduate seminars on applications of quantum mechanics to a course in the Residential
College on the effects of industrialization on the Appalachian region of eastern
Kentucky. He also directed the dissertation research of 24 Ph.D. students. In
recognition of his contributions to the art of teaching physics, his effectiveness as a
teacher, and his concern for the development of his students, he was honored with the
Amoco Foundation Faculty Teaching Award in 1994. He is a fellow of the American
Physical Society and co-chaired the 1990 International Conference on Atomic Physics
In 1989 Professor Zorn produced a monograph to celebrate the centennial of
physics research at Michigan, and this led to the construction of large, welded bronze
sculptures that he created to commemorate achievements in physics. Three of these
sculptures are now displayed on campus and three more are at other universities.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher, scholar and artist by naming
Jens C. Zorn professor emeritus of physics.

JUNE MEETING, 2009

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
June 18, 2009
The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Ilitch, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice
President Pescovitz, Vice President Scarnecchia, Executive Vice President Slottow,
Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks. Vice Presidents Forrest and Harper
were absent.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order, noting that this is the meeting at
which the board considers the recommended budget for the upcoming fiscal year. She
commented that given its national and international standing, its scholarly breadth, the
top ranking of most of its schools and colleges, and the opportunities offered to students
and to faculty, the University of Michigan stands alone among its peer public and
private research institutions that are members of the Association of American
Universities. She emphasized the importance of maintaining these strengths during this
tough economic time when the University is critical to the future well-being of the
state's youth and to its economic recovery.
President Coleman stressed that the University's financial condition is very
stable because of the leadership of the Board of Regents and the diligence of the
financial team, and that it is crucial not to lose this stability or the ability to attract top
faculty, staff, and students. Noting that "where we place our resources shapes the future
direction of the institution," she described four critical facets of University activity that
have led to the University's current stability and performance and that have influenced
the decisions made in developing the budget. These include 1) being aggressively
focused on "market presence," which has resulted in strong admissions, steady growth
in research funding, strong faculty hiring, and productive faculty; 2) generating record
levels of funding, both for research and from donors, despite the economic downturn;
3) being insistent about controlling costs across all facets of the institution, including
requiring all units to accept budget cuts of from 1 to 3 percent; and 4) maintaining a
strong balance sheet, excellent bond rating, and prudent investment strategy.
President Coleman praised the leadership of the regents, noting that
administrators have met repeatedly with board members over a period of many months
to review the institution's finances and that she has "never, ever worked with a
governing board as engaged and thorough as ours" or who have shown such attention to
detail. She thanked them for their hard work throughout the year and thanked Regent
White for her leadership as chair during this extremely challenging year.

339





June Meeting, 2009

President Coleman noted that the budget recommendation was constructed with
the goal of emerging as a stronger institution and advancing against our global peers.
She pointed out that many deans were in attendance at the meeting, and that their
leadership is critical to the University's success.
Public Comments
The regents heard comments from Jonathan Ettinger, student, about lack of
proper conduct by administrators at the University of Michigan-Flint.
Comments from Regent White
Regent White said that as this was her last meeting as chair of the Board of
Regents, she wanted to thank the regents for being so gracious and working so well
together and to thank Regent Richner for his work as vice chair and for his oversight of
the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee earlier in the year. She also
thanked Regent Darlow for her outstanding leadership as chair of the Personnel,
Compensation and Governance Committee and thanked President Coleman and the
executive officers for their support throughout the year.
Election of Board Officers for 2009-2010.   Regent White moved the
nomination of Regent Andrew Richner as chair of the Board of Regents and Regent
Julia Darlow as vice chair, effective July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. Regent
Maynard seconded the motion.
Regent Richner commended Regent White's service as chair. He noted that the
office of board chair is a relatively recent phenomenon at this university and that it is
continually evolving. Regarding Regent White, he said "She has brought order to a
disordered environment, and she has been fair, considerate and well-prepared. I really
appreciate the work you've done as chair, and I will try to follow in your footsteps."
The vote was then taken, and Regent White's motion was approved
unanimously.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White reported that
attendees at that morning's meeting had included Regents Ilitch and Maynard,
Executive Vice President Slottow, and for part of the meeting, President Coleman.
Agenda topics included a review of the FY 2009 Internal Audit Risk Assessment and
FY2010 Audit Plan, with Carol Senneff, executive director of University audits, and
Rowan Miranda, associate vice president for finance. The committee also conducted its
annual review of the president's travel and hosting expenses.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Darlow,
chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that the
committee had met that morning with she and Regents Newman and Taylor in
attendance, along with Vice President Churchill, Provost Sullivan, and for part of the
meeting, President Coleman.
The committee reviewed with Provost Sullivan questions formulated by the
Federal Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System relating to race and
ethnicity, which will be required on admissions applications in the future. The provost

340





June Meeting, 2009

also reviewed a change in the reporting structure for the Digital Media Commons and
gave a report on pending searches. Other agenda items included review of a two
"housekeeping" bylaw amendments which will be posted in the near future, and reports
from each campus's Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF).
Professors Askari, Thouless, Dorfman, and Strandholm, CESF representatives from
each campus, joined the committee for the CESF discussion, and they will present their
reports at the formal board meeting in July.
President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of May 14, 2009.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report,
Plant Extension Report, and the University Human Resources Report. He reported that
with the completion of the purchase of the Pfizer property, which includes 1500 surface
parking spaces with 780 spaces in structures, the University plans to pause indefinitely
its planning for the Wall Street parking deck and office building. The planned
demolition of some buildings on Wall Street this summer will create an additional 200
parking spaces there, so this, along with the existing 360 spaces in that area, should
meet the additional demand created by the opening the new Kellogg Eye Center in
2010. Executive Vice President Slottow also commented that Ann Arbor city officials
have approached the University about a potential collaboration to address mutual
parking interests and the possible creation of a Fuller Road intermodal transportation
station. Those ideas, along with placing a hold on the North Campus parking deck, will
be presented during the parking and transportation update at the July regents' meeting.
Executive Vice President Slottow also announced that the house officers
agreement has been ratified.
Litigation Report. Vice President Scarnecchia submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report. The Report of Projects Established, May 1 - May 31, 2009

difficulties, the University of Michigan Health System is quite stable. Although it did
not meet its economic target, she noted, the system is ending the year with a positive
margin. She praised the contributions of the Health System's "excellent operational
team."
Division of Student Affairs. In Vice President Harper's absence, Associate
Vice President Anjali Anturkar reviewed the request for the University Health Service
fee increase.
University  of Michigan-Flint.    Chancellor Person  highlighted  the

Michigan Institute for the Humanities, and he created two commemorative handmade
books that were used in the inauguration of President Lee Bollinger. His current work
combines digital technologies and traditional painting techniques to produce unique
two-dimensional expressions.
Professor Ramsay is an excellent teacher who has inspired multiple generations
of artists-designers to create powerful visual forms through an exploration of technique,
aesthetics, and the conceptual aspects of image making. He co-authored Emphasis Art:
A Qualitative Program for the Elementary School (1965), a textbook designed to train

Wayne State University from 1978-85. She joined the University of Michigan faculty
as professor of nursing in 1985.
Professor Whall's research interests were centered on geriatric nursing, dementia
care, and the role of implicit memory in maintaining functioning in dementia. She
investigated nursing approaches to the behavior of cognitively impaired nursing home
residents, expert nurses' use of implicit memory with the cognitively impaired, and
aggression in dementia including the background and proximal factors. Within the
School of Nursing, Professor Whall developed and taught courses on theory development
and on gerontological nursing. She was a generous and active mentor of doctoral
students and supervised a sizeable number of master's student research papers. She has
been a faculty associate with the Institute of Gerontology since 1993, and for many years
was associate director for nursing at the University of Michigan Geriatrics Center. She
also served on the School of Nursing Executive Committee, the University-wide Medical
Affairs Committee, and the Geriatrics Center Administrative Committee. In addition to
her other contributions, Professor Whall received an award from the Fulbright
International Scholars Program in 2001, where she worked with the University of Ulster
in Northern Ireland on the use of video-teleconferencing for guest class lectures in
graduate nursing classes at the University of Ulster and the University of Michigan.
The Regents now salute this distinguished nursing educator for her dedicated
service by naming Ann F. Whall professor emerita of nursing.
Gail D. Winger, Ph.D., research professor, Department of Pharmacology,
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on March 31, 2009.
Professor Winger received her B.A. degree from the University of California,
Berkeley in 1965, and her Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1970
and 1971 respectively. She was a post-graduate research associate at Rutgers University
from 1970-71, and from 1972-75 she was a faculty member in the Department of
Psychiatry at Downstate Medical Center, State University of New York, Brooklyn, and
then at The Johns Hopkins University Medical School. She joined the University of
Michigan faculty in 1975 as an assistant research scientist in the Department of
Pharmacology, and was promoted to associate research scientist in 1989, research scientist
in 1995, and senior research scientist in 1997. She was named research professor in 2003.
Throughout her career, Professor Winger has studied the effects of drugs of
abuse in rhesus monkeys. Most recently, her research has focused on behavioral
economic procedures that permit the direct comparison of the reinforcing effects of a
range of drugs. This work, in collaboration with a preeminent behavioral economist,
was the first to demonstrate individual differences in sensitivity to the reinforcing
effects of drugs of abuse in rhesus monkeys. Professor Winger has published over 100
papers on the behavioral, and specifically the reinforcing effects, of drugs of abuse, and
she is co-author of A Handbook on Drug and Alcohol Abuse (Oxford University Press),
the fourth edition of which was published in 2004. Professor Winger served on
departmental and school committees, including three terms on the Medical School's
Advisory Committee on Primary Research Appointments, Promotions, and Titles,

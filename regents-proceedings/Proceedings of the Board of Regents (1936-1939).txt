and include all of the income received and to be received from the operation
of said dormitory from and after the date hereof, including rental of rooms and
income from the dining room and other service charges, after deducting from the
aggregate thereof the actual expenses for operation, maintenance, insurance,

or interest as provided herein or to redeem the Certificates of Indebtedness as
herein provided, any funds which may result from other sources and which it
may legally apply for such purpose.
Section 4. The Obligor shall, out of the revenue of said dormitory, pay the
insurance premiums to keep the building insured against fire and other hazards
in an amount at least equal to the face value of all Certificates of Indebtedness outstanding (providing, that in case the face value of the Certificates of
Indebtedness outstanding shall be greater than the insurable interest in the
building, then the Obligor shall insure to its insurable value); and the contents
therein insured in not less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00),
in companies approved by the Trustee, and shall assign to and deposit with said
Trustee such insurance policies. The proceeds of said insurance, in case of loss,

The fees of the Ann Arbor Trust Company covering their services in connection with the refunding program were approved as outlined in the following letter:Mr. Ralph Stone
Detroit Trust Company
Detroit, Michigan
Dear Mr. Stone:
In order that the entire Mosher-Jordan Refunding program may be considered in its final form this coming week-end by the Board of Regents, I am writing you this letter with reference to the fees of the Ann Arbor Trust Company
covering their services in connection with the refunding program.
My letter of June 3rd to Mr. Smith, stated that the fee should not exceed
2% of the par value of the loan.
In view of the work which has been done and which will still have to' be
done to finally complete the refunding program and in contemplation of the
sale of approximately $300,000 of the certificates to individual investors subject to the release of this amount of certificates by the banks purchasing the
loan, I am asking for approval of a fee of $13,000.
The above fee has been arrived at on the following basis: In view of the
University's purchasing $100,000 of the total of $750,000 of the certificates, I
have eliminated the $100,000 from consideration in arriving at the fee to be
charged. On the $650,000 par value remaining, I have figured a fee of 2%  or
$13,000, this to include the attorney fees of Burke & Burke. The only additional
expense in connection with the new loan that I know of now would be the printing of the certificates. The trustee fees, of course, are set up in a separate
schedule which we have already reviewed.




14                   AUGUST MEETING, 1936
I discussed the question of fees with Dr. Ruthven this past week and he
requested that I write you with reference to them.
Very truly yours,
ANN ARBOR TRUST COMPANY

a monthly rental equal to 0.6 cents per gallon of Gulf motor fuels sold through

minimum rental paid during any said month shall not be less than $65.00. An

stipulating a minimum monthly rental of $75.00. The lessee agrees to erect
such buildings and install equipment and make improvements as deemed neces



AUGUST MEETING, 1936                             21
sary for the purpose of carrying on its business. It is our understanding that
the building and improvements are to cost in the neighborhood of $10,000.00.
In connection with this lease, the University entered into a lease the same
day with Mr. Oscar W. Haab for a portion of the property adjacent to that
owned by the University in order to afford additional space for driveway. This
lease is drawn for the same period as the lease of the Gulf Refining Company,
specifying payments of $20.00 monthly to Mr. Oscar W. Haab, and is entirely
contingent on the fulfillment of the lease drawn between the Regents and the
Gulf Refining Company.
Mr. Ormond E. Hunt made provision for the use of the proceeds
from the sale of the property originally reported to the Regents at the
December meeting (page 749) in accordance with instructions in the
following letter:I am enclosing herewith a properly executed deed covering the transfer to
the University of Michigan of lot number eleven (11) of Andrew Franklin
Smith's Subdivision, this being the lot upon which my house stands. The other
three lots that are a part of my residence property at Ann Arbor were deeded
to the University last December.
As outlined in our recent conversation on the subject, it is my desire that
the proceeds of these two gifts be put into a fund to be known as the "Harriet
Eveleen Hunt Trust Fund," as a memorial to my mother, who died last April.
It is further my desire that the income from this fund be used to assist needy
and deserving students in the engineering college of the University in obtaining an engineering education. As a result of our talk, I understand that such
an arrangement will be in keeping with your policy in such matters and I will
appreciate it if you will see that such a setup is made.
It is also a part of our understanding that my family is to have the free use
of the property until August 1, 1936.
Yours very truly,
(Signed) ORMOND E. HUNT.

on or about October 1, 1936 (page 867).
Professor Robert H. Sherlock of the Department of Civil Engineering was granted two months' leave of absence with salary beginning September 1, 1936, to permit him to attend the Congress of
the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering,
in Berlin and Munich, during that period.
Authority was given to pay to Mrs. Ethlynn Sprentall, Secretary
of the Department of Political Science, the sum of $17.80 for extra
work done by Mrs. Sprentall at the request of Professor Everett S.
Brown, on Faculty Research Project No. 421.
The sum of not more than $2,000 was appropriated as an addition
to the budget of the Buildings and Grounds Department with the
understanding that this amount, together with such funds as are
necessary to be supplied from the budget of the Medical School, be
used for the purpose of alterations requested by Dr. Howard B.
Lewis in rooms used by the Department of Biological Chemistry, West
Medical Building, and for repairs to the elevator in the Pharmacology Building.
The Board appropriated the sum of $1,729.21 to cover the cost
of major repairs to and for furnishings for a house located at 514
Thompson Street which is to be used for the housing of foreign students. This request has the approval of Professor Raleigh Nelson,
Counselor to Foreign Students, and Professor Henry C. Anderson, Director of Student-Alumni Relations. The approval of the Regents
to the project was given with the express understanding that the
funds thus appropriated will be returned to the general funds of the
University from earnings which it is hoped will be made possible in
the operation of the house over a period of ten years.
The Board gave approval to the request of the Board of Governors of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies to purchase the Psi Omega house at 1007 East Huron Street for $15,000.
The expenditure involved represents a portion of the appropriation
of $75,000 of which the Regents were notified at the June meeting
(page 840), and the purchase Is made with the stipulation by the
Board of Governors of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies that before payment of this sum the deed will be submitted

from the Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Fund, a Michigan Trustee
Corporation, to purchase this property, it is agreed that this conveyance is for the
use and benefit of said Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies of the
University of Michigan, and that said real estate and any improvements thereon
shall be for the exclusive use of said Graduate School, except such other use or

uses as may be made of said premises by and with the consent of the Board of
Governors of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies.
It is also a stipulation that a statement is to be filed of the disbursements made in connection with this project in such detail as the
Business Office of the University may deem necessary and proper
when all or substantially all of the funds have been disbursed.
The Board appointed President Ruthven, Regent Crowley, Regent
Hemans, and Professor E. Blythe Stason of the Law School as a
committee to revise the By-Laws of the Regents.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Regents agree to pay if necessary from other funds any
cost of the so-called mechanical trades for the Horace H. Rackham School of
Graduate Studies in excess of the allowance of $290,000 as stipulated in the
contract between the Regents and the W. E. Wood Company.
The Board approved the proposal of the Investment Officer to
return to Mr. Ormond E. Hunt the sum of $234.69 representing the

property recently deeded to the University by Mr. Hunt (page 21 this
meeting).
The Regents were not willing to pass a resolution proposed by the
University of Michigan Club of Detroit to govern the awarding of
Michigan Alumni Undergraduate Scholarships. The University of
Michigan Club of Detroit suggested that the Regents take into consideration the proportion between boys and girls in the annual student enrollment and award scholarships to candidates suggested by
the University of Michigan Club of Detroit accordingly.
Vice-President and Secretary Shirley W. Smith and Investment
Officer Julius E. Schmidt were requested to present to the Board at
the September meeting a full report showing the loss of income together with recommendations on the proposal to reduce the interest;
rate on mortgages held by the University from 6 per cent to 5 per
cent.
The Board approved accepting with appreciation of the Regents
a gift of $8,150 from Dr. and Mrs. Harry A. Towsley of Ann Arbor,
as a contribution toward the Ann Arbor Boys' Guidance Project to be
administered by Associate Professor Lowell J. Carr of the Department of Sociology. This contribution is accepted subject to definite
assurance from the President, Vice-President Yoakum, and Professor
Carr that the project is primarily one of research and not of service.
The Board appointed Regent Beal and such other Regents as may
be able to attend as delegates to the annual meeting of the Governing Boards of State Universities to be held in Dallas, Texas, early
in November (page 651).
All of the above items were approved by the unanimous vote of
the Board.
Adjournment was made with the understanding that the President
will notify the Regents when the next regular meeting is to be held,
probably toward the end of September.

late Professor Hugh Brodie (R.P. 1932-1936, page 501), in the case
of the Ann Arbor lot to Professor Brodie's sister, Miss Grace Brodie,
and in the case of the lot in the City of Mount Pleasant to Professor
Brodie's sister, Mrs. Fox. The Regents have never taken title to either
lot.
Regent Beal reported to the Board that the widow of the late Dr.
Charles H. Stowell, who from 1881 to 1889 was Professor of Histology
and Microscopy, at the time of her death, desired that the gold watch
which had been presented to her husband at Christmas, 1885 by Dr.
Corydon L. Ford, Professor of Anatomy, should go into the possession
of the University, and particularly into the custody of the head of
the Department of Anatomy and should be passed down from one
succeeding holder of that chair to another. The Regents accepted the
watch with thanks under these terms and conditions.

remission of semester fees to those persons who are sent to the University of
Michigan by the Division of Secondary and Vocational Education of the Department of Public Instruction (R.P. 1932-1936, page 652). As in former years, it
is understood that the Division will use discretion in the number of students to
whom this privilege is to be accorded, so that it may not be necessary for the
Regents to limit the number who may register in any one year.
August 14, 1936
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The committee accepted, with the thanks of the Regents, the sum of $750

The Regents established a medical unit of the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps, not involving additional expense to the University,
under conditions laid down by the United States War Department,
as follows:Should this application be accepted by the President, the authorities of this
University (college or school) hereby agree to establish and maintain a two
years' compulsory (or elective) course of military training as a minimum for its
physically fit male students, which course when entered upon by any student
shall, as regards such student, be a prerequisite for graduation, to allot a minimum of an average of three hours per week per academic year to military training and instruction during the first two academic years and to arrange for five
hours per week during the balance of such students' course, and to use their
endeavors to promote and further the objects for which the training corps is organized. It is understood that the law requires a minimum enrollment in the
military course of fifty physically fit male students, citizens of the United States
and over fourteen years of age, in order to maintain the Reserve Officers' Training Corps unit requested. (In the case of Engineer Units fifty students only
are required.)




62


FIRST OCTOBER MEETING, 1936


The authorities of this institution also agree to conform to the regulations
of the Secretary of War relating to issue, care, use, safekeeping, and accounting
for such Government property as may be issued to the institution. Further, the
institutional authorities agree to appoint or designate by resolution or in bylaws, whichever may be countenanced by statutes or approved methods of procedure governing the institution, an officer of the institution, to be known as
military property custodian, who will be empowered to requisition, receive, store,
and account for this property and otherwise transact matters pertaining thereto,
for and in behalf of the institution.
The Board referred to Mr. George J. Burke, as counsel, certain
claims of Mr. Irving K. Pond of Chicago, architect.
Secretary Smith and Mr. Schmidt, Investment Officer, presented
a written report relative to the loss of income and other considerations involved in the proposal to reduce interest rates on mortgages
held by the University, as they had been requested at the August
meeting (page 36). Full authority to handle this matter was vested
by the Regents in the Finance Committee, with the expectation that
the two officers named would make recommendations from time to
time to this committee.
The Regents authorized the quitclaiming of whatever interest the
University may have in four gold-mining claims being part of the
estate of the late Hugh Brodie, on payment therefor of the sum of
$100 by Mr. George S. Daniel of Buena Vista, Colorado, the Uhiversity assuming no expense and no obligation beyond the document
divesting the Board of such interest as it may have (R.P. 1932 -1936, page 501; page 37).
The Regents authorized a quitclaim deed to the City of Ann
Arbor of the following described land. The description is part of the
land conveyed to the University by Mr. and Mrs. Ormund E. Hunt
(R.P. 1932-1936, page 749), but had, however, earlier been conveyed to the City for street purposes. This conveyance had been
misplaced and never recorded. The description herein covers lands
that are already occupied by a City street with curb and gutter and
the quitclaim conveyance is, in effect, to correct records in accordance with facts (page 21):Beginning at the northeast corner of lot ten of Andrew Franklin Smith's
Subdivision, thence southerly along the easterly line of lots ten and twelve of
Andrew Franklin Smith's Subdivision ninety-five and 9/lOths (95.9) feet; thence
deflecting 850-57'45" to the left, 3.25 feet to the easterly line of said lot twelve;
thence southerly along the easterly line of said lot twelve sixty-six and 71/lOOths
(66.71) feet to the northerly end of Concord Road as platted; thence westerly
along the northerly end of said Concord Road 27.65 feet; thence northerly onehundred sixty-nine and 3/1Oths (169.3) feet to a point in the south line of
Highland Road, sixteen and 48/lOOths feet (16.48) west of the northeast corner
of lot ten, Andrew Franklin Smith's Subdivision; thence easterly sixteen and
48/100th, (16.48) feet along the south line of Highland Road to the place of
beginning.
The Board made the following increases in salary effective September 1 and applicable only to periods when the appointees are
working on definite projects paid for by clients of the Department of
Engineering Research:Dr. Paul H. Geiger, Research Physicist in the Department of Engineering Research, increase from $4,308 to $5,000, twelve-month basis




FIRST OCTOBER MEETING, 1936


63


Dr. Donald W. Murphy, Research Associate in the Department of Engineering
Research, increase from $3,000 to $3,300, twelve-month basis
The Secretary notified the Board of the receipt through Mr. Dan
Earle of Seattle of a check for $30,000 in part payment of the bequest of the late Mrs. Thekla Bengel Porter, in accordance with a
settlement of the estate now in process, with the approval of Mr.
Earle and Mr. Bruce C. Shorts (R. P. 1932-1936, page 241). The
Board approved the settlement so far as it has thus far progressed
and is now in prospect, and authorized payment to Mr. Earle for his
legal services when bill should be presented, this payment to be made
by deduction from the proceeds of the bequest.
Gifts were received and accepted in accordance with their terms
and with the thanks of the Regents as follows:From the George Willis Pack Foundation a check for $7,500, to be added to
the present George Willis Pack Foundation's support of the new Charles
Lathrop Pack Professorship of Wild Land Utilization (R. P. 1932-1936,
page 867)
From Captain Arthur Newton Pack, Trustee of the Charles Lathrop Pack Forestry Trust, check for $3,000 to be added to the income of the George
Willis Pack Forestry Foundation (R. P. 1932-1936, page 647)
From the McGregor Fund, per Mr. Renvilie Wheat, Secretary, to the Joint Committee on Public Health Education, $2,000 (R. P. 1932-1936, page 717)
Eugene Jesse Ash, M.S., was appointed Assistant Professor of Metal
Processing for the University year 1936-1937 with salary of $3,000
for the year vice Harry L. Campbell, resigned (page 23). This appointment requires no addition to the budget of the Department.
The Board established an Engineering Research Fellowship in
Highway Engineering for the year 1936-1937 in the amount of $1,500,
funds being provided from the Engineering Research Current account
on the basis of a contract with the State Highway Department under
the terms of which the Department of Engineering Research Current
account will be fully reimbursed. To this fellowship Norman W. McLeod was appointed for the year with stipend of $1,500.
Eugene D. Hart of the General Library staff was promoted from
"In Charge of the Charging Desk" to "Assistant in the Main Reading
Room," with increase in salary from $1,559 to $1,600 a year, twelvemonth basis, beginning October 1, 1936. The salary addition is within
the present Library budget.
The salary of Assistant Professor Donovan H. Young, Department
of Engineering Mechanics, was increased for the present University
year from $2,000 to $2,150 and that of Assistant Professor Franklin
L. Everett, same Department, from $2,000 to $2,150. Funds to cover
these increases are already in the Salary budget of the Department.
The following letter of resignation from  Dr. Ernest M. Fisher,
Professor of Real Estate Management in the School of Business Administration, was filed by Dean Griffin and was accepted with regret
(R. P. 1932-1936, page 682):The Federal Housing Administrator is very insistent that I should continue
with the Administration during the current academic year. After very mature
deliberation I have come to the conclusion that I should defer to his wishes and
not disrupt the work that I have under way here.




64


FIRST OCTOBER MEETING, 1936


In view of the difficulties that this decision creates in the School of Business Administration, I feel that I should tender my resignation as a member
of the Faculty.
In doing so, I want to express my hearty appreciation of the courtesies
that you have shown to me while I was a member of your staff and particularly
during the period that I have been on leave. I have, as I think you know, the
warmest interest in the work of the school and in seeing it succeed. I shall
hope that I may be kept in touch from time to time with the work of the school
and with the friends that I have made there.
Salary increases in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts
were approved as follows:Department of Astronomy
Assistant Professor Hazel Marie Losh, Ph.D., from $2,350 to $2,800, for the
University year 1936-1937 only
Department of Economics
Assistant Professor Robert Peter Briggs, C.P.A., from $2,500 to $3,000, for the
University year 1936-1937 only. MAr. Briggs is to teach a public accounting course in Business Administration this year and the additional $500 is
to come from the budget of the School of Business Administration.
Department of Political Science
Assistant Professor Howard Black Calderwood, Ph.D., from $2,600 to $3,250,
for the first semester of 1936-1937 only
The increase for Assistant Professor Losh does not add to the budget
of the Department of Astronomy. The increase for Professor Briggs
requires a transfer of $500 from the School of Business Administration
Salary budget to that of the Department of Economics. The increase
for Professor Calderwood requires an appropriation of $325 to the
Salary budget of the Department of Political Science.
Upon recommendation of the proper Faculty in each case degrees
and certificates were voted as follows:BACHELOR OF SCIENCE

The Regents authorized execution by the President and Secretary
in behalf of the University of a tripartite agreement between Frederick
Stearns and Company, the Dow Chemical Company, and the University for the protection of the proper interests of all concerned under
patent No. 1,980,966 growing out of investigations authorized by the
Regents in November, 1930 (R. P. 1929-1932, page 493). The Regents
further authorized the execution by Professor Frederick F. Blicke,
the patentee, of a petition for the reissuance of this patent as technical
and legal requirements might demand. Further, subject to final approval by Regent Murfin, the Board approved the execution of a
contract with Frederick Stearns and Company covering terms and
conditions of continuance by Frederick Stearns and Company of the
Frederick Stearns Fellowship in Pharmacy.
Regent Murfin was excused.
The Board directed insertion in the record of the following memorial to a benefactor of the University:Mr. Alfred J. Brosseau, of Greenwich, Connecticut, a former resident of
Michigan who remained deeply attached to this State and its people although his
business responsibilities had called him elsewhere, died at Mt. Sinai Hospital,
New York, on Thursday, September 24, 1936. As President of Mack Trucks,
Inc., Mack Brothers Motor Car Company, International Motor Company, and
the International Brunswick Motor Company, and as officer or director in other
corporations, he had won an important position in American industry.




66


FIRST OCTOBER MEETING, 1936


In 1927, Mr. Brosseau's interest in his former home and in aiding young
men and women to fit themselves for useful careers by means of education led
him to establish the Brosseau Foundation, now amounting to $116,464.47. It
was characteristic of the independence of his thought and at the same time of
his genuine philanthropy that the benefits to be derived from this Foundation
were limited to students pursuing courses in those liberal and useful arts and
sciences in the value of which Mr. Brosseau especially believed, while on the
other hand the Regents were accorded wide and unrestricted powers in administering the Foundation and supplying scholarship aid within these limits.
Since the establishment of the Brosseau Foundation 2,531 loans have been
made to students, and since the fund is a revolving one, the total of these loans,
$254,387.10, is more than two and a half times the original amount of the
fund. It is difficult to estimate the good that has already been accomplished
by this means, or the returns, in the form of enlightened citizenship, which will
eventually accrue to the State and country from the beneficiaries who have been
enabled thereby to secure an education. In token of their continued appreciation of this unusually effective benefaction, and of their profound sorrow for the
death of Mr. Brosseau, the Regents of the University of Michigan have inserted
in their Proceedings this memorial, and have directed that the Vice-President
and Secretary transmit a copy of it to Mr. Brosseau's family.
The President filed a record of University registration by schools
and colleges thus far, and to corresponding data in 1935-1936, showing
a percentage increase of 7.4 for the present year.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except where
otherwise expressly stated.
The Board adjourned to Friday, October 30, at 3:30 P.M.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary




APPENDIX A
Action of the Regents Taken October 2, 1936, in Their Capacity as
Board of Control of the Psychopathic Hospital
(R. P. 1932-1936, page 891)
Authority was given to the Acting Director, Dr. H. A. Haynes, to
employ at the Psychopathic Hospital the following service:A dietitian for the period from October 1, 1936, to September 30, 1937,
with compensation of $75 a month, including board, room, and laundry.
An occupational therapist for the period from October 1, 1936, to June 30,
1937, with compensation of $50 a month for such time as might be required.
A senior medical student for three hours daily from October 1, 1936, to
June 30, 1937, with compensation of three meals a day for such services.
The Psychopathic Hospital budget already provides for the expense
above recorded.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary
APPENDIX B
HONORARY DEGREES
Voted February 28, 1936 (R. P. 1932-1936, page 778).
Characterizations by Professor John G. Winter.
MASTER OF SCIENCE
RUSSELL STURGIS ROWLAND, of Detroit; a graduate of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in the class of 1898, and of the Medical School in
1901, who has combined with outstanding distinction success in the practice of
medicine with eminence in scientific research. His work in Pediatrics, the subject
of his specialty, has won for him the recognition of his colleagues. But the many
demands made upon him as a physician have not lessened his interest in medical
research nor dulled his devotion to productive scholarship. By intensive study
of the disturbances of lipid metabolism he has contributed to the advancement
of knowledge and established his reputation as an authority in his chosen field.
DOCTOR OF SCIENCE
REUBEN PETERSON, whose career and attainments need no recital in an
assembly where he is so familiarly known and so deeply esteemed. During the
years of his active service as Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology from 1901
to 1931, he contributed greatly to the eminence of the Medical School by his research and teaching. The numerous articles and the two books that bear his
name bear also the evidence of his devotion to fundamental investigation and of
his achievement in medical science. The repeated honors that came to him from
learned societies attest the place he holds in the opinion of his colleagues in the
profession. In his teaching he showed always qualities of clearness, energy, enthusiasm, and, above all, of an invigorating strength of personality, so that his
pupils remained his loyal adherents after lectures and clinics were done. Among
the founders and builders of the Medical School his name and place will long
endure. May the years of his retirement bring to him in constantly increasing
measure the assurance that in the continuing life of this University his own has
been, and is, a constructive part.

thus provided in bulk are to be prepared by the Director of the Summer Session and the President and presented to the Board in due course
for approval. It was understood that if the needs of the Summer
Session demanded and the financial position of the University permitted, the Board might at a later date consider additions to this
allowance for the Summer Session (R.P. 1932-1936, page 693).
The bill of Burke and Burke for legal services was allowed in the
total sum of $732.85. Of this the sum of $510 is to be paid from Legal
Fees and Expenses; $62.85 from Engineering Research Revolving
Merchandise; $5 from Operation of Foreclosed Property: Consolidated
Endowment; $140 from the Rackham Social Work Building; and $15
by the Michigan Union out of the funds of that organization (page 34).
The Board considered a request from Robert C. Jones, as a member
of the Class of 1926, for approval by the Regents of the making to
him by the Aetna Life Insurance Company of a loan secured by the
cash value of the policy. The Board directed that the University
officials should follow the advice of counsel on the legal principles
involved (R.P. 1932-1936, page 682).
The Board approved the registration of James William Volk as a
resident of Michigan, as the ward of Horace G. Johnson (R.P. 1932 -1936, page 589).
The Secretary filed a request from the Consumers Power Company
for permanent right-of-way for its poles over the Edwin S. George
Reserve in Livingston County. The Board directed that in accordance
with the advice of counsel no right-of-way should be granted without
retaining the right on the part of the Regents of cancellation.

SECOND OCTOBER MEETING, 1936


Van Cleve Marshall, Associate Professor, was increased from $3,400 to $3,500,
beginning with the University year 1936-1937.
The employment status of Thomas Sherdin Tanner, Instructor in the College
of Architecture, was changed from three-eighths time at $1,311 to half-time at
$1,900 for the University year 1936-1937. No addition to the salary budget of
the College of Architecture is necessitated by these actions inasmuch as the funds
for both increases are to be paid from the salary originally allotted to Professor
Roger Bailey, on leave without salary for the present University year.
October 8, 1936
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
The Regents, at their meeting on October 2 (page 60), delegated to the
Executive Committee, with power, certain questions of additional appropriations
necessitated by increased enrollment for the University year 1936-1937. The
committee approved additional appropriations as follows:

On recommendation by President Ruthven, the committee approved the
appointment of two members to the Executive Committee of the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, to replace Professors John W. Bradshaw and
Clarence D. Thorpe, whose terms of office expired on September 30, 1936, from
a panel submitted to the President by the faculty of the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts. The two appointees are Professor Arthur S. Aiton and
Professor John F. Shepard, who will each serve for a term of three years, beginning October 1, 1936.
*First semester only.




SECOND OCTOBER MEETING, 1936

For the present University year the committee will be constituted as follows:Term Expires
Dean Edward H. Kraus, Chairman
Professor George R. LaRue.......... September 30, 1937
Professor Charles F. Remer.......... September 30, 1937
Professor Heber D. Curtis........... September 30, 1938

Professor Arthur S. Aiton........... September 30, 1939
Professor John F. Shepard........... September 30, 1939
October 12, 1936
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation by Dr. Harley A. Haynes, Director of the University
Hospital, the course in bacteriology in the University Hospital School of Nursing
was increased from forty-five to sixty hours, with an additional expense of $800
to be paid by the University Hospital. It is understood that this increase in the
budget is to reimburse the Department of Bacteriology in the Medical School to
the amount of $500 for Usable Supplies, and to secure the services of a laboratory assistant at $300 for the University year.
October 12, 1936
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
Upon recommendation of the Executive Committee of the College of Engineering, the committee authorized the payment of the traveling expenses of Mr.
and Mrs. Eugene J. Ash between Boston, Massachusetts, and Ann Arbor on
September 23 and 24, amounting to $104.80. Mr. Ash was invited to come to
Ann Arbor for consultation concerning appointment to an assistant professorship
in Metal Processing, vice Assistant Professor H. L. Campbell, resigned. Mr.
Ash has accepted this appointment, and the fact that Mrs. Ash accompanied him
facilitated their making an immediate decision, which was desirable, inasmuch
as the appointment had to be made in the few days preceding the opening of
the College.
This action does not add to the budget. Payment is to be made from the
Engineering Administration Travel account, reimbursed by a transfer of $104.80
from the Current account of the Department of Metal Processing.
October 17, 1936
Present, the President, Regent Stone, and Regent Beal.
The Vice-President and Secretary called the attention of the committee to a
contingent bequest by Dr. David Murray Cowie, of the Medical Faculty (R.P.
1932-1936, page 395), as follows:The third paragraph of the trust created under the bequest reads as follows:III (b) Upon the death of the Donor's said daughter, if his said
wife be then living, she shall have the income therefrom for her own
use, but upon her death thereafter, or upon the death of his said daughter, should said daughter outlive his said wife, the trust shall terminate
and all money, property and securities then held by the Trustee hereunder shall be assigned, transferred and delivered to the Regents of the
University of Michigan, to be used by them, however, for research in
Juvenile Medicine, to be carried on in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
In the original trust agreement Dr. Cowie reserved the right to make
changes, including change in the "ultimate remainderman," i.e., the Regents.
Dr. Cowie now proposes, with the consent of all the interests, to cash in the
funds in the trust and therewith to purchase a ten-year endowment policy with
a face value of $50,000, or approximately that sum, on the life of his daughter,
Margaret Lucy Cowie. During the lifetime of the daughter the income produced
by the policy, namely, 3 per cent on its matured value, or on its cash value if
converted into cash before maturity, shall be paid to the said daughter at the
rate of 3 per cent per annum.
Until the death of the daughter the principal sum shall not pass out of the
hands of the insurance company. Afterward the value of the policy, in money,
shall come to the Regents to be used for research in juvenile medicine, as provided in the original trust, quoted above.
The net effect of the above arrangement would seemingly be, first, to transfer the handling of Dr. Cowie's fund to the care of the Mutual Benefit Life

SECOND OCTOBER MEETING, 1936


Insurance Company, and, secondly, to make the benefit ultimately coming to the
University irrevocable.
The opinion of Mr. Burke, as rendered in writing, found no legal objection
to the modification of the original agreement on behalf of the University and
expressed the belief that "if the plan is carried forward as outlined in the agreement, the University will ultimately be placed in a better position in respect to
this gift than under the existing trust agreement." The committee therefore
authorized the signature of the President and Secretary on behalf of the Board
to the consent to modification of the original document, even though this consent
was not, probably, legally necessary.
October 20, 1936
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation by Dr. Russell W. Bunting, Acting Chairman of the
Executive Committee of the School of Dentistry, the committee added the sum
of $4,000 to the Salary budget of the Department of Postgraduate Medicine.
Medical School, to provide salary of $1,000 annually to each of four new Instructors in Postgraduate Education, for the University year 1936-1937.
October 23, 1936
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation of Dean Henry Bates, the salary of Professor Ralph W.
Aigler was increased from $8,500, to $9,500, beginning with the University year
1936-1937. This action was taken to retain, if possible, Professor Aigler's
services for the University of Michigan in view of an attractive offer elsewhere.
No addition to the salary budget of the Law School is necessitated by this action.
Actions of the Operating Committee were approved and ratified by
the Board in accordance with the minutes of the committee, as follows (page 45):September 25, 1936
At the request of Professor Morris P. Tilley, Associate Editor of the Early
Modern English Dictionary, the sum of $100 was appropriated as salary for
James Jones, at the rate of $18 a week, as Supervisor of the National Youth
Administration student helpers in the office of the Early Modern English Dictionary, until such time as the Works Progress Administration reinstates Mr.
Jones to that position.
September 29, 1936
After careful investigation by the members of the committee and after
reference to the Committee on Office Personnel, which in turn recommended the
action, the Operating Committee added $150 to the budget of Memorial Building
Custodian, Salaries and Wages account for the year, in order to increase the
salary of Mr. George W. Wright, Custodian, Alumni Memorial Hall, from the
rate of $1,000 a year to the former rate of $1,200 a year, as of October 1,
1936.
September 30, 1936
At the request of Dean Clarence S. Yoakum, the committee approved the
transfer of the sum of $125 from the Salary budget of the Institute of Public
and Social Administration to the Current account budget, Social Work Curriculum. It is understood that this addition to the Current account is necessary
to take care of certain extra expenses incurred in furnishing new offices.
October 8, 1936
At the request of Dean Clarence S. Yoakum, the committee approved the
use of the sum of $211.50, now appearing in the Salary account of the Ann
Arbor Boys' Guidance Project, for the purposes for which the funds of the
Current account are used.
October 8, 1936
On recommendation by Dean Clarence S. Yoakum, the committee increased
the salary of Lawrence Irving Barbier, Technician at the Heart Station, on the
budget of the University Hospital, at the rate of $1,260, twelve-month basis, by
the amount of $120, payable from Research Project R No. 15 (R.P. 1932-1936,
page 860).




SECOND OCTOBER MEETING, 1936


75


October 10, 1936
At the request of Dr. Randolph G. Adams, the committee approved the
transfer of the sum of $215 from the Salary account to the Current Expense
account of the William L. Clements Library.
October 19, 1936
The committee approved an increase in salary of $13 a month for Mr. J.
Fred Bareis, Diener in the Department of Anatomy, for the period from October
1, 1936, to July 1, 1937, only, thereby increasing his salary rate of $1,200 a
year, twelve-month basis, to $1,356 a year, twelve-month basis. The amount
of $117 involved will be paid from Faculty Research Project No. 415. It is
also understood that the amount of $13.60, appearing on a time slip for the
month of September, 1936, will be paid from this Project.
Assistant Secretary Watkins reported the amount and the several
sources of the yearly retiring allowance of Professor George L. Jackson,
whose resignation had been accepted by the Regents in June last (R.P.
1932-1936, pages 847 and 813):Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching........... $ 670.00
Supplemental Annuity Policy (Option No. 3)...................      206.04
Older Faculty Members Retiring Fund........................        935.63
Total..............................................    $1,811.67
Gifts were received and accepted with thanks and in accordance
with their terms and conditions as follows:From the W. K. Kellogg Foundation the sum of $760 to pay the salary of a
substitute to permit Professor Howard Y. McClusky to assist in the study
of guidance and adjustment problems in rural and grade schools. This participation on the part of Professor McClusky was approved by the Regents
on the basis of his giving thereto approximately one-fifth time for the remainder of the present University year.
From Lawrence D. Buhl of Detroit $1,200, renewing the Buhl Classical Fellowships for the year 1936-1937 (R.P. 1932-1936, page 701)
From the Albert A. Stanley Memorial Fund the sum of $100 to constitute a
scholarship in the School of Music for the present University year. Ralph
B. Clark, Jr. was appointed to the scholarship.
The Secretary offered for record the fact that the will of the late
William A. Jack of Grand Rapids, Michigan, provides in the final
portion of paragraph eight that after the termination of three lives
now in being, namely, the widow and two sons, the trustee, namely,
the Grand Rapids Trust Company, shall pay the entire net income
from the trust fund provided by the residue of the estate.
To the Grand Rapids Foundation, a corporation, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, such fund to be then known as the "Jack Loan Fund," making the particular
request of the Trustee of said Foundation that such fund be used for the purpose
of aiding deserving young men and women of the County of Kent in obtaining
a higher education through loans to such persons, such loans not to bear interest
during the time the recipients thereof are securing their respective educations. In
case said Grand Rapids Foundation ceases to exist said Trustee shall pay said
net income annually to the University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor, Michigan, for
the establishment by it of the "Jack Loan Fund," for the purposes herein mentioned, requesting that in making loans from said fund preference be given to
students from Kent County.
The Regents voted that, should the contingency provided for in Mr.
Jack's will ever eventuate, the University would accept its responsibilities thereunder.

facilities provided by the Extension Division to meet the people's requirements;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby grant the
request of Professor William D. Henderson to be retired from active service at
the end of the first semester of the current year, with the annuity provided for
him by previous actions of the Regents, with the title Professor Emeritus and

Resolved, That in taking this action, the Regents express their profound
gratitude, in behalf of the University of Michigan, for the notable service which
he has performed as one of its officers, and felicitate him upon the remarkably

impair any right consequent thereon.

134          SPECIAL DECEMBER MEETING, 1936
event, it shall take effect immediately upon such appointment and the acceptance
of the trust hereunder. Any successor to the Trustee shall be appointed by the
Obligor and shall be a trust company or bank having trust powers, in good
standing, located in either the City of Ann Arbor, Michigan, or the City of
Detroit, Michigan, if there be one willing and able to accept the trust hereof
upon reasonable and customary terms; and in case there shall not be a trust

shall select a trust company or bank having trust powers, in good standing,
located in some other city within the State of Michigan, which is willing and
able to accept the trust hereof upon reasonable and customary terms.
Section 3. The Trustee shall hold all sums received hereunder as a special

charged with any notice to the contrary.

Indebtedness hereunder shall have been paid, or the Obligor shall have provided
for such payment by depositing with the Trustee the amount of such principal
and interest to maturity or to a date fixed for redemption as herein provided,
and shall also have well and truly kept and performed all the conditions and
agreements herein, then this Agreement shall be terminated and shall be of no
further force and effect, and upon the request of the Obligor, the Trustee will
execute an instrument specifically releasing the Obligor from the covenants herein.
ARTICLE IX
Section 1. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts

Lane, Davenport, and Meyer were appointed architects for the
proposed additional dormitory units (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 831).
The Secretary reported that the life tenancy of Mrs. Julia Jones
in a bequest of $50,000 by the late Mrs. Jule Hopwood had been terminated by the decease of Mrs. Jones, and that the bequest was now
in process of being added to the Avery Hopwood and Jule Hopwood
Prize Fund. The Secretary reported that on the basis of court appraisal
of a piece of New York real estate originally mortgaged to Mrs. Jones's
life estate and later foreclosed, there has presumably been a loss of approximately $2,000 in the principal. The Secretary recommended that
management of this portion of the Hopwood fund be continued for the
time being in the hands of Mr. Jacob J. Schwebel, attorney during their
lifetimes of Mr. Hopwood and of his mother, and that, further, the
income from this segment of the estate be applied, for the time being,
to building up its endowment to the original total of $50,000. The
Board approved these recommendations (p. 99).
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to the date of the next regularly called
meeting, January 15, 1937.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary




January Meeting, 1937


UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, JANUARY 22, 1937
The Board met at 3:30 P.M. in the Regents' Room.
There were present the President, Regent Murfin, Regent Cram,
Regent Hemans, Regent Smith, Regent Crowley, and Regent Beal.
Absent, Regent Stone, Regent Cook, and Superintendent Elliott. There
were also in attendance Mr. H. G. Watkins, Dr. F. E. Robbins, and
the Secretary.
The usual financial reports were placed on file.
The minutes of the meetings of December 4 and December 12
were approved as submitted to the members in press proof with certain
specified changes. Those changes in the record of the legal instrument
for the purpose of financing two dormitory units, to be known as
Units E and F, being pages 122 to 134 inclusive of the second December meeting, had the specific approval, in writing, of Mr. George J.
Burke, attorney of the Board.
In the absence of Regent Cook, Regent Crowley reported for the
Plant and Equipment Committee upon the proposed erection of Dormitory Units E and F. On his motion the following resolutions were
adopted:
Resolved, That the President and the Secretary be and hereby are authorized
and directed to execute a contract for the erection of so-called Dormitory Units
E and F, the financing of which was authorized at the meeting of December 12,
with the H. B. Culbertson Company, in accordance with plans and specifications
prepared by Lane-Davenport, Meyer, architects, and approved by Professor
L. M. Gram, Director of Plant Extension, provided that such contract shall first
have the approval of said architects, the said Director of Plant Extension, of
the attorneys for the Board, and shall not exceed a total of $108,010.
Resolved, further, That the President, the Vice-President and Secretary, and
the University administration in general be and hereby are authorized to do
all things that may be necessary in carrying out and providing for the erection
of the said Dormitory Units E and F, provided always that the procedure shall
be in accordance with and within the limits of the action of this Board at the
meeting of December 12 and recorded in the minutes of the Board on pages
122 to 134 inclusive.
The President filed a communication from the McGregor fund
through Judge Henry S. Hulbert, its Vice-President, tendering to the
University under certain terms and conditions the sum of $100,000.
The Regents declined to change from Friday evening to Saturday
noon the time of the beginning of the Christmas and spring recesses
(R.P. 1932-1936, p. 694). On this action Regent Beal voted in favor
of making the change.
The following resolutions were adopted:
Resolved, That a Division of Extramural Services be organized in accordance
with the general principle stated in the definition of a division as approved by
the Board of Regents. (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 348.) In view of the nature of the
units involved in exercising advisory functions in accordance with the controlling
definition of a division, special emphasis shall be placed upon coordinating the
various allied activities and developing in a sound and progressive manner the




138


JANUARY MEETING, 1937


educational services which can be properly rendered by the University to the
citizens of the State. The administration of each unit included in the Division
of Extramural Services and the responsibilities of the chief officer of each unit
are not hereby affected; and
Resolved, further, That there shall be included within the Division of
Extramural Services all postgraduate activities, all of the sections and bureaus
within the present University Extension Division, the Library Extension Service,
the Bureau of Appointments and Occupational Information, the Bureau of Alumni
Relations, the Bureau of Coiperation with Educational Institutions, the extramural work of Student-Alumni Relations, the in-service training of the Bureau
of Reference and Research in Government, the industrial teacher-training of the
Department of Vocational Education, and such other units and activities which
may from time to time by regental action be placed within the Division. Official
representatives shall be the responsible heads but the Division may include, as
regular members, additional representatives from the various bureaus and units;
and
Resolved, further, That Dr. James D. Bruce, in his capacity as VicePresident in Charge of University Relations, shall act as Chairman of the Division; and
Resolved, further, That Dr. Charles A. Fisher be placed in charge of the
activities included within the present Extension Division and that his title
shall be Director of the University Extension Service when, by reason of retirement, Dr. William D. Henderson ceases to act as Director (p. 113).
Actions of the Executive Committee were approved and ratified in
accordance with the minutes of the committee as follows (p. 99):
December 7, 1936
Present, President Ruthven, Regent Beal, and Regent Stone.
On recommendation of Registrar Ira M. Smith, the Executive Committee
granted membership in the University Senate to Dr. Robert L. Williams, Assistant Registrar of the University. This action does not imply the granting of
academic rank to Dr. Williams, and it is expressly understood that it has no
bearing on the question of his being given the privilege of admission to the
participating scheme for the granting of retiring allowances, which is now pending.
December 14, 1936
Present, President Ruthven and Regent Beal. Absent, Regent Stone, who is
out of the State.
In view of illness and necessity for rest and recuperation, the committee
granted leave of absence with pay for six months, dating from December 15,
1936, to Julius E. Schmidt, Investment Officer of the University of Michigan.
December 26, 1936
Present, President Ruthven and Regent Beal.
At the request of Professor Harrison M. Randall, Chairman of the Department of Physics, the committee approved the sale of an infrared spectrograph,
property of the Department of Physics, to the Department of Chemistry of the
University of Illinois, for $750, and appropriated this amount to the current
account of that Department, inasmuch as the sale price, when received, will be
credited to the general funds of the University.
December 28, 1936
Present, President Ruthven and Regent Beal.
In view of the illness of Mr. Schmidt, the committee, until further action
by the committee or by the Board, added to those eligible to access to the safedeposit box in which the University's securities are kept in a Detroit vault
(By-Laws, Chapter 1, Section 8B) Mr. Frank G. Davis, clerk in the Investment
Office. Mr. Davis is already under fidelity bond for $100,000.
Actions of the Operating Committee were approved and ratified by
the Board in accordance with the minutes of the committee as follows
(p. 100):
November 27, 1936
The committee appropriated the sum of $200 to the Faculty Research fund
to provide an additional grant of this amount to Henry M. Kendall, who is at




JANUARY MEETING, 1937


139


present abroad on appointment to a "Commission on Relief in Belgium Foundation fellowship," and who, because of the variation in exchange, the devalued
dollar, and the underestimation of living expenses finds that the funds provided
by the fellowship and the $650 already provided from the Faculty Research
fund will be insufficient to allow him to complete his work.
December 1, 1936
At the meeting of November, 1935 (p. 694), the Regents established for
the year 1935-1936 only, not to exceed fifty scholarships for rural pupils in the
University High School in the amount of $35 each. This sum   embraced the
High-School tuition fee of $30 and the so-called activities fee of $5. In the administration of this action during the year, credit was given for the fees of $30
each but through oversight or misunderstanding no credit was given on the
books of the High School or of the Business Office for the $5 fee for activities
though expenditures were made the same as though this fee had been credited. The
High School at this time, therefore, has a shortage for which it is in no way to
blame and for which the Regents had made provision. The Operating Committee,
therefore, is giving the High School Activities fund a credit out of General
Funds of $5 for each of the forty-eight students involved, or $240. While the
Operating Committee regards this as routine, it is necessary to report it to the
Regents since the appropriation affects the present year.
December 2, 1936
The committee appropriated the sum of $250 as an addition to the Current
account of Waterman Gymnasium to be used for the purpose of replenishing and
adding to the supply of towels. The committee also approved the plan whereby
all forfeited towel deposits will in the future be credited to a new account to be
designated "Waterman Gymnasium, Towels." The first credit to this new account
will be for the year 1936-1937.
December 2, 1936
At the request of Dean Albert C. Furstenberg the sum of $156 was transferred 'from the Current Expense account to the Salary account of the Department of Photography, Medical School, to provide for an increase in salary for
Charles R. Burd, Medical Photographer, for the year 1936-1937. Although Mr.
Burd was granted this increase in salary beginning July 1, 1936, he has not
received the increase because of the fact that it was to come out of the Photographic Revolving fund. Inasmuch as there is no money in the Photographic
Revolving fund the transfer is approved is indicated.
December 9, 1936
When the budget for the University year 1936-1937 was prepared, it was
the intention of Dr. Margaret Bell to include Mrs. Violet K. Hanley as Assistant
in the Department of Physical Education for Women for the University year at
a salary rate of $900, instead of for one semester only as had been the basis
of her appointment in the previous budget. This matter, however, was overlooked.
The Operating Committee appropriated the sum of $450 as an addition to
the Salary budget of the Department of Physical Education for Women, which,
together with the item of $450 now appearing in the budget for Mrs. Hanley,
will allow her to serve for the University year as originally intended.
December 19, 1936
On recommendation by Dr. Marcus L. Ward and with the approval of the
Executive Committee of the School of Dentistry, the Medical Library Association
was added to the list of organizations to which the University pays dues for a period
of not to exceed three years, at the end of which time, or before, the question
regarding the desirability of membership in this Association shall be reviewed.
The annual dues of $10 are to be paid from the Current account of the School
of Dentistry (p. 91).
January 6, 1937
The committee approved the use of $500 in the Infantile Paralysis Research
fund for salary, for the period from.December 1, 1936, to June 30, 1937, for
Dean Holland Echols, M.D., appointed Research Assistant in the Department
of Surgery for that period.

JANUARY MEETING, 1937


The traveling expenses of Regent Murfin, amounting to $48.96, for
the period from January 31, 1936, through December 4, 1936, were
approved.
In accordance with the recommendation of the committee consisting of Dr. Robbins, Assistant to the President, the Librarian, and
the Dean of the Graduate School, the University's membership was
discontinued in the Michigan High School Forensic Association and
in the National Association of Commercial Teacher Training Institutions (R.P. 1932-1936, pp. 278, 279, and 280; also p. 139).
Gifts were reported as follows and accepted in accordance with
their terms and conditions, with the thanks of the Regents to the
donors:
From the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association, the sum of $175 for an investigation of selenium salts by Dr.
Howard B. Lewis. The ultimate donor, namely, the American Medical
Association, provided as one of the terms of the gift that an annual accounting of the expenditure should be made to the Council on Pharmacy
and Chemistry and that any unexpended balance be returned to the Association upon the expiration of the grant, namely, November 16, 1937, unless
extension is requested and granted.
From the Trusteesi of the Michigan School of Religion, cash in the amount of
$3,258.08 and securities having a face value of $3,935.77, all made over
to the University in accordance with a resolution adopted by the Board of
Trustees of the Michigan School of Religion, as follows:
WHEREAS, It seems improbable that sufficient interest will again soon be
shown in the Michigan School of Religion to enable it to raise the necessary funds
to carry out the aims and purposes of its founder, the late Professor Charles
Foster Kent, and as there is a fund of approximately six thousand dollars
($6,000) remaining in the Michigan School of Religion treasury available for
use in educational purposes,
Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Michigan School of Religion turn
over to the President of the University of Michigan the funds remaining in the
treasury of the Michigan School of Religion to be used by him for similar purposes for which the Michigan School of Religion was organized, and the Michigan School of Religion be dissolved;
Be it further, Resolved, That the officers of the Michigan School of Religion be authorized and directed to do whatever is necessary to carry out these
purposes.
From the McGregor fund the sum of $15,000 toward the support of the Institute of Public and Social Administration and the sum of $6,500 toward
the support of the McMath-Hulbert Observatory at Lake Angelus, the
latter gift to be credited to the Lake Angelus Astronomical Support fund.
The latter gift, also, comprehended cancellation of a balance of $4,000 still
unpaid to the University out of an appropriation of $10,000 made November 14, 1934 (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 518). The net additional gift to be
recorded, therefore, under this heading is $2,500.
From Dr. Eugene C. Sullivan of the Class of 1894 the sum of $1,000 to be used
toward the cost of furnishing one or more rooms in the new addition to the
Michigan Union
From the local chapter of Chi Omega sorority the sum of $25 to serve as the
stipend of the Chi Omega Prize in Sociology for the year 1935-1936. This
prize had been awarded, on vote of the Department of Sociology, to Miss
Nissley Brandt, of the Class of 1938 (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 627).
From Judge Henry S. Hulbert of Detroit the sum of $250 to be credited to the
Lake Angelus Astronomical Support fund (p. 142, above).
From Mr. John Helfman of the 1903 Pharmacy class, the sum of $500 as an
addition to the Prescott Memorial Scholarship Loan fund (R.P. 1932-1936,
p. 845)
From the Plymouth Motor Car Company, Mr. D. S. Eddins, President, for the
use of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, a cut-away chassis of a
Plymouth car, having an approximate value of $2,000

the Observatory and the rights of the University of Michigan. This
grant is the approximate equivalent of $25,000. In accordance with
the President's recommendation due record of the transaction was
made in the Proceedings of the Regents, and the official thanks of the
Regents were directed to be transmitted to appropriate government
authorities for thus making it possible to complete the program of discovery of double stars and to provide additional measurements of
stars already discovered, all much desired by astronomers for the
purposes of research.
Gifts were received as follows and accepted by the Regents in
accordance with their terms and conditions and with thanks to the
donors:

On behalf of the Board in Control of Physical Education, this annual report
covering the period from July 1, 1935, to June 30, 1936, is presented.

Plant  additions..............................  6,105.02  16,105.02
Excess of Receipts Accounted as Revenue over Disbursements  $  6,423.77
In determining the operating profit for the year covered by this report, two
items must be added to the $6,423.77 representing excess of receipts over disbursements. These two items are: (1) Liquidation of bank loans, $10,000;
(2) Plant additions, $6,105.02. The operating profit thus arrived at is
$22,528.79. The items making up the $6,105.02 listed as "Plant additions" are
chiefly expenditures for equipment, street and drainage assessments, a little over
$1,000 in improvements on Palmer Field, and approximately $2,500, as the
balance due on contract covering the construction of the Intramural Sports Building, was due to be paid upon dismissal of the litigation that had been pending
for several years.
Again, it was not found possible to retire any of the bonds: Indeed, the last
bonds were retired on October 15, 1930. No interest, however, is in arrears on
these bonds. The above financial statement shows an item of $36,660 deposited
for payment of bond interest. With the payment of the $10,000 listed in the
financial report as "Liquidation of bank loans" all of the indebtedness of the
Board on notes held by banks and unpaid balances on construction were wiped out.
For the estimated attendances at the football games for the 1935 season as
published in last year's report the following official figures provided by the
auditors are given:
At Home
Michigan State.........................  32,315
Indiana................................  18,538
Pennsylvania........................... 30,752
Minnesota.............................  32,030
Ohio State.............................  53,461   167,096
Away
Wisconsin..............................  14,381
Columbia...............................  24,901
Illinois................................  28,136  67,418

The estimated attendances for the eight football games of the 1936 season
are as follows:

Northwestern...........................  31,000
Minnesota.............................  48,000
Pennsylvania...........................  35,000
Ohio State............................  56.200    294,486
Despite the fact that the season just closed was the third successive unsuccessful one, the total attendance shows a considerable gain over that of the
preceding year.




164                 FEBRUARY MEETING, 1937
The President reported a gift from the Carnegie Corporation, embodied in a resolution of the Trustees of the Corporation adopted
January 21, as follows:

dollars ($150,000) be, and it hereby is appropriated to the University of Michigan for endowment of the Department of Library Service.
In transmitting this gift to the University, President Keppel of the
Corporation said:
The purpose of our Board was to add to the opportunities which are now
offered in this field at Michigan; and while the gift is free and unsolicited, I felt
justified in telling my colleagues that its receipt would not operate to reduce the
support already being given to the department from the general sources of the
University.

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1937


175


An honorary degree was voted to be conferred on the occasion of
the opening exercises of the Medical School in the fall of 1937 (p. 155).
A petition was received from Olga E. Dobosz that she might be
regarded as a Michigan resident for purposes of registration. The
Board could only apply the usual principle on the basis of which such
requests are determined, resulting in the denial of the request.
Associate Professor Louis A. Hopkins as Secretary of the University Council communicated to the Regents the desire of the Faculties
for an Advisory Committee on University Affairs, to be composed of
eight members of the University Senate, elected by the Senate, and
four members to be selected by the Deans' Conference from their own
membership. Further, the University Senate desires that the University Council be increased by such numbers as may be necessary to
provide membership in the Council for the Advisory Committee on
University Affairs. These requests received the approval of the Board.
The Regents directed to be spread upon the record, with adoption
and approval by the Board, the following special report by Dr. F. E.
Robbins to the Standing Committee on Educational Policies of the
University Council:
At the meeting of the University Council held April 20, 1936, the undersigned
was by resolution asked "to compile a list of the degrees granted by the University and to present the list to the Standing Committee on Educational Policies
with the suggestion that the list be presented to the University Council and the
Board of Regents for record." This report is made in response to the Council's
resolution. It attempts to give the following things:
1)  The official list of degrees in course authorized to be conferred by
the University of Michigan, and those honorary degrees which
are customarily conferred;
2) Their proper designations in English, and, when the diploma is in
the Latin form, in Latin;
3) The abbreviations for these degrees approved for use in all University publications.
This list includes only degrees which are conferred at the present time. It may
be remarked that a list of this sort has been more or less informally circulated
as a Style Sheet of the University of Michigan Press to promote uniformity in
giving the names of academic degrees and their abbreviations in the University
publications. It was originally compiled in consultation with the deans of the
various schools and colleges. The present list is identical with the one which has
previously been circulated except that it has been brought up to date, the Latin
designations of degrees the diplomas of which are expressed in Latin are given,
and the honorary degrees customarily conferred have been added.
I have not included the designations and abbreviations of degrees which are
no longer given here. This matter is ordinarily important only when the compilation of an Alumni Catalogue is in progress. So many degrees have been
given for a time and then discontinued, and so many changes have been made in
the designations of degrees which are still given, that the addition of these
details would unnecessarily complicate this report.
Since one of the matters about which there has been the greatest lack of
uniformity is the use of parentheses, either in citing the name of the degree or
its abbreviation, the following rule has been applied: In general, parentheses are
used when a qualification is added to the degree without altering the fundamental
character of the degree thus qualified (as for example, the citation of "diploma
departments" in Engineering and Architecture). Parentheses are not used to set
off any part of the name of a degree which is distinctly independent and not
merely a modification of another degree brought about by specialization.
The list of degrees and abbreviations follows:

end of the present school year. This action was taken with regret at
the termination of Professor Hamilton's loyal and effective service.
The salary of Dr. Charles A. Fisher, Director of the University
Extension Service, was increased from the rate of $4,700 a year to
$5,400 a year beginning with February 15, 1937. No additional appropriation was needed.
The salary of Wells I. Bennett as Professor of Architecture and
Director of the College of Architecture was increased from the rate of
$4,000 to the rate of $5,000 a year, beginning with the second semester
of the present University year. The sum of $500 was added to the
Architecture budget to provide for this increase.
The Board confirmed the election of the following as Directors of
the University Musical Society for the term beginning with the
Society's annual meeting in February, 1937, to the date when the
annual meeting shall be held in 1940 (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 304): Oscar
A. Eberbach, Arnold H. Goss, James Inglis, and Horace G. Prettyman.
While the property of the Student Christian Association has been
given to the University (p. 118) and therefore rent payments on Newberry Hall would ordinarily cease, in view of the fact of the gift and
that it will take some weeks to reorganize the Student Christian
Association, the old Board of the Association has been asked to continue to supervise the work until the end of the present University
year, and, in accordance with the President's recommendation, authority was given to expend under the supervision of Professor Henry C.
Anderson, as Director of Student-Alumni Relations, the sum of $833.24
or so much of it as should be required to carry on the affairs of the
Association during the transition period. This sum is the balance
remaining in the budget for rental of Newberry Hall.
Upon recommendation of Dean Furstenberg, the Regents approved
a Medical acceptance fee or deposit of $25.00 for freshman Medical
students. Such fee is payable within two weeks of notification by the
Medical School that an applicant has been accepted for admission.
The fee will be applied toward the semester fee of the payor at the
time of registration and will be forfeited if the applicant fails to appear
for registration. A refund will be made only in case an applicant who
has been accepted conditionally fails to remove the condition.

The President reported that the American Wildlife Institute of
Washington, D.C., had notified the University of its desire to establish a fellowship here for the investigation of predatory enemies of
fish in Michigan lakes and proposed an original sum of $2,500 for the
period from February 1, 1937, to June 30, 1938. The fellowship was
accepted accordingly with the thanks of the Regents and was named
the Fish Management Fund in the Museum of Zoology.
Leave of absence with full pay for the period from     April 9 to
July 1, 1937, was granted to Professor Heber D. Curtis of the Department of Astronomy in order that he might participate in an expedition
to Enderbury Island, 1,660 miles southwest of Honolulu, to observe
the solar eclipse on June 8.
In order to provide for increased enrollment the sum of $6,000
was added to the University Extension Service Credit Plan salary
budget. It is expected that there will be a proportionate increase in
the income from student fees in these classes.
Professor Randolph G. Adams communicated to the Regents the
fact that Mrs. Genevieve Allen Carter of California has presented to
the University the following items relating to her grandfather, John
Allen, founder of Ann Arbor:
A manuscript written by James Turner Alien, the brother of John Allen,
which comprises:
a) A biographical sketch of Ann Isabelle Barry McCue Allen (2 pp.)
b) A description of the journey of the Aliens from Augusta County, Virginia, to Washtenaw County, Michigan, in 1824 (7 pp.)
c) Notes on James Allen's family. It is in this manuscript that we find
the story of the naming of Ann Arbor.
A plat book of 25 leaves, each 13"x 13", labeled "Original Plan of Ann
Arbor." Each sheet represents a city block as surveyed and laid down on the
Stratton-N. Currier map of Ann Arbor of 1836. Each block is subdivided into
lots, and on each lot the names indicate the derivation of the title, from the
United States Government, through John Allen to thirty-nine different purchasers.
An oil portrait of John Allen by an unknown artist.
An oil portrait of John Allen's son, James Crawford Allen, painted by the
latter's daughter, Elizabeth Tate Alien.
These were accepted with a vote of thanks to Mrs. Carter for her
generous gift of these highly appropriate Ann Arbor historical data.
The President reported that the Bryant Walker collection of mollusks (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 843) has now been formally transferred to
the University by the executors of Mr. Walker's estate, and is housed
in the University Museums Building.
Upon recommendation of the proper academic authorities in each
case, degrees and certificates were voted as follows:

The Secretary filed a letter from Mr. Julius E. Schmidt expressing
to the Board of Regents his gratitude for the leave of absence vouchsafed him (p. 138).
The Secretary reported receipt, through Professor Wells I. Bennett
and with his full approval, of the following tender from Professor and
Mrs. Henry Harold Higbie as a memorial to their daughter Helen
Jane, a student in the College of Architecture, who died January 5,
1937:
Mrs. Higbie and I have been deeply touched and greatly comforted by the
expressions of respect and high regard for our daughter Jane that have come to
us from her teachers and student associates. We should like toi feel that she
continues always to recognize the existence and to stimulate the development of
high ideals in student life, and to make her contribution to the realization of
these ideals, which she cherished. To that end we understake to establish for her
"The Jane Higbie Award," for originality in conception and for excellence in
workmanship but not merely for high scholarship, demonstrated not later than
the second year in required courses of Decorative Design. The recipient of the
award should be selected by a committee of five, a majority of whom should be
from the teaching staff in Decorative Design.
The first Jane Higbie Award, which we hope may be conferred in the
present academic year, is Jane's balance in the bank, amounting to fifty dollars.
It contains the residue of an award that was made to her in her first year at the
University, as a result of her having been chosen as one member of a team
representing this University which won first prize in an intercollegiate competition. For the perpetuation of the award we transmit herewith to the Board of
Regents a check for one thousand dollars as endowment, which we wish to be
invested with the Consolidated Fund. We shall provide the amount sufficient for
the award of 1938, or until the first income from the endowment provides it.
We may supplement the earnings of the endowment in any year, or the endowment itself, if we find the present arrangement inadequate and are able to do so.
If in any year no student is considered to qualify for the award, the income
from the endowment shall be added to the principal.
This gift was accepted in accordance with its terms and conditions
and with the thanks of the Regents.
The Board accepted with thanks the gift of $1,000 as a subscription to the Burton Memorial Tower from the International Business
Machines Corporation, which furnished the clock for the Tower.

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1937


The Secretary notified the Regents that the Michigan Union desired to turn over to the University for investment, in accordance with
the terms of the bequest, the sum of $5,000 received by the Union
under the will of the late Luella Jenkins Brandon, as follows:
I give and bequeath to the Board of Directors of the Michigan Union of
the University of Michigan, located at Ann Arbor, Michigan, their successors or
assigns, the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) to be invested in high-grade
interest-bearing securities and the income used for the comfort and convenience
of the students of the University of Michigan as the Board of Directors may
decide. This bequest shall be the means of expressing some slight appreciation
of my deceased husband, George Russell Brandon, of the benefits secured in
attendance at the University of Michigan, and in loving memory of his brother,
Samuel Craighead Brandon, engineer of the class of 1906, of the University of
Michigan.
George Russell Brandon was a member of the class of 1891 of the Engineering College.
The Regents approved the request of the Michigan Union with the
understanding that no official of the University nor the University as
an institution should be responsible for any losses that might possibly
accrue unless through gross carelessness or malfeasance on the part of
University officials or employees.
The Regents laid down the rule that in the administration of the
University's retiring allowance and pension fund a widow's pension,
in so far as it came from funds over which the Regents had control,
should not be forfeited should she remarry.
The Board authorized the President and the Secretary to execute
the following release with respect to lot number 9 block 5 in J. D.
Baldwin's Eastern Addition to the City of Ann Arbor. The "early
conveyance" referred to was in 1837; no reference to the right-of-way
in question appears in the Regents' Proceedings; the location of the
spring which was the presumable source of the water has long been
unknown; and it is believed that the University could have no possible
interest in the right-of-way, if in fact it ever existed:
This deed is given for the purpose of releasing any right-of-way that the
said first party may have across said above described property for the purpose of
conducting water across said land, said right-of-way, being referred to in the
early conveyances in the chain of title to said property as having been granted to
first party by Dwight Kellogg and Dan W. Kellogg and no consideration passed
except as above stated.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to Friday, March 26, at 3:30 P.M.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary

Regent Murfin reported for all those concerned in the negotiations
of a final settlement of matters under discussion growing out of the
will of the late William L. Clements in their relationship to the William
L. Clements Library (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 856), the settlement being
embodied in the following agreement:

WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, At the time of his death said William L. Clements had in his
possession several large collections of manuscripts, books, maps, and documents
pertaining to American history, more particularly hereinafter described and
generally herein referred to as "Americana," and
WHEREAS, By instruments purporting to be his Last Will and Testament,
dated April 16, 1931, and a Codicil thereto, dated March 17, 1932, said William
L. Clements directed that said Americana be given to Second Party upon certain
conditions including the requirement that Second Party should pay to his estate
the sum of $400,000 as a purchase price for said material, and
WHEREAS, Second Party claims to be the owner of said material by virtue
of the gift thereof to Second Party by said William L. Clements during his
lifetime, which said claim is denied by First Parties, and the parties hereto are
desirous of compromising and settling said disputed claim in accordance with the
provisions of law,
Now therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, it
is agreed between the parties hereto as follows:
1. First Parties agree to sell and deliver the collections of manuscripts,
books, maps, and documents generally herein referred to as "Americana," and
particularly described in Schedule "A" attached hereto, and made a part hereof,

$25,000 on delivery of said Americana to Second Party;
$25,000 on or before April 1, 1938;
$10,000 on or before April 1, 1939, and a like sum annually on or before
April 1, thereafter, until said sum of $100,000 shall be paid in full. Second
Party agrees to pay said sums to First Parties if, as, and when they are
received by it.
3. Second Party agrees to pay to First Parties the sum of $200,000 as
follows:
$15,000 upon the execution of this Agreement and its approval by the
Probate Court for Bay County, Michigan, and

including April 1, 1949, and the sum of $5,000 on or before April 1, 1950.
4. First Parties agree that Second Party shall have the privilege of paying
said sum of $200,000 on any portion thereof at any time hereafter, and any sums
less than the whole unpaid balance thereof so paid in advance shall be credited
upon the last maturing installments above set forth.
5. First Parties shall have no right to collect interest upon the aforementioned deferred installments of said sum of $300,000.
6. Second Party agrees to authorize its President, Alexander G. Ruthven,
to assist First Parties in raising an additional amount sufficient to pay to First
Parties a sum equal to interest upon the actual deferred installments of the
aforementioned sum of $300,000, computed at the rate of 312 % per annum,
payable semiannually.
7. First Parties agree to deliver said Americana into the possession of
Second Party at Bay City, Michigan, as soon as possible after this Agreement
shall have been approved by the Probate Court for Bay County, Michigan. Upon
said delivery, said Americana shall become the absolute property of Second
Party; provided, however, that if any default shall be made in the payment of
any installment of said sum of $200,000, and if such default shall continue
for six months after said installment shall become due, First Parties may either
declare the entire balance of said $200,000 to be forthwith due and payable,
or they may demand and receive back the said Americana herein referred to,
free from any claims on the part of the Second Party hereto. It is specifically
agreed that Second Party by this agreement is purchasing said Americana, and
that the same shall not be in any way bound or subject to the right of reverter
contained in the gift agreement between William L. Clements and The Regents
of the University of Michigan, dated December 14, 1922, or in any way subject
to the conditions set forth in the 10th paragraph of the purported Will of said
William L. Clements and in the 4th paragraph of the Codicil thereto, dated
March 17, 1932.
8. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto, their successors
and assigns, and upon the heirs of said William L. Clements, deceased.
9. This Agreement is executed in the spirit of compromise for the purpose
of settling all differences between the parties hereto, and shall not be considered
binding unless and until it shall have been approved by the Probate Court for
Bay County, Michigan.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The First Parties have hereunto set their hands and
seals, and Second Party has caused these presents to be executed by its President,
and Vice-President and Secretary, and its Corporate Seal affixed hereto the day
and year above written.

MARCH MEETING, 1937


Regent Murfin further notified the Regents of the resignations
embodied in the following communication, and on motion these resignations were accepted by the Regents:
The Regents of the University of Michigan
Ann Arbor, Michigan
Gentlemen:
Under Paragraph Eleventh of Mr. Clements' Will dated April 16th, 1931,
provision is made for a board of three supervisors whose duties are therein provided and which relate to the supervision of the administration of the William L.
Clements Library under the Deed of Gift of December 14th, 1922.
Confirming to you the confidence of Mr. Clements' family in the perpetual
maintenance of the Library by the University, there appears to us no further
occasion for our functioning in the capacity designated in the Will. We, therefore,
respectfully submit our resignations as supervisors with the intention that this
resignation will be made effective without the appointment by us of any successors and that the trust created in Paragraph Eleventh of the Will be abandoned.
We will take such further action in this matter in the Probate or Circuit
Court as may be necessary to make this resignation fully effective and so as to
provide that the trust fund created in this paragraph of the Will shall lapse into
the residue of the Estate.
Respectfully submitted,
Eliza M. Clements Finkenstaedt
Harry S. Finkenstaedt

March 23rd, 1937
Actions of the Operating Committee were approved and ratified by
the Board in accordance with minutes of the committee as follows
(p. 158):
February 18, 1937
The committee gave approval to the recommendation of Dr. John Sundwall,
Director of the Division of Hygiene and Public Health, to transfer from the
Salary account to the Current Expense account of that division the total sum of
$400. This is made up of $100 originally allocated to the salary of John V.
Fopeano, Instructor, and $300 for special lecturers. The increased registration
necessitates this action to provide funds for expenses of the second semester.
February 24, 1937
On recommendation by Dr. John Sundwall, the committee granted leave of
absence for February, with full salary, on account of illness, to Christa E. Landgraf, Bacteriologist in the Health Service, Division of Hygiene and Public Health.
March 1, 1937
The committee added the sum of $150 to the Current account of the Committee on Office Personnel to provide for necessary expenses for the remainder
of the present fiscal year.
March 6, 1937
The committee appropriated the sum of $262.50 as an addition to the Salary
budget of the Department of Botany, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
for compensation for an additional assistant for the second semester of the
University year 1936-1937. This action is necessitated because of increased
enrollment in a certain section of that Department, which could not be foreseen
at the time the Regents had previously acted to provide assistance for the various
departments in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts for the second
semester (p. 178).
March 6, 1937
The committee authorized expenditure of $90 a month from March 1, or a
total of $360, for the rest of the present fiscal year, in order to provide an
additional operator in the Dictaphone Station. This additional operator is
necessary if the Dictaphone Station is to keep up with the work brought to it.
March 9, 1937
At the request of Dean Herbert C. Sadler, the committee approved the
transfer of the sum of $420 from the Salary budget of the Department of Engi

neering English, College of Engineering, to the Salary budget of the Department
of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering to provide-with the balance of $100
which has not, as yet, been used-salaries for the necessary assistants for the
second semester of the present University year.
March 18, 1937
The committee authorized payment, under special conditions and without
constituting a precedent, of the sum of $16 in addition to her regular salary,
to Anne Harsha, a full-time clerical employee of one of the University's offices
in Detroit. Miss Harsha receives full-time pay at the rate of $1,200 per annum.
The extra work consisted of special attendance as collector of fees at eight evening
classes for which work she was employed by Mr. Boyd Stephens, University
Cashier, without knowledge of the facts as a whole.
The Board approved and ratified actions of the Finance Committee

Resolved, That the nomenclature of divisions of the University and titles

hereby is, adopted as the official standard of the University, and that no changes

204


MARCH MEETING, 1937


changes of title or nomenclature are made at the time of the adoption of the
budget or at other times in connection with appointments, promotions, and other
actions affecting faculty and staff members, it is understood that such changes
will be separately and specifically recommended and acted upon.
The following resolution was adopted (p. 14 and R.P. 1932-1936, p.
831):
WHEREAS, The Regents of the University of Michigan have been advised
by the Detroit Trust Company that it has encountered considerable difficulty in
transferring and reregistering certain registered municipal bonds which are included
in the Fund established by the Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Fund
for the benefit of The Regents of the University of Michigan, in that said registered bonds were originally issued in the name of the said Horace H. Rackham, and
by the executors of his estate transferred to the Trustees of the Horace H.
Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Fund under the will of Horace H. Rackham,
deceased, and by them transferred to the Horace H. Rackham and Mary A.
Rackham Fund, the Fund, in turn, transferring the bonds to the Detroit Trust
Company as Trustee under Agreement for the benefit of The Regents of the
University of Michigan; and
WHEREAS, The Detroit Trust Company, in order to meet this and similar
situations, has created a nominee partnership known and styled as Spicer and
Company, the purpose of this nominee partnership being to facilitate the handling
of securities, and to hold in its name securities belonging to various trust
accounts; and
WHEREAS, It seems advisable, in order to avoid delay and expense and to
facilitate delivery in the case of sale or exchange, that certain of the bonds held
in accounts known on the books of the Detroit Trust Company as 13537 and
13537-A be registered in the name of Spicer and Company; therefore
Be it Resolved, That the Detroit Trust Company is hereby authorized and
empowered, in its discretion, and when it deems the same to be for the best
interests of The Regents of the University of Michigan, to reregister municipal
bonds and other securities in the name of Spicer and Company.
As it has not proved feasible to proceed with the erection of a
proposed addition to the University Laundry Building under the terms
and conditions imposed by the Public Works Administration (pp.
115-116), the following resolution was adopted. The construction of
a material storage building and an addition to the East Physics Building mentioned in the resolution had not come before the Regents but
had been requested in routine by the administrative officers of the
University.
Resolved, That the application heretofore filed with the Federal Emergency
Administration of Public Works (Docket Mich. 1253-D) for a grant from the
United States of America for the purpose of aiding and financing the construction
of a material storage building, an addition to the East Physics Building and an
addition to the University Laundry be and the same hereby is, withdrawn.
The Board approved and confirmed appointment of the following
physicians and surgeons, all residents of Detroit except Dr. James E.
Davis of Ann Arbor and Dr. Robert H. Haskell of Northville, each as
Extramural Lecturer in Postgraduate Medicine, for the period of one
year beginning January 1, 1937. There is no obligation on the part of

fund is to be administered in accordance with the University's usual
method. The thanks of the Regents were tendered to Mr. Murray A.
Schutz for his generous and helpful action.
The salary of Dr. Vincent Clifton Johnson, Assistant Professor of
Roentgenology, was increased from $4,000 to $5,500 a year, twelvemonth basis, effective April 1, 1937. For the remainder of the present

services, at a salary not in excess of $70 a month, without maintenance.
The above actions do not require, for the present University year,
any addition to the Psychopathic Hospital budget.

April Meeting, 1937
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, APRIL 30, 1937
The Board met at 3:30 P.M. in the Regents' Room.
There were present the President, Regent Murfin, Regent Beal,
Regent Smith, Regent Hemans, Regent Cram, Regent Cook, Regent
Stone, and Superintendent Elliott. Absent, Regent Crowley. There were
also in attendance Vice-President Yoakum, Dr. F. E. Robbins, Mr.
H. G. Watkins, and the Secretary.
The usual financial reports were placed on file.
The Board approved the drawing of Pitkin and Mott, No. 142-A,
as the layout of the Mall extending from the Library to the Horace H.
Rackham School of Graduate Studies.
The President made an oral statement of proffered cooperation in
the dormitory plans of the University on the part of the Chicago and
the Rochester alumni. The President was authorized to accept such
proposals in detail, at his discretion, when they are formally received.
The President reported that in the opinion of those he had consulted and in his own opinion there were so many difficulties in the
way of conferring additional honorary degrees at Commencement,
1937 (p. 175) that it seemed necessary for practical reasons to limit
the list to those already voted. This report was approved, all members
voting aye except Regent Hemans who voted no.
The minutes of the meeting of March 26 were approved as submitted to the members in press proof.
The Board declined to purchase copies of the Michiganensian of
1937 for distribution to high schools upon the accredited list (R.P.
1932-1936, p. 809).
The Board declined to purchase advertising in the Detroit Saturday Night, and restated its policy on the subject of advertising, namely:
In view of the fact that the University is crowded with students and in
view of the further fact that the Regents are unable, with equity, to discriminate
among large numbers of advertising media, it is the policy of the University
until further notice not to advertise except in the case of special features
requiring special publicity.
The Board approved and ratified actions of the Finance Committee
as follows (p. 193):

At the request of Assistant Secretary Watkins the Regents included in the record the subjoined list of pensioners inadvertently
omitted from page 29 of the Proceedings of August, 1936, following
the record of the appointment of Mrs. Church and Miss Monroe. The
record of that meeting should have carried the fact, which is here
inserted, that the Board of Governors of the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies had made an appropriation, at the request
of the Rackham Fund Trustees, from the Mary A. Rackham Trust
Fund, to carry certain pensioners under the so-called "Blood Relative Account" list, for the year 1936-1937. Amounts have varied and
will continue to vary each month in accordance with a monthly list
which Mrs. Mary H. Church of the Mary A. Rackham Fund has
furnished and will continue to furnish so long as these pensions are
continued. The list of pensioners and the total amounts received by
them from this source from July 1, 1936, to March 31, 1937, inclusive

The committee appointed April 24, 1924 (R.P. 1923-1926, p. 264)
on matters pertaining to diplomas and certificates, was abolished.
The Regents approved for record the action of the Secretary
under the precedent set in the case of the Consumers Power Company
(p. 70) in giving permission to the Detroit Edison Company to cross
with its lines the following described lands:
Township of Webster, county of Washtenaw, State of Michigan, being
the southwest one-quarter Section No. 6, line north of Strawberry
Lake Road




222


APRIL MEETING, 1937


with the following provision:
This permission is granted expressly on condition, which is a precedent
condition to the granting of the permission, that the permission is
subject to cancellation in whole or in part at the sole discretion of
the Regents of the University of Michigan at any time on ninety
days' notice.
The President and the Secretary were authorized to execute a quitclaim deed to the following property, which is a portion of the residue
of the estate of the late Arthur Hill. The only reason why the quitclaim deed was desired was the alleged lack of a record in the Probate Court that Mr. Hill's bequest of funds for the erection of Hill
Auditorium had been paid in full:
Lots Numbered three and four (3 and 4) of John G. Ferris Addition to the
City of Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, such addition being a subdivision
of part of Private Land Claim number eighteen (18).
Pending the return to active duty of Julius E. Schmidt, Investment
Officer (p. 138) the Regents substituted the name of R. Gordon
Griffith, Assistant Investment Officer (p. 199) as one of those to have
access to the safe-deposit box in which the University's securities are
kept in a Detroit vault. Similar action was taken to give Mr. Griffith access to the safe-deposit box at the Ann Arbor Savings and Commercial Bank, University branch, Ann Arbor.
The Board declined to take any action upon claims presented in
correspondence from Mr. Irving K. Pond (p. 62).
The Board accepted, with thanks, the sum of $75 tendered by the
Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters, for the use of
Assistant Professor Frank E. Eggleton in study of the Geddes Pond
in the Huron River and its recovery from gross pollution after the
operation of the new sewage disposal plant shall begin. The fund
is to be known as "Huron River Limnological Research Fund."
The Board accepted the sum of $50 tendered by the Chinese Student Club of the University of Michigan and its friends through
Professor Robert B. Hall. This fund, with such accretions as may
come to it, is to be known as the "Chinese Studies Endowment," and
the income from it is to be used for the promotion of study and research in Chinese culture. Until the fund shall increase in size the
income will presumably be added to the principal each year.
The Board accepted with thanks and in accordance with its terms
a check for $300 tendered by the Federation of Paint and Varnish
Production Clubs through its treasurer Mr. C. W. Clarke, of Wilmington, Delaware, to continue the Federation's fellowship for the second
semester of 1936-1937 (p. 49).
The President presented a letter from   Mr. Theodore C. Blegen,
Superintendent of the Minnesota Historical Society, to Professor
Lewis G. Vander Velde, as follows:
You will be interested to learn that I presented the matter of a possible
transfer of the Alexander Winchell Papers at a meeting of the Executive Council
of the Minnesota Historical Society last Monday. Miss Nute and I, after consulting the donors of the collection, concluded to recommend a permanent transfer or gift, and the council authorized me to make it. It happens that Miss
Nute is at present in the east and I shall defer a formal letter of presentation




APRIL MEETING, 1937


223


until after her return. The transaction will be in the nature of an outright gift
rather than a deposit with only one condition, namely, that the University of
Michigan will at all times facilitate the photostating or transcribing of such
particular items as this Society may desire.
I may add that when I first saw the Winchell collection in a Minneapolis
warehouse, it was in a state of extraordinary confusion, the documents crammed
into boxes and trunks. Naturally it required much patient work of arranging
to bring the materials together properly. I have at present no very definite idea of
what expense was involved in doing this work, but I wonder if your institution,
in the event of a presentation of the entire collection to you, would care to cover
the approximate cost of the labor involved in the arranging and labeling of the
collection? I suppose that this labor ran to something between thirty-five and
fifty dollars. Though I mention this item, I do not wish this to be thought of in
any sense as a sale of the papers. In transferring them to your library, we shall
do it on the basis of an outright gift. Please regard the present letter as informal
and preliminary.
April 14, 1937
The Regents accepted the gift in accordance with its terms and with
the gratitude of the University for this generous recognition by the
Minnesota Society of the interest of the University of Michigan in
the Alexander Winchell Papers.
The Board accepted the resignation of Mr. Harold D. Smith,
Director of the Bureau of Reference and Research in Government,
in order that he might become Budget Director of the State of
Michigan. Mr. Smith's resignation was accepted with regret, effective
as of April 30.
Dr. Robert S. Ford, Assistant Professor of Economics and Research Investigator in the Bureau of Reference and Research in Government was appointed Acting Director of the Bureau of Reference and
Research in Government, vice Harold D. Smith, resigned, the appointment being for the period from May 1, 1937, to July 1, 1938, with an
addition of $300 a year, twelve-month basis, to the present salary of
Dr. Ford.
In view of the absence on leave of Dean Sadler, Professor Henry
C. Anderson was appointed Chairman of the Executive Committee of
the College of Engineering, beginning May 1. The appointment is to
continue presumably throughout the time of Dean Sadler's absence
(p. 220).
Leave of absence with pay was voted to Assistant Professor Juva
Higbee of the School of Music for the period beginning April 12 and
extending through the present University year. This leave was voted
on account of illness.
A total sum of $600 was added to the Current Expense budget of
the Botanical Gardens and the Department of Zoology, the distribution of this total being left to Dean Edward H. Kraus.
The sum of $225 was added to the Visiting Nurse Current Expense
account in the Division of Hygiene and Public Health.
The sum of $292 was appropriated to the Committee on University Archives for the following purposes (p. 222): To the Minnesota
Historical Society for sorting and labeling Winchell Papers, $35 to $50,
bookcase, $92, and 60 boxes for Winchell, Wenley, and Walker
Papers, $150.
In order to effect an organization within the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies to operate research programs, clinics, and




224


APRIL MEETING, 1937


other services therein contemplated, the following actions were taken
(R.P. 1932-1936, pp. 838-839):
a)  A unit is to be recognized, to be known as the "Institute for Human
Adjustment."
b)  The operation of the Institute is to be under the immediate direction
of the Executive Board of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies.
c)  The Dean of the Horace H. Rackham     School of Graduate Studies is
empowered to nominate under the rules and regulations of the Board
of Regents such directors and staff members as may be deemed needful
to carry forward the purposes of the endowment.
A letter was received through Professor Robert B. Hall from Mr.
Bunzaburo Sashida, A.B., 1920, A.M., 1921, of Tokyo, Japan, Secretary of the University of Michigan alumni in Japan, tendering a
planting of Japanese flowering cherry trees to be received by the University through personal delivery of Mr. Hanji Soma, M.S., 1903,
President of the Meiji Sugar Refining Company, or through purchase
with money to be supplied by the alumni of Japan. This proffer was
accepted by the Regents with sincere thanks to the Japanese alumni.
Leave of absence from April 26 to the end of the present semester
on account of illness was voted to Professor Horace W. King of the
Department of Civil Engineering. This leave is with full salary.
Leave of absence from June 1 to July 1, 1937, was voted to
Professor Frank N. Wilson, with salary. The state of Professor Wilson's health requires this vacation period.
The Board adopted the following statement and directed that it
be spread upon the records of the Regents and that copies be sent to
Mrs. Mary Bartron Henderson's family and to the Board of Governors
of the University of Michigan League, with the hope that the League
would see fit to place these resolutions at some suitable place upon
the walls of the building, with a portrait of Mrs. Henderson:
The Regents of the University of Michigan, together with the entire University community, and the former students of Michigan, have been profoundly
shocked by the sudden death of Mrs. Mary Bartron Henderson, A.B., 1904,
which occurred in Ann Arbor on April 26, 1937. Her name will forever remain
associated, in the history of this institution, with the organization of the alumnae
and the campaign which resulted in the building of the Michigan League, to
which she devoted herself tirelessly and loyally. From 1926 to 1931, when she
was the Executive Secretary of the Alumnae Council, Mrs. Henderson was the
leader of the building campaign through its most critical period to its completely successful conclusion, and thereafter she remained chairman of the building fund until all the payments on the League had been made. The University
is gratefully aware that, though this splendid addition to the facilities came as
the result of the united efforts of many, the executive ability, the abounding
energy, and the courage of Mary Bartron Henderson were indispensable factors
in the success of the enterprise. The Regents, therefore, once more make record
of their lasting gratitude for the extraordinary service rendered by Mary Bartron
Henderson to her University, and express to her surviving family their heartfelt
sympathy.
The Board accepted with thanks the offer of the A. C. Barnes
Company, Inc., of New Brunswick, New Jersey, to continue for
another year to support the research studies being conducted in the
Department of Pathology under the designation "Argyria Investigation" (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 836). It is understood that the Company




APRIL MEETING, 1937


225


will make payments of $430 each quarter, beginning June 1, 1937,
and that the expenditure will be in the form of $720 for services and
$1,000 for equipment, animals, and current expense.
The President presented a letter from Mr. Bryson D. Horton,
written in behalf of himself and Mr. Frederick G. Rolland, as Trustees
of the Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Fund, proposing
to make a
gift of $100,000 to the University of Michigan, to be put into the income account
of the $1,000,000 fund which Mrs. Mary A. Rackham individually gave the
University, as an endowment fund for a social service center. This gift will wipe
out the overdraft which has existed since the $1,000,000 in bonds was given the
University and also provide a fund which may be drawn upon for the needs of
the social service center. The appraised value as of today's date of these various
items which appear on the schedule enclosed is $81,146.95. The balance, namely,
$18,853.05, would come to the University in cash (R.P. 1932-1936, pp. 838-840).
The Regents authorized and directed the President to notify
Messrs. Horton and Rolland that the Board would accept the gift in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Mr. Horton's
letter and with deep gratitude.
The President filed with each member of the Board a revision of
certain portions of the By-Laws "designed to clarify the actions of the
Board of Regents and the Faculty committees on student conduct.
This revision has been approved by the Regents' committee on revision of the By-Laws." It is understood that consideration of the
President's proposed revision will be had at the May meeting of the
Regents.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote with the exception expressly recorded.
The Board adjourned to Friday, May 28, at 3:30 P.M.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary

ANN ARBOR, MAY 28, 1937
The Board met at 3:30 P.M. in the Regents' Room.
There were present the President, Regent Murfin, Regent Beal,
Regent Smith, Regent Cram, Regent Cook, Regent Stone, Regent
Crowley, and Superintendent Elliott. Absent, Regent Hemans. There
were also in attendance Vice-President Yoakum, Vice-President Bruce,
Dr. F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G. Watkins, and the Secretary.
The usual financial reports were placed on file.
The minutes of the meeting of April 30 were approved as submitted to the members in press proof.
Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company were appointed to audit the
University accounts, on the same basis as last year, but with compensation of $3,300. The audit is to include as usual the books of the
Hospital and of the dormitories.
Dean Bursley communicated to the Board the fact that the Men's
Dormitory Committee of the student body, out of the money which
it had raised during the present year, desired to use approximately
$1,000 to erect the ornamental gate which is to be placed between
the addition to the Michigan Union and the new dormitory units,
Allen House and Rumsey House (p. 212), and further that the
student committee desired to have this gate named the Murfin Gate,
in honor of Regent James 0. Murfin. The Board accepted this gift
and named the gate accordingly. Regent Murfin did not vote. The
vote by his fellow members was accompanied with many expressions
of congratulation to him and of appreciation of his long and devoted
service as a Regent.
The Board adopted by-laws in general accord with suggestions filed
at the April meeting (p. 225), though with several amendments thereto,
as follows:
REVISION OF BY-LAWS AND REGENTS' REGULATIONS CONCERNING
STUDENT AFFAIRS, CONDUCT, AND DISCIPLINE
Section 1. General Standards of Student Conduct. Enrollment in the
University carries with it obligations in regard to conduct, not only inside but
also outside the classroom, and students are expected to conduct themselves in
such manner as to be a credit both to themselves and to the University. They
are amenable to the laws governing the community as well as to the rules and
orders of the University and University officials, and they are expected to
observe the standards of conduct approved by the University.
Whenever a student, group of students, society, fraternity, or other student
organization fails to observe the standards of conduct as above outlined, or
conducts himself or itself in such a manner as to make it apparent that he or
it is not a desirable member or part of the University, he or it shall be liable to
disciplinary action by the proper University authorities.
Section 2. Concerted Neglect of Duty. Concerted absence from any appointed duty by a class or by any number of students together will be regarded
as improper conduct, and those participating in such action shall be liable to
disciplinary action by the proper University authorities.




228                    MAY    MEETING, 1937
Section 3. Use of Motor Vehicles by Students. No student in attendance
at the University shall operate any motor vehicle. In exceptional and extraordinary cases, at the discretion of the Dean of Students, this rule may be
relaxed. Any student violating this rule shall be liable to disciplinary action by
the proper University authorities.
Section 4. Financial Obligations of Students. Proper observance of financial obligations is deemed an essential of good conduct, and students who are
guilty of laxness in this regard to a degree incompatible with the general standards
of conduct as set forth in Section 1 shall be liable to disciplinary action by
the proper University authorities.
Students shall pay all accounts due the University not later than the last
day of classes of each semester or summer session. Any unpaid accounts at the
close of business on the last day of classes shall be reported to the Cashier of
the University, and the following action shall be taken: (a) all academic credits
shall be withheld, (b) grades for the semester or summer session just completed
shall not be released, (c) no transcripts of credits shall be issued, and (d) students owing such accounts shall not be allowed to register in any subsequent
semester or summer session until payment has been made. Whenever, in the
opinion of the Dean of Students, a case warrants it, like action shall be taken
in the case of nonpayment of rent properly chargeable for living accommodations
for the term in an approved rooming house. Student loans that fall due during
any semester or summer session which are not paid or renewed are subject to
this regulation, but loans not yet due are not included.
Section 5. Rooming Regulations. (a) All men students in the freshman
class shall live in quarters approved by the Dean of Students, and all unmarried
undergraduate and graduate male students not living at home with their parents
shall live in rooming houses, University dormitories, or fraternities. The Dean
of Students is given authority to make exceptions to these regulations in cases
where in his opinion conditions warrant such action.
(b) All undergraduate women students shall live in University dormitories,
unless permission is given by the Dean of Women to live elsewhere.
Section 6. Publications. The publication by any student or students of any
printed matter bearing the name of the University, or purporting to emanate
from it, is forbidden, unless the publication is first approved by the Board in
Control of Student Publications.
Section 7. Solicitation of Funds from Alumni. No University organization
of interest to the student body generally shall solicit funds for any purpose from
the alumni of the University without having first obtained the approval of the
Regents. Application for such approval must be made through the Dean of Students and must be accompanied by a full statement of the intended plan of
campaign and its purposes.
Section 8. Use of University Property by Students. The use of University
property for extracurricular purposes is subject to the following provisions:
(a)  No permission for the use of University property for meetings or
lectures shall be granted to any student organization not officially recognized nor
shall such permission be granted to any individual student.
(b)  Lecture Rooms and Auditoriums. The policy of the Regents is to
encourage the timely and rational discussion of topics whereby the ethical and
intellectual development of the student body and' the general welfare of the
public may be promoted, and a due respect inculcated in the people for society
at large and for the constituted government of the state and nation.
In furtherance of this policy the use of University lecture rooms and auditoriums may be granted to recognized student organizations for meetings or
lectures on topics of the day, under guaranty that during such meetings or
lectures there shall be no violation of the recognized rules of hospitality, nor
advocacy of the subversion of the government of the United States nor of the
State, and that such meetings and lectures shall be in spirit and expression
worthy of the University.
No addresses shall be allowed which urge the destruction or modification of
our form of government, by violence, or other unlawful methods, or which advocate or justify conduct which violates the fundamentals of our accepted codes
of morals.
Speeches in support of particular candidates of any political party or
faction ordinarily shall not be permitted. The discussion of matters of public
interest relating to our political, legal, economic, and general social institutions,




MAY MEETING, 1937                            229
if conducted in the right way, by proper persons, is of the very essence of
education and is of as much importance as a discussion of any subject in the
whole field of knowledge. It will not do to say that there shall be no discussion
before our students of matters of public concern by intelligent, well-qualified,
and honorable persons.
The Committee on University Lectures is given jurisdiction over all public
lectures held in University buildings. The committee may make its own rules of
procedure for receiving and passing on applications.
(c)  Other University Property. The use of other University property by
students or student organizations shall be in accordance with rules prescribed
from time to time by the Secretary of the University, except that the use of
University property specifically committed by action of the Board of Regents to
the care of other University agencies shall be as prescribed by such agencies.
(d) Smoking is prohibited in University buildings, except in private
offices, private laboratories, and assigned smoking rooms.
Section 9. Student Loan Funds. Loans shall be made to students from
the various funds in accordance with the conditions established by the several
donors and in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the Board
of Regents for the administration of the same.
No distinctions shall be made among students on account of sex, race,
religion, or course of study, further than those prescribed by the donors.
Unless otherwise provided for by terms and conditions laid down by the
donors thereof, the administration of all student loan funds shall be by the
University Committee on Student Loans, consisting of the Dean of Students,
the Dean of Women, and a representative from the Financial Office of the
University. The Dean of Students shall act as chairman of the committee.
Meetings of the University Committee on Student Loans shall be held at the
call of the chairman.
Each application for a loan shall be upon a blank form provided for the
purpose, properly filled out, and, in general, loans shall be made only after the
references have been heard from, and, so far as possible, only after a personal
appearance of the applicant before the proper committee.
Before a loan will be granted, the committee must be thoroughly convinced
of the applicant's real need for assistance; and it will be considered a ground
for refusal of the application if it is found that a loan is desired as a mere
matter of convenience to avoid the necessity of earnest effort on the part of
the applicant to obtain the necessary money otherwise. Loans will not be made
to students having expensive habits or to those belonging to expensive societies
or organizations. In making loans the committee will take into account the
moral character of the applicant, including his sense of financial responsibility,
his habits of temperance and industry, and his assiduity and success in his studies.
Unless provision to the contrary is made in the instrument of donation,
all loans shall, except under extraordinary circumstances, which in the judgment
of the committee justify a departure from this rule, be confined to seniors and
graduate students, and, subject to the above exception, no loan shall be made
to a student who has not been matriculated for at least one year.
Except in case of loans made from the Brosseau Foundation, the amount
loaned to any one applicant shall not exceed $200 a year, unless the circumstances
are extraordinary. The limit on the Brosseau Foundation loans shall be determined
by the committee in accordance with the terms of the deed of gift.
Each student borrowing shall sign a note for the full amount of the loan.
The committee may require the maker of the note to furnish additional security
-either an endorser or acceptable collateral. Except where a different provision
has been made by the donor of the fund, these notes shall draw interest at 3
per cent per annum from the date the loan is made until the date that the note
or the first payment on it is due, and interest at the rate of 6 per cent shall be
charged on all past-due amounts. In case the borrower is unable to meet his
payments when they come due, he may renew the note at the rate charged on
the original loan, provided that if such renewal note is not paid on time, the
interest rate shall be increased to 6 per cent on the balance due on the note,
unless in the opinion of the committee circumstances warrant further renewals at
the original rate. Loans shall be payable in a lump sum, or in installments of not
less than $10 per month, which payments shall apply toward the reduction of
principal and interest. The loan, or the first payment, shall be due not later
than six months after the date of probable graduation. In case the borrower




230


MAY MEETING, 1937


leaves college before graduation, the loan shall become due six months after the
date of leaving college.
In case the loan is to be paid in installments, the amount due on the first
installment shall be the accumulated interest. That due on subsequent installments shall include both the amount due on the principal and the interest due
to date of payment.
Section 10. The Dean of Students. The Dean of Students is chosen to
act as friend, counselor, and guide to the student body, and has the general
oversight of its welfare and of its several activities. He shall ex officio be of
professorial rank, a member of the University Senate, of the Board in Control
of Student Publications, and the Board of Directors of the Michigan Union,
and chairman of the Committees on Student Affairs, Student Conduct, and
Student Loans.
The Dean of Students shall act as the comptroller of funds and the auditor
of accounts of all student organizations with the exception of fraternities, sororities, the Michigan Union, the Michigan League, the Lawyers Club, and the
activities under the control of the Board in Control of Athletics and 'the Board
in Control of Student Publications. He shall make such rules as may be necessary
concerning the deposit and withdrawal of funds and the keeping and auditing
of accounts.
Section 11. The Dean of Women. The Dean of Women shall receive the
registration of women students upon their first entrance to the University, and
be accessible to them for consultation during regularly appointed hours. To her
shall be reported absences of women students from classes, and upon her rests
the duty to see all women that are failing in their academic work, and to
ascertain the cause.
She shall be ex officio of professorial rank, a member of the University
Senate, of the Board of Directors of the Michigan League, and of the Committees
on Student Affairs, Student Conduct, and Student Loans, and an adviser to the
Director of the Health Service in cases that relate to the health of women
students under University care; and shall be a guide in the social and in the
spiritual life of women students. On the material side she shall carefully inspect
and standardize their housing conditions.
Section 12. The Senate Committee on Student Affairs. There is hereby
created a Committee on Student Affairs to consist of the Dean of Students and
the Dean of Women, ex officio, six members of the Senate, two to be appointed
by the President each year for a period of three years, and five students; viz.,
the President of the Men's Council, the President of the Michigan Union, the
Managing Editor of the Michigan Daily, the President of the Michigan League,
and the Chairman of the Judiciary Council of the Michigan League, all members
to have equal voting power, the Dean of Students to act as chairman of the
committee.
Full supervision and control of all student activities, other than athletic and
those falling within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Student Conduct, shall
be vested in this committee, and no such activities shall be organized or launched
without first obtaining permission from the committee.
The chairman shall have power and authority to appoint such subcommittees as may be deemed necessary for the performance of the duties herein
imposed.
The Dean of Students as chairman of the committee shall have summary
power in the administration of all matters coming under the jurisdiction of the
committee, but questions involving the adoption of, or change in, an established policy shall be referred to and determined by the committee.
Section 13. University Committee on Student Conduct. There is hereby
created a University Committee on Student Conduct to consist of (1) three
senate members appointed by the President for rotating terms of three years:
(2) the Deans or Directors of the several schools and colleges, or their designated
representatives; (3) the Dean of Women; and (4) the Dean of Students, who
shall act as chairman. This committee shall from time to time prescribe standard
principles and rules of conduct for students and student organizations such as
to promote the welfare of the student body and to protect the University from
unwarranted criticism. Such rules shall not be inconsistent with action taken
from time to time by the Board of Regents concerning student conduct.
Section 14. Disciplinary Authorities. The following authorities shall exercise disciplinary powers over students in cases of misconduct.




MAY MEETING, 1937                              231

Students or the Dean of Women, to the Judiciary Committee of the Men's

authority. The instructor shall promptly report to the dean or other administrative head of his department any disciplinary action taken by him.
(d)  The Deans or Other Administrative Heads-Cases Requiring Summary
Action. Cases of misconduct of students in which the offenses are such that

Women in the case of women students, may take such disciplinary action as
shall be deemed appropriate.

of this chapter), all cases concerning men students involving violations of the
regulations as to financial obligations (Section 4 of this chapter), all cases concerning men students involving violations of the rooming regulations (Section

proper faculty or other disciplinary authority as herein provided.
(f) The Dean of Women. All cases concerning women students involving
violations of the regulations of the Board of Regents as to general standards of
conduct (Section 1 of this chapter), as to financial obligations (Section 4 of

consultation with and consent of the Dean of Women.

Committee on Student Conduct shall have power of discipline over the following
cases of misconduct: (1) those involving students from  more than one school
or college; (2) those involving students enrolled in combined courses; (3) those
involving organized student groups; and (4) those referred to it by other
disciplinary authorities. Its decisions shall be final, but the President shall be
consulted whenever practicable before suspension or expulsion. The committee
may create a Subcommittee on Discipline and delegate to it the power to act.
The committee may also delegate to student committees on self-government its
power to act in specific classes of cases, and may provide that action in such
cases shall be subject to review by the Subcommittee on Discipline.
(I) Penalties. Except as otherwise herein provided, the several disciplinary authorities may determine the penalties appropriate to the circumstances
of the cases. Penalties may be in the form of expulsion, suspension, probation,
withdrawal of special privileges, imposition of special duties, imposition of extra
hours of required credit, the reduction of hours of credit, and the imposition
of monetary fines, which shall be deemed debts owing the University, or such
other action as may be deemed proper in particular cases. A failure to comply




232


MAY MEETING, 1937


with a disciplinary order of any of the disciplinary authorities shall result in
suspension until compliance.
Section 15. Repeals. The following sections of the By-Laws are hereby
repealed:
By-Laws 1923, Ch. VI, C, Sec. la. General Student Duties.
By-Laws 1923, Ch. VI, C, Sec. 3. Suspension or Dismissal by Faculty
Discipline Committees.
By-Laws 1923, Ch. VI, C, Sec. 5. Dismissal for Want of Improvement.
By-Laws 1923, Ch. VI, C, Sec. 6. Disorderly Acts.
By-Laws 1923, Ch. VI, C, Sec. 7. Public Lectures.
The Board authorized an addition to the University Health Service
Building to provide office space and six additional beds within a preliminary estimate of $5,000, with new equipment therefor within an
estimate of $1,000, the total sum  of $6,000 to be taken from  the
Health Service Budget reserve.
The Regents accepted the sum of $750 a year for three years to
constitute the stipend of a fellowship in the Economics Department to
carry on studies in the status of the Jew in the automobile and allied
industries in Detroit and vicinity, to be known as the Edward Lasker
Fellowship in Economics.    This fellowship was presented by the
Conference on Jewish Relations, an organization interested in
promoting scientific studies helpful in understanding the relation of
Jews to their fellow citizens. The organization expressly pointed out
that it had no interest in propaganda and that the investigation was
to be made by the University untrammeled and on a purely scientific
basis. The acceptance by the Regents of the fellowship was on the
basis of these terms and with the understanding that the investigation
and any publications of the results would be in accordance therewith.
On recommendation of the President the following were named
to receive during the coming Commencement season the designation
of Honorary Alumnus of the University (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 834):
Mr. Albert J. Engel, Congressman from the Ninth Michigan District
Mr. George Wahr, Ann Arbor
Mr. Stanley G. Waltz, Ann Arbor
The Regents expressed the view, in response to a communication,
that it would be highly appropriate to provide a suitable and adequate
memorial to the late Judge Thomas M. Cooley, for many years Dean
and Professor in the Law School, but that such a memorial should not,
in the opinion of the Regents, take the form of attaching Judge
Cooley's name to any of the land or buildings provided by the late
W. W. Cook or of a request to the City of Ann Arbor to change the
name of South University Avenue to Cooley Avenue.
The Regents adopted the following resolution:
Resolved, That the quadrangle enclosed by the Lawyers Club, the John P.
Cook Dormitory, the William W. Cook Legal Research Library, and Hutchins
Hall be designated hereafter as the W. W. Cook Quadrangle.
The Board approved and enacted the recommendations, including
nominations, embodied in a communication from Dean Yoakum of the
Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies as follows:
1. That, in accordance with a request of the President, he no longer be
listed as an ex-officio member of the Executive Board of the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies.
2. That the Assistant Dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate




MAY MEETING, 1937


233


Studies be designated an ex-officio member of the Executive Board of the Horace
H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies.
3. That in view of the broadened duties of the Executive Board in connection with University research activities, the membership of the board be
enlarged from eight members, which it is at the present, to ten members.
4. That the term of office be changed from four to five years, two members
of the board to be appointed each year.
5. That nominations for membership be made as heretofore in accordance
with Chapter IX, Section 2, of the By-Laws. Selection of nominees will be made
in accordance with a plan to be adopted by the Executive Board.
The board was thereupon constituted as follows:

The Board enacted the following recommendation of the University
Council:
Emeritus professors shall be regarded as members of the University faculties
who have been relieved of teaching and administrative responsibilities, and, as
such, they shall be entitled to attend, without vote, meetings of the University
Senate; to march in a position of honor in academic processions; to receive the
Michigan Daily while residing in Ann Arbor so that they may be informed of the
items in the Daily Official Bulletin; to avail themselves of library and other
facilities offered to University faculty members, as such; to represent the University on appointment at academic ceremonies of other institutions; and, in
general, to take part with the faculties in all social and ceremonial functions of
the University.
The Board authorized the sale as paper-mill stock of approximately
3,000 duplicate books in the General Library for which there is no
market either through exchange or sale as books. According to the
general rule, proceeds of this sale will go into the University's general
fund.
In accordance with the request of its Board of Governors, the name
of the Student Christian Association was changed to Student Religious
Association.
Mr. Watkins, Assistant Secretary, reported to the Regents three
appeals from his decision with respect to whether certain students were
entitled to register on payment of resident fees or only on payment of
nonresident fees. The Regents confirmed the decision that Mr. Watkins has made in these cases (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 589).
The Regents rescinded previous action with respect to the special
curriculum for training of social workers (R.P. 1920-1923, p. 99;
R.P. 1932-1936, pp. 531 and 35). The College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts will, therefore, no longer grant the Certificate in Social
Work. In place thereof, the Institute of Public and Social Administration will confer the degree of Master of Social Work (R.P. 1932-1936,
p. 835).
The Regents granted approval, as requested, for the projected plan
of the Women's Athletic Association of the University to promote the




244

financing of a swimming pool for women in connection with the
Women's Field House.
Regent Murfin was excused.
The Regents accepted with thanks the gift of $1,000 from Mr.
Alvan Macauley of Detroit which he had generously tendered with the
request that it be used in some way for the benefit of students. The
Regents voted that this gift of $1,000 be a nucleus for "The Dormitory Residents' Aid fund." The interest from this fund shall be
awarded annually, or in such fraction of the total amount of interest
available as may seem desirable to the committee appointed to administer the fund, to selected men residents of dormitories. The intent of
the proposed awards is to enable specially selected, worthy students
to live in a dormitory when, without this financial aid, they could not
afford to do so. It is to be further understood, however, that in setting
up this fund the Regents may at their discretion at some later date,
when in their judgment the accretions to the fund shall warrant, use
the entire capital in the erection of a new dormitory.
The Board accepted with thanks and recorded two gifts of $15 and
$30, made by President Ruthven as additions to the Alexander G.
Ruthven Loan fund in the Museum of Zoology (R.P. 1932-1936,
p. 40).
The Board accepted with thanks a gift from the Geological Society
of America with headquarters at Baltimore, Maryland, of a grant of
$1,125 for study of the Upper Jurassic marine fauna of northern
Mexico. A check for $1,000 of this total grant has already been received through Mr. R. W. Imlay, Research Associate, and is to be
held for his use under Research Project No. 416.
The Regents continued the leave of absence of Mr. Julius Schmidt,
Investment Officer (p. 138) for a further period of six months, or for

The Secretary filed notice that House Enrolled Act No. 35 of the
present session of the Legislature, signed by Governor Murphy May 17,

and Mary A. Rackham Fund and the Regents of the University (R.P.
1932-1936, pp. 682-687; p. 684 in particular). The Secretary further
gave notice that the Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham Fund
Trustees have filed with the papers of this meeting a copy of their
action, which they had communicated to the Detroit Trust Company,
terminating as of June 28 the agency agreement between the Fund and
the Trust Company (R.P. 1932-1936, pp. 831-834), and had directed
the Trust Company in accordance therewith to turn over to the
Regents or their representatives the funds thus far held by the Trust
Company under the agency agreement.
The Regents took the following action terminating the agency
agreement betweeen the Board and the Detroit Trust Company covering the Mary A. Rackham Fund of $1,000,000 (pp. 14-16):
WHEREAS, Act No. 140 of the Public Acts of 1895 (being Sections 153 and
154 and of the Michigan Compiled Laws of 1929) has been legally repealed and
the repeal thereof has become effective, and

making of a memorandum agreement on July 1, 1936, as of June 15, 1936, by
and between the Regents of the University of Michigan and the Detroit Trust
Company, such agreement being recorded on pages 14, 15, and 16 of the
Proceedings of this Board at the meeting of August 7, 1936, and
WHEREAS, The said agreement provides that it may be terminated by either
party upon thirty days written notice to the other party, Now, therefore be it
Resolved, That the said agreement between the Regents of the University of
Michigan and the Detroit Trust Company be and is hereby terminated, in accordance with its terms, thirty days after the receipt by the said Detroit Trust Company of the notice in writing of such termination, and
Resolved, further, That the Vice-President and Secretary of this Board is
directed to give notice to the said Detroit Trust Company in manner approved
by himself and George J. Burke, attorney of the Board, at the earliest reasonable
date.

Board with power to handle such details as might be urgent in connection with the termination of the agency agreements and to report
their action to the Regents at the meeting of June 18, including any
recommendations that seemed desirable with respect to the care of the
University's trust funds following the termination of the agency agreements. The President later appointed Regent Murfin.

Mendelson Memorial Trust to be expended under the direction of
Dr. Reuben L. Kahn in his studies in immunology. It is expected that
the Aaron Mendelson Memorial Trust will make a like contribution to
carry the work through 1938-1939 (R.P. 1932-1936, p. 821).
The Board received with thanks to Mr. Samuel A. Harper of Chicago, the donor, a statue, "The Boxer," by Roaul Jean Josset. This
work of art will be placed, for the time being at least, in the lobby of
the Michigan Union.
The Board received and accepted with thanks the gift of Mrs. William L. Clements of a replica of the Romney Germain portrait. It is
understood that this portrait will be hung beside the Shelburne portrait in the Clements Library.

Japanese alumni, for the purchase of Japanese flowering cherry trees
to be planted at such place in Ann Arbor as shall be recommended by

to be vigorous in this climate (p. 224).

College, former State Geologist of Michigan, a gift of the Bryant
Walker Papers and the Charles A. Davis Papers in his possession. It
was directed that these papers be placed in the University archives.

Dear Dr. Ruthven:
At the annual dinner of the University of Michigan Club of Chicago on
Friday, April 16th, following a series of meetings of the officers, governors, and
representative leading Alumni, a resolution was unanimously adopted whereby
the Club selected as an objective for Chicago Alumni the erection of a dormitory
building in dormitory group already planned by the University.
The Club asks the University to allot to it as its part of the dormitory
program the building to be located at the corner of Madison and Thompson
Streets, which we understand will accommodate approximately 90 to 100 students
and is planned to cost from $180,000 to $200,000.
Preliminary work on the campaign will be done during the summer and it is
planned to conduct a very extensive campaign beginning at approximately the
time of opening of school in the fall.
The University of Michigan Club of Chicago takes pleasure in asking that
you present this proposed contribution to the Board of Regents of the University.
Yours very truly,
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN CLUB OF CHICAGO

of 1938, with due allowance for traveling expenses to and from Ann Arbor.
From the Board of Governors of Martha Cook Building the sum of $2,073.50
under terms and conditions expressed in the following note from Mrs. Florentine Cook Heath, Chairman:
I am enclosing a check for $2,073.50 which is to be the nucleus for the Anne
E. Shipman Stevens Fellowship fund being raised by alumnae and friends of the
Martha Cook Building in recognition of Mrs. Stevens's notable services as a member
of the Board of Governors.
We wish to deposit this sum with the University with the understanding that
it shall be added to from time to time, and that the interest earned shall be paid
to the Board of Governors of The Martha Cook Building. For the year 1937-1938
the Board of Governors will supplement this interest to the extent of room and
board for one student who is to live in the building. Such student is to be chosen
according to the rules governing the free room and board scholarships at Martha
Cook, plus the approval of the Board of Governors.
When the Fund reaches larger proportions we shall wish to make different stipulations as to the manner of award.

be replaced by Civil Engineering 58 and two hours added to the major electives
in the first semester of the fourth year.

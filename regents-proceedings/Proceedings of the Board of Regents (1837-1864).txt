EDITOR'S PREFAC-E.


The University of Michigan as an organized institution
of Collegiate rank dates from the admission of the State
into the Union. The feeble attempts during the Territorial
days to organize such an institution had all come to naught.
Accordingly, the first Legislature, following the nmandate of
the State Constitution, proceeded to carry out the design
on new lines. A Board of Regents was created to consist
of eiglteen members, six ex ocirio and twelve by appointment of the Governor and Senate. Seven memlbers constituted a quorum. On June 5, 1837, the first meeting of
the Regents was held at Ann Arbor Twhere the University
had been located by legislative enactment the previous
March. At this meeting eleven members were present, and
Governor Mlason presided. From tlis time forward there
were frequent meetings, sometimes in Ann Arbor, more
often in Detroit, which was for ten years the State Capital.
Difficulties were often experienced in securing a quorum,
and there were frequent changes in the personnel of the
Boardl, chiefly by resignation. The business was (lone for
the most part by a few men in and near Detroit.
The Constitution of 185o provided for a smlaller bo(ly.
to consist of one member from each Judicial District, who
should be chosen by popular vote at the April election of
I851 and take office the following January. The objection
to this arrangement was that all the members took office at
the same date for the same term (six years). It was found
in I857 that an entirely new Board of ten had lben chosen 
To obviate this objection an Amenldment to the Constitution
was proposed and adopted, that at the Spring election of
1863 a Board of eight members shoulld be elected on a
general ticket, to take office the following January; and that
these should be divided into four classes of two each, to
serve two, four, six, and eight years respectively. Thereafter, two should be chosen at the Spring election every two
years to serve the full term of eight years. TIlis arrangement is still in force.

iED l.ITO. ' S PREFAI' CL;


The first Board began by printing a record of its proceeclings (.see page 9), but discontinued the practice after
three meetings. The Proceedings from that time to I858
have lain in the original MS. all these years. Many students
of the History of the University have remarked on this
neglect and have wished that these documents might be
printed and thus made secure against injury or destruction.
Accordingly, in June, 1912, the Regents authorized the
printing of these records "for preservation."  Authority
was later given the Editor to include the Proceedings from
IS58 to 1864, inasmuch as these, mluch abridged in printing,
existed in less than half a dozen known copies. The volume
hlere presented contains all that is recorded during the first
and second regimes above described.
The original MS. is in two thick folio volumes of 1129
closely written pages.  During the twenty-seven years
covered by this record ten different men served the Board as
Secretary. The handwritings of these men (or of their
scribes) present considerable variety in legibility, and the
style is not always un.iforml. The Editor has not attempted
any changes beyond the correction of obvious errors. A
few explanatory foot-notes lhave been added in small type.
A word of explanation should be given in regard to the
inclusion of Dr. Tappan's "Review" (pp. i11:9-II66). The
Board that removed him from the Presidency entered upon
their Journal (pp. o179-o081) a defence of their action,
and indulged in some reflections upon his official character
and efficiency. During the first winter after his removal,
while residing in Berlin, he yielded to the urgency of his
friends and prepared the "Review' here appended. For
obvious reasons it was rigidly suppressed at the time, and
very few copies are known to have survived. In view of the
attack just referred to, the present Board have thought it
proper that Dr. Tappan should be heard in his own defence,
as a part of the record of that unhappy controversy.
Mr1. H. L. Sensemann, of the Rhetoric staff, has rendered
invaluable aid in verifying the type-written copy with the
MS., preparing the Index, and assisting with the proofs.

REGENTS' PROCEEDINGS
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
1837-1864
FIRST MEETING, JUNE, 1837.
Ann Arbor, June 5th, I837.
This being the day appointed by the Governor for the
first meeting of the Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan, the following gentlemen appeared, viz.: his Excellency, Stevens T. Mason, Governor of Michigan, the
Honorable Edward tMundy, Lieutenant-Governor, the IHonorable Elon Farnsworth, Chancellor of the State, ex-officio
members of the Board, and Doctor Zina Pitcher, Doctor
Samuel Denton, Lucius Lyon, Isaac E.. Crary, Ross Wilkins, John F. Porter, Gideon 0. Whittemore, and John J.
Adam, Esquires, members.
On motion of Judge Wilkins, his Excellency the Governor, was appointed President pro tern., and Charles W.
Whipple, of the City of Detroit, Secretary pro tern., of the
Board.
On motion of Lieutenant-Governor Mundy, the "Act to
provide for the organization of the University of Michigan," wvas read and referred to a Committee consisting of
Lieutenant-Governor Mundy and Messrs. Crary and Porter.
On motion of Doctor Denton, the "Act to provide for
the location of the University," was referred to the same
Committee.
The Board then adjourned to 3 o'clock P. M.
3 o'clock, P. M.
The Board met pursuant to adjournment.
The Committee to whom was referred the "Act to provide for the organization of the University," and the "Act




2            FIRST MEETING, JUNE, 1837
to provide for the location of the University," by their
Chairman, Lieutenant-Governor Mundy, made the following report, which was adopted:
The Committee to whom was referred the "Act to provide for
the organization and government of the University of Michigan,"
and "to locate the University of Michigan," respectfully report:That they have used the very limited time at their disposal for
the purpose of presenting to the Board of Regents, in a condensed
form, what, in the opinion of the Committee, would be at this first
meeting of the Regents, proper matters for their consideration and
action.
From an examination of the Act first named, the Committee
find it to be the duty of the Board at this meeting to appoint a
Secretary, Librarian, and Treasurer, and that the Regents appointed
under the provisions of the third section shall be classed and balloted for, so that one-fourth of them may go out of office annually,
and that by the second named Act, the selection of the lands to be
donated as the condition of the location of the University at Ann
Arbor, should be made by the Board at the present meeting and
the necessary conveyances for the same made and recorded. Your
Committee are of opinion that it was the intention of the Legislature to vest in the Regents the appointment of the Chancellor of
the University, an opinion predicated as well upon the great propriety of that mode of appointment, as upon a knowledge of the
opinions of many individual members of Ithe Legislature, and the
impression of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Yet the
Committee, from a perusal of the Act, are satisfied that the exercise
of this power by the Board at this time, might from the ambiguity
of the Act, be of doubtful propriety, and they would therefore suggest that the Governor of the State might be requested in his message at the coming special session of the Legislature, to lay this
matter before that body.
Your Committee would suggest that the following Committees
be appointed to report at the present session of the Board, to wit:A Committee on the number of Professors and Tutors, and
their salaries and the salary of the Chancellor and other officers.
A Committee to carry into effect the provisions of the "Act to
locate the University of Michigan."
A Committee of Ways and Means.
And that the following Committees be appointed with instructions to report at the next regular session of the Board, to wit:A Committee to prepare a Code of Laws for the government of
the University and the Course of Instruction.
A Committee on Buildings and the Improvement of the University Grounds.
A Committee on University Branches.
A Committee on the appointment of Professors and Tutors, and
other Officers.
A Committee on Library, Philosophical Apparatus, and Cabinet
of Natural History.
The President appointed Chancellor Farnsworth        and
Messrs. Whittemore and Adam      a Committee to carry into

effect the provisions of the "Act to locate' the University

On motion of Lieutenant-Governor Mundy, the Board
then proceeded to the election of a Secretary and Treasurer; and Charles W. Whipple' was chosen               Secretary, and
Charles C. Trowbridge,2 Treasurer.

proceeded to divide the Board into four classes,3 of three
each; and it appeared that Messrs. Norvell, Wilkins. and
Adam    drew   class number one; Messrs. Lyon, Crary, and
Porter, class    number two; Doctor Denton             and   Messrs.
Whittemore     and   Hoffman, class number three; and             Dr.

Present: the same as yesterday.
The minutes of the Proceedings of yesterday having
been read,
Judge Wilkins, from    the Committee appointed on the
number of Professors and Tutors, their salaries and the salaries of the Chancellor, and other Officers, made the following report:
[That they have had the subject under consideration, and conceiving it highly important to the public that the University of
Michigan should be speedily organized, and in operation, unanimously recommend the creation, at this time, of three professorships and two tutors, under the first department; and that the
salaries be fixed as follows:
That of  the  Chancellor  at................. $3,000.
That of each of the Professors at.......... 2,000.
That of each of the Tutors................  600.
In relation to the salaries of the other officers, your committee
deem it inexpedient at this session, to designate any amount of
compensation as an annual salary.
The committee further recommend the appointment of one
Professor in the Law Department, whose salary shall be fixed at
$2,000; and the commencement of the duties of that professorship,
the ensuing winter. Michigan, for years past, has presented, and
still continues to present, to the ambitious 'and enterprising youth

of our country a rich field for the exercise of talent and knowledge. Many such have emigrated from our sister states, with 'the
hope of here leading a useful and honorable life. Already prepared
by collegiate education for the study of a profession, all that is
needed is the opportunity to qualify themselves 'by appropriate
and liberal instruction. The.free, civil, constitution of Michigan,
holds forth high hopes to all, of every class, who cast their lot
among us. The science of law expands the intellect, improves the
heart, and qualifies for the most serviceable duties to man. By it,
our statesmen, civilians, jurists, and many of our legisators are
formed; and by it the country is cleared of the dangerous pettifogger, and protection from oppression, and security and justice
to all are maintained and preserved.
Your Committee therefore believing that this department will
immediately command a number of students, who are awaiting the
action of this Board, hesitate not to recommend the opening of the
Law School the ensuing winter.
On motion, the report was laid on the table.']

NO TVEMBER MEETING, I837


NOVEMIBER MEETING, T837.
At a meeting of the Board of Regents of the University
of Michigan held pursuant to adjournment, at the Capitol
in the City of Detroit, on the 14th November, I837.
Present: Governor Mason, Lieutenant-Governor Mundy, Chancellor Farnsworth, Dr. Pitcher, and Messrs. Wilkins, Adam, Norvell, and Schoolcraft.
Dr: Pitcher, from the Committee on Branches, made the
follow\ing, report from  said Committee, accompanied by the
report of Dr. Gibson, the agent of the Board heretofore appointed:
The undersigned, a member of the Committee on University
Branches, has the honor to report the progress they have made in
carrying into effect the intentions of the Board of Regents, so far
as they were expressed in the Resolutions adopted at their session
in June last. A majority of your Committee met on the 22nd of
June at whicih time the circular enclosed was issued, and the resolution marked (A)1 w'as adopted. In pursuance of this resolution
the appointment of one agent authorized by the Board was offered
to the Reverend Gilbert Morgan, then in the City of Detroit, between whom and a member of the Committee the correspondence
herewith presented took place. As Mr. Morgan did not accept the
appointment tendered him by the Committee, it was deemed advisable to employ Dr. R. C. Gibson, of Monroe, 'to perform this service for the Board, who has done it to the entire satisfaction of
the Committee. This report is also laid before the Regents for
their consideration.
It will be seen on reference to Dr. Gibson's report that he recommends the establishment of three of the Branches in the Third
Senatorial District, instead of two, as contemplated by the resolutions of the 2Ist of June. This would leave but two to be located
in the Fifth District. In the expediency of this proposal the Committee fully concur.
In the exercise of the discretionary power bestowed upon the
Committee, they conferred in July last the appointment of "Principal of the Oakland Branch of the University of Michigan," upon
the Rev. G. P. Williams, who has had that Branch in successful
operation since the I5th of Sept. last.
At a meeting of your Committee August 24th, they passed the
annexed Resolutions (B)1 in relation to a System of Laws for t'he
Government of the Branch in Oakland and the compensation to
be allowed the Principal thereof.
The Committee have the honor to present to the Board for their
examination and decision in relation thereto, the following documents:
First. A System of Laws for the Government of the Oaklandl
Branch of the University of Michigan.
1 These Resolutions (A. B.) were not recorded in the Proceedings.

The Committee to wlhom was referred the subject of the Library, Philosophical Apparatus, and Cabinet of Natural History, regret to say that from various causes they have not been able to
make much progress in the important duty assigned to them. Without procuring means and without instructions, the most the Committee have felt themselves authorized to do was to prepare a catalogue of books for the Library, and by correspondence to endeavor
to learn where, upon what 'terms, and the best mode in which the
Board of Regents might provide a suitable Library, Philosophical
Apparatus, and Cabinet of Natural History; and even this from
their distant separation they have not been able much to accomplish. Your Committee have examined a correspondence submitted
to them by the Secretary of the Board between that gentleman and
Dr. Torrey of the City of New York relative to a Cabinet of Minerals owned by L. Lederer, of that City, and have seen,letters from
Mr. Lederer to Dr. Torrey and Major Whipple stating;the terms
upon which Mr. Lederer would dispose of his Cabinet; and the favorable opinion of some scientific gentlemen of its value.
This Cabinet consists of about 2600 specimens of foreign minerals, many of them said to be rare, and perhaps not elsewhere to
be obtained. The price asked by Mr. Lederer 'is $4500, which in
the opinion of Dr. Torrey is "rather high, but perhaps not above
their real value, especially to a public institution." Mr. Lederer is
anxious to sell upon favorable terms of credit. Your Committee
would recommend that some suitable person in the City of New
York be employed to examine this Cabinet and make some arrangements for the purchase of it.
On motion, it was,
Resolved, That Judge Wilkins, Chancellor Farnsworth, and
Lieutenant-Governor Mundv be a Committee to take into consideration the legal rights of the Trustees of the University of Michigan and how far it is practicable to alter by legislative enactment

ing the establishment of Branches, which were severally
read and laid on the table.
Chancellor Farnsworth submitted the following resolution which was adopted:
Resolved, That the President of this Board be and he is hereby authorized to issue his warrant upon the Treasurer of the University in favor of the Principal of the Branch at Pontiac for

Treasurer.
On motion ordered that said Treasurer execute a bond

On motion of Chancellor Farnsworth, the resolution submitted by Mr. Adam on the I8th instant, prescribing the

Dr. Pitcher submitted the following resolution, which
was adopted:
1Afterwards Professor of Greek in the University, 1845-I852.




30   THIRD NO VEMBER ML EETING, 1837


Resolved, That the President of the Board be directed to issue
his warrant upon the Treasurer of this corporation for $333-33,
bearing interest to pay the salary of R. C. Gibson, the Agent of the
Board from the Ist day of July to the ist day of November, I837,
provided, however, that no interest shall be paid on said warrant
after a sufficient sum shall be in the Treasury to pay the same.
Dr. Pitcher from the Committee heretofore appointed to
examine that part of the collection made by the State Geologist of Zoological specimens, etc., made the following report:
From an estimate made on data furnished by the State GeoIog:ist, the committee have arrived at the conclusion that in the section of Ornithology alone, the State of Michigan will yield from
three hundred and fifty to four hundred species. Counting duplicates of these to embrace the sexes, we shall have from seven to
eight hundred individuals. Many of these individuals molt twvice
in the year; hence it becomes necessary to exhibit the same bird,
both in summer and winter plumage. A complete collection, therefore, of Mich;igan birds will contain at the lowest estimate, one
thousand specimens.  One-fourth of this number has been obtained, and the hunters employed are sending in about one hulndrec
and fifty per month. Tihe Committee are of opinion (as it is
necessary for their preservation) that the specimens appertaining to
the University should be stuffed and set up in cases. To do this,
and go on with the collection of quadrupeds, fishes, and reptiles,
involves the necessity of.a heavy expenditure. We are informed
by the State Geologist that the appropriation heretofore made by
the Legislature, will not enable him to meet the current expenses
of the scientific corps under his direction, and make the disbursements requisite to keep in service his ornithological assistant. Wihen
the Committee take into consideration how important 'it will be to
the University to have in its possession so complete a collection of
subjects of Natural Science and of such as are indigenous to the
State and how difficult and expensive it will be to procure it, if we
permit the present opportunity to pass by unimproved, they feel
disposed earnestly to urge the Board of Regents to co-operate with
the State Geologist, in the adoption of means to accomplish an object of so much interest to the University and of utility to the
public at large. As there are no funds in the corporation applicable
at this time to the purpose under consideration, the committee
thought it would be expedient to recommend that this Board adopL
some mode expressing to the Legislature its conviction to the
necessity of placing at the disposal of the State Executive a larger
fund, in order that the State Survey, so well begun, so important
to agriculture, to science and the arts may be concluded -in a manner
honorable to its projectors, and creditable to the State which has
thus far sustained them. In accordance with this view the committee offer the following resolution:
Resolved, That the President of the Board of Regents be requested in his capacity to communicate to the Legislature the proceedings of this body on the subjects embraced in the foregoing
report.
Signed. Z. PITCHER,
Chairman of the Committee.




DECEMBER MEETING, 1837                       31
On motion the Report and Resolution were adopted:
Mr. WTilkins moved to reconsider the vote upon striking out the word "Niles" and inserting the words "White
Pigeon," in lieu thereof in the report of the Committee on
Branches, which motion was laid on the table.
The Board then adjourned to meet again on the 2nd
December.
DECEMBER MEETING, I837.
2nd December, 1837.
The Board met pursuant to adjournment.
Present: Governor AMason, Lieutenant-Governor lAMundy,
Chancellor Farnsworth, Chief Justice Fletcher, Justice Morell, Dr. Pitcher, and MAessrs. Wilkins and Adam.
Dr. Pitcher from the Committee on Branches to which
was referred the resolution of Mrr. Adam     prescribing the
conditions upon which Branches of the tUniversity should be
establisled, submitted the following and resolution; which
were severally adopted:
Dec. 2nd, I837.
The Committee on Branches to whom was referred the resolution offered by Mr. Adam. prescribing the conditions on which the
Branches of the University shall be established at the several places
selected by the Board of Regents, have had the same under consideration, and report it back to the Board so amended as to read
as follows:
Resolved, That no Branch of the University shall be established until a deed of a suitable quantity of land shall be executed
by some authorized person or persons, at the places designated by
the Board of Regents in favor of this corporation, and security
given for the erection of the necessary buildings thereon; the site
selected and the security given to be approved of by the Committee
on Branches or such agent as the Committee may employ for that
purpose.
The Committee have stricken out that part of the Resolution
in relation to a donation for a library, because part of the tuition
tax is already pledged to that object; and also because it appeared
to them that parents or guardians would be more willing to purclhase the necessary class books themselves for their sons than
they would to place the amount necessary to procure them into the
hands of an officer of this Institution.
The Academy Lot in this city having been given to the Trustees
of the University of Michigan for the purposes of education, and
the building thereon erected by voluntary subscription on the part
of the Citizens of Detroit, it seems to the Committee that the spirit
of the proposed resolution has already been complied with at this
place, and that no change in its phraseology need be made to adopt
it to Detroit.




.32  SECOND DECEMBER MEETINTG, 1837


Although the proposal of Mr. Whittemore was accepted on. the
2Ist of June, he coincided in opinion with the other member of the

motion by inserting "Centerville" in lieu of "White Pigeoln,"
which was agreed to.
The question then recurring upon striking out "Niles"
and inserting "Centerville" it was agreed to: so that a

The Committee to whom was referred the applications and

in the University, report, that they have had the subject under consideration. High testimonials of character and qualifications are
produced by the several applicants; but your Committee regret that
the present situation of the University forbids them from recommending at this time a selection. The corner-stone of the University is not yet laid, and until a prospect can be reasonably entertained of the commencement and completion of that building on the
site selected, your Committee deem a crhoice of Professors premature.

Natural Philosophy; and from his distinguished reputation, it would
be greatly advantageous to the future reputation of the Institution,

answer the several applications, acknowledging their receipt, stating
that the unprepared state of the University to commence immediate

Committee be discharged from their further consideration.

THIRD MARCH MEETING, 1838


-artment to the Monroe Branch, and with further instruc-.tions to report upon the expediency of amending the laws
prescribing the test of admission.
Mr. Schoolcraft presented the following report, which
was accepted and laid on the table:
The Committee on the Organization and Government of the
University, to whom was referred the Regents' resolution of the
3rd!instant, have had the same under consideration and beg leave
to report: That it would in their view best promote the interests,of the Institution, and of sound learning, Science, and Literature, to
organize each general Department of Instruction as a separate College or Collegiate Department, to be under the literary Government
of its own Presiding Officer, so far as the several branches taught
therein are concerned, subject, however, to the Laws prescribed by
the Regents. Such a sub-division of local government and' responsibility of action is not only deemed wise 'in principle, but the course
is rendered imperative by the ninth section of the Organic Act,
which declares that "the immediate government of the several Departments shall be intrusted to their respective Faculties."
The eighth section prescribes the general Collegiate divisions.and the separate Professorships wlhich may be appointed under each,
by the Regents, and circumscribes their power within the recited
number. It is clear, from a view of this Section, that the Act contemplates a College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and a College of Surgeons and Physicians, as the two primary Institutions.
Subordinate in rank, but at the same time perfectly distinct, are,.a Department of Law, a Department of Natural History and Chemistry, and a Department of the Fine Arts, Civil Engineering, and
Agriculture. Each of these requires, in our opinion, for its healthy
action, a Presiding Officer or Principal to whom shall be committed
its local government and management; and to this end, each needs
to have appropriate buildings, lecture rooms, books, and apparatus.
'The Committee do not wish to trench on the Professorships Committee by expressing an opinion on the number of Professors to be
appointed, or the grouping of their duties; but they deem it essential that whatever the number be, their respective duties should be
independently performed. This is believed to be the principle of
excellence 'in literary labours. lit appeals at once to the highest
motives, to intellectual exertion, and secures to its fullest extent,
individual accountability.
Such a distribution of powers would leave the Chancellor to
perform the duties of a civil and moral governor of the whole Institution. He would preside over the,deliberations of the Faculty
and be responsible to the Regents for the due administration of the
prescribed laws, and for the internal polity and general prosperity
of the University. To these duties it is deemed proper to add the
delivery of occasional lectures, at his own pleasure as to time and
topic. Every Professor having an appointment from the Regents
should be a member of the Faculty Board. The rules by which
this Board is to be governed are properly within the province of
the Committee for preparing a Code of Laws.
It is believed that the buildings for the Medical and Surgical
College could be most beneficially located at Detroit; but the graduation exercises would take place, and the degrees be conferred, at




APRIL MEIETINIG, 1838


43


the Mother Institution. The reasons for this recommendation are
founded wholly on the advantages for Anatomical and Clinical lectures which are possessed by this place and wlhich, from its commercial growth and importance, it must continue to enjoy over any
other in the State. Under these general views, the Committee re-.spectfully submit the following resolutions:
Ist. Resolved, That the Professor of Moral Philosophy shall
be ex offcio, President of the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts.
2nd. Resolved, That the Professor of the Theory and Practice
of Medicine shall be ex officio, President of the College of Surgeons
and Physicians.
3rd. Resolved, That the Professor of Common Law shall be
the Principal of the Law Department.
4th. Resolved, That the Professor of Geology and Mineralogy
shall be the Principal of the Department of Natural History and
Chemistry.
5th.- Resolved, That the Professor of Civil Engineering shall
be the Principal of the Department of the Fine Arts, Civil Engineering, and Architecture.
6th. Resolved, That the Chancellor shall execute the duties of
a civil and moral Governor of the University; that he shall preside
over the Faculty, and, with its aid, be responsible for the administration of the Laws and Regulations; and for the superintendence
of its internal polity and. general welfare; and that he shall, furthermore, be a lecturer ad libitunm.
7th. Resolved, That the buildings required for the College of,Surgeons and Physicians shall be erected at the City of Detroit.
Adopted in Committee, March I7th, I838.
(Signed) HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAF'r, Chr.
On motion, the Act relative to the State Geological Survey, and repealing an Act entitled, "An Act to provide for
a Geological Survey of the State of Michigan," was referred
to a select Committee, consisting of Messrs. Kearsley and
Wilkins.
On motion of Mr. Schoolcraft,
Resolved, That the State Geologist be requested to make an
examination in the vicinity of Ann Arbor to ascertain whether
stone of a suitable quality can be obtained for the University buildings.
And then the Board adjourned to the 7th day of April
next.
APRIL    MEETING, I838.

Adam.

APRIL MEETING, 1838


Dr. Pitcher presented certain testimonials in behalf of
the Rev. C. B. Thummel, who applies for the Professorship
of Modern Languages in the University, which was referred
to the Committee on Branches.
Dr. Pitcher presented a communication from        E. A.
Brush, Esq., which was laid on the table.
Mr. Kearsley from   the select Committee to which was
referred "An Act relative to the State Geological Survey,
etc., approved March 22nd, 1838, made the following report which, with the resolution accompanying the same,
was laid on the table:
REPORT:
By the eighth Section of said Act it is provided that specimens
shall be collected and preserved in the following manner, to wit:
first, the State slhall be supplied with single and good specimens.
Second, if more similar specimens than one can be found, sixteen
more, if possible, shall be procured, to be distributed by the Regents
amongst the University and its Branches. By the ninth section it
is provided that the Regents shall pay $4,000 for these anticipated
specimens in twelve equal quarter-yearly installments between the
first day of March, 1838, and first day of March, I84I, and that in
order to secure the benefits of said Act to the University and
Branches, the Regents shall within one month from its passage file
in the office of the Secretary of State their assent to the provisions
thereof. Your Committee cannot forbear the expression of surprise
at the foregoing provisions of the Act which requires the appropriation of the funds of the University for the purpose contemplated.
Your Committee are not insensible to the great advantage and, 'indeed, absolute necessity to the cause of Science that the University
and Branches should be furnished with the best specimens in Geology, etc., and your Committee very highly appreciate the value of
the Law authorizing the exploring of the State with the view to
developing its mineral and other resources. Yet while the object
of the law is unquestionably highly beneficial and commendatory,
your Committee are of the opinion that the Regents should not
have been called upon to appropriate any part of the funds of the
University for carrying it into effect. It is believed that the University and its Branches, exl uccessitate rei, can be tihe only safe
and appropriate depository of such specimens and therefore that
the Law should have made it the duty of the Regents to provide for
the preservation and safe keeping of all such specimens. This appropriate duty the Regents would most carefully and to the utmost
of their ability cheerfully undertake and perform. Your Committee
are, however, of the opinion that the interests of the Institutions
committed to their care should oblige them to decline giving their
assent to this Law, as provided by the ninth Section, for the following considerations. The Constitution most wisely provides that
the principal of the University Fund shall remain sacred and inviolate, no part of which can be expended for any purpose whatever. The interest accruing upon the amount for which lands have
been sold, if promptly paid, will be about $Io,ooo per annum. This




APRIL MEETING, 1838


45


entire sum would be required to meet the interest upon the loan
now asked from the State, with a view to an immediate commencement of the buildings for the University, and, therefore, no part
of it should be diverted from this object of primary importance.
The Regents from want of means have thought it prudent to organize but four Branches, although eight are considered necessary
at this moment. To carry out the provisions of law, relative to the
four Branches now organized, it may and probably will be immediately necessary to make an additional annual appropriation of
$I,000 to each to sustain a Female Department. To meet this expenditure, the Regents must depend upon the interest to accrue from
future sales of lands. Should the loan be obtained, then the interest now accruing will be necessary to meet that of the loan, and
should the loan be withheld, it will be the more necessary that the
Regents apply their wlhole means to carry out the spirit and intentions of the Constitution and Laws relative to the University. It is
only necessary to turn the attention of the Regents to the fact that
these specimens in Geology, etc., are now being collected and that
many of them,will be ready for delivery within six months, and
that all must be collected, at the longest, within three years. Buildings, fixtures, etc., must be erected for their safe keeping. Where
are those buildings? by whom to be constructed? Wihere are the
funds, or from what source to be appropriated!? It is not the duty
of the Regents 'to provide all these. In this view of the subject
thus, can the Regents consent to this proposition? It might be
added that the appropriation would require an amount equal to that
necessary for maintaining a Branch; and would the Regents be
justified in assenting to the provisions of this Law at the sacrifice
of this more direct and paramount duty? The impropriety also as
well as impolicy of pledging appropriations beyond the certain receipts and thus, under any contingency, requiring forced sales even
under disadvantageous circumstances, needs only to be mentioned
to induce their cautious avoidance. It can be clearly shown tnat
the pledges already given by the Regents will be all they can redeem; and, therefore, that the state of their finances forbids, upon
principles of justice and in accordance with the expectations of the
public, their assent to the provisions of the act of the 22nd March,
I838. Your Committee therefore respectfully submit the following
resolution:
Resolved, That the Regents feel it their duty to withhold
their assent to the appropriation contemplated by the Act of the 22d
March, I838. Yet they hereby pledge themselves for the erection of
such buildings as may be necessary and otherwise to-provide for
the preservation of such specimens as may be collected under said
Act and at any time intrusted to their care.
Dr. Pitcher, from the Committee on Branches, to which
was referred a communication from the Rev. M\r. Centre,
made the following report, which was adopted:
The Committee on Branches, who have had under consideration
the suggestion of Mr. Centre respecting the propriety of reducing
the qualifications of candidates for entrance into the University
Branches, fully concur with Mr. Centre that the distinction between
the common school and the Branches is unnecessarily great, but




46


APRIL MlEETIAG, 1838


also are of the opinion that this evil should rather be remedied
by striving to elevate the character of the district school than by
adoption of the plan proposed in the report of the Principal of the
Branch at Monroe.
The propriety of appointing a Tutor in that Branch has also
been discussed by'the Committee, who have formed the opinion that
it will not be expedient to make such an appointment until the
citizens of Monroe shall have furnished room for the accommodation of all the qualified applicants. The Committee would, however,
suggest that authority be given to the Committee on Branches to
make such an appointment whenever the objection above alluded
to shall have been removed.
Dr. Pitcher, from   the same committee, made the following report, with the accompanying resolutions, which
were severally adopted:
The Committee to which was recommitted the communication
from Mr. Noble on the subject of the Monroe Female Seminary
and the report of the Committee on Branches in relation thereto,
respectfully report:
That their views remain unchanged as regards the obligations
of this Board to organize the Female Department of each Branch
whenever the requisite buildings shall be furnished for that purpose,
but that they deem it inexpedient at this time to recommend the
establishment of a School of Female Instruction to be connected
with the Monroe Branch,-notwithstanding the overtures made by
the patrons of the Female Seminary at that place, because the
Committee are of the opinion that the precedent would not be a
safe one to establish, although it would not, so far as the Branch
alone at Monroe is concerned, very essentially augment the amount
to be drawn from the resources of the Regents of the University.
The Committee, therefore, ask leave to submit the following resolutions:
Resolved, Tlhat it is the opinion of this Board, that in the
present state of the finances of the University, it will be prejudicial
to the interests of the Institution to organize the Departments of
Female Instruction of either of the Branches which are to go into
operation this season, before the conditions have been Irterally
complied' with on which the location of each Branch was made to
depend.
Resolved, That the Committee on Branches be instructed to,
furnish Mr. Noble a copy of the foregoing resolution.
The Act to authorize the loan of a certain sum of money
to the University of Michigan, was referred to a Select
Committee consisting of Chancellor Farnsworth, Dr. Pitcher, and Mr. Kearsley.
On motion of Mr. Kearsley, the President is authorized
to signify the assent of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan to the provisions of the said Act, file
i certificate thereof in the Office of the Treasurer, and




SECOND APRIL MlEETING, 1838


47"


execute to said Treasurer and his successors the necessarl
bond, etc., agreeably to the Second Section of the Act aforesaid,.
It was further Resolved, That the President be authorized to
take charge of the specimens in Natural History, in the possession
of Dr. Houghton, belonging to the University and provide a place
for their safe keeping and preservation.
Resolved, That a Branch of the University be located at Niles
and the Committee on Branches be instructed to put in operation a
Branch of the University at Niles as soon as, in their opinion, the
funds of the University will permit.
The Board then took up the report of the Committee on
the Organization of the University and adopted the first,
second, third, fourth, fifth, and  sixth  resolutions.   (See
pages 42 and 43.)
It was further Resolved, That the Committee on Branches be
authorized in their discretion, to discontinue any Branch of the
University now or hereafter to be established, and to transfer the
Principal of any Branch so discontinued to any other Branch established or to be established by the Board.
Adjourned to Monday the I6th of April next.
SECOND      APRIL MEETING, 1838.
Monday, April i6th, 1838.
The Board met pursuant to adjournment.
Present:   Governor    Mason, Chancellor Farnsworth,.
Dr. Pitcher, and Messrs. Adam, Kearsley, and Schoolcraft.
Chancellor Farnsworth, from     the Committee to which
was referred the Act to authorize a loan of a certain sum
of money to the University of Michigan, made a report
accompanied by certain resolutions, which were severally
adopted:
Tlhe Committee to whom was referred the Act in relation to
a loan for the University report that they have conferred with the
Secretary of the Board in regard to 'the form of the bond and the
certificates of the stock, which forms are prepared by him and will
be submitted to the Board for their approval. The committee are
of opinion that the University will require the following sums at
the periods severally mentioned. Fifteen thousand dollars for the
year 1838, Thirty-five thousand dollars for I839 and Fifty thousand
dollars for I840. If the whole loan can be contracted on terms as
favourable as any other, payable at those periods and the stock not
to be issued until payments are required, the Committee would




48    SECOND APRIL MEETING, 1838


recommend that course. If not the Committee would recommend
that the agent whom the Board shall appoint shall have discretionary power to negotiate the whole loan, and it will then be incumbent upon the Board to place the proceeds in safe institutions which
will pay the interest, save the Board from  loss, and give ample
security for the payment of the principal at the periods when the
same may be required. Your Committee would further suggest the
propriety of first offering the loan here as, in the opinion of your
Committee, this will be a favorite stock. It is here well known that
the property pledged in addition to the faith of the State for its
redemption is worth nearly or quite a million of dollars. Its amount
is not so great as to place the entire loan beyond the reach of our
own institutions or capitalists. The periods at which the money
will be required will be no additional inducement. Should not offers
be made here of a satisfactory character, it can be ascertained
through the President of;the Board, or some other agent in the
eastern cities, what can be obtained for the stock and a choice had
between the markets at home and abroad. This fund is placed under
the care and control of this Board, and, like other trustees, it will
be held responsible for its safe and prudent administration. Said
loan your Committee are of opinion should be reimbursable after
twenty years in ten equal installments. Your Committee recommend
the adoption of the accompanying resolutions.
Resolved, That Jonathan Kearsley be and he is hereby appointed
the agent of this Board with full power and authority to negotiate
the said certificates of stock of One hundred thousand dollars,
authorized by the act of the Legislature of this State, entitled
"An Act to authorize a loan of a certain sum of money to the
University of Michigan,' approved. April 6th, 1838.
Resolved, Tlhat said Jonathan Kearsley, agent as aforesaid,
before said stock is delivered to him shall enter into a bond to the
Regents of the University of Michigan and their successors, in the
sum of One hundred and fifty thousand dollars, with two sureties
to be approved by the Auditing Committee of this Board with condition for the faithful performance of said trust, and to account to
this Board for the proceeds of said negotiation.
Resolved, That the certificates of the stock authorized to be
issued by the act of the Legislature of Michigan, approved April
f6th, I838, entitled "An Act to authorize a loan of a certain sum of
money to the University of Michigan,' be transferred, assigned and
delivered to said Jonathan Kearsley (the security as aforesaid' being
first given) and that said transfer and assignment be executed by
the President of this Board, countersigned by the Secretary under
the seal of this corporation, and said President and Secretary are
hereby authorized and empowered to execute assignment and transfer according to the provisions of the foregoing resolution.
Resolved, That until a permanent Seal is provided, a paper
Seal impressed with a common stamp be adopted and used as the
Seal of this corporation.
Resolved, That the said agent slhall not sell the said stock here
or elsewhere in the United States unless upon such terma and
conditions as shall insure that it shall not be re-offered for sale
in the United States.
Adjourned to the 15th May next.

M/r. Kearsley, the agent to negotiate the loan of $Ioo,000,
made the following report, which was laid on the table:
The agent appointed by a resolution of the Board of Regents,
dated April i6th, 1838, for negotiating the loan of $Ioo,ooo under
the Act of the Legislature of Michigan entitled, "An Act to loan
a certain sum of money to the University of Michigan," reports
that he has attended to that duty by negotiating said loan with the
Bank of Michigan, in the City of Detroit, and has transferred the
bonds of the State for $Ioo,ooo to said Bank, subject to the following stipulations. The Bank has covenanted to pay on demand,
$6,ooo as a premium upon said stock, to pay $I5,000 of the principal
on thie fifteenth day of June, 1839, or so much thereof before that
time as shall be appropriated and expended by the Board of Regents,
the further sum of $35,000 on the fifteenth day of June, 1840, with
the like covenant to meet appropriations of the Board prior to that
time and after the fifteenth day of June, I839, and tlhe last installment of $50,000 to be paid. on the fifteenth day of June, I84I, with
the same proviso as!in the preceding, to meet appropriations. The
Bank covenant further to keep an interest account with the Board
of Regents and to pay semi-annually, seven per cent per annum
interest upon all unpaid balance. The obligation, given by the
Bank of Michigan to the Board of Regents and approved by the
Auditing Committee, 'is herewith submitted and will more fully
explain the negotiation.
It may be proper to add that previous to tihe appointment of
your agent, their Secretary, by direction of the Board, had, made
application to the several banks in the city of Detroit for proposals
of terms upon which they would take this loan and that the Banks
had severally declined to submit propositions to the Board. It was
therefore inferred by the Board. that the loan could not be effected
in this State, and a verbal understanding was had between Governor
-Mason and your agent that the Governor would make the necessary
enquiries as to the terms upon which the loan could be effected
in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, and communicate the
result to your agent before the tenth day of May then next ensuing.
Your agent therefore made no attempt to dispose of this stock
until that period has elapsed, except *to receive such other offers
as might be presented. Having no communication from the Governor and therefore taking it for granted that this stock could not be
advantageously sold in our Atlantic Cities, your agent about the
20th to the 25th of May last entered into the before mentioned
agreement with the Bank of Michigan, the only corporation or
individual who had submitted any proposition. In conclusion, personal considerations induce your agent to remark that the terms
upon which this loan has been negotiated are believed to be more
advantageous than other proposals made subsequently, for it is
probably known to members of this Board that proposals were
made for the purchase of this stock sometime after the negotiation
with the Bank of Michigan had been consummated. And it may
therefore be proper to state that on the i5th June last, two or three
offers were communicated to your agent at Io per cent premium,
and again on the 22nd of the same month a further proposition
offering I2 /2 per cent premium. But let it be observed that in
all these proposals no intimation was made of an interest account,,.




52


SECOND JULY 1MEETING, 1838


and inquiry as to one of them slhows that no allowance of interest
upon unpaid installments was intended. The Bank of Michigan
at an interview with its Officers originally upon this subject had
offered twelve per cent premium, which was declined. An arinmetical calculation satisfied your agent that the terms upon which
the loan has been negotiated would equal 22-450/I0OO per cent premium without interest account, and this, too, exclusive of interest
upon the $6,ooo premium obtained and which is now drawing interest.
Most respectfully,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.               J. KrARSLrY, Agent.
July IIth, 1838.
The propriety of altering the LUniversity Grouncts at
Ann Arbor was referred to a Committee consisting of Lieutenant-Governor Mundy, Chief Justice Fletcher, and Dr.
Denton.
IMr. Kearsley laid on the table the following resolutions:
Resolved, That the tuition fees after the present term  be
$25 per azutnut in the City of Detroit and Monroe, and $I5 per
an,11num at all other Branches.
Resolved, That the Laws for the Government of Branches
contemplated, in the opinion of the Regents, a series of uninterrupted studies and recitations during the week; and, therefore,
that any suspension of the usual and regular recitations on Wednesday afternoon is clearly in violation of said rules.
Resolved, That the Committee on Branches be authorized to
organize such Classical Schools, subject to the same confirmation
as is required for the establishment of Branches, as they may deem
expedient from time to time for the purpose of instruction in the
Latin and Greek Languages exclusively, and that the said Committee
have authority to employ the Tutors necessary to that object.
Resolved, That the Auditing Committee be and hereby are
authorized and required to audit and allow the account of any
member of the Board of Regents for his travelling expenses, with
one dollar and fifty cents per day as an equivalent for his necessary
contingencies, for every day spent in going to, attending upon, and
returning from any meeting of said Board, and the same allowance to any member of a Committee who may be necessarily called
from the place of his residence in the discharge of his duties on
said Committee.

Branches at Detroit at such time as the Committee on Branches
may designate.
(n motion of M\Ir. Kearsley a Committee of Miessrs.
Kearsley and Wilkins and Dr. Pitcher was apointed to report a summary of the Proceedings of the Board of Reg'ents since its organization.
The following report from the Committee on Branches
was adopted and presented to the Governor to be transmitted to the Legislature.
The Committee on Branches respectfully report,
That since your Committee presented to the Board of Regents,
in November, I837, the result of their efforts to carry into effect
the resolutions adopted in June of that year, there has been opened
at Monroe a Branch of the University, under the direction of the
Rev. Samuel Centre; one at Kalamazoo, under the care of Mr. G.
B. Eastman; one at Detroit, under the supervision of the Rev. C.
W. Fitch; and one at Niles, the Principal of which,is the Rev.
Joseph Whiting.
The Monroe Branch was opened for the reception of pupils
Feb. 19, 1838. At this Branch -there are two teachers engaged. Mr.
Centre, the Principal, is receiving a salary of $I,300 per antlnum, and
his assistant, Mr. Hough, $600 per an mi.n. The latter gentleman
has been in the employment of the Board since the Ioth of May,
1838. Number of pupils at last report, 63. The Branch at Kalamazoo went into operation May ist, I838. Mr. Eastman, the Principal
of this Branch, receives $1,200 a year. Number of pupils at last
report, 22. At Detroit the building.designated for the use of the
Branch was not ready for Mr. Fitch till the 20th June last, when
the Institution was opened under the charge of two teachers, the
Rev. Mr. Fitch and Mr. Bissell, the former to receive $i,500 a
year for his services, and the latter, $800. Mr. Bissell has since
resigned his place iwhich is now occupied by Mr. Andrew Harvie.
Number of pupils at last report, 40.
Owing to the sickness prevalent in the interior of the State,
Mr. Whiting, the Principal of the Branch at Niles, could not commence his labours at that place till the 5th Nov., 1838. His compensation is the same as that allowed to Mr. Eastman. Number
o.f pupils, 9.
Whole number of Branches in operation = 5.
Whole number of Teachers employed in Branches = 7.
Number of pupils in the Branches last term = I6I.
The disposition' which exists more especially at the points where
Branches are established to convert these Institutions into Common
Schools is a source of embarrassment to our Branches and has
convinced your Committee that these Institutions are in great danger of degeneration, when organized in advance or even coetaneously with Common Schools. The want of proper boarding houses
in the vicinity of our Branches has hitherto tended very much to
abridge their usefulness and check their financial prosperity. At
Pontiac some efforts are now making to remedy this evil. Your

MNr. Wilkins made the following report, accompanied by
a resolution:
The Committee appointed by a Resolution of the Board to in-,quire into the legality of appropriations made out of the fund derived from the sale of University Lands for the support of University Branches,
Report, That they have given the subject that consideration
which its importance merits. The lands mentioned in the resolution compose the munificent grant made by the Congress of the
United States in the Act of the 20th May, 1836, entitled, "An Act
concerning a Seminary of Learning in the Territory of Michigan.'
for the use and support of a University within the said Territory
and for nto other use or purpose whatsoever.
In enquiring into the legality of appropriations made out of
the said Fund for the support of University Branches, two questions present themselves:
First. In what sense 'is the word University used in the Act of
Congress? and,
Second. To what object and extent was the donation designed?
First. In the Act of Congress the Secretary of the Treasury
was authorized to set apart and reserve from sale out of any of
the Public Lands within the Territory-of Michigan to which the




SECOND JANUARY MEETING, 1839


65


Indian title was extinguished, a quantity of land not exceeding two
entire Townships for the use and support of a University within
the Territory aforesaid and for no other use or purpose whatsoever, to be located in tracts of land corresponding with any of the
legal divisions into which the Public Lands are authorized to be
surveyed, not less than one Section, one of which said Townships
so set apart and reserved from sale shall be in lieu of an entire
Township of land, directed to be located in said Territory for the
use of a Seminary of Learlilg therein by an Act of Congress entitled, "An Act making provisions for the disposal of the Public
Lands, in the Indian Territory, and for other purposes," approved
March 20, I804. By the provisions of this Act this liberal fund is
specifically dedicated to the Use and Support of a University. What
then is a University? It will be perceived that the language of the
original donation is changed in the body of the Act, although retained in the title. A Seminary of Learning may in some respects
be synonymous with a University, but there are many Seminaries
of Learning that could not properly be termed Universities. For
instance, a Female Academy or an Elementary School is a Seminary
of Learning, but not a University; for all the Sciences are not
taught in such Institutions; they might be roots or branches to
such an establishment; they might be parts of the Body, but not
the Body itself. Webster, in his Dictionary, defines a University to be "An assemblage of colleges, established in any place with
Professors for instructing students in the Sciences, and other
branches of learning, and where degrees are conferred."  It is
therefore an assemblage of Colleges and not one College and comprehends instruction in all Sciences and Arts. It is not necessary
to meet the force of this definition that all these Colleges must
necessarily be located in one village. It is sufficient if the main
and principal College where the degrees are *to be conferred has
-the superintending government of the whole. This is frequently
the case, and it must be supposed that Congress had this in view
in changing the Language of the Gift. In' I804 when it was first
made, the land was comparatively of little value and scarcely suffi-,cient -to justify any reasonable anticipations of its meeting the exigencies of even a Seminary of Learning. The Country was then a
wilderness, and the most sanguine could not have anticipated the
wonderful increase of population which twenty years was destined
to make in the West. But in I826 three new States had sprung
-up like magic from this very wilderness, and rapid settlements and
improvements iwere everywhere meeting the view and enhancing the
value of the Public Lands. That which was designated for a Seminary could well be extended to a University: that which was
-thought could' nourish only one College was now deemed amply sufficient for the use and support of an assemblage of Colleges within
-the designated Territory. The spirit of this congressional donation
is not to be confined to the mere erection of a splendid edifice for
the purpose of displaying to the eye of taste this or that order of
architecture or with the ignoble view of ornamenting and increasing the values of this or that village, within the Territory of Michigan; it was not intended "for the use and support" of a University
of Brickbats and Mortar; but unquestionably designed to promote
Learning and for the cheap education of the People.
The evil had long been, perceived by the people of the United.States that College education, maintained by the Public Funds of




66   SECOND JANUARY MEETING, I839


the different States, was principally confined to the children of tihe
wealthy who could afford to send and maintain their sons at such
Institutions. But all alike had not the same advantage, and many
a stupid heir of Fortune received the parchment title of an A.B.
or an AS.S.., when impoverished genius and talent had to struggle
on without this Public facility. Congress, in this Act, determined
differently in the appropriation of this portion of the Public domain for the use of a University designed for the education or the
People of the Peninsula of Michigan. They made the appropriation for the University of Michigan and not for a single Seminary
of Learning. Now a University is general in its signification; it
not only comprehends instruction in all Arts and Sciences, but in
every branch of learning from the preparatory school where a-b-cdarian principles are taught, to that standard of scientific perfection when it is deemed fit and proper to confer upon him the final
degree.
But secondly. To what object and extent was the donation
designed?
The language of the Act is, "for the use and support of a University and for no other use or purpose whatsoever."  Your Committee have already explained the sense in which they conceived
Congress used the word "University." It now becomes essential to
consider the prohibitory phrase: "for no other use or purpose whatsoever." Your Committee believe that Congress intended' this fund
to the purpose of education and inhibit its being used for any other
purpose: such as its ever being devoted to meet the expenses of the
Territorial or future State Government, or even being used in
works of Internal Improvement, or any other object of general
State concernment, than the sacred purpose of General Instruction.
In other words it was a munificent endowment of a University in
Michigan by 'the Government of the United States. The consecration of the Fund is not, in the opinion of your Committee, expresslyv limited to expenditures upon a splendid building, or the support
of Professors who shall be called to instruct the youth there. The
language of the Law is more extensive. The spirit of the times in
which it was enacted was more liberal. There were Universities
then,in existence elsewhere, both in Europe and America, and' it
was well understood 'that the college buildings did not compose the
University. The German Universities had no specific buildings
whatsoever. The University of Dublin had its colleges other than
in the city or its immediate vicinage. The University of Virginia
had throughout the State its preparatory schools, and the University of' Canonsburgh and Pennsylvania had its Law and Medical
Departments at distant places from the Mother Institution. But
all were included within the Maternal protection and comprehended
in the meaning of "the University." Your Committee are of opinion that the spirit and meaning of the Act of Congress not only
dedicates the University Fund to the erection of the Main Buildinoat some designated place in M'ichigan and the support of instruction
there, but also for the use and support of such necessary Branches
as may by the competent authority be deemed essential as preparatory schools to supply from time to time with students qualified to
pursue with advantage the higher branches of Science. The main
edifice would be but a standing Monument of Folly and Wasteful
extravagance if unoccupied with students, and the various Professorships but sinecure posts of honor.




SECOND JANUAiRY MEETING, 1839                    67
It is surely not within the bounds of reasonable anticipation
that the Halls will be filled with students from other States. Although Michigan does present a beautiful and liberal; system calculated to entice students from other States, yet it would be unwise,
unpatriotic, to depend altogether upon that source. Other States
have their own state Institutions and will in a great measure receive the encouragement of their own citizens: and this munificent
grant of Congress to Michigan should not be so construed as to
operate to the measurable exclusion of the youth of Michigan. The
Branches, then, form a very essential part of the University. They
are the arms ~which feed the mouth of the Body, the roots which
nourish the trunk of the tree. Your Committee are strengthened
in this construction of the Act of Congress by the subsequent legislation of that Body, which if not allowed to give meaning to the
previous legislative language, yet at least must be considered as
enlarging the terms of the grant. The Congress of the United
States is the donor. The State of Michigan is the recipient of the
gift. There are no other parties to the transaction. If the donee
violate the terms of the Contract, the subject matter might revert;
but it is perfectly competent for the Donor, or original proprietor
with the consent of the donee to enlarge the objects of his benevolence.
The grant was made by an Act of Congress on the 20th May,
I826. On the 15th of June, 1836, ten years afterwards, Congress
passed the act providing for the admission of Michigan into mne
Union and in the 2nd Section enacts, "that the constitution and
State Government which the People of Michigan have formed for
themselves, be and the same is hereby accepted and ratified and
confirmed." In the 5th Section of the Ioth Article of that Constitution, the Legislature of the State is empowered to take the necessary measures for the disposition and improvement of the Lands
granted by the United States to this State for the support of a
University; and the article further declares that the Funds accruing from the rents or sale of such lands shall be and remain a permanent fund for the support of said University with such Branches
as the Public convenience may demand. This constitutional provision of this State in relation to this fund, the subject matter of the
specific grant mentioned in the Act of 1826, was affirmeci, ratified,
and accepted by Congress, the original proprietor and Donor. If,
therefore, the prohibitory words of the Act of I826 limiting the
grant for the use and purpose of an University and no other use
or purpose whatsoever, must receive the strict construction o con —
firming all appropriations out of this Fund to the Main Building
at Ann Arbor, your Committee are of opinion that the ratification
by Congress of the Constitution of the State enlarges the terms of
the donation and justifies the use of the funds for the maintenance
and support of Branches. In pursuance of the power thus vested
in them by the Constitution of the State, and thus confirming and
recognized by the Congress of the United States, the Legislature has
assumed the control of the subject matter and enacted the Law organizing the Board of Regents of the University and directing the
establishment of its Branches. In Section Io of Chapter 2nd of
Title ii of the Revised Code, it is made the duty of the Board of
Regents together with the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
establish Branches of the University in the different parts of the
State and providing that there shall not be more than one in any

one organized County of the State. This confers ample power upon
the Board of Regents in connection with the Superintendent of
Public Instruction to appropriate the funds dedicated by the Act of
Congress to the support of the University to the use and support
of the Branches of that University. Your Committee conceive such
appropriations already made or hereafter to be made, as perfectly
legal; and offer the following Resolution:
Resolved, That they be discharged from the further consideration of the subject.
On motion the Resoltuion was adopted, and the Report
laid on the table.
lMr. Kearsley laid on the table the following resolution:

Regents of the University for the University buildings, the material of which they are about to be composed, and the estimated cost
of erection. Also, whether the loan of One Hundred Thousand
dollars, on the credit of the State authorized by an Act of the Legislature has been effected, in what manner and on what terms, if
effected; and what disposition has been made of said loan, with

MARCH l.rIEETING, 1839


The Committee appointed at the last meeting of the
Board of Regents, report, that they have this day presented
to the Senate, which has been referred to the Committee on
State affairs, a remonstrance.against the passage of the Bill
for the relief of settlers upon the University Lands, of
which the following is a copy:
To the Honorable, the Senate of the State of liichigaln:
The Undersigned a Committee appointed by a resolution of the
Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, do most earnestly, yet respectfully, remonstrate against the passage by your honorable body of the Bill No. 4I of the House of Representatives, for
the following and other reasons and considerations:
The Act of Congress of May 20th, 1826, (6th Vol. Laws of
the U. S., page 494,) authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to
reserve from sale, two townships or seventy-two sections of the
public lands for the purposes of a University in the Territory of
Michigan. This munificent grant to the then Territory was certainly made in good faith for the purpose therein expressed, and
with no other design and for no other purpose.
By the Act of Congress for the admission of the State of Michigan into the Union, those lands were placed at the disposal of 'the
-State for the same puropses and under the same restrictions.
The Constitution of Michigan, Art. Io, Sec. 5, provides that.the Legislature shall take measures for the protection, improvement,,or other disposition of such lands as may have been or may hereafter be reserved or granted by the United States for the support
of a University, etc., and, that it shall be the duty of 'the Legislature, as soon as may be, to provide effectual means for the improvement and permanent security of the funds of said University."
Upon the constitutionality of the Bill No. 4I of the House of
Representatives, the undersigned would, 'in this place, only ask the
Senate, whether the disposition of the lands in'question at $I.25 per
acre, or even any part thereof, is "providing effectual means for
the improvement and permanent security of the funds of said University."
Again. Fourteen sections of land upon the Niles Reservation
were received from  the United States as equal to 8,960 acres,
amounting, at $1.25 per acre, to $11,200, yet these sections, being
fractional, contain only 7,964.I5 acres, equal at same price to $9,955.I9, the Bill No. 41 thus proposing to sell at-a loss, even according to this estimate, of $1,244.81. In like manner, nine sections on
the Nottawassippi Reserve, would contain in full sections, 5,760
acres equal to $7,200, yet contain only 5,706.98 acres, amounting to
$7,133.72.
The lands in the Grand River District present even a still
stronger'case than the foregoing. There I,600 acres have been taken
for the University in lieu of 5,120 acres. Some of those lands are
alleged to be worth $5.00 per acre. The water power is also very
valuable. But the land alone is 3,520 less than eight full sections,
for which they were located. Consequently, estimating both at $1.25
per acre, the University would lose $4,400. In other words, the
money received from actual settlers would relocate 4,528.87 acres
less than the quantity for which the present locations were taken,




74


MARCH MEETING, 1839


the loss being $5,66I.09. Even under this view of the subject, the
Board of Regents entertain the opinion that the Senate cannot concur in the passage of this Bill, and thus sanction the inference that
the constitutional requirements have been observed, and that the
Legislature have by this Act "provided effectual means for the improvement and' permanent security of the funds of said University."
But the Board of Regents would respectfully call the attention
of the Senate to another view of this subject, in connection with
the aforesaid constitutional requirements.
The affidavit of C. C. Douglass, who located this land upon the
Niles and Nottawassippi Reservations, accompanies this remonstrance, and exhibits 'their average at about $20 per acre. From
this, it will appear, then, that the fund of the University arising
from lands on these two reservations alone will be decreased $256,333.69. This estimate, it will be observed, is made according to
what the lands were worth in I836; the increased value of the lands
since that time, although known and admitted to be very great, is
not taken into consideration.
But another and perhaps a stronger objection to the passage
of this Bill arises from the effects of the Act of the Legislature
approved April 6th, 1838, entitled, "An Act to authorize a loan of a
certain sum of money to the University of Michigan." Section 5th
of that Act provides, "That the Board of Regents shall make provision for the punctual redemption of said Stock (after twenty
years) for the punctual payment of the interest, etc., and all the
disposable income from the University funds shall be and is hereby pledged' for the payment of the said interest and the redemption
of the Stock."
Under the foregoing Act, the Regents have, in good faith, negotiated the loan of $Ioo,ooo, implicity relying that the Legislature
would never interfere with the University Fund, as it then stood,
namely, that all the lands would be held at a minimum price of $20.
per acre, and that the further sales (which can be readily made at
that rate) with those already effected, would enable the Regents to
'meet the redemption of said stock and interest punctually, and also
provide for the payment of Professors in the University, and the
Principals and Tutors of the Branches.
The Board of Regents 'are therefore reluctantly compelled to
adopt the conclusion, that, should this Bill become a law, it will
be necessary to suspend immediately, the operation of iall the
Branches of the University now organized, and also all contracts
now entered into for the erection of professors' buildings, and all
other expenditures whatever. The proceeds of the lands now disposed of, it is believed, will be no more than sufficient (making the
necessary and reasonable allowance for the lands which may revert
for non-fulfillment of contracts) to meet, beyond all question, the
payment of the principal and interest of the loan, and such contracts as are already made, and which must be fulfilled. Superadded to the foregoing considerations, the undersigned would very
respectfully further suggest the enquiry whether the Legislature of
the State has such power over the subject matter as to direct an
absolute sale or transfer of the title 'of these lands without the consent of the Corporation of the University of Michigan! and if the
State Legislature has such power, can the funds arising from such:sale or transfer be reinvested in the purchase of other lands?




MARCH MEETING, 1839                       75
The right of the State Legislature to direct the disposition ot
these lands, other than to the use of a University, if such right
exists, must be derived from the United States. By what Act of
Congress is such right conferred?
The University of Michigan, as at present constituted, is a corporation created by State legislation. But prior to the formation of
the Constitution of the State, the Congress of the United States,
by an Act approved the 20th of May, I826, "set apart and reserved
from sale, out of the public lands within the Territory of Michigan,
-two entire townships for the use and support of a University within the Territory aforesaid."
The consideraton, then, may be of some weight, in the careful
and just deliberation of the Senate, whether!the whole right, title,
and interest of the United States to the quantity of land mentioned,
was not, by the passage of the Act of 1826, completely parted with
by;the original proprietor and vested; in the Corporation of the University of Michigan. Briefly to illustrate the force of this suggestion: The undersigned would inquire who was the munificent donor? The government of the United States. What was the gift?
The land expressed in the grant. And who was the donee? The
University, and' not the State of Michigan. Has the land thus specified as to its quantity and object, in the Act of Congress, been
legally located and confirmed to the University? The answer to
this inquiry is to be found in the archives of the State, and is recognized in the first section of the Bill under the consideration of the,Senate.
The undersigned, in behalf of the corporation they represent,
forbear the intimation of any opinion, as to the vested right of the
University, designing only to place before the Senate those views
which have occurred to them, in the cursory consideration they have
been able to give the subject; and being confident that the more enlightened and extended examination which the Senate will give to
the Bill of the House of Representatives, in all its bearings, will.assuredly elicit justice to all parties concerned.
If "the Settlers on the University lands" are entitled by the
existing laws of the country to the right of property in the lands in
question, the undersigned cannot, nor would not, even for the hallowed purposes of educating the children of the people of Michigan,
1do aught to disturb the enjoyment of said, or interpose an objection.
But believing that the rights of the corporation they represent are,clearly defined, and legitimately derived from the only source of
title, they would deem themselves recreant to every sense of duty
to the University and to the people of Michigan, did they not most
solemnly, but most respectfully protest against an invasion of the
rights of the corporation as is assuredly calculated to render it
useless and defeat the object designed by the wise and liberal framers of the Act of 1836.
All of which is most respectfully submitted to the patient and
impartial consideration of the Senate of the State of Michigan.

Kearsley.
Mr. Kearsley, from the C(ommittee to which was referred
the application of Mr. Fitch, Principal of the    Detroit
Branch, for an increase of salary, and a letter from the
Visitors of the said Branch on the same sublject, made the
following report:
The Committee to whom was referred the application of Professor Fitch for an increase of salary, respectfully, report, That
the deliberate consideration  of this subject has given your
Committee much embarrassment. Justly estimating the value of
the services of Professor Fitch, all would deplore their loss. The
Regents have established the salaries of the Principals of the
Branches, equitably graduated, in their judgment, to the unavoidable
*expenditure incident to their several locations.




78


FIFTH MARCH M/EETING, 1839


In tendering to Professor Fitch his present appointment it is
admitted that the Regents acted with good faith and unreserved
frankness., The salary, terms of payment, and all other needed
information of which the Regents were advised, were unreservedly
communicated. In the judgment of your Committee, these salaries
cannot, in good faith, be increased except upon the general principle
that all are too low. The exception in favor of any one cannot
be entertained without affording just ground upon precedent for a
correspondent increase to all other Principals of Branches. If,.
then, justice to Professor Fitch demands an increase of his salary,
your Committee are of opinion that a corresponding or proportional inc'rease should be extended to all other Principals. It is
alleged that the case of Mr. Fitch is sui generis, that the expense of
living in Detroit differs from all other places where Branches are
or may be organized. It may be so; yet this remains to be shown,
and the Regents should assume nothing as granted until the same
has been demonstrated. An application from a Principal in the
interior may present hereafter, if we admit the one now before us,
as strong a case, all the circumstances considered, as that now in
review. That others have not asked an increase of salary, is not
even prinma facie evidence that they do not need it. It only proves,.
what it is believed the Regents intended, that the Principals of the
several Branches consider the Regents as the exclusive arbiters upon
the question of salaries, and that they will unsolicited do that which
to them may seem equitable and just in the premises.
If the existing salaries are insufficient or unequal, it becomes
the duty of the Regents to increase and equalize. In forming an
opinion upon this subject, another consideration has influenced your
Committee.
A short time since a request was laid before the Regents by
Mr. Fitch that an additional Tutor be employed for the Detroit
Branch. It was alleged:that the number of students, and especially
the number of classes, had so increased at the commencement of the'
present term, that full instruction could not be given by the Principal and one Tutor.
The Committee on Branches, to whom this subject was referred,.
reported in favor of the temporary employment of a second Tutor.
The Regents sanctioned the measure and the same was carried
into effect.
The following is the result in a pecuniary point of view:
To sustain the Branch at Pontiac  one Principal         $I,200
"     "    "    (" "Kalamazoo  "     "             1,200.... "     ".    Niles     i"      "             I,20o
<" t       t.. i Tecumseh  "  "              1,300'."        ". "  ". Monroe   ".       and I Tutor i,9oo. " it          "    " Detroit     ".      and 2 Tutors 2,800
The Regents will perceive that the expenditure upon the
Detroit Branch exceeds by the sum of $900 that upon any otherBranch. Can they in justice to other counties that are now applicants for Branches and at the risk of merited public censure, yet:
further extend the appropriation to the County of Wayne? Your
Committee, although residents of Detroit, and as they believe, alive
to every interest for her prosperity, cannot recommend it.
The just estimate and' deference entertained by your Committee in common with 'the entire Board for the personal, moral,
and professional worth of the Principal of the Detroit Branch, has.

The Committee would respectfully recommend that in this
and all other similar cases, as individuals, but not as a Board,

resolutions:
WHEREAS, The Legislature of the State of Michigan have passed
a Bill directing the Superintendent of Public Instruction to sell

University designed for the erection of appropriate Buildings and
the support of Professors and teachers.

where no reasonable prospect can be entertained of meeting the
demand for materials and service.

Dec. next and settle and adjust the accounts of the teachers employed.

82     SECOND APRIL MEETING, 1839


Be it Resolved, That a Committee be appointed to prepare a
Protest against the approval of the Bill and present the same to
the Executive of the State.
Mlessrs. WVilkins, Kearsley, and Pitcher were appointed
the Committee contemplated by the foregoing resolution.
Lieutenant-Governor Munlldy submitted the following report and resolution:
The Committee on Building to whom was assigned by a resolution of the Board the duty of procuring a plan for the University
Buildings, in relation to that matter report:
That soon after the appointment on the eleventh day of April,
I838, being strongly advised, by several gentlemen of high standing,
of the merits and talents as an architect, of Ammi B. Young, of
Vermont, they through their Chairman addressed a letter to him
inviting him to make a visit to Michigan and proposing to employ
him as the Architect of the University. Mr. Young in answer to
their letter declined the proposition made to him, having as he
informed the Committee, been appointed to superintend the erection
of the Custom House at Boston, but proffered to the Committee
his professional services in making a plan of the buildings.
The Committee, having consulted with other members of the
Board, as well as with gentlemen well acquainted with Mr. Young,
on the I5th May last wrote to Mr. Young and giving him particular
description of the grounds and. map of the village of Ann Arbor,
employed him to furnish a design, urging him to give to it his
early attention and promising him a proper compensation.
The Committee were told by Mr. Young in answer that he
would commence the designs immediately, and devote to them all
his spare time. The Chairman of the Committee on the i8th of
July last again wrote to Mr. Young from New Jersey sending him
the views of the Committee upon some suggestions made by him
in his last letter, soon after which the Chairman of the Committee
received a letter from Judge Fletcher dated the g9th July, saying
that the Board of Regents had the day before determined to proceed
with all convenient dispatch with the University Buildings, and that
he was requested to write to him desiring him to see Mr. Davis.
the Architect from whom the Regents expected a plan, and to
urge upon him the necessity of making a visit to Michigan as early
as possible to view the site and determine upon the location and
arrangement of the buildings and other improvements. Upon receiving this letter the Chairman called upon Mr. Davis, stated to
him that Mr. Young had been employed as Architect, informed him
of the Judge's communication, and sought from him an explanation
of his engagement with the Board of Regents; and learned from
him that a correspondence had existed between himself and one
of the members of the Board, to whom anterior to the appointment of this Committee had been given authority to procure a
plan for the buildings. Mr. Davis, also informed him that Mr.
Young in a letter to him had expressed a willingness to relinquish
to him the production of the plan. From these explanations the
Chairman of the Committee was led to suppose that in his absence
the Board had resolved to look to Mr. Davis alone for a design,
and consequently, according to the instructions in the Judge's




THIRD     APRIL     MEl.EETTING, 1839


83


letter invited Mr. Davis to visit the Board of Regents. After the
Board had agreed upon the plan submitted to them by Mr. Davis
and after the return home of the Chairman, having understood
that no further correspondence had passed between the Committee
and Mr. Young and fearing that Mr. Young might possibly feet
himself ill treated by the Committee, although from the length of
time since he had been heard from, and the suggestion or Mr.
Davis, the probability that he had from his other engagements
relinquished in behalf of Mr. Davis this employment seemed strong,
the Chairman of the Committee wrote to Mr. Young stating the
circumstances under which Mr. Davis had been employed, stating to
him what Mr. Davis had said about his relinquishment to him of
this employment, and informing him that the Board had adopted a
plan furnished by Mr. Davis. In reply to this Mr. Young informed
the Committee that he had expended much time and study upon
the designs for the University Buildings, that he had completed: the
most difficult part, the designing, that nothing remained to be done
but the mechanical part, and forwarded to them his bill for three
hundred dollars, requesting its early payment.
The Committee have thought it due to themselves to make
this statement of their proceedings, and although the interests of
the University may have warranted all the energy and zeal and
dispatch manifested by the Board on its adoption of a plan and
preparation for building, yet they 'cannot but regret that any circumstances should have deprived the Board of the benefit of the
study and labour of Mr. Young in whose professional knowledge
and fairness of character the Committee have undiminished confidence.
Believing that Mr. Young is entitled to a just compensation for
his services, the Committee report the following resolution:
Resolved, That the President of the Board issue a warrant in
favor of Ammi B. Young or bearer for................ dollars for
professional services as architect and that the Building Committee
be authorized to place the proceeds of said warrant in the Bank
of Michigan to the order of Mr. Young.
Dated Nov. 1838.                 E. MUNDY, Chairman.
(n motion of Mr. Wilkins, the said report and resolution was laid on the table.
MTr. Kearsley submitted the following resolution, which
was adopted:
Resolved, That the President of the Board of Regents shall
draw no warrant upon the Bank of Michigan except such as may
become necessary upon the refusal of the Treasurer to pay drafts.
And then the Board adjourned to the 2oth instant.
THIRD APRIL MEETING, 1839.
Detroit, April 20th, 1839.
The Board met pursuant to adjournment.
Present: Chancellor Farnsworth, Justice Whipple, Dr.
Pitcher and Messrs. Schoolcraft, Wilkins, Lyon, and Kearslev.

Sir:
Enclosed, the undersigned have the honor to transmit a copy
of a Resolution adopted by the Board of Regents of the University
of Michigan.
In pursuance of the duty enjoined, the undersigned respectfully request that Patents for the Lands heretofore confirmed to
the University of Michigan by the Secretary of the Treasury on
the 2ISt day of June, 1838, as appears by a letter from the Hon.
Jas. Whitcomb, of the 23rd of June last, may be forwarded as soon
as possible to the undersigned.
Yours respectfully,
HON. LEvI WOODBURY,                Ross WILKINS,

Committee.
General Land Office,
April loth, I839.
Gentlemen:
Your letter of the 2Ist ultimo addressed to the Secretary of
the Treasury has been referred to this Office.
In reply thereto I have the honor to advise you that selections
have been made and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury
of a quantity of land for the University of Michigan equal to
712 sections including the river lots No. I72 near Perrysburgh,
which that Institution was authorized to exchange for other lands
by the act of I3th Jan., I830, and leaving only one half section to
complete the quantity of 72 sections originally directed to be
reserved by the Act of 20th May, I826,'and granted to the State by
that of 23d June, I836.
I beg leave respectfully to suggest, with the view of closing the
transaction and embracing all the lands in one patent, that you
request the proper authorities to report to this Office the selection
of an additional half section, on the approval of which a patent
will issue to the State with the least practicable delay.
Messrs. WILKINS,              I am very respectfully,
J. KEARSLEY, and Z.              Your obt. Servt.
PITCHE;R, Committee          (Signed) JAS. WHIrcoMrB,

THIRD APRIL MEETING, 1839


85


Mr. Wilkins-from the Committee appointed to present a
protest to the Executive against the approval of a Bill for
the relief of certain settlers, made a report, stating in substance that the Committee had discharged the duty imposed
upon them.
On motion, ordered that said protest, with the veto of
the Executive, bIe entered upon the Journal.
To his Excellency, Stevens T. Mlason,
Governor of the State of Mlichigan.
The undersigned, a Committee of the Board of Regents of
the University of Michigan, specially appointed for that purpose,
do hereby most solemnly Protest against the approval by the Governor of the Bill which has recently passed the Legislature, entitled,
"An Act for the relief of certain Settlers on University and State
Lands."
The Regents of the University of Michigan believe the provisions of this Bill to be inexpedient, unjust, illegal, and unconstitutional.
The inexpediency is inferred, because full justice might be
done to the settler by paying him a liberal compensation tor his
labour in the improvement of these lands out of the interest accruing from the University fund, and still the fund itself would be
retained for the purposes of the University. Under the provisions
of this Bill, the Lands already sold, and upon which one installment
has been paid, may be claimed at one dollar-and twenty-five cents
per acre, if the settler can prove that he occupied the Land prior
to its location; and thus it cannot be foreseen what portion of the
Lands, whether now sold or unsold, will be ultimately claimed at
this rate; or, how much of the $I50,ooo now unpaid, or, if the
$820,000 anticipated from unsold land, will be realized.
We respectfully urge the unconstitutionality of the Bill from
this consideration. The acts of a Trustee to be valid, must be
clearly limited to the powers expressed in the Trust. Now either
the Regents or the State is the Trustee 'in this case, as must readily
be conceded. The Regents claim to be invested exclusively with
this Trust, and the Legislature, by this Bill, claim the same Trust.
In either case, it cannot be denied that a limited trust only has
been created. The Congress of the United States is the Grantor
of these Lands, in trust for the "use of the University of Michigan."
If there was no University at the time of the grant, then the
grant is in abeyance until the creation of such corporation. If it
be alleged that the State is the recipient, still the State is only so
for the purpose of applying the grant to the uses for which it is
intended and limited. The Legislature cannot alter or e.rcecd the
intention and li.mit of the grant. But this the Legislature has done
by the provisions of this Act. The Act of Congress of 1826 reserving the Lands in question for the use of the University of Michigan,
confers no power on the Legislature to sell these lands or give
them away; and moreover, if the Legislature has the right, under
subsequent Congressional Legislation, which we contend cannot
impair the extent of the previous reservation, to direct the sale, they
cannot, under the provisions of our Constitution, reinvest the funds




86


THIRD APRIL MEETING, 1839


accruing from such sale. For a more extended view of the obligations of this proposed measure, the undersigned would very respectfully refer your Excellency, to the accompanying documents, heretofore presented to the Senate by the Undersigned. Believing the
measure to be fraught with ruin to the bright prospects of the
University, so fondly entertained by the Friends of Education;
believing the provisions to be contrary to the intent of the Act ot
I826 by which the munificent donation was created, believing it to
be in violation of the letter and spirit of the Constitution of Michigan, which directs the preservation and not the diminution of the
University fund, and recognizing no distinctive merit in one class
of our population, that rights should be legislated to them which
they could not make manifest in our Tribunlas of Justice, the
undersigned do,
In behalf of the people of Michigan, in behalf of generations
yet unborn, in behalf of the Board of Regents of the University
of Michigan, and standing on the Act of Congress of 1836, most
earnestly and solemnly Protest against the executive approval of a
Bill deemed so unjust and so hostile to the best interests of the
corporation they represent.
And we remain,
Your Excellency's Fellow Citizens,
(Signed) Ross WILKINS,
J. KEARSLY,
Z. PITCHER,
Committee of the Board of Regents.
Detroit, April I6th, I839.
Message of the Governor.
To the House of Representatives:
I return without my signature, to the House in which it originated, a Bill entitled, "An Act for the relief of certain settlers on
University and State lands." In refusing my sanction to the provisions of this Bill, I am governed by an imperious sense of public
duty urged upon me by the solemnity of my official oath. The
determination I make is a painful one. It has been framed, however,
after mature and anxious deliberation and cannot be resisted. The
ostensible object of the Bill is to secure to certain settlers on public
lands, their just right under the pre-emption law of Congress, which
is alleged has been interferred with by this State.  Does the
bill meet the object intended, and are its provisions limited to
the designs of the Legislature?
I will permit myself to enquire into the equity of the claims
of these settlers. I do not stop to ask how far the eager hopes
of the people of Michigan in an Institution fraught with benefits
to thousands yet unborn are crushed by the measure proposed to
me. The pre-emption law. was framed for the protection of the
bold and daring pioneer, who leads the march of civilization and
proclaims to the world the unknown beauties and hidden resources
of our western wilderness. For the protection of such men was the
law designed, and if the applicants under the Bill before me are
entitled to the right of property in the lands in question, not even
for the holy purposes of education should that right be disturbed.
How far, then, these claimants come within the spirit and intentions
of the legislation of Congress, I leave the Legislature to determine.




THIRD APRIL MEETITNG, 1839


87


To tie representatives of the people properly belongs the decision
of all such questions. Appreciating as they ever should, the high
interests committed to their charge, I am bound to believe, that
each claim, under this Bill has undergone the most rigid scrutiny
and that none other save a disinterested sense of justice, an anxious
desire to protect the rights of the citizen, and a high sense of what
is due to the' character of the State and our institutions, could
have induced your sanction to 'the measure proposed by the Bill
before me. If, then, a mere question of expediency was involved in
the bill, it might become my duty to yield to it my unhesitating
assent. But my solemn convictions sanction no such conclusions.
By Ithe first section of the Bill, you propose to sell at $1.25 per
acre, any lands located for University purposes, if it is proven they
were occupied and cultivated as pointed out by the pre-emption
law of Congress, before their location by the State. Where is the
necessity for this unlimited provision, releasing all lands located for
the University purposes, whether heretofore claimed by individuals
or not? What is the object of this wholesale temptation to fraud
and perjury? The applications before you have emanated from
that highly respectable class of settlers whose rights are effected
by the locations on the Niles and Nottawassippi Reservations, and
on the Grand River and Muskegon River. The relief asked by
these claimants should have been extended to them wherever their
claims are found to be meritorious. I am anxious to afford that
relief, and I regret that their rights have been jeopardized nDy a
wholesale species of propagandism in search of adventurers to
claim your Public Lands.
The Congress of the United States "has granted and conveyed
these lands to the State to be appropriated solely to the use and
support of the University of Michigan." The State has accepted
these lands, and the Constitution enjoins, "that the Legislature
shall take measures for their protection and improvement, and
also provide means for the permanent security of the funds of the
Institution." These are the solemn conditions by which the State
holds this sacred trust; and yet by one single enactment, you place
all the lands thus held in 'trust in the market at $I.25 per acre, no
matter what their value, where located, or how claimed. Yet it
may be said, they are protected by the provisions of the Bill from
all illegal claims. What is that protection? The feeble barrier ot
an oath, held out with a bribe and reward for its violation by bad
and wicked men. Can this be a faithful administration of the
trust committed to us? Is it the appropriation of these lands solely
to the use and support of the University of Michigan as required
by the compact with the United States, or their protection and
improvement as enjoined by the Constitution?
But the second section is still more fatal to this Bill. You
there propose to sell at $I.25 per acre "any State lands of the
State." What are the lands thus contemplated to be sold? Lands
for the erection of public buildings, and lands attached to the
State salines. These lands are donations under the provisions of
Congress at the time of the admission of the state into the Federal
Union, and were accepted by the ordinance of July 25, I836. This.ordinance is declared "to be irrevocable without the consent of
-the United States," and by the express terms of the grant, as confirmed by the ordinance, the salt springs and lands attached "are




88


THIRD APRIL MEETING, 1839


granted to the State for its use alone, they are to be used on such
terms as the Legislature may direct and shall never be sold or
leased for a longer period than ten years, without the consent of
Congress." It is clear then that the Bill before me is palpably
unconstitutional and cannot receive my sanction without a reckless
violation of my oath. By this decision, I am not unmindful of
the responsibility I assume, nor am I forgetful of the wrong I
may inflict on some meritorious claimant. I therefore regret it is
so general in its features. To a constitutional measure of relier
my sanction would be readily given. If the legislature in their
wisdom  will propose a remuneration to the claimant from  the
general fund, either in money or by the purchase of other lands,
or by any other mode which will remove the unconstitutional features of the present Bill, it will be my duty to sanction it. My
present objections do not arise from hostility to the claimants,
but from insuperable objections to the mode pointed out by the
Legislature. Every personal feeling and sympathy are with the
advocates and friends of this measure. My first impulse would
lead me to give it my sanction, but the convictions of my judgment
and my oath warn me to yield to no such temptation. I know the
personal consequences that are to flow from this act. I am aware
how little I gain and how much personally I may lose. But in
the conscientious discharge of my official trust, those considerations
shall never control me. I perform a duty I owe to myself, and I
leave the result to a liberal and enlightened people.
(Signed) S. T. MASON.

O'CTOBER MEETING, 1839


99


Jr. late Treasurer of the Board, made the following report,
\which was read:
Report of Comlmi!tee on Finantce.
Maj. Kearsley on behalf of the Committee on Finance reports,
that John Norton, Jr., late Treasurer of the Board of Regents ot
the University of Michigan, admits a balance due from  him as
Treasurer to the Board of Regents amounting to between $3,000 and
$4,000, which sum he is now unable to transfer to his successor
owing to the fact that said money was deposited by him in the Michigan State Bank for safe keeping and that said Bank has suspended
payment. The late Treasurer therefore proposes to secure the ultimate payment of the amount due by him by mortgage upon unincumbered real estate and prays that such time may be allowed him
for such payment as under the circumstances the Board may be
pleased to grant. The Committee on Finance would therefore recommend that the period; of two years be allowed to the late Treasurer for the reimbursement of the amount that may be ascertained
to be due from him as Treasurer of the University with interest
thereon from the Twentieth day of May, 1839, provided he shall
execute a Bond or Bonds secured by M\'ortgage on unincumbered
real estate to the satisfaction of the Board of Regents, and further
provided that the securities on the official Bond of Mr. Norton assent to such arrangement and that the same does not operate as a
release of the said securities on said Bond.
)n motion of Chief Justice Fletcher,
Resolved, That the report of the Committee on Finance relating to the moneys in the hands of John Norton, Jr., late Treasurer
of the University of Michigan, be accepted and that the same be referred to the Committee on Finance, who are hereby authorized!to
take of said Norton the collateral security for any sum found to be
due the University in accordance with the recommendations contained in said report. And in case the said Committee shall not be
able to obtain from said Norton, security upon unincumbered real
estate satisfactory to them within twenty days from this date, that
the said Committee cause a suit to be commenced forthwith upon the
Bond of said Norton and his sureties.
Chancellor Farnsworth from the Co-mmittee on Appointments to whom had been referred the resolution respecting
the appointment of a Professorship of Geology and Mineralogy, made the following report, which was read:
Report of Conullittee on Appointtmentts.
The Committee on Appointments have had under consideration
the resolution referred to them at a prior meeting and beg leave to
report that 'the period has arrived 'when, in their judgment, the
interests of the Institution requires the designation of a person to
fill the Professorship of Geology and Mineralogy. The buildings
at Ann Arbor are in such a state of forwardness as to justify the
belief that one of them will be ready to be appropriated to this
object in the course of the Autumn.




I00


OCTOBER MEETING, 1839


The collections made by the State Geologist for the University's
Cabinet are, at this time, extensive and require the use of one skilled
in their scientific value and properties to receive them and prepare
the entire collection for exhibition and lectures. In addition to
this, the Regents have also on hand.the fine collection of European
minerals obtained from the Imperial Cabinet of Vienna, through
the instrumentality of Baron Lederer. It is felt that both collections are not only exposed, in their present position to more than
ordinary danger of loss from fire, but by being withheld from
view, their value;is lost to the Institution and not appreciated by the
community at large.
Natural History in all its departments affords so varied and attractive a field for investigation, and!its advancement is so closely
linked with the process of academic and collegiate instruction that
it is felt by the Committee they could scarcely err in fixing on too
early a period for introducing the study in all its essential branches
into the walls of the University. It has been deemed wise to appropriate a portion of their funds to the purchase of specimens, books,
and apparatus, and the sentiment has been cherished from our first
meetings that every proper facility should be afforded to the Professors to place these studies on the most liberal and polished footing. It was under such views that the Professorship of Botany and
Zoology was organized and authority given to the newly appointed
Professor to visit the seats of Botanical and Zoological learning in
Europe.
With respect to the person to be chosen to fill the Geological
and Mineralogical Chair, a wide range has presented itself in the
numerous individuals who have distinguished themselves in these
departments in the United States; but there has been a perfect
unanimity of sentiment in the Committee in the ultimate decision
in favor of our present enterprising and highly intelligent State
Geologist. His zeal and patient research in the Northwest, his untiring activity and perseverance in every department of his appointments under the State Authority, and his sound and accurate deductions in bringing forward the results in his annual reports, point
him out as the man who promises to fill the station with honor to
himself and usefulness to the public.
The Committee beg leave to recommend the adoption of the
following resolutions:
Resolved, That the appointment of Professor of Geology and
Mineralogy in the University be tendered to Dr. Douglass Houghton, of Detroit, and that he be also charged with the subjects of
Chemistry and Pharmacy, till the Regents take further order in relation thereto.
Resolved, That the annual salary of the Professor of Geology
and Mineralogy be fixed' at.......... to commence at such time
after he shall have actually entered on the execution of his duties,
as the Regents may by resolution direct.
On motion, the report was accepted.
The question on the adoption of the first resolution reported by said Committee was decided in the affirmative.




NOVEM/BER MEETING, 1839                 IOI
On motion, the blank in the second resolution was filled

Nays: Maj. Kearsley. I.
The question on the adoption of the resolution was then
decided in the affirmative.
On motion of Dr. Denton,
Resolved, That the Building Committee be authorized to have
one or more of the buildings on the University grounds fitted up as
soon as convenient under the advice and direction of Professor
Houghton for the reception of the Library and specimens in Natural
History.
Dr. Pitcher, from the Committee on Branches, made the
following report, which was read and writh the letter referred to laid upon the table.
The Committee on Branches ask leave to report that they have
communicated with Mr. Alden, the Superintendent of the Kalamazoo Institute, on the subject of the resolution adopted at the last
meeting of the Board and referred to them, from whom they have
received the letter submitted herewith.

104


DECEMBIER MEETING, I839


occasion of doing so, although not strictly enjoined by the terms of
the resolution. They have accordingly availed themselves of such
sources of information as have been possible, in the absence of all
regular statements of the former Treasurer of the Board. These
have been the reports of the Superintendent of Public Instruction,
the books of the Bank of Michigan and the Michigan State Bank,
and the Secretary's book containing an account of warrants issued.
The Committee have made a careful examination of the last mentioned book and prepared from it an abstract of expenditures which,
upon comparison, is found 'to agree with the accounts of the banks.

Interest from the Bank of Michigan.
This will depend upon the amount expended, but as the
sum of $50,000 will not probably be withdrawn before the same is payable by the bond of the Bank,
the interest for the year I840 may be estimated at..  3,500.00
$17,200.00
to which sum may be added the interest to accrue upon sales of
lands hereafter to be made. These will depend, in a good degree,
upon the state of the Country, now much embarrassed.
In regard to the mode of making disbursements, your Committee remark that no systematic plan has hitherto been pursued. The
warrants of the Board have been directed to the Treasurer of the
University, but in most cases they have been paid by the Bank of
Michigan. The Treasurer has in fact received no money excepting
that which was deposited in the Michigan State Bank, nor has he
in fact paid any other than the sums charged in his account with
that Bank, yet the records exhibit an account in his name, charging
the University with all the warrants paid by the Bank of Michigan
up to 5 July, I839, and showing a balance due to him of $11,235.03,
when in truth he was a debtor to the University in a considerable:SUIm.




DECEMBER MJEETINTG, I839


107


The reason assigned for this mode of disbursement has been
the desire -to leave the moneys in the Bank of Michigan in a condition to draw interest agreeably to the contract with that Bank. This
object may still be attained, according to the spirit of the agreement, by adopting the plan which your Committee have the honor
to propose, namely, to direct the Treasurer to lay before the Board
of Regents, from time to time, his estimates of the sums required
to meet the expenditures of the University, and to issue warrants
upon the Bank for so much of these sums as are not supplied by the
ordinary receipts into the Treasury. In this way the account of the
Treasurer will exhibit all the expenditures. In the present mode,
unless he borrows the vouchers from the Bank, as was done by the
late Treasurer, his account will show a part and the Bank account
will contain the other part, the latter being made without any actual
authority from the Regents.
Your Committee further recommend that the Treasurers of the
Branches be required to pay to the Treasurer of the University before the expiration of every term, the sums received for tuition and
applicable to the payment of Teachers' salaries, in order that the
same may appear in the accounts of the Board. At present these
sums are held by Treasurers or deducted from the stipend of the
Teachers, and it is difficult to ascertain the exact receipts of the
Branches. These payments should also be reported to the Secretary of the Board and by him charged against the Treasurer of the
University.
Respectfully submitted,
J. KEARSLEY,
C. C. TROWBRIDGE,
Committee on Finance.
Detroit, Dec. I6th, I839.

Pontiac, Dec. 28th, 1839.
We the undersigned, proprietors of the lot and building on Saginaw Street, Pontiac, now occupied by the Oakland Branch of the
University of Michigan, hereby agree to give and transfer the said
lot and building to the Regents of the University of Michigan for
the use of the said Oakland Branch, provided the same is located
and established in this place.
(Signed) G. 0. Whittemore, J. Hodges, D. Chamberlin, D. Paddock, H. N. Howard, George Hill, Amasa Andrews, O. D. Richardson, L. W. Allen, J. P. LeRoy, Amasa Bagley.
On motion of Judge Whipple,
Resolved, That the foregoing proposition submitted to the Board
by sundry citizens of Pontiac be accepted, upon the execution, by
the owners of the lot and building therein referred, of a deed to be
executed and delivered to the Board, and upon the further condition that the building be put in complete order and repair, and the
grounds properly fenced, and all necessary out-buildings erected,
to the satisfaction of the Committee on Branches, within such period as the said Committee may direct, not exceeding six months.
Dr. Pitcher and Rev. Mr. Duffield presented sundry

motion were referred to the Committee on Appointments.
Rev. Mr. Duffield from; the Committee to revise the
Organic Law of the University and propose such changes
as may be desirable, to be presented for the action of the
Legislature, made the following report, which, on motion
of Judge Wilkins was accepted.
REPORT.
The Committee appointed to revise the Organic Law of the
University and to report such changes as may be desirable to be
presented for the action of the Legislature, beg leave respectfully
to submit the following:
Two things appear to be essential, in order 'to the vigorous and
successful prosecution of the great and responsible duties devolved
on the Board of Regents.
I. The first is the proper restriction of their responsibilities
-to the Board themselves. At present the Regents, as by law pro



I4


JANU4ARY M/[EETING, I84o


vided, have not the sole responsibility in the location of the Branches. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shares it in common
with them. Nay more, has in effect the power by his veto of staying their procedures. This officer is not an ex officio member of
the Board, is not present at their meetings to hear and know what
transpires in their discussions, and therefore cannot be so capable
as the Board themselves of judging as to the propriety of establishing a Branch in this or the other County. It does not seem reasonable that to him should be given the power to interpose his veto.
and by withholding his concurrence embarrass and prostrate measures which the Board may deem advisable and necessary for the
interests of education. Moreover, the Board are directed by Law to
make report of their disbursements as well as their general doings
to the Superintendent of Public Instruction, to be embodied by him
in his annual report of his proceedings to the Legislature. Your
Committee think both these regulations exceptionable and recommend such amendments of Title I2th, Chapter Ist, Part Ist, of the
Revised Statutes of this State, as will throw the entire responsibility on the Board and require them to make a full report of their
proceedings to the Governor, to be laid by him before the Legislature, instead of that responsibility being divided, and the Board being made, as they now are, a mere appendage of another functionary.
2. The second matter of importance is, the full trust and responsibility of the funds belonging to the University. The present
law withholds from the Board all agency whatever in the management and consolidation of the funds appropriated to the use of the
University, and by making them the mere annual recipients of uncertain payments depending in a great measure on contingencies
connected with the duties of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, leaves them unable to adapt their measures to their means, or
to project and execute such plans as the interest of education and
the resources of the University may call for. The Board have no
power to sell any of the Lands of the University, or to invest any
moneys arising from the sale of lands by the Superintendent, or to
consolidate their Capital and efficiently regulate their own fiscal interests and concerns. The right and authority to sell the Lands of
the University and to invest the proceeds is vested solely in the
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and all the agency required
of the Board, in reference to the same, except in specific disbursements of moneys fromn, time to time paid over to them, is to submit
an estimate of expenses for the ensuing year, to another body, a
Board of Visitors consisting of five persons to be appointed annually by the Superintendent of Public Instruction and who are to
report to the Superintendent, see Title I Ith, Chap. 2d, sections I5
and I6. And your Committee think that the duties of the Superintendent in relation to the Primary School lands and funds are sufficiently onerous without devolving on him those in relation to the
University lands, which the Board are competent to meet. They
therefore recommend that such amendments of the Law be made
as will vest in the Board the powers of disposing the University
lands now conferred on the Superintendent, and hold the Board
directly responsible to the Legislature for the investment of the
moneys arising from the sale of the same. They further recommend
that monyes arising from the sale of the University lands be paid
into the hands of the Treasurer of the State to be invested and held




SECOND JANlUARY MEETING, 1840

in trust by the State for the use and benefit of the University, and
that so much of the Law as requires loans of such moneys to be
made to the different Counties be rescinded.
Your Committee further recommend that Dr. Houghton be
authorized to place a part, if not the whole, of the specimens in
geology, mineralogy, and zoology, now in his hands, belonging to the
State, in the University buildings under the charge and control of
the Board of Regents.
On motion of Chancellor Farnsworth the report was
taken up and on his motion the first proposition of the committee was adopted.
On motion of Judge Wilkins, the second proposition of
the Committee was adopted.
On motion of Chief Justice Fletcher, the third proposition was adopted.
Chief Justice'Fletcher moved that a Committee of three
he appointed to draft a Bill embodying the provisions recommended in said Report, and report the same to the next
imeeting of the Board, which motion was decided in the
affirmative.
The chair announced Chief Justice Fletcher, M\aj. Kearsley, and Judge W'ilkins as said Committee.
On motion of Maj. Kearsley,
Resolved, That the Committee on Branches be instructed to
report to the Regents at their next meeting a plan for reducing the
expenses of the Branches.
On motion of Mr. Trowbridge the Board adjourned
until Tuesday evening next, the: Il.th inst.
SECOND JANUARY MEETING, 1840.
Tuesday, January 14th, I840.
The Board met pursuant to adjournment.
PIrcseut: Chief Justice Fletcher, Justices Morell, Ransom, and Whipple, Judge Wilkins, MLaj. Kearsley, Rev. Geo.
Duffield, C. C. TroTwbridge, Esq., and Dr. Pitcher.
On motion of Dr: Pitcher, Justice Morell was called
to the chair.
Maj. Kearsley from the Committee on Branches made
the following report, which, on motion was accepted, and
the report was laid upon the table.
The Committee on Branches, to whom was referred the Resolution of the Board of Regents, "To inquire what reductions may be
made in the existing expenditures upon the Branches of the
University,"




II6   SECOAND JANU,4JRY MEETING, 1840


REPORT,
That, after a careful examination of the entire subject, taking
into view the financial condition of the University, present and prospective, your Committee are of opinion that the direct expenditure
from the Treasury of the University proper, toward the support
of Branches, is greatly beyond that 'which its resources will warrant. Your Committee are fully aware of the importance as well
as the popular favor of the Branches; that upon these the prosperity
of the University must mainly depend, and without which it is ever
doubtful whether the University can be extensively beneficial. Your
Committee are therefore not insensible to the consequences that may
result from the reduction of appropriations, which necessity compels
them to submit. The annual report of the Superintendent o'f Public
Instruction exhibits the sum of $6,402.91 (as the Superintendent
informs your Committee) of interest paid for 1839 on University
lands already sold to which he thinks there may be yet added
$I,ooo, making $7,400 or thereabouts, to be placed at the disposal
of the Regents for the year 1840. The Board of Regents, exclusive
of tuition fees, have expended in 1839, upon the Branches the sum
of $I0,200, being an excess beyond the receipts of interest for
I838 of $766.87. And to limit the entire expenditure of the Regents
to their annual receipts, the payment of salary to one Professor
and prospective payments to others should not be overlooked.
The salary of one Professor is now paid and has been for more
than a year past. One other Professor has been appointed, and
should the Regents determine to open the University for the
reception of students, at least two additional Professors will be
required.  To sustain four Professors would therefore require
an appropriation of $6,ooo, which added to the excess of expenditure beyond the receipts will be $6,766 for the year I839.
This important question therefore presents itself ''for the
decision of the Regents, in the organization of the University
proper and the Branches,-is precedence to be given to either, or do
the Constitution and Laws of the State contemplate their organization parti passu?  Your Committee are of opinion if both, cannot
be sustained, the Branches must be suspended. Yet there can be
little doubt that the Branches would.at present best promote the
interests of the State and advance the general cause of Literature
for which the original donation of lands was intended. The suggestion is therefore here submitted,-Would a petition to the Legislature not be expedient and proper asking a grant of part of the
salt-spring or other lands belonging!to 'the State, to constitute a
distinct fundl for the exclusive benefit of the Branches?
Neither the condition of the University, being as yet unorganized, nor the proficiency of a large majority of the students
now in the Branches, seems to demand our immediate decision of
the question,-Shall! the Branches be discontinued? Most of the
classes in the Branches will not be prepared to enter the University
sooner than the close of the present year. Nor should the University be organized by the appointment of the additional Professors
necessary. Would the number of students prepared to enter it
justify tllhe measure? Your Committee, therefore, recommend the
continuance of the Branches for the present year, as now organized.
A retrenchment in 'the expenditures upon them is however ind'ispensably necessary, and this without delay.  There are three
methods by which this may be done.




SLEC'OND JAN UARY JlEEETING, 1840


1r7


First. To determine the number of Branches that shall be
continued and to allow to each a certain and uniform appropriation.
Second. To limit 'the number of Branches to the resources of
the Regents and appropriate salaries to the Instructors.
Third. To reduce the appropriation from the Treasury, appropriate the entire fees of tuition in payment of salaries, and
thus make the emoluments of the teachers depend in some degree
upon the number of students,-the sums paid from the Treasury
to be graduated according to the necessity for a Branch and the
public advantage likely to result therefrom.
Your Committee recommend the last mentioned as most expedient and practical; and with this view, the following graduation
or schedule is submitted.

Total..........$3,700      $I,6oo         $4,085    $9,385
From  the foregoing exhibit it will appear that six Branches
may be liberally aided by a direct appropriation of $5,300 from the
University fund, leaving a balance, however, of only $2,700 for all
other purposes as salaries, contingencies, etc., of the University
proper.
A more equitable apportionment of the $5,300 may possibly be
made, but it is the opinion of your Committee that the extent of
education afforded by six Branches ought not to cost beyond $9,385
or $42 per year tuition for each student. This is certainly a high
rate for tuition and the direct appropriation from the Treasury
of the University, while it decreases the tuition to be paid by
individual students, will secure a fair compensation!to Instructors.
It is also conceived that the proposed appropriations will fully
sustain that public approbation heretofore extended to the Branches
and also present any relaxation of the regulation heretofore adopted
and insisted upon as to the qualifications of Instructors and attainments of students in the several Branches.
It will be perceived, notwithstanding these proposed retrenchments that no provision is made for the discharge of the interest
of $6,000 per annum upon the $Ioo,oo loan. To meet this for I840,
it will be seen, by reference to the report of the Finance Committee, that there will probably be received from  the Bank ot
Michigan as interest $3,500. And it is possible the balance $2,500
may be paid, as interest, by purchasers of the University lands,
who have not heretofore paid their interest due. But in any event,
it is deemed advisable that the interest on the loan should be

paid, in part, even from  the principal, rather than attempt, at
present, a further reduction towards the support of the Branches.
In conclusion, the Committee recommend that ithe foregoing
plan, if adopted for the support and continuance of the Branches,
take effect from and after the expiration of the present term, and
that the Committee on Branches be instructed to give immediate
notice thereof to the several Principals of Branches and to be submitted by them to their respective Board of Visitors.

FEBRUA4RY MlEETI;NG, 1840


On motion of Chief Justice Fletcher, Lieutenant-Gov
ernor Gordon was called to the Chair.
The Proceedings of the last two meetings were read and
approved.
MAr. Duffield from the Committee on Branches, to whom
was recommitted the report of the Committee on Branches
and the resolution of Tustice Ransom, submitted on the
T4th ult. relative to, the reduction of the expenses of the
same, made the following report which on motion of Chief
Justice Fletcher was accepted.
REPORT.
The Committee to whom was referred the report of the Committee on Branches relative to the reduction of the expenses of the
same, beg leave respectfully to represent,
That they have given the subject all due consideration and are
not prepared to recommend any alteration in the present system to
be provided for by the action of this Board. The estimated deficit
in the receipts for the present year, should not an increase in the
number of pupils and the avails from ithis source be sufficient to
meet it, will doubtless subject the Board to embarrassment and most
probably prevent them from meeting punctually their engagements
with the Principals and their assistants, or render it necessary to.
resort to a temporary loan. There is reason to hope that this deficiency in the annual receipts will not be permanent or lasting, but
be more than met by the payments of the last two years, yet uncollected, whenever the general causes which have produced such universal derangement in the monetary affairs of the country, shall
have ceased to operate. At all events your Committee do not think
that the prospect of increased embarrassment or absolute failure in
the collection of the revenue is at present sufficiently dark and
gloomy to warrant the Board under present circumstances and
without further effort, to change the whole system so recently adopted and just beginning to be brought into successful operation. The
necessity is not yet imperious or at least so imperious but that some
expedients can be devised to meet the present exigencies. Whatever may be the inconvenience and embarrassments to which the
Board shall be subjected, they do not however appear to your Committee by any means as great as those to which the abandonment of
the present system  will subject tthem. The plans for effecting a
change are the following:
Ist. The equal distribution of a per annum   allowance of
$500.00 to each Branch, leaving the Principal to the co-operation of
the Visitors to look to the fees for tuition and to the increase of
the number of his pupils for the balance of his salary or the means
necessary for his support.
2nd. The reduction of the number of the Branches, and
3rd. The adjustment of the appropriations of the Board so as
to meet and supply the full amount of salary after deducting the
receipt for tuition as at present estimated and reported.




FEBRUA4RYI MEETINA1G, 840o


I 2 I


\/Vith respect to the first plan, although it has been warmly advocated in the Board, yet the Committee cannot but think it would
prove utterly uneffectual, and not only subversive of the presentsystem, but of any other which would be of real utility, or give the
Board any control in directing the interests of education. For in
the very first place it would be equivalent to the dismission of the
present Principals and assistants, some of whom have been invited
here by the Board and have come with their families in the faith
of the promises and engagements made and entered into with them
which they have considered both honorable and sacred. In the next
place there could not be teachers procured competent to conduct the
system as at present in operation. This is of an elevated grade, requiring the best scholars and men of reputation. For ithe annuity
of four or five hundred dollars with the contingency of a large or
small number of scholars, no man of talents and attainments in science and literature would be willing to come to a new State and:
submit to the toils and privations incident to the hazardous enterprise of establishing an academy among a sparse population and
where neither the wealth of the inhabitants nor the condition of
the State has as yet furnished inducements at all commensurate
with those presented in older States and more populous regions.
Young men prosecuting professional studies, and adventurers having other ends in view than the advancement of the interests of
education, might be procured; but the schools would be subject to
fluctuations and embarrassments without end, were they necessitated to look to this class of persons for -their teachers. Besides
the actual experiment has been made by the Committee on Branches,
and they found that it was impossible on any other system than the
one adopted by them and in operation at present, to procure responsible and qualified' instructors with whom to confide the interests of education in this young and: rising commonwealth.
To abandon the present system now and to resort to that which
at first was proved inefficient, would not only be in opposition to the
dictates of that wisdom which experience has dictated, but would
throw additional obstacles in the -way and 'such as would not in the'
first instance have been encountered, but which have now become
serious. It is not at all improbable but that in some places respectable members of society may think the present system expensive,
and comparing the salaries and expenses at different Branches, may
think that the plan of equalizing the distribution of aid is preferable and that teachers would readily be procured; but should the
experiment be made and the high character of the schools be maintained, it would be found that such anticipations are much moreeasily expressed:than realized. The Committee feel that it is due
to the people whose interests they seek to promote to adopt and
pursue the system which is most efficient and valuable instead of
being embarrassed by the views which are apt to be entertained on
a partial examination, but were to be abandoned by every reflecting
and observant man when placed in circumstances to see the experiment fairly made.
What is said in relation to the opinions and objections of those'
who have purchased the lands of the University, and who may now
find it 'difficult to meet their installments, your Committee think is
altogether irrelevant. They certainly are entitled to all proper
leniency and sympathy from this Board', if needed, but they can on
no pretext whatever be accounted the donors of the University,.




I22


2FEBRUAR Y MEEETING, 1840


whose opinions and judgments as to the disposition of the funds
should have authority with the Board. They have received or wil!
receive a full equivalent in the lands conveyed to 'them for all tilhe
money they pay, and however their opinions as citizens may deserve respect, they are entitled to none whatever on the ground ot
their contributing to the funds of the University. They are debtors and not patrons, and to be induced to make any change in our
system because of menaces or objections from this source would be
unfaithful, your Committee think, to the trust reposed in this Board.
As to the second plan, that of reducing the number of Branches,
your Committee think that serious objections may be urged against
it however preferable it appears to the other. It is possible that
some of the Branches where the pupils are few, just beginning and
very young, might safely be suspended; but there would be danger
of exciting invidious feelings and producing those sectional jealousies which should ever be avoided, were an election to be made
as to what Branches should be suspended. Nor would this probably
be done without some pecuniary considerations to satisfy the Principals and assistants of such Branches. At all events your Committee think that until some correspondence or negotiations can be
had with such Branches and: further light be thrown upon the subject of its practicability, the Board cannot be prepared to make a
reduction of the number of existing Branches.
The third plan touches not the amount of salaries as at present
rated, but proposes a very serious change in reference to the foundation on which the Branches are placed. It proposes to give the
Principal the amount of tuition arising from the school and to make
up after deducting the amount of tuition estimated at the present
number of students, the deficit of salary by appropriation from the
Board. This plan does not reduce the expenses of the Board, nor
does it alter the salaries, and: therefore gains nothing in reality on
this ground. The Principal, for example, of the Detroit Branch
will receive $550.00, the amount of tuition, and $950.00, the appropriation of the Board, making up the sum of $I,500.00. The Committee on Branches are abundantly competent to pay the salaries
in this way, and your Committee think they should be so paid as
to prevent!the withdrawal of the tuition money for any local purposes such as repairing the school-room, or any other object which
ought to'be met by the people of the place. They may constitute
the Principal their collector and in settling his account of salary
make him account for the full' amount of tuition money; none could
object to such a procedure. The salary in such a case would be regarded as certain, the principle on which it rested by the pledge of
the Board would be untouched, and this would be a mere arrangement as to the mode of its payment. But suppose that the Board
should say to the Principals, "Take the tuition money and make
what you can out of the school;' we will appropriate only so much,
this year," at once the salary becomes uncertain and fluctuating.
The receipts may be more or less than $1,500.00. If more, what
pledge has the Principal that the appropriation will not be reduced
next year, just in proportion to the increased tuition, thus making
the teacher look mainly to the number of his scholars for his salary
and not 'to the pledge of the Board. This would be furnishing
temptations to the Principals to adapt the style and standard of instruction and discipline of the school to the whims and caprices of
parents rather than to throw the Aegis of the Board's protection




FEBRUARY MEETING, I1840

around him while he attempts to maintain the system and standard
as established by the Board. Thus their dependence on the Board
and consequently their obligations to the Board would be embarrassed. Besides it would destroy all confidence in the pledges of the
Board. Should the Principals be told today, "You may have the
tuition for yourself and the Board will appropriate a given sum to
your support," they may expect similar treatment next year and
never be able to tell whether the Board may not reduce their appropriations in either case, whether they have increased the number of
students or not. Adventurers and those desirous of making money
might consent to such uncertainties, but men devoted to the business of education as their profession for life and preferring a salary
because certain, to such opportunities Ito make money, would refuse
to be dependent on such contingencies and would decline to enter
into the strifes and measures which are often resorted to to swell
the number of pupils in a money-making academy. Besides this
system would be subject to greater fluctuations than the first, and
not only would the same difficulties be felt in the way of procuring
and retaining teachers, but others and peculiar to itself would greatly be experienced. A change of this sort would be regarded and
pronounced as a violation of pledges already given, and the confidence abroad might be so far impaired in the stability of the plans
of the Board, and the worth of their pledges, as to prevent men
of science and reputation from attending to the future invitations
of the Board.
In view, therefore, of all the difficulties around this subject,
your Committee judge that it is inexpedient to make any changes in
the system of Branches as at present established and recommend
that the subject be dismissed from their further consideration.
On motion of Chief Justice Fletcher, the above report
was adopted.
Dr. Pitcher presented a communication from the Board
of Visitors of the White Pigeon Branch, relative to payment
of moneys of Rev. Julius Steele, and, on motion of Maj.
Kearsley, it was
Resolved, That so much of the communication of the Board of
Visitors of the Branch of the University at White Pigeon of January 25th, 1840, as refers to the salary of Rev. Julius Steele, be referred to the Committee on Branches with instructions to inform
the Board of Visitors that the claim cannot be admitted.
Resolved, That the Committee on Branches be instructed to
limit the appropriation to the White Pigeon Branch to $I,200 to the
Principal and $600 to M. W. Gray, the Tutor, and that the tuition
money form a part of said expenditures as in all other Branches.
Dr. Pitcher also presented a communication of inhabitants of White Pigeon, relative to the appointment of a
BIoard of Visitors for the White Pigeon Branch    also, a remonstrance, which, on motion, was laid on the table.

MARCH MEETING, 1840


123


REPORT.
The undersigned, in behalf of the Building Committee, respectfully submits to the Board of Regents of the University, the following report of their proceedings.
By an order of the Board of Regents of the IIth February,
I839, all further proceedings to erect the University Buildings ac-,cording to the plan adopted in September, I838, were suspended and
the building Committee by that resolution were directed to give
notice to Alexander J. Davis and Isaac Thompson, that the Board
of Regents would put an end to the contract made with them on
the I8th September, I838, as Architect and Superintendent; and the
Committee were further directed by that resolution to make a new
contract with Mr. Thompson to superintend the building of four
houses on the University ground at Ann Arbor, and to proceed to
erect those houses according to plans adopted by the Regents. In
pursuance to these directions, the Committee notified Mr. Thompson
that the contract made with him and Mr. Davis would be determined in pursuance of the provisions of the contract made with
them, and Mr. Thompson authorized by Mr. Davis, and acting for
Mr. Davis, as well as for himself, on receiving a certificate from
the Committee for the amount due them on that contract, did on the
14th February, I839, discharge the said contract and endorsed his
receipt thereon for the sum of six hundred and sixteen dollars, being in full for all claims under that contract. On the same day
-the Committee also made a new contract with Mr. Thompson to
superintend the building of the four houses above mentioned, the
compensation to be at the rate of $I,ooo per annum; and by the.advice of Mr. Thompson, the Committee on the I4th February last,
entered into a contract with Haspier Lum, to erect and finish those
houses by which they agreed to give him the sum of $7,450 for each
of two of the houses to be completely finished, and the sum of.$6,ooo for each of the other two houses to be finished except as to
certain parts of the interior, amounting in all to the sum of $27,500,
the houses to be finished by the first of July, I840; Mr. Lum giving a
bond with ample security in the sum of $5,ooo, as security for any
advances made to him under the contract.
On the 4th of March last, the Commi'ttee by the advic'e of the
Superintendent, and being satisfied that it would be an improvement upon the buildings as well in res'pect to economy as durability,
made a further contract with Mr. Lum by which- he was to finish
-the exterior of the buildings in rough cast, or stucco, for which
he was to receive the further sum of $250 for each house. And' on,the 22d June, the Committee made a further contract with Mr.
Lum, by which he was to construct.a terrace on each of the houses,
for the further sum of $I2.50 for each house. On 'the 13th July the
Board of Regents passed an order directing the Committee to contract with Mr. Lum to finish the interior of all the houses upon the
terms and in the manner specified in the original contract, and in
pursuance thereof, the Committee entered into such. contract. The
result of these contracts is that Mr. Lum 'is to be paid the sum of,$7,7I2.50 for each house, amounting in all to $30,850..
Upon these contracts with Mr. Lum, the Committee have given,certificates for payments to be made to him amounting in the whole
-to $25,000 and by the terms of the original contracts, Mr. Lum was,to take 200,000 bricks which had previously been purchased by the




I26


MilARCH M/EETING, 1840


Committee, at $I,200, the first cost, so that the whole amount ac —
tually paid him is $26,200.
On the I3'th July last, the Board of Regents put an end to the
contracts with Mr. Thompson as Superintendent, of which the Committee gave him notice, and afterwards gave him a certificate for
six months' pay, under the contract for $500, up to the I4th August.
The Committee have caused the University grounds to be cleared of stumps for which they have paid $346.81, and have caused a
well to be dug and stoned and bricked at an expense of $331.70.
The Committee at different times remitted small sums to pay for
work done in digging the well, and' clearing the ground amounting
in all to $500, out of which they have paid $346.81 for clearing the
ground of stumps, and $II9 towards the well, and $2.00 for recording deeds given by the Land Company to the Regents, leaving in
the hands of the undersigned the sum of $31.74 unexpended.
The Committee have also under the direction of the Board entered 'into another contract with Michaell Horrigan who dug the.
well, to dig another well upon the same terms as for digging the
first, which is now in progress of being completed. The first well
is seventy-six feet in depth, and has five and a half feet water. The
second well will probably be about the same depth and cost nearly
the same, if it shall be finished in the same manner.
The Committee by direction of the Board of Regents obtained
from Mr. Thompson certain plans and estimates of cost of fences
and out-buildings which have heretofore been exhibited to the Board
of Regents.
Nearly all' those matters were submitted verbally to the Board
of Regents at their quarterly meeting at Ann Arbor in July last,
by Judge Mundy and the undersigned, but for want of time, they
were not submitted in writing and since that time Mr. Mundy and
Mr. Adam, being a majority of the Committee during the time most
of the transactions occurred, have ceased to be Regents.
All of which is respectfully submitted,
Detroit, Feby. 15th, I840.      Wm. A. FLETcCHER, Corn.
The above report was prepared to be submitted to the Regenrs
at an adjourned meeting to have been held on the i5'th February,
but at which there was not a quorum. Since that time, Mr. Horrigan, the person employed to dig the second well, has succeeded in
obtaining water at the depth of seventy or seventy-five feet, and the
undersigned has paid on account, the sum of thirty-two dollars.
March 6th, I840.                     WM. A. FLETCHER.

established, prosecutes the same for his own benefit.
Hiram Chilson, being sworn as a witness for claimant, confirms the above statement in all its essential particulars.  This
claim upon the evidence was objected to on the part of 'the University. Ist, that claimant should have shown himself to have been
an actual personal resident on the premises previous to their
selection for University purposes, which he has not done. 2nd,
because claimant moved off the premises and by so doing virtually
abandoned them and could not by returning reinstate himself into
his original rights. These objections were overruled and the claim

that himself and part of his family were absent during the summer
of I836, while he was doing a job of work on a mill; the remainder
of his family remained on the land and kept house. Entered for
his own use and benefit solely. Made an agreement in March, I839
to sell his claim provided the Law then pending before the Legislature of this State, and afterwards vetoed by the Governor, should
be passed. This agreement was in writing, and referred expressly
to the law above.mentioned, and no other. It was cancelled a few
days since. Has never made any other contract to sell, and there is
no agreement that this shall be renewed. There is no other claimant to these premises.
Robert Cassidy, sworn as witness for claimant, confirms the
above statement in all essential particulars.
This claim was objected 'to upon the evidence, on the ground
that the contract mentioned in the deposition of the claimant
worked a forfeiture of his claim and that no subsequent act or

thing could restore it. The objection was overruled and the claim
allowed.

Claim No. 20. Moses Finch, Sen. S. W.,I4, Sec. 3, T. 8 S. R.
I7 WV. Claimant being sworn says he moved onto the premises
claimed in April 1833 and commenced improvements. Continued
to live upon the land until May I839 when he went off and rented
it. He himself went to Wisconsin, and his family to Indiana.
Returned from Wisconsin but a week or two since and his family
yet remain in Indiana. When he went away he left a tenant on the
land and reserved a right to occupy one room in the house. Tenant
was to pay him $21 a year rent.   No person now lives on the
premises. Before he went away he made an agreement to sell his
right in the premises, which agreement is now    cancelled.  It
referred expressly to the Law of 1838, which was vetoed by the
Governor and was cancelled before I left the premises. It was
an agreement to sell my right provided I should establish a claim
under said Law then expected to be passed.
Job Brookfield sworn as a witness for claimant confirmed the
above statement in all essential particulars.
This claim was objected to: Ist, because claimant was not at
the time of:the passage of the State Law an actual settler residing
on the lands therein mentioned, and had not at that time any subsisting interest in the land claimed. 2nd, that the contract mentioned in claimant's deposition worked a forfeiture of all his
rights.
Objections were overruled and claim allowed.
Claim No. 21. Watson Roe. S. E. 4, Sec. I8, T. 8 S. R. 17 W.
Claimant being sworn says he moved onto the premises claimed
with' his family in August, 1835, and has lived on them ever since.
Has 50 or 60 acres under improvement, entered for his own benefit
alone, and has never sold or agreed to sell his interest or claim in
the premises. There was another settler on the same quartersection who went on about the same time I did. He lived on the
east half of the quarter and I on the WVest. He moved off and
went to Illinois in the fall of I838, and I purchased out his possession.  His name was Lee and he claimed the E. half of the
premises upon which he lived.
Alanson Hamilton being sworn as a witness confirmed Mr.
Roe's statements.
It was contended that Mr. Roe had a good claim for only one
half the premises, the other not having been occupied or improved
by him until the fall of I838, or that he must take a right only as
teniant in common with the University.

JULY    il1EETING, I840

objection. (State Building Lands).
Claim No. 31. Jeremiah Slater. S. W. I4, Sec. 28, T. 7 S. R.
17 W. Claimant being sworn says he moved onto the premises
claimed in December, 1835, and has continued there ever since
until last week, when he moved off. The premises are now unoccupied. "I sold one-half my claim to J. C. Larimer, about three
years since. The bargain was made in writing and I received part
of my pay. It was cancelled;today and I gave my note for the
amount of purchase money I had received. The east half only was
sold to Larimer. About a year since I made a bargain to sell the
other half to Barlow and Babcock. This bargain was also reduced
to writing and I received payment in part. The effect of these
bargains was that I should convey to the purchasers upon obtaining
a title under the preemption laws of the State or United States.
This second bargain was also cancelled yesterday and I gave my
note for the payments I had received. I now' reside in Indiana
and have rented a place there. There is no bargain on my part to
renew these contracts if my claim is allowed, but I have promised
the parties the refusal of the premises.
Wm. Murphy, sworn as a witness, confirmed the statements
of complainant as to settlement, residence, etc.
J. C. Larimer, being sworn, confirmed statements of claimant
as to the contract with him. He paid claimant $50 cash at the time
the contract was made. It was cancelled this morning without
consideration and claimant gave witness his note without security
for the money paid. I gave up the claim because I supposed if
I kept it Murphy's claim would not be allowed and it would do
neither of us any good.
Messrs. Isaac Babcock and Lemuel Barlow stated the same
facts with regard to their contract with claimant. It was cancelled
yesterday and a note taken for the amount paid about $75. It was
cancelled without other consideration and because it could not be
good for anything to us.




JULY MEETINTG, 1840


I35


This claim was objected to on this evidence. Ist, because of
the sale or contract to sell to Larimer and Babcock and Barlow.
2nd', because the claimant by moving off had abandoned the premises
and all his claim or interest in them. He had no existing interest.
(Held under consideration).
Claim No. 32. Perry Knapp. S. W. ', Sec. I5, T. 8. S. R.
T7 W. Claim allowed without objection. (State Building Lands).
Claim No. 33. Robert Cathcart. N. W. fract. 4, Sec. 25, T.

Claim No. 34. Matthew Reading. N. W. fract. ~4 Sec. I7, T.
8 S. R. I8 W. Claim allowed without objection.
Claim No. 35. Jesse Smith. N. E. 4, Sec. I4, T. 8 S. R. I4
W. Upon argument, after hearing the proof, this claim     was
rejected.
Claim No. 36. Lewis Bryant. N. E. 4, Sec. I7, T. 8 S. R.
I8 W. Claimant being sworn says he moved onto the premises
in I835, with his family and' has lived there ever since. Entered
for his own benefit, and has never sold or agreed to sell his interest
or claim. I live on the E. '2 of the quarter, and the W. VI is
now occupied by a man whose name is Ames. He moved on in
April 1838, and purchased out my brother who went on that half
of the quarter, about the time I went onto my half. Ames and
his family are yet there.
Benjamin Reading sworn as a witness confirms this statement of Bryant as to occupation, improvement, etc.
The same ground was taken in relation to this claim as in
the case of Watson Roe (No. 21) and the same decision made.
Claim No. 37. Isaac Howe. N. W. 4, Sec. 14, T. 8 S. R. I8
W. Claimant being sworn says he moved onto the premises in
Oct. I836, and has lived there ever since except about three months
of the winter of 1839. Previous to claimant's going on a man by
the name of Sanford had made a small improvement and partly
built a house. He, however, never moved onto the premises. In
June or about that time in I836, Sanford gave claimant these
improvements and' abandoned them. Claimant after that went on
and kept up,the fences and trimmed the nursery but made no
clearing or improvement prior to the time he went on with his
family. Claimant has never sold or agreed to sell his claim. He
now resides upon it. Improvements are about 3 acres.
Frederick Howe, a witness for claimant, being sworn, says
that sometime in the summer of I836, his brother, the claimant
told him that Sanford had given him the improvements on the
premises claimed. Claimant's family was then in New York and
did not arrive here and move on the premises until October I836.
Witness never saw claimant at work on the premises before he
moved on 'them. The lot 'is one mile from witness's place of
residence-does not know  that claimant made any improvement
previous to Sept. 20, I836. Claimant has lived on premises ever
since Oct. I836, and now lives there.
On this evidence this claim was objected to on the ground that
claimant had not occupied or improved premises previous to Sept.
20, 1836. (Case retained for further consideration.)
Claim No. 38. William Reading and Roswell Rice, joint claim.
S. E. 4, Sec. 17, S. R. I8 W.
William Reading, one of the claimants, being sworn, says he
moved onto the premises claimed in November I836. There had




I36


JULY MlEETING, 1840


been a previous occupant who built the house I moved into previously to moving onto the lot with his family, and in the summer
of I835, claimant went on and ploughed 4 or 5 acres, but made no
other improvements. Can't say that he made any improvements
before he moved on in I836. Has lived on premises ever since
except a few months in the Spring of I837 when he moved off to
attend a sawmill in the neighborhood with the intention to return.
The former occupant of the house left it about three weeks before
claimant moved on. Has never sold or agreed to sell his claim.
Roswell Rice, the other claimant, being sworn, says that lie
bought a claim to this lot in Oct., I835, and went to work on the
land. He boarded with a family then occupying the premises until
December, I837, when    he  moved  onto  the  premises  with
his family who had been at the east. Has lived there ever since
with his family. Sold his claim  and improvements this Spring
but did not receive any pay. He was by the contract which was
in writing to have received $I50. to be paid when the purchaser,
Emory Smead, took possession. The time he was to give possession
was stated in the contract, but claimant does not recollect when it
was. He intended to move away. This contract was cancelled and
destroyed yesterday.  It was cancelled because we concluded it
would prevent our holding the claim. Smead wanted to be off, and
I finally concluded to have the contract cancelled.
Lewis Bryant sworn as a witness confirmed' the facts stated by
claimants as to residence, occupation, etc. This claim was objected
to; Ist, as against Reading that he had not proved an occupation
and improvements within the meaning of the statute previous to
the time the premises were selected for University purposes; 2nd,
as against Rice that by his sale or agreement to sell he had
divested himself of all rights and had forfeited his claim; 3rd, that
Rice did not occupy and improve within the meaning of the Statute
previous to the selection by the agent of the University.  (This
claim was retained for further consideration.)
Claim No. 39. Frederick Howe, Junior. N. W. 4, Sec. 12, T.
8 S. R. I8 W. Claim objected to and disallowed.
Claim No. 40. James Kennedy. N. E.,4, Sec. 12, T. 8 S. R.
I8 W. Claim objected to on the evidence and rejected.
Claim No. 41. Benj. Reading. S. W. 4, Sec. 17, T. 8 S. R.

Claim No. 42. Thomas McCartney. S. E. fract. ~, Sec. I5,
T. 8 S. R. I7 W. and N. E. f. 4, Sec. 22, T. 8. S. R. 17 W.
Claim good as against the State but disputed as between claimant
and Wm. Jaquette. (State Building Land.)
Whole number of claims presented at Niles, 42. Of these
there are on the State Building Lands, all of which are allowed, 5.
Whole number of claims on University Lands, 37.     Of those
adjudged bad and rejected, II. Reserved for further consideration
and undecided when I left Niles, 3. Number of claims on University Lands allowed, 23. The above statement contains the testimony
taken only in those cases which in my opinion were either doubtful
or else most clearly decided wrong, and those which were reserved
by the Commissioners and undecided when their sitting closed.
Should it be wished I can furnish the Regents the testimony in
every case. This, however, will not perhaps be thought necessary

as the Commissioners caused all the testimony to be reduced to
writing and signed by the persons swearing. This will no doubt
be returned with their report.
Very Respectfully,
(Signed) S. BARSTOW.
To the Regents of the Michigan
State University.
Dr. Pitcher su'bmitted a certified copy of a resolution of
the Legislature of this State, entitled, "A joint resolution
relative to the University of Michigan," and moved that
the same be referred to a Select Committee of three consisting of Messrs. Duffield, Kearsley, and Fletcher, to report
at the next quarterly meeting.
Mr. Trowbridge from the Building Committee made the
following report, which was accepted.
The Building Committee of the University of Michigan have
the honor to report to the Board of Regents, that, in pursuance
of the resolution adopted at 'the last quarterly meeting of the
Board, they have entered upon the erection of the Main Building
for the University.  By the resolution alluded to they were
restricted to the sum of Sixteen thousand dollars for the cost of
the building.
They proceeded immediately after the adjournment of the
Board to invite sealed proposals for furnishing the materials and
performing the labor for the whole or any part of the said building,
and in order to obtain the same upon the best terms, as well as to
afford to mechanics and furnishers of materials an opportunity to
participate in the competition usually attendant upon public contracts, notices were published in the newspapers at Ann Arbor and
Detroit. On the day appointed, the Committee met at Ann Arbor
for the purpose of receiving and examining the proposals, to which
duty they devoted the whole of one day and part of another. The
proposals, fifty-two in number were found to differ greatly in
amount and they were carefully reduced to an abstract form and
preserved for the inspection of the Board. Having ascertained that
the most economical plan for the erection of the building would
be to select from separate proposals for materials and labor, those
which were lowest in price, rather than to take any proposal for
the whole together, the Committee did not hesitate to adopt this
course, and they have accordingly made contracts for the stone,
brick, lime, sand, timber, boards, nails, etc., and for all the labour
necessary to the completion off the building, and they are happy
to say that the building is now being erected in conformity thereto.
They did not make their contracts, however, without having first
satisfied themselves that the total cost of the building by this
method would be several thousand dollars less than by any other,
and that it would be within the sum limited by the Board in their
resolution of April last.
The glass, locks, paint, and other material which cannot be
advantageously procured in the way of contract previously made
(the quality of these articles being various and the prices fixed
thereto respectively) the Committee propose to procure at one of




1:,


JULY M iEETING, 1840


the eastern cities through the agency of the Superintendent employed by them.
The building is now under the superintendence of Mr. Haspier
Lum, who was appointed to this office under the resolution of the
Board to 'this effect, adopted at the last quarterly meeting, at an
annual salary of $I,ooo, besides travelling expenses when necessarily
employed in the business of the Board, and whose skill, industry,
and integrity, have been so fully and satisfactorily exhibited to
the Board of Regents in the erection of the Professors' houses.
Respectfully submitted,
J. KRARSULY, 
WM. A. FLTCHIR,    Committee.
C. C. TROWBRIDGE, 
Ann Arbor, July 7th, I840.
Dr. Pitcher submitted the invoices and vouchers of Dr.
Asa Gray relative to the purchase of books, etc., which
were referred, on his motion, to the Committee on Finance.
On motion of Maj. Kearsley,
Resolved, That the Building Committee be instructed to employ
Mr. Geo. Corselius temporarily to take charge of the books and
documents belonging to the University, until such time as the
Library can be permanently fitted up, at such compensation and
under such regulations as said Committee may prescribe.
On motion of Maj. Kearsley, Messrs. Duffield and
Pitcher were added to the Committee on. the Library.
On motion of Maj. Kearsley, the following preamble
and resolution were adopted:
WUHIREAS, The Building Committee for the erection of Professors' buildings so varied the original contract with Haspier
Lum as to require the labourers of eastern workman to stucco the
buildings, therefore,
Resolved, That said Lum be allowed five per cent. premium
upon such sum as may meet his contract for said wvork, not to
exceed Six hundred dollars upon which said premium shall be
paid.
On motion of Maj. Kearsley, the following was ordered
to be placed upon the Journal of the Board:
New Haven, June 3d, I840.
In our opinion the method of stuccoing or rough casting
houses and other buildings of a permanent character, as practised
by Mr. Gill in New Haven and elsewhere, is worthy of much confidence. Particularly so if clean washed silicious or granite sand
lime of a good quality and hydraulic cecment to the amount of one
half the lime used (i. e. equal parts of common and hydraulic lime)
can be obtained. The houses in New Haven done by Mr. Gill in
the mode last named have thus far proved unaffected by the action
of the weather, and are quite dry after the most violent winter
storms, the water falling from the cement as from stone.

Dr. Zina Pitcher,               Detroit, July ISth, I840.
Dear Sir:
The Treasurer of the University has in the State Bank a
deposit of about four thousand dollars which the Bank is unable
to pay except by assigning its securities. Its officers have now




I 40


FOURTH JULY MEETIAG, 1840


liberty to transfer and are daily transferring such securities in
payment of its liabilities and are disposed to give to the University
a preference in selection, if they choose to accept it. The suggestion is made in consequence of an unfavorable alternative received from the heavy Eastern creditors of the institution, which
if adhered to, must inevitably place its affairs in the hands of a
Receiver. Should you think proper to communicate this proposition
to the Board of Regents, such measure, to be effectual, should
be adopted at the earliest practicable opportunity.
I remain respect'y,
Your obt. Servt.,
Gto. F. PORTER.
On motion of Maj. Kearsley,
Resolved, That the above communication be referred to the
Committee on Finance, with full power and authority to adjust and
settle the claim therei'n referred to and to take such securities for
its ultimate payment as they may deem proper, and further to grant
in the name of this Board acquittance for the money due this Board
from the said Bank.
On motion of Chancellor Farnsworth, Rev. Geo. Duffield
was appointed one of the Committee on Branches in the
place of G. O. Whittemore, whose term of office as a member of the Board of Regents has expired.
Maj. Kearsley, from the Building Committee, reported
that the plan of the Building now     being erected at Ann
Arbor for the University had been so far changed from
the original design that the exterior is to be finished with
stucco instead of being painted, and that the expense of this
alteration would not be material, while the appearance of the
buildings would be uniform.
The report was adopted and approved.
On motion of Judge Wilkins,
Resolved, That the sum of One hundred dollars be appropriated for the payment of the annual salary of the Librarian, provided he reside at Ann Arbor.
Resolved, That the Building Committee be authorized to provide
temporary shelves in one of the Professors' houses at Ann Arbor
for the Library.
On motion the Board adjourned until Friday evening,
the 2Ist August next.

Esq., Dr. Pitcher, and Maj. Kearsley.
On motion M\aj. J. Kearsley was appointed President
pro tempore.
Mr. Schoolcraft, from    the Committee on the Library,
submitted the following report, which, on motion of MAr.
Farnsworth, was accepted.
Report of Committee on0 Library.
The Library Committee have examined with as much attention
as the time would permit, the Catalogue of Books purchased 'in
Europe for the University by Dr. Gray and derive satisfaction from
being able to express to the Board of Regents the opinion that
the trust committed to Professor Gray has been executed in a
manner which reflects much credit upon his judgment and discrimination in the selection and cost.
The collection numbers 3,700 volumes, embracing the various
departments of history, philosophy, classical literature, sciences and
arts, jurisprudence, etc.  A  large proportion of it, consists of
works which could not be obtained in America and many of the
editions are scarce and rare in Europe.
We deem it fortunate for the interests of the Institution that
such a basis has been laid for building up a Library which shall do
honor to the Institution, and we trust its claims upon the funds of
the Board for an annual and permanent increase, may be steadily
borne in mind.
We have the satisfaction to add that the entire collection has
been received and opened at the University buildings at Ann Arbor,
to which place the Committee are about to forward the valuable
but limited number of volumes elsewhere purchased.
The invoices of books purchased by Dr. Gray amount to
I,036, I8s, 7d,, or $4,606.55, upon which has been paid $I44.93 for
freight and charges and $35.75 for insurance, all which they beg
leave to recommend to be audited by the Fiscal Committee at the
sums charged.

"relative to the University of Michigan," Approved March
25th, I840, made the following report, which, on motion of
Judge Wilkins was accepted and adopted.
Report of Select Committee
on
Joint Resolution of Legislature.
Board of Regents, Dec. 3Ist, I840.
To the Honorable, the Senate and House of Representatives
of the State of Michigan:
The Board of Regents of the University of Michigan respectfully present to the Honorable the members of the Senate and
House of Representatives, of the State of Michigan, the following
report in obedience to the joint resolution, "relative to the University of Michigan," approved March 25th, I840.
The resolution requires the Board of Regents to report to
your Honorable bodies at the commencement of your session, "if
any changes and what are necessary in the Organic Law of the
State relative to said University, in order to secure more effectually
the objects of the same."
The Board of Regents having duly considered this subject,
respectfully state that changes are needed and such as were contemplated in the Bill No. 36, on the file of the Senate for I840 and
herewith presented, as containing the views of the Board. The
first change in the Organic Law deemed essential is the proper
'restriction of responsibility to the Board of Regents. At present
the responsibility is dividedi and' the Board would be greatly facilitated in their action were such amendments made of Title I2th,
Chap. ist, Part Ist, of the Revised Statutes of this State as would
throw entire responsibility on the Board and require them to report
their annual Proceedings to the Legislature.
The second change relates to the trust and management of
funds of the University. Under the existing Law it is impossible
for the Board to adapt their measures to their means, or to project
or execute such plans as the interest of education, the wants of
the State, and the resources of the University may demand. The
machinery contemplated in Title II, Chap. 2, Sections I5 and 16,
is too complicated and cumbrous and the duties imposed on the
Superintendent of Public Instruction in connection with the University unnecessary and onerous.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
On motion, the President of the Board pro tempore, was
instructed to transmit a copy of the above Report to the
President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives of this State.
Mr. Schoolcraft, from. the Select Committee appointed
to prepare the Annual Report of the Board to the Superintendent of Public Instruction, made the following' Report,
which, on motion of Judge Wilkins, was accepted and adopted.




I46


JALNUARY MEETING, I841


Board of Regents,
Detroit, Dec. 3Ist, I840.
Sir:In obedience to a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
on the 22d inst. the undersigned fulfill in their behalf a requirement
of the statute by presenting their Third Annual Report.'
In organizing a Board of Regents to carry out the views of
the Legislature in the establishment of a University, it is conceived to have been the primary object of this body to extend its
benefits as widely and at as early a period throughout the State.
as the wants of the community and the means at their disposal
would permit.
And their attention was therefore called at an early day to the
location and establishment of Branches of the University at suitable
points, where the branches of a classical and English education,
preparatory to the entrance of the students into the parent Institution, should be taught. This object has been steadily pursued, not
only from its being the appointed means for preparing classes for
the final collegiate course, but from the additional consideration
that in a new and hastily settled community it would be one of the
best and most practical means of arousing attention to the value
and importance of the plan of education submitted to the people
in the Organic Act and of thus preparing the public mind to
appreciate and foster it.
To this end the most competent men were sought as Principals
of the Branches, liberal salaries paid them, and every facility
afforded in connection with the exertions of the citizens at the
respective sites of the Branches to render the means of instruction
both efficient and reputable. The Committee on Branches charged
with this duty, have encountered an arduous task in the management of the correspondence, the selection of Principals and teachers,
the examination of reports, and the pecuniary questions which
required decision and adjustment. And the Board owes to it much
of the success which has attended the effort. It was conceived
that the requirements of the Act, and the duty of the Board of
Regents in this respect would have been fully performed by merely
obtaining instructors of competent literary and natural abilities.
disconnected from their moral influence both in the Branches and
in the communities in which they are located. And it has ever
constituted an object to find men, both as Principals and as subordinates, who united sound learning and apt habits of instruction, with
professional assiduity, good judgment, and practical piety. And
the confident hope is indulged that the importance attached to this
principle, in these selections for office, has produced a benign
result.
Of the seven Branches established, five are under the direction
of clergymen, and two, of laymen, of various religious denominations. Two clergymen are also embraced among the Assistants
and Tutors, the whole number of whom add to their literary qualifications, those arising from religious considerations.
The Board cannot, they believe, be mistaken in the importance
they attach to the connection between learning and morals, science
and religion; and,.at any rate, they would be unjust to themselves
not to express the belief that success cannot permanently crown
''The First and Second Annual Reports of the Board wvere not entered
upon the Records of the Proceedings.




JANTUARY MEETING, I841

the Institution committed to their management after this ligament
is severed.
By reference to the catalogue of teachers and students here
with 'submitted, marked A, it will be perceived that twenty teachers
and Professors of all grades have been employed during the year,
who have instructed an average number of 236 scholars in the
various Branches of Classical and English Literature. A steady
increase of the number has taken place in the respective terms for
the year, the last and highest of which numbers 247.
These students have been distributed in seven Branches eligibly
located at some of our most promising villages and towns in various
parts of the State. A respectable proportion of them have studied
the Languages and higher branches of Mathematics; and the proficiency evinced has been generally such as reflects credit both
upon the Instructors and pupils.
At four of the Branches, namely, at Monroe, White Pigeon,
Niles, and Tecumseh, there have been Female Departments under
appropriate Instructors, where English branches only have been
taught. The effect of home schools in this Department has been
propitious, and they constitute a branch of higher instruction, contemplated by the Act, which is highly appreciated by -the inhabitants. In view of the whole amount of instruction furnished, its
character and distribution, it may be asserted that in no previous
year has the Institution, through its Branches, rendered equally
important service to the State.
While the Board has devoted so large a share of its attention
to the Branches, it has not overlooked the paramount duty connected with the parent Institution at Ann Arbor. During' the year
four Professors' dwellings of a substantial, appropriate, and classical model have been finished and prepared for occupation at the
University site, and the Main Building commenced and carried
forward with spirit.
This building has been carried forward to its height and roofed
and is now in process of completion, and will, it is anticipated, be
finished and ready for occupancy in the autumn of 184I. In addition to which, the grounds, which embrace a quadrangular area of
40 acres have been enclosed in a neat and substantial manner, and
other improvements made.
One of the Professors' dwellings has been temporarily appropriated to the reception of the Cabinet of Natural History which
has been provided or is in the process of accumulation for the use
of the Professors and students in the various departments. And
these collections are about to be opened and arranged under the
direction of Dr. Houghton. It is known that early after the organization of the Board of Regents, they laid a foundation for this collection by the purchase of the Mineralogical Cabinet of Baron
Lederer, of Austria, which affords so far specimens representing the
mineral kingdom, not to be excelled on this side of the Atlantic. To
this have been added the extensive and valuable collections in geology, mineralogy, botany, and zoology, made within the geographical
area of Michigan by the State Geologist and his exploring corps.
This collection is due to the forecast of the Legislature who directed
their attention to the subject at one of their earliest sessions after
the admission of the State into the Union. The specimens are the
result of an assidious reconnoissance of three years' continuance,
embracing all parts of the State, from the southern and eastern




148


JANUARY MlEETING, I841


counties to its farthest northern and western limits, on Lakes Huron and Superior. And, if may be pertinent to add, that much of
the information thus brought to light is believed to be of practical
importance aside from the value of the specimens as illustrations
of the principles of science.
Dr. Gray was authorized to visit Europe immediately after his
appointment, for the purpose of advancing the Institution in the
respective departments committed to him and was furthermore commissioned to make the incipient purchases for a Library. The sum
of five thousand dollars placed at his disposal for this object has
been judiciously laid out by him. in the execution of this commission.
Three thousand seven hundred and seven volumes have been received and opened at Ann Arbor, for the character and value of
which the Committee beg leave to refer to a report accompanied
by a catalogue herewith submitted and marked C, which was made
to the Board at a meeting convened on the 22d inst.
The disbursements made during the year, designating the several heads of expenditure, a comparative schedule of the cost of
sustaining the Branches, and the general state of the funds, are
exhibited in a series of fiscal tables, herewith enclosed and marked
B, and denote the facts referred to. It was impossible that the estimates and anticipations entertained at the enactment of the organic laws establishing a University, at,the height of the general
fiscal crisis of 1836-7 should not have partaken in some measure of
the excited and oversanguine spirit which characterized all fiscal
calculations of the time; and the undersigned would not fully acquit
themselves of their duty to the Board or to the community in closing this Report without adverting to!the fact that the receipts for
land sold and the installments for interest accruing thereon, have
fallen short of the estimates. Acting on the principle which is believed to be true, that 'intellectual labor in all the departments of the
instruction should be well paid and encouraged in carrying it out,
by the actual condition, of the permanent funds of the Institution,
liberal salaries were awarded to the Principals of the Branches and
Professors (so far as appointed) and have been paid without delay
or deduction to. the present time. And they cannot but regard this
course of policy as one of the causes of the actual efficacy and success which has marked the course of instruction generally, at the
Branches. These salaries have been paid without respect to the
number of students taught and enrolled on the catalogues of the
Branches, each Principal of which has been held accountable for the
amount of tuition fees received, according to the rules and the
amount of tuition fees per term, established by the Regents, receiving from the latter the stipulated salary. That the Branches, although affording a sound and reputable description of instruction,
have been maintained at a comparatively high expense to the parent
Institution, is not to be denied, and it is.a question, in view of the
prospective and diminishing state of the funds and the increasing
demands of the University at its central point, whether the same
system should be indefinitely continued, or a connection established
between the amount of salary paid and the numbers taught. Disconnected from the question of finance, sound principle is thought
to forbid any respect to this relation.
A teacher's best abilities are as fully required to teach a few
as many. Even the time he devotes in the former case is out of
proportion and in excess to the diminished number of his pupils;




JANUARY MEETING, 184I


I49


and were it not, he is ready and willing to devote the whole number
of hours daily to his classes, which he owes to the public under circumstances of the fullest attendance of scholars. We have arrived
at a point in the establishment of the Institution when the organization of a Faculty at Ann Arbor and the opening of the University
proper is a consideration of moment, and the hope is entertained
that this may be brought about before the close of another year.
That it is expedient to attempt such an; organization without appointing a full Faculty, admits of no doubt. A limited number of
Professors would temporarily answer all the purposes of the incipient and limited classes, and the duties of Chancellor could be appropriately assigned to be performed ex officio, agreeable to the
principles of a resolution adopted by the Regents in the winter of
1838. Advanced as the Branches are in these means of instruction,
the instances are not single in which students who have gone
through the preparatory courses have gone into other states to complete their education; and we have no doubt from the facts before
us that a respectable and adequate number of students could
be enrolled for the final course at the University as early as the
main building for recitation and lecture rooms and dormitories,
now in progress, is completed. To accomplish this, however, with
our present funds without crippling the Branches or devising some
additional means for their support from the surrounding communities, will not be of easy attainment.
While the permanent funds of the University are of undiminished intrinsic value, and confidence is felt in the final ability of the
purchasers of University lands to pay up their installments and
interest, there need be no wellgrounded apprehension that the present annual receipts from these sources will be eventually diminished.
Nor can there be more reason to fear that the prices of the valuable and well selected portions of the lands, still held by the Institution, will not rise and sales be resumed, with the returning prosperity of the country.  Whether sources thus really ample and
which may be eventually relied on without fallacy, constitute
grounds in the present state of the Institution to justify the anticipation of their proceeds by a further loan, in order to consummate
on object so closely identified with the cause of education in the
State, is a question that has suggested itself to the Board, and it is
one that will receive all the consideration it merits.

WHHEREMAS, It appears from the report of the Committee of
Finance, that owing to the disasters of the times, which have nearly
altogether prevented the sale of University Lands and the collections
of the installments and interest due on those heretofore sold, as
well as the interest on the moneys loaned to the counties by the
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and owing to the proximate
exhaustion of the loan of $ioo,ooo, authorized by the Legislature,
in the necessary expenses incurred by the erection of buildings and
improvements of grounds at Ann Arbor, the purchase of a Library
and Mineralogical Cabinet and the support of the Branches, it will
not be possible for the Board of Regents, under present circumstances to appropriate the same annual amount they have heretofore
done for the support of the Branches.




JANUARY MEETIA;G, 184I


i65


AND, WnHEREAS, The Board having no control or direction in
the management of the revenue, arising from the lands of the
University, and therefore having no data on which to found hope
for the future, but what may be obtained contigently from the
action of the Legislature, or of the Superintendent, cannot feel
themselves authorized to sustain or incur responsibilities they do
not know how, and have no authority, to provide for themselves.
AND, WHEREAS, There is reason to believe that the change which
has taken place in the expenses of living in different places during
the past year, and the success thus far attending the efforts to
establish the Branches, that the appropriations, without doing injury
to the teachers or the Branches, may be so graduated as to meet
the exigency of the times, to preserve the system at present in
operation, and to prepare the way for the organization of a Collegiate Faculty.
AND, WHEREAS, Further serious doubts are entertained whether
there may not be a salutary change made in the Branches, so as to
equalize the appropriations to each, and leave room for the skill,
reputation, and industry of the Principals to increase their receipts
by giving in addition to such appropriations the entire amount of
tuition fees, therefore,
Resolved, Ist, That the first blank in the foregoing resolution
be filled with the words, "the nineteenth day of April next."
2nd. That this Board do now proceed to fill the residue of
the blanks in the foregoing resolution with such sums as shall
be deemed expedient for each of the Branches respectively.
3rd. That the Committee on Branches be and they are hereby
directed to enter into a correspondence with the Principals of all
the Branches named in the foregoing resolution whose annual
appropriation shall be reduced by the filling up the blanks under the
provisions of 'the last preceding resolution, and explain to them the
causes which have compelled this Board with great reluctance to
adopt this course, it being the only alternative, in their opinion, by
which the Branches can be sustained through the present crisis,
and their future usefulness permanently secured, and endeavor to
establish such arrangements with them as shall be best calculated to
accomplish the objects contemplated in these resolutions.

I7o


SECOND APRIL M1AEETITNG, 1841


On motion of Maj. Kearsley the report was adopted.
Dr. Pitcher submitted the report of the Principal of the
Detroit Branch, which, on motion, was ordered to be placed
-upon the files of the Board.
iMIr. Duffield, from the Select Committee appointed at the
last meeting of the Board by resolution relative to 'the organization of a Faculty in the central Institution, made the following' report, which was accepted.
Report of Select Commtittee on Orgalntialtion of University:
The Committee to whom was referred the consideration of
the subject of the most suitable time and mode of organizing the
Faculty of the University, present the following report:
It is the unanimous conviction of the Committee that the time
has come for the adoption of some measures for this purpose.
Some of the youth in the higher classes of our Branches will
presently have to leave the State to complete their education if
a Collegiate Faculty is not soon organized. The wishes and expectations of the people urge it. Our buildings will be sufficiently completed in a few months to afford every facility for Professors and
students and our duties and responsibilities under the direction of
the Legislature cannot be fully met without attempting it at the
earliest possible period. The interest and prosperity of our several
Branches require it.
Bu't while these considerations leave no doubt in the minds
of the Committee as to the propriety of the earliest practicable
attempt to organize a Faculty, it must be confessed that embarrassments of a serious nature present themselves. The funds obtained by loan which have been appropriated for the support of
Branches, for the erection of buildings, and for other necessary
purposes, are not adequate as a permanent endowment to meet the
expenses of even a very limited number of Professors. The uncertainty attendant on the collection of the revenues of the Board
by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, as proved by the
experience of the last two years, prevents any confident anticipations of any immediate or adequate increase of means. The destitution of all power on the part of the Board to adopt any measures
for the management of the funds belonging to the University and
the inexpediency and indeed impracticability of obtaining further
sums of money by loan to meet the demands and expenses of the
Institution, it is to be feared will render an experiment on this
subject precarious. After the bills yet due for the completion of
the public expenses as far as it is intended or as it may be
necessary to carry them for the present, as well as for the support
of the Branches and other incidental expenses to the 6th of August,
1841, there will be left in the Treasury the sum of $I4,667.48. This
sum will not be more than adequate for a year or two to support
the Faculty and meet the expenses necessary at the commencement
for the purchase of an apparatus, etc., and other expenditures to be
incurred there. Moreover, there is reason to fear that when competent and qualified gentlemen may be appointed either as Chan-;cellor or Professors, their inquiries as to the state of our funds




SECOND APRIL MEETING, 1841


I71:and their competency for a permanent support may not be met by
disclosing the actual condition of our finances in a way sufficiently
satisfactory to secure the acceptance of our invitations. Probably,
too, the number of students at the first will be comparatively small,
so as to make the total expense in support of a Faculty appear to
many to be too great an amount. Yet in view of all these grounds
of fear, the Committee feel pursuaded that having 'made all the
necessary preparations within the Board, they should proceed without delay to organize a Faculty. Believing that the Legislature will
not withhold the powers and means necessary for carrying on and
perfecting the work begun, we have nothing to do but go forward,
evincing ourselves a confidence in their legislation and zeal for
the interests of education and endeavoring to inspire those to whom
we may address our invitations with similar feelings. Much legislation is not needed. Far better will it be for us to proceed cautiously, prudently, economically and gather wisdom by experience,
than be trammeled by enactments either sketched in haste or unwise
theoretical attempts to give shape and character to what must ever
in a very great degree depend upon contingent events. The experience of the two or,three years past has proved ithat the powers
which the Board at present possess are totally inadequate' to the
efficient prosecution  of the great objects entrusted  to them.
A Bill was introduced before,the Legislature the winter before
-last containing some provisions which, had it been enacted, would
have given the Board the powers needed, but others somewhat
questionable. The subject was referred by the Legislature to the
Board and they were required to report to the Legislature at the,commencement of their next session on the subject. This was done,
but as yet there has been no enactment by the Legislature such as
the Board solicited.
The number of students offering for the first two or three
years will not render necessary more than three gentlemen of the
Faculty, or two with one or two Tutors. The Board will judge
whether it is advisable to organize a Faculty in part without a
Chancellor, or appointing a Chancellor to require from him in. the
early period of the Institution a more extensive and active participation in 'the instruction of the several classes, than it would be
reasonable or proper to expect when the number of students and
the cares and burdens and responsibilities of government shall be
greater than!they will be for some time. The departments which
it will be necessary immediately to fill are those of Classical Literature, Mathematics, and Natural Philosophy and the Moral Sciences.
The Languages and "the Belles Lettres" for ithe present might
be confided to the same Professor; both Mathematics and Natural
Philosophy to another; and 'should a third Professor be deemed
expedient, the balance for a year or two might be confided to him.
Or should a Chancellor and one Professor be preferred, a Tutor
or two would afford ample means for an equal distribution of the
labor of instruction so as to comprise the whole range of collegiate
studies. The two Professors' already elected occupy departments
in which their services will not be immediately required and are
at present so occupied as not to subject us to expense' for their
support.
'Dr. Pitcher, from  the Committee on Branches, presented the application of C. W. Fitch, Principal Dietroit

Pitcher, Chancellor Farnsworth, Judge Wilkins, Mr. Jno.
Owen, and Rev'ds Duffield, Comstock, and Kundig.
Chancellor Farnsworth from     the Committee on Professorships, etc., made the following report, which was
accepted:
Report of Committee on Professorships, etc.
The Committee on Professorships, etc., to whom was referred
the resolution of April i6th, 1841, on the subject of the organization
of the University, report:
That they have had the subject under consideration and have
come to the conclusion that under the present pecuniary condition
of the Institution, the appointment of two Professors and a Tutor
at moderate salaries will be all that at present can be done; and
for the purpose of producing an income from tuition and for the
public convenience, it will be expedient to require of the Professors
to be appointed, that they shall organize a Preparatory Department,
to be under the supervision and control of the Faculty; and that
for the present and until the number of students in the University
shall become so great as to render it impracticable, the Professors
shall devote such portion of their time as may be necessary 'to the
classes in the Preparatory Department. And the Committee would




MAY MEETING, 1841


I7 5;


recommend that the selection of Professors shall be made from
persons at present in the service of the University, believing that
we have already among us men quite equal to any we should be
likely to procure from abroad, under the present condition of the
Institution. The Principals of the Branches from whom the Committee recommend that the appointments shall be made, are already
aware of the pecuniary condition and circumstances of the Institu —
tion, and in the event of a contingency occurring which would
render it necessary to dispense with their services', the disappointment and inconvenience to them would be much less than to
strangers called from a distance.
Dr. Pitcher, from the Committee on Branches, reported
that the Rev. C. 'W. Fitch had informed that Committee of
his determination to withdraw     from  the services of the

SECOND JULY JMEETING, 1841


I79


A communication was presented by the Chair, from      H.
K. Sanger, Esq., tendering his. resignation as Treasurer,
being about to remove from    the State.   Accepted.
The Chair also presented the accounts of the late Treasurer, which on motion of Mr. Trowbridge, were referred
to the Committee on Finance.
Mr. Duffield, from the Select Committee, to whom was
referred the application of Mr. Whiting, Principal of the
Niles Branch, for an appropriation of $5oo.oo, made the
following report, which, on motion of Mr. Farnsworth, was
accepted.
Report of Select Coummittee on Professor PVhiting's Claimt.
The Committee to whom was referred the communication of
Mr. Whiting, of Niles, present the following report:
The communication pleads that in accepting to take charge
of the Branch at Niles as Principal and removing his family there,
he was subjected to an expense of $250; that he removed to that
place and faithfully discharged the duties of his office in the
expectation of continuing to receive the salary that had been given
him and which was necessary for the support of his family, and
that now: that salary having been unavoidably reduced without any
fault on his part and he being obliged to remove from the'State,
he felt in his peculiar embarrassments constrained to pray the
Board to remunerate him for the expenses necessarily incurred by
his removal to and from Niles, which would not fall short of
$500, or at least to allow him $400, or the salary of one term, and
to release him on these terms at the end of the current session.
The Committee were apprised that at least another claim of
the same kind would be preferred by another of the Principals, the
Rev. Mr. Fitch, and have therefore given it and the reasons urged
by Mr. Fitch and herewith presented, all the consideration which
fidelity to their trust as Regents and honesty in their intercourse
with their fellowmen required.
On reviewing the history of these appointments the Committee
have found in the remonstrance and accompanying statements of
the Board of Regents' in their communication to the Senate of
Michigan against the passage of Bill No. 41 on the file of the
House of Representatives, presented and contained in documents
No. 33 under date of April 5th, I839, the principles distinctly
avowed which regulated the Board in their appointment of Principals, and the hopes and expectations which these gentlemen might
be supposed to entertain. "The Regents of the University," says
one of these statements,- "have made contracts, as was understood,
in good faith, with the Principals of seven Branches. These gentlemen have been induced to remove from other States and other
literary institutions where it is known they received a support for
themselves and families. It was certainly reasonable, and very
strongly implied, that their situations would be not temporary but
permanent, so long as they continued faithfully and competently
to discharge the duties incumbent upon them. These are the known




I8o


SECOAND JULY iMEETING, I841


and well established terms upon which all literary professors enter
upon their arduous and responsible avocations."
Similar remarks, showing the equity of the claim which Professors dismissed without cause have for indemnity, and showing
from the history of other Colleges that.the vacation of a Professor's
chair for the introduction of another incumbent and appropriate
Committee, are followed by the interrogatory, "Have not the
Principals of Branches, then, an equitable and perhaps legal claim
at least to meet the disbursements incident to their removal from
their places of former residence and for a reasonable time to seek
other employment?" Your Committee think that the claims of Mr.
Whiting and Mr. Fitch fall within the scope of these remarks and
are confirmed by the principles and modes of reasoning already
avowed to the Legislature by the Board this their Committee.
They are precisely.such cases as the Board seem  to have
anticipated in their remonstrance against certain legislative action,
and although it has been with regret land the result of necessity
on the Board so to change the system, as to withhold a salary
and grant but a small allowance, yet in all cases where the Principals shall not consent to remain on the new terms proposed and
are forced to seek other situations for support, the change of the
system becomes tantamount with a removal.
Your Committee therefore recommend that the Committee on
Branches be instructed in the above cases to make such compromise or pecuniary allowance as shall be judged by them to be
equitable in view of all the circumstances.
On motion of Mr. Farnsworth, the above report was referred to the Committee on Branches.
The Committee on Branches to whom was referred the
above report, reported the following resolution,
Resolved, That under the peculiar circumstances of his case,
the sum of $200 be paid to Rev. Jos. Whiting, Principal of Niles
Branch, should he leave the services of the University at the termination of the present term.
Justice Fletcher moved to amend the resolution by striking out $200 and inserting in its stead, $I50, which motion
was decided in the affirmative.
The resolution as amended was then adopted by yeas
and nays as follows: Yeas: Messrs. Kearsley, Trowbridge,
Fletcher, Morell, Farnsworth, Pitcher, Draper, Owen, and
Kundig. Nays: Judge Wilkins.
On motion of Judge Wilkins, the Board proceeded by
ballot to the election of a Treasurer of the University, in
place of H. K. Sanger, Esq. resigned. Whereupon, Alexander H. Sibley was duly elected, having received eleven votes.

provide such furniture and fixtures for the said building as may be
necessary for the use of the University, and to construct a reservoir to the Main Building; and that the sum of Three hundred dollars including any balance which may remain unexpended after the
appropriation for the said building, be appropriated for the above
obj ect,
On motion, the Board adjourned until tomorrow      evening at seven o'clock,
Detroit, Friday evening, August I3th, I84I.
The Board met pursuant to adjournment.
Presentt: Messrs. Kearsley, Whipple, Wilkins, Draper,
Owen, Trowbridge, Pitcher, Farnsworth, Kundig.
On motion, Maj. Kearsley was appointed President pro
tenmpore.
The Committee on Finance, to whom was referred the
claims of Rev. Mr. Centre and Geo. P. Williams, praying
to be reimbursed for notes of Bank of Michigan, depreciated
on their hands as claimed, made the following report, which
on motion of Judge Whipple, was accepted.
Report of Colmmittee on Finance on Mr. Centre's and Mlr. Williams's Claims.
The Committee on Finance to whom. was referred the claims
of Rev. Mr. Centre and Mr. Geo. P. Williams, report,
Mr. Centre claims of the Regents ithe repayment in current
funds of the sum of four hundred dollars, part of a warrant issued
upon the Treasurer of the University, for which he received payment in the notes of the Bank of Michigan, which notes are now uncurrent. The Committee have ascertained that the warrant alluded
to was issued on the 29th December, 1840, and paid at the Bank the
same day. They are also informed that the notes of the Bank were
as valuable at that time as the common currency is now, being, convertible into coin at eight or ten per cent. discount and that during
the whole of the month of January ithe bank redeemed its notes by
drafts on New York, payable in six months upon which it allowed
two months' interest, thus reducing the actual exchange to the equivalent of four months' interest or about two per cent. The Committee do not therefore, hesitate to express the opinion that no obligation, legal or equitable, rests upon the Board of Regents in regard
to Mr. Centre's claim.
Mr. WVilliams's claim has also been investigated. It is found
that a warrant issued to him on the 2Ist of April, I84I, for three
hundred and forty-nine dollars and on the same day was left by his
agent in the Bank of Michigan, conformably to his custom, where
it was credited to him and where it remains to this day.




184  SECOND AUGUST MEETING, 1841


The Committee on careful inquiry learn that the notes of the
Bank were in a greater degree uncurrent during the month of April
than they were during the year I840 or the month of January, I84I,
being at a discount of ten per cent below other common currency
and twenty-five per cent. below specie. Nevertheless they were generally received by the merchants at par during April and up to theioth of May,at which time they became more depreciated, and they
finally ceased ito circulate as currency on the I5th of May, the
State Treasurer refusing on that day to receive them for taxes..
With this statement of facts the Committee submit the case of Mr.
\Williams to the decision of the Board.

worth, Draper, Pitcher, and Owen, sustaining the Chair..
Nays: Mr. Wilkins.
Maj. Kearsley from the special Committee appointed on
the I2th instant, for the purpose of taking into consideration the expediency of continuing the Branches, etc., made.
the following report, which was accepted.
Report of Select Colmmittee on Expediency of Contilnuing
Branches, etc.
Resolved, That a special Committee of five be appointed to take
into consideration the expediency of continuing the Branches and
the University under the existing organization and to report such
modifications as the pecuniary resources of the Board of Regents
may require. Adopted August 2Ith, I84I.
The Committee to whom the foregoing Resolution was referred,
report, That it be recommended to the Board of Regents to suspend all pecuniary appropriations to Principals or other Instructors
in the Branches at Niles, Monroe, Detroit, and Pontiac, until
such time as the finances of the University may enable the Board
to reappropriate for said objects, provided said Branches or either
of them shall in the meantime, have complied with the terms originally prescribed in the organization of these Branches, in the conveyance of grounds and erection of buildings suitable for said purposes. In recommending all pecuniary appropriations to the Branches enumerated, your Committee feel deep regret in submitting the
foregoing result of their deliberations and subjoin the following
reasons for the consideration of the Board.
Pirst. The very limited financial resources of the Board require an immediate reduction of expenditure. This can only be
effected by the measures recommended because it has been resolvedl
by the Board to organize the parent Institution and this upon a scale
which your Committee believe cannot bear pecuniary contraction.
Second. The citizens resident in the counties where the Branches proposed to be suspended, have been heretofore organized, have
not, with the exception of Detroit, conveyed to the Regents in
trust for the use of such Branch, the grounds, nor have they erected
thereon the buildings, which said citizens covenanted to erect and
complete to the satisfaction of the Regents when 'these respective
Branches were so organized.
Third. Branches will still remain at such locations as, in view
of your Committee, will supply the wants of a large proportion of
the population of the State; Ito wit, one Branch at Tecumseh and
one at White Pigeon for the southern tier of counties of this State,
will also invite the citizens of Northern Ohio and Indiana to lend
their cooperation in the common cause of education. The Branches
at Kalamazoo and Ann Arbor have such locations as to be neither
too remote nor inconvenient of access for the middle and northern
counties. The latter would not have been organized but for the
obvious consideration that the du'ties of its instruction will devolve
upon the Professors of the University exclusively and thus no additional pecuniary appropriation will be required..In conclusion your Committee would repeat the expression of
their reluctance in recommending the present suspension of any one
Branch heretofore organized and no consideration other than the




I86     SEvCOND A4UGUST lfMEETING, I841


limited pecuniary resources of the Board could have influenced their
decision.
The measure will be most gratifying and will be doubtless
adopted at the earliest period when the income of the Regents will
warrant, to reorganize these Branches and also to establish others
in the several counties of this State. The Branches, therefore,
which may be now suspended, will have the assurance that this suspension will not be continued beyond the earliest ability of 'the Regents to revive them.
With-regard to the University proper, your Committee recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:
I. Resolved, That it appears necessary 'to modify and extend
the organization of the University by the appointment of a Professor of Mathematics.
2. Resolved, That Geo. P. Williams, A.M., be transferred (at
his own request) and he is hereby appointed Professor of Mathematics in the University of Michigan.
3. Resolved, That the Rev. Joseph Whiting, A.M., be and he
is hereby appointed Professor of Languages in the University of
Michigan.
4. Resolved, That the Professors of Languages and Mathematics in addition 'to their respective duties in the University proper,
shall also for the present, perform all the duties incident to the
Principals of the Branches of said University.

The Board met pursuant to, adjournment.
Present: Maj. Kearsley, President pro tem1po re, Messrs.

The Minutes of the last two meetings were read and approved.
Dr. Pitcher from    the majority of the Committee on
Branches to whom    was referred the memorial of Mr. M.
Meigs, claiming his appointment as Principal of the Detroit
Branch and an appropriation of $5oo towards his salary as
such Principal, made the following report (Maj. Kearsley
as the minority of the Committee dissenting) which was accepted.
Report of Coztmnittee oni Branches Respecting AMr. lMeigs's
Applicatio n.
The Committee on Branches, to whom was referred!the communication of Mr. M. Meigs, present the following report:
It appears that Mr. Meigs was appointed and invited to take
charge of the Branch in the City of Detroit, as Principal, before
the actual expiration of the term of Mr. Fitch, late Principal; that
he had accepted the appointment, visited the place, and made his
arrangements before ever the question of suspending the appropriation to this or any other particular Branch was agitated in or out
of the Board, as far as known 'to the Committee; and that, having
accepted the appointment on the basis of the $500 appropriation to
each Branch, he had a just claim to be accounted the Principal of
the Branch of Detroit. Should the Regents think that the suspension of appropriations to the Branch cannot be reconsidered, the
Committee think that he has a just claim to the full amount of the
sum, which he had been led to expect when he accepted the invitation, would be appropriated for the support of this Branch.

Mr. Trowbridge from the Committee on Finance, made
the following report, the consideration of which was, on his
motion, postponed until the next meeting of the Board.
Report of the Committee on Finlance on the Claimz of
Isaac Thompson.
The undersigned, Committee on Finance, to whom was referred
the claim of Isaac Thompson, Architect, as Superintendent of the
University Buildings at Ann Arbor, have had the same under consideration and have the honor to report, that on the 'I4th day of
February, 1839, the said Thompson entered into a contract with the
Building Committee in which he stipulated in consideration of the
salary therein agreed upon to render his services as Superintendent
of four dwelling houses to be erected at Ann Arbor and to make
working drawings for the same.
The said Committee agreed to pay the said Thompson for his
services at the rate of $Iooo per annum, payable quarterly and the
said contract contains the following clause, "It is mutually agreed
that this contract may be determined at any time after the expiration of six months by either party giving three months notice of
such intention."
The Committee find that on the I3th day of July, 1839, the
Regents of the University adopted a resolution declaring the said
contract annulled and that on the ioth day of August, 1839, Mr.
Thompson received from the Regents the sum of $5oo for six
months' services up to the 14th August.
Due notice was given to Mr. Thompson of the passage of said
resolution about the time of its adoption and on or about the tenth
of August Mr. Thompson left the State. Mr. Thompson now claims
pay for three months, being the period in said contract specified,
"after the expiration of six months."
The Committee with the foregoing statement of facts, beg leave
to refer the subject to the decision of the Board.

Detroit, November 27th, 184I.
The Board met pursuant to adjournment.
Present: Maj. Kearsley, President pro tenmpore, Messrs.
Duffield, Wilkins, Kundig, Owen, Pitcher, Trowbridge, and
Farnsworth.
Dr. Pitcher from the Committee on Branches, made the
following report, which, on his motion, was accepted and
adopted.
Annual Report of Coimmittee on Branches for 1841.
The Committee on Branches in compliance with a resolution
of the Board, submit the following Report:
At the close of the last academic year, there were in operation
seven Branches of the University, one at Pontiac, one at Monroe,
one at Detroit, one at Kalamazoo, one at Niles, one at Tecumseh,:one at White Pigeon.
At these Branches there were engaged seven Principals and
thirteen assistant teachers, and there were in attendance one hundred and forty-seven male and one hundred female pupils.
Circumstances known to the Board affecting the financial prosperity of the University induced the Regents at an early period, after
closing their Annual Report for S840, to reduce the appropriations
for the support of the Branches to $500 a year for each, in addition
to the amount that might be received for tuition. The change being
prospective, did not go fully into effect until the close of the summer term in August, when the Rev. Professor Fitch and the Rev.
Mr. Centre, each the Principal of a Branch, left the service of the
Board.
Your Committee on being directed by the Board to establish
a Branch at Ann Arbor and to organize Collegiate Classes under
the direction of the Principal of the Branch, transferred to that
post Mr. G. P. Williams, from the charge of the Branch at Pontiac
on whom the Board also conferred the appointment of Professor
of Languages. The Committee in conformity to instructions, gave
public notice of the action of the Board, of the appointment of
Mr. Williams as Principal and Professor and of the qualifications
of applicants for admission to the Freshman class, which are as
follows:




NOVEMBERR MJEETING, 1841                     193
Applicants for admission must adduce satisfactory evidence of
good moral character, and. sustain an examination in Geography,
Arithmetic, the Elements of Algebra, the Grammar of the English,
Greek, and Latin Languages, the Exercise and Reader of Andrews,
Cornelius Nepos, Vita Washingto7ii, Sallust, Cicero's Orations, Jacobs' Greek Reader, and the Evaiigelists.
The transfer of Mr. Williams to Ann Arbor and the resignation of Messrs. Fitch and Centre, left the Branches at Pontiac,
Detroit, and! Monroe to be reorganized, which was done by appointing Rev. Mr. Meigs, an Assistant at White Pigeon, to the charge
of the Branch at Detroit, the latter (Detroit) without the aid of
an appropriation from the Board of Regents, and Mr. S. Hough to
that of Monroe where he rendered valuable services as the Assistant
of Mr. Centre. When the Board at its session in August withdrew
the appropriations to the Principals of Branches at Niles, Monroe,
Pontiac, and Detroit, Mr. Hough and the Rev. Mr. Whiting resigned their appointments as Principals of the Branch at Monroe
and at Niles. These two, as well as the Branch at Pontiac, are, for
the present, suspended. The Branches at Tecumseh, White Pigeon,
and Kalamazoo remain in successful operation, the first under the
direction of Andrew' Harvie, has forty-three pupils in attendance;
the second under the charge of Rev. S. Newberry has thirty-seven
pupils, and the third, over whom the Rev. Wim. Dutton presides,
has forty-six male and thirty-seven female pupils.
Under existing arrangements, the Principals of Branches are
authorized to provide their own Assistants, the Principals only
holding their appointment from the Board. This remark explains
in part the great reduction in the number of teachers employed by
the Board. During the year a Branch has been located at Romeo
in the County of Macomb.

MIr. Duffield, from  the Executive Committee, made the

Report of Executive Commsittee.
The Executive Committee was organized on the I3th of August,
184I, and consists of Messrs. Pitcher, Wilkins, and Duffield. The
1 It is apparent that a number of students were registered in two
departments.




I94


TNOVEMBER MEETING, 1841


duties required' of them are in general the same in reference to the
Main Institution as the Committee on Branches discharge toward
the Branches.
It was made their special duty, in concert with the Professors,
to prepare a Code of Laws for the Government of the University.
The Faculty was organized by the Board on the I3th day of
August, 1841, by the appointment of a Professor of Languages and
a Professor of Mathematics, who are required to organize and instruct the collegiate classes to the extent the number of students
for the present may demand their services.
They are also required to organize and conduct a preparatory
school at Ann Arbor and to discharge towards it the duties required
of the Principals of Branches.
The Committee visited Ann Arbor, and having conferred and
corresponded with the Faculty, it was judged best to avail themselves of the advantage of experience and not for the present to
draft any very extensive Code of Laws, such as may be required
when the University becomes more extended and comprises a greater
number of classes and students. A few general laws, capable of
application by the Faculty to all the exigencies of the government
of the Institution in its incipient condition, were thought to be preferable in every respect to more detailed and minute legislation prospectively to meet contingencies which might not be realized and
which experiences, ere they should arise, would require to be modified.
Accordingly the Code of Laws which has been adopted for the
present is the same with that adopted and in use for the Branches,
as far as their general provisions are applicable to the Main Institution.
Much in the early stage of the Institution will depend on the
wisdom and fidelity, the prudence and zeal, the vigilance and energy, the industry and discernment, of the Faculty. It has therefore been judged best to define the general features of the government, only as a guide to them till future experience may qualify
them and the guardians of the Institution, the better to adapt to the
state of things in the University of Michigan such rules and regulations as are found useful in other Institutions. Under these impressions the schedule of studies for the Collegiate Classes has not been
sketched farther than for the two inferior, viz., the Freshman and
Sophomore, which are all that have been organized. The following are the terms of admission to the Freshman class and the
Studies of that and the Sophomore classes.
TERMS OF ADMISSION.
Candidates for admission to the Freshman class are examined
in Arithmetic, the elements of Algebra, Geography, Cicero's Orations, Sallust, Virgil, Jacobs' Greek Reader, the Four Gospels, and
Latin and Greek prosody, and are required to furnish satisfactory
testimonials of good moral character.
Studies of the Freshman Class.
Jameison's Rhetoric, DeLacy's General Gramm1ar, Livy, Horace..
Delloway's Roman Antiquities, Prosody and Exercises in writing
Latin, Homer's Iliad, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Lysias,




TNOVEMBER MEETING, 1841


I95


Isocrates, Demosthenes, Cleveland's Grecian Antiquities and Exercises in writing Greek, Bourdon's Algebra, Legendre's Geome1try,
Naltural History.
Studies of the Sophomore Class.
Tacitus' History, Germania, and Life of Agricola, Terence,
Suetonius, Greek Philosophers, Homer's Odyssey, Application of
Algebra to Geometry, Trigonometry, Mensuration, Davies' Analytical Geometry anld Descriptive Geometry, Davies' Surveyinig, Whately's Logic and Rhetoric.
The number of students in the Main and Preparatory Institutions and the present condition of both are not accurately known,
as the Committee are waiting for the report of the Faculty.
The prospects of the University are flattering and the Committee think that the short experience since the opening of both has
fully justified the steps which the Board took for the opening of
the Main Institution and organizing a Preparatory Department at
Ann Arbor. All which is respectfully submitted.

Executive Committee.
Mr. Duffield from the Committee on the Library, made
the following report, which on his motion was accepted and
adopted.
The Committee on the Library, report, that the books of which
a catalogue has been printed, belonging to the University, have been
carefully preserved in temporary cases, prepared for them, in one
of the houses for Professors. Since the organization of the Faculty, it has been judged best that measures should be taken for the
purpose of giving the Institution the advantages appropriately accruing to it from the possession of the Library. Rules and regulations
have therefore been prepared, with the co-operation and concurrence
of the Faculty and Librarian, for the purpose of rendering those
advantages available. The following are the regulations which for
the present have been adopted:
Regulations for the Library.
I. The Librarian or his Assistant shall keep the key of the
Library and shall permit none but the Regents of the University
and members of the Faculty to enter the Library except in his
company.
2. The Librarian shall keep a catalogue of the books of the
Library and an account of all books borrowed therefrom, including
the name of the borrower and the time of delivery of the book.
3. The Library shall be open for the delivery of books once a
week on such day and hours as the Librarian may appoint when
all the students of the University may enjoy its privileges under the
restrictions which follow.
4. No book shall be loaned to students except such as may
have been d'istinctly specified by the Faculty as suitable for such
use.
5. No student shall receive more than two volumes at a time
nor retain a volume longer than two weeks, without renewal, nor




I96


NA OVTEMIBER MlEETTING, I84z


lend, nor carry it out of his room except to return it to the Library.
A volume may be renewed only once except by special permission of
a Professor.
6. A student not returning a volume in his possession within
two weeks, shall incur a penalty of twenty-five cents and an additional penalty of fifty cents for every additional week of delinquency, which penalty shall be paid to the Librarian before such student shall have any further use of the Library.
7. Borrowers of books from the Library are forbidden to
write or mark in them or to turn down a leaf.
8. All damages done to books shall be estimated by the Librarian and shall be promptly paid. If a volume shall be lost or
destroyed, the borrower shall pay for the whole set or replace it.
9. Such books as by reason of their great value or scarcity
could not easily be replaced, shall not be loaned but shall be kept
for consultation in the Library.
Io. No person visiting the Library shall be allowed to take
down or put up a volume without permission of the Librarian or
his assistant.
II. Any violation of these rules will be punishable by fine or
exclusion from the use of the Library.
It has been thought altogether impracticable and inappropriate
to the use and design of the College Library that it should be rendered a circulating Library for the benefit of the surrounding population, and therefore books are not to be loaned but as above prescribed. Yet it is a matter under consideration by the Committee
whether it would not be proper to instruct the Faculty and Librarian to afford access to the Library during the presence of the
Librarian at such fixed time to be designated by him, to such as
may desire to consult any of the authors, it being understood that
no work whatever is to be carried out of the Library by such visitants or readers.  Respectfully submitted,

A NOVEl~MBER MEETINAG, 1841


Balance in hands of Treasurer in State scrip..  1,721.95
Balance in hands of Treasurer in notes, etc. of
of Bank  of Michigan.....................  549.97  $8,674.83
Of the sum in the Treasury, the only available portion is the
item of $I,721.95, in Michigan State Scrip, nominally equal in
amount to the outstanding warrants. The Bank of Michigan, having failed, is now closing its concerns. The Committee have not
been able to obtain payment of the balance due by that institution,
but have taken care to put the amount upon interest by demanding payment thereof.
The Bonds and Mortgages taken in payment from the Michigan
State Bank have not been collected. The Committee have heretofore called the attention of the Regents to these Bonds, which are
supposed to be good, and they now renew their recommendation
that they be placed in the hands of an attorney for collection.
From this exhibit it appears that when the outstanding warrants shall have been paid, the available means in the Treasury will
be nearly exhausted. This is a crisis in the affairs of the University
to which your Committee have looked forward with much anxiety.
It has been apparent for the last two years that the principal source
of income, that indeed upon which all the hopes of the Institution
were founded, has, from the operation of causes known -to the
Board of Regents, been rapidly diminishing and at length has almost entirely ceased. The Committee allude to the interest upon
University Lands sold.
By the Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the 30th December, 1840, it appears that
the sales of University lands up to the Ist of'that
month amounted to II,965 4I/I00 acres for the sum
of........................................ $I93,584.0
The interest due upon this sum for the year ending Dec.
Ist,  1841,  is.......................................  3,550.88
The arrearages of interest due on the Ist Dec., 1840, were I9,663.69
M aking.......................................  $33,214.57
Of this immense sum not one farthing has reached the Treasury of the University during the year 1841. The Committee are informed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction that very little
has been collected by him during the present year for interest on
University Lands.
These facts show conclusively the absolute necessity of the
measures recently adopted by the Board of Regents for reducing the
current expenses of the University and Branches.
The annual expenditures under existing regulations may be estimated as follows:
For the pay of two Professors in the University in addition to the tuition fees of the primary school........ $,000.00
For the salaries of the Principals of the Branches at Tecumseh, White Pigeon, and Kalamazoo in addition to
tuition   fees........................................  1,500.00
For the salaries of Secretary, Librarian, and Treasurer..  400.00
For Insurance on University buildings..............     74.00
For Interest on State Bonds...........................  6,000.00
For Incidental expenses...............................   50o.o0
$9,224.00




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1841


I99


The resources of the Board, without reference to interest upon
University Lands sold during the year I84I, the amount of which
is unknown to your Committee are to be derived from the following items.
-Arrearages of interest on land's Ist December, I84I...... $33,214.57
Interest on lands sold prior to Ist Dec., I840, for the year
1842...............................................  I3,550.88
Balance due by the Bank of Michigan..................  6,402.91
Notes and bonds received of Michigan State Bank.......  4,482.30
Notes and certificates of the Bank of Michigan..........  559.97
$58,210.63
How much of this sum can be collected during the year 1842,
your Committee will not venture Ito estimate. So much as is received on account of interest on University Lands will no doubt
ble paid in State Scrip as all debtors to the State have a right by
law to do. But it is feared that even this resource will be exceedingly limited. In the report of the late Superintendent of Public
Instruction for the year 1840 (p. 12) it is stated that, "Many purchasers of Universiity and school lands appear to;have come to the
conclusion to make no further payments until the price is reduced."
What is here predicted of some of the purchasers is no doubt indic-;ative of a dissatisfaction common to all who purchased at the high
prices of 1837 and 1838.
But from the peculiar organization of the Board of Regents,
that body is not only without power to provide a remedy, but destitute of the means of ascertaining the precise nature and extent of
the evil.
The Committee therefore content themselves with bringing the
fact to the notice of the Board, submitting to their judgment the.expediency of an effort to produce relief to the Treasury by relieving its debtors from -a portion of the burthen resulting from the
extravagances of past years. This can only be done by Legislative:action. That, however, may possibly be promoted by proper repre-.sentation from the Regents. The University Lands remaining unsold amount to about Thirty-six thousand acres.
Your Committee annex to this report an abstract of the expenditures of the past year together with a general abstract of all re-.ceipts and disbursements since the organization of the University.

The unfinished business of the last meeting having been
taken up and the Report of the Committee on Branches in
reference to the claim of Mr. M. Meigs, made at the last
meeting, being under consideration, Mr. Duffield moved

Mr. Duffield, from  the Committee appointed to make
the Annual Report of the Board for the present year, made
the following report, which on motion of Dr. Pitcher, was
accepted and adopted:
REPORT OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.
To THEI SUPERINT'NDIEN'T o0 PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.
Sir:The undersigned, in pursuance of a Resolution of the Board
of Regents of the University of Michigan, passed on the 27th of
November ultimo, and, on their behalf, present to you their fourth
Annual Report.
The attention of the Board, which, in their last Report it was
stated had been successfully directed to the Branches and to the diffusion, through them, of the means of much higher instruction than
could be had in Primary Schools and Private Academies, had also
been sedulously bestowed on the necessary means and preparation
for the organization of a Faculty and the opening of the University.
The views by which the Board were influenced in relation to the
Branches, the success attending them, and the measures adopted for
the procurement of a Library, a Mineralogical Cabinet, and specimens in Botany and Zoology, for the erection of Professors' houses
and the Main Building, and for the inclosure of the College Grounds
at Ann Arbor, have already been detailed.




DECEMIBER M/IEETING, 1841


205


During the past year, the main edifice has been completed, a cis-tern sufficiently large to furnish at all times an abundant supply
of water in case of fire, and other conveniences for the occupancy of
the buildings, have been added, and the whole finished in the most
workman-like manner.
The Cabinet of Natural History and the Library, which had
been temporarily placed in one of the Professors' houses, have been
transferred, each, to one of the large rooms in the Main Building
appropriated to their use, so that the benefits of the Library may
be had under the care of the Librarian, agreeably to the rules which
have been adopted by the Board, and where the Mineralogical Cabinet has been opened, and will be arranged under the direction of
Dr. D. Houghton, Professor of Mineralogy, Geology, and Chemistry, whose services in this and other general interests, as a member of the Faculty, have been of great value; although in consequence of the classes not yet being sufficiently advanced, he has
not been required to deliver lectures, or any instructions to them,
in his Department, and has therefore declined any salary from the
Board, but generously rendered his services for the benefit of the
Institution. To the Library there'have been added, during the past
year, the bound volumes of the public documents of this State and
of the United States, togethei with Conzversations Lexicon, in German, thirteen 8vo volumes presented by Dr. Charles W. Bomp, of
La Pointe, Lake Superior, and some six volumes of Spanish and
German Mineralogical works, by Baronl Lederer, late Austrian Con-.sul at New York. The Mineralogical Cabinet 'has been increased
by the addition of a small box of specimens from- Baron Ledierer,
and very considerably by specimens collected during the current
year, by the gentlemen engaged in the geological survey of this
State. The Cabinet of Minerals, purchased. in I837 from Baron
Lederer for the sum of $4,o00 and lately opened by Dr. D. Houghton, who is now occupied in arranging them in cases according to
their scientific classification, proves to be a very rich and: valuable
'collection. It contains; as we are informed by him, almost every
known mineral, with the greater portion of the varieties, and may
be fairly estimated to equal, if not to exceed, any collection of foreign minerals in the United' States, being a much richer Cabinet
than that of Yale which originally cost $20,000 and has since been
greatly increased. In addition to this, the entire Cabinet of the
University comprehends a very extensive collection of rock specimens, fossils, American minerals, together with a Zoological collection of great value, 'altogether forming greater facilities and inducements for study in Natural History than can be had in any Institution in this country.
At an early period after the commencement of the last year, it
was foreseen that by the necessary expenses incurred in the erection of buildings, in the procurement of Library and Cabinet, and in
the support of seven different Branches of the style and character
which have heretofore been reported, the sum $Ioo,ooo obtained on
loan by means of the State Bonds, and put into the hands of the
Board to enable them to commence operations as early as possible
by anticipating the moneys that would become due on the actual
sales of University Lands, would be so far expended as to embarrass the further operations of the Board unless there should be a
greater amount of interest and installments paid in by purchasers
than, from the experience of one or two preceding years it was




206


DECEMBER MEETING, 1841


feared would be realized during the coming year. The reduction
of the minimum price of lands and! the measures for the relief of
purchasers adopted by the Legislature of I840 and 1841, it was believed by the Board, would have an effect contrary to that which
they intended by it, and cause, as has actually been the case, much
less money to be received during the coming year, instead of replenishing the means of the Board. To continue the Branches upon the
system originally established, and to organize the Main Institution,
therefore, it was foreseen, would be impracticable without further
resources than those at the command of the Board; at least, it.
could not be continued for more than a year or eighteen months at
furthest if attempted. The value of the Branches was felt to be'
great, and the importance of opening the Main Institution still
greater, inasmuch as the interests of education called for it, and
all the necessary buildings and preparations had been completed.
The idea was conceived that possibly now since the Branches had
been established and in successful operation, a change might be
made in the system, which wtuld subject the Board to less expense, continue to foster the Branches, and afford means to justify
the opening of the University. Accordingly a change wras resolved
upon, and instead of the Board's undertaking to support the Branches by paying the Principals' and teachers' salaries and receiving the
avails of tuition, it was determined that, from and after the I9th
August, there should be the sum of $500oo appropriated to each
Branch, the Principal be allowed to appropriate the proceeds of tuition to his own use, and to be at the sole expense of employing and
paying his necessary Assistants, as well as meeting all expenses for
repairing buildings. This reduction of expenses, it was believed,
would enable the Board to sustain the Branches and to open the
Main Institution. The effect of -the change, in so far as concerns
the Branches, has been the cessation of three, viz., those of Pontiac,
Monroe, and Niles. The remainder continue to flourish and extend their advantages to ithe places where they are situated. This
change, moreover, has enabled the Board to organize a Faculty and
open the Main Institution.
It was believed that the number of students who might offer,
while they were sufficiently numerous to require some measures to
enable them to obtain collegiate advantages in their own State,
would nevertheless not be sufficient to justify the appointment of a
full Faculty. Should none offer but for the Freshman and Sophomore, the two inferior, classes, it would not be necessary to have
a full Faculty. Two Professors, one for the Languages and the
other for Mathematics, Who might be competent to conduct the
students of such classes in their collateral studies, would be adequate to all the necessary duties, and thus save the Board from the
expense of the salaries of a Chancellor and' other Professors, whose
services in the business of instruction would not be required till the
classes were more advanced. The expense for the support of a
full Faculty would be so disproportionate to the limited number of
students as to make many feel that the expenditure would be altogether too great and thus excite jealousies against the Institution,
and destroy confidence in the Regents. Besides, it was doubted
whether so little certainty as to the future means of the Board under the existing state of things and with no power whatever possessed' by the Regents to attend to, collect, and manage _the revenue
of the University, or to urge the fiscal officers as at present consti



DECEMBER MEETING, I841

tuted by law their guardians, to expedite or coerce the collection of
that revenue, it would be possible to induce any gentleman fully
qualified for the office of Chancellor, or persons selected for their
attainments and worth for the different Professorships, to accept
of appointments, should' they be tendered to them. It would have
most naturally and certainly been asked by such, had they been appointed, "What security can you offer for the payment of our
salaries? What prospect can reasonably be entertained that you
will be able to carry the Institution forward more than another
year? What direction or control have the Regents over the finances
and revenue of the University? On whom shall we be dependent.
from year to year for the payment of our salaries-on the Regents,
or the Superintendent of Public Instruction, or the Legislature?
May we not be subjected to expense and privations in removing to
your State, and after having fairly got into our offices and begun
to discharge our duties, find ourselves deserted, without funds, and
knowing not to whom to look for the payment of our salaries?
And is it at all reasonable for you to ask us to place ourselves in
such embarrassing circumstances, to make an experiment so perilous, or for us to run risks so fraught with danger to our reputation and usefulness, and personal and domestic comfort and peace?"
To all such questions we could have but expressed our confidence in
the Legislature, who might authorize future loans, or coerce the
payment of outstanding interest, or adopt some measure to secure
greater efficiency in the collection of the revenue. The disastrous.
history of Universities and Colleges in different States in this Union,
where the appropriations for their support -were dependent on legislative bodies, changing with every year, and no permanent body of
Trustees or Regents held responsible and furnished, with competent.
power for the collection and management of the revenue, we fear,
would have been appealed to in opposition to all our most sanguine
hopes, that such would not be the history of the University of
Michigan.
These and such like considerations, induced the Board to adopt
the most prudent and cautious plan and one which would not be so
likely to issue in disappointment in the rejection of their invitations.
Having been apprised that several Branches would cease their operations in consequence of the change they had been constrained to
make in the appropriations, and, it being certain that two, if not
more, valuable, worthy and in every respect fully qualified Instructors, known and proved to be such by their service, already as Principals of Branches in the employment of the Board, would thus be
thrown out of their situations, it wa:s judged that no better or more
desirable course could be pursued than to secure the services of
such as might be obtained and transfer them from their places in
the Branches to the Professorships in the University, which must be
immediately filled in order to its being opened. Accordingly, Mr.
Geo. P. Williams, late Principal of the Branch at Pontiac, and the
Rev. Joseph Whiting, late Principal of the Branch at Niles, were
unanimously appointed in August last, Professors in the University,
the former of Mathematics, and the latter of Latin and Greek Languages, and the 25th September ordained for the opening of the
Collegiate Department of the University at Ann Arbor. It was at
the same time, made the duty of these gentlemen to organize the
students who might offer and were qualified, into collegiate classes,
and to superintend their instruction in all the collateral branches of




208


DECEMBER MEETIANG, I84I1


a collegiate education. Believing, also, that a much larger proportion of students who might offer, would not be sufficiently advanced in their studies, to enter, even the lowest collegiate class,
it was determined to organize a Preparatory School for the reception of such, where they might as speedily as possible qualify themselves to enter the University. This Preparatory School has been
put substantially on the same foundation, and subjected to the same
general rules with the different Branches, but is to subject the
Board to no additional expense. The sum of $500 per annum was
voted as the salary of each Professor. The occupancy, free of rent,
by each of one of the houses built for the use of the Professors
Was further voted, and, in consideration of their discharging the
duties of Principal of the Preparatory School or Branch at Ann
Arbor, and conducting free of all expense to the Board, the studies
of the youth in it, they were allowed to appropriate to their own
use, the moneys receivable for tuition, just as under the present
system is done in the-several Branches.
By the Organic Law of the University, the students in the Collegiate Department are exempt from all charges for tuition. An
Executive Committee was 'appointed, whose duties it was resolved by
the Board should be the same in relation to the Main Institution
with those of the Committee of Branches in relation to them. The
report of this Committee, which will be found in the Proceedings of
November 27th, 184I, will show what 'they have done, what is the
schedule of studies, and the general provisions of the government
adopted for the Collegiate Classes.
The experiment thus far, of opening the Main Institution upon
the plan adopted, has more than realized the sanguine expectations
of the Board, and the report of the Faculty which will be found
in appendix (No. I) will show its pre'sent condition, and the measure
of success which has attended it.
The situation of the several Branches will appear from' the report of the Committee on Branches, found in the Proceedings of
Nov. 27th, I841, and the regulations with regard to the Library, from
the report of the appropriate Committee in 'the Proceedings of Nov.
27th, 184I. From the report of the Committee on Finance, which
is also found in the Proceedings of Nov. 27th, I84I, it will be seen
that the balance of money on hand on the first day of January,
1841, was $22,314.73, to which has' been added during the current
year for interest from the Bank of Michigan, '.and for amount of
warrant on the State Treasurer, etc., no more than to make the
total amount of moneys belonging to the Board $25,328.33. After
deducting the various sums due for interest on State Bonds, insurance, salaries of Professors, Principals, teachers, expenses in erecting University buildings at Ann Arbor, and other expenditures,
amounting to $I6,653.50, there remains in the Treasury a balance of
$8,674.83. Of this sum,,the only available portion is the item of
$I,721.9I in Michigan State Scrip, nominally equal in amount to the
outstanding warrants, the condition of the Bank of Michigan having rendered the amount in their hands not immediately subject
to the drafts of the Board, and the balance of the loan having been:anticipated inadvertently by the Treasurer acting in the double capacity of the representative of the Board as their Treasurer, and
of the Bank as their Cashier. -It will be perceived, as the Committee remark, that the affairs of the Board have reached a crisis, and
one which has been looked forward to by the Board with much




DECEMBER MEETING, 1841


209


anxiety. It was hoped that the Legislature of 1840 would have
made such changes in the Organic Law of the University as would
have rendered the collection of the funds of the University more,efficient, and given the Board, who have to bear all responsibility
for the well and faithful management of their trust, the power
absolutely necessary for the prompt and punctual discharge of their
duties. A communication on this subject was submitted at that time
to the appropriate officers of government, being the unanimous expression of the views of the Board. In this, the Board were disappointed. When the Legislature of that year, however, required
from the Board a prompt report to be laid before that of I84I at
the commencement of -their session, it was again hoped that the
subject would not be lost sight of in the crowd of business, but
that the Board would have the powers conferred on them which
are so indespensable to the welfare and permanent success of the
University. In this too, they were disappointed. No action was
had on the subject by the Legislature. Being utterly destitute of
all power to look after the moneys due to the University, and having had but little put into their hands, for 'the last two years by
the payment of interest, the Board had no other means than the
proceeds of the loan negotiated with the Bank of Michigan' by the
authority of the Legislature of 1838. The public expected, and the
state of things called for the opening of the University at the earliest
possible period. This could not be done without appropriate and
necessary buildings. The Board lost no time, therefore, in constructing what in the commencing of the University might be neces-.sary. These have been finished, in a style which does credit to the
State, at a very reasonable cost compared with the excellence, durability, and classic taste of the workmanship, and the value of materials. Moreover, it was required, that Branches should be organized and supported, and the wants and demands of several interesting sections of the State called for it. The Board endeavored, in
both respects, to meet the wishes of the Legislature, and the expectations of the public. They did not anticipate any embarrassment
from the want of means necessary for the carrying on of the University, until it was ascertained that the interest due on the sale
*of land would not be paid, and the action of the Legislature, reducing the minimum price of lands and delaying the payment of the
interest, excited the fears of the Board that there would not be
money enough collected 'to meet the current expenses, to pay the
interest on the loan, and to liquidate it when it became due. The
Board are confident that had the changes in the Organic Law, which
were asked for in 1840 a.nd again in 1841, been authorized, the affairs
of the University would have been not only at this time, but pros-pectively, as prosperous as could be desired. There is much to encourage the Board, and to give the prospect of permanent success,
could they but realize the moneys due.to the University, and receive the interest regularly, accruing from the sale of lands.: Should
their plans be defeated, to this source only, may that defeat be
traced. It appears from the statement of 'the Committee on PiInance, that the resources of.the Board for moneys due and receivable during 1842 without reference to the interest due on University
Lands sold during the year 1841, amounts to $58,210io.62. This sum
would be more than adequate to meet all the necessary expenses of
-the University and Branches, to increase the Faculty, if 'the number,of students' should require it, to pay the interest due on the State




210


DECECMBER M1EETING, i841


Bonds for the loan of $IOO,OOO, to purchase a philosophical apparatus, to commence the botanical garden, to erect a Laboratory, to
contribute to a sinking fund, as well as to meet such unforeseen
and contingent expenses, as are incident to the. commencement of
such an Institution. The Board feel a deep solicitude on this subject, for judging from the experience of the two past years, there
is but little reason to believe that even the amount necessary to
prevent the actual suspension of all appropriations to Branches, and
the dismission of the Faculty, will be collected during the coming
year. Nor can the Board according to the existing laws move in
the matter or employ any means, or influence or agency whatever
for the collection of the funds of the Uni.versity. It is judged but
reasonable that they who are held responsible to the public, and
will be looked to by the Legislature for the faithful discharge of
their trust, would be able to know what are their means and resources, and what they may reasonably expect and calculate upon
from year to year. It is impossible to give any thing like 'consistency and permanency to their plans without this. Already have
they been necessitated to derange their plans, and to adopt measures
which have involved them in unpleasant difficulties with some in
their employ and which have given occasion to others, unacquainted
with the facts, to reproach the integrity and rectitude of the Board.
It is understood that payments of moneys due to the University
are, and will be, made in State scrip, a depreciated currency, which
in their judgment is in violation of the sacred trust reposed in the
guardians of education in this State by the splendid gift of the
donors, and which, if not *arrested and prevented, cannot fail to
subject the Board to the most ruinous embarrassments.
The Committee on Finance have made some suggestions on the
subject of relieving the debtors of the University from a portion of
the burthen resulting from the extravagance of former years, as an
expedient for increasing the annual receipts. But the Board think
that the experiments already made on this subject, afford no grounds
for such hope, and that the trust reposed in them and in this State,
by the government of the United States, as well as their obligations
to the community at large, the interests of science, the welfare of
our entire population, and the character of Michigan hereafter, and
of unborn generations, require a sacred adherence to existing engagements, which may be done without diminishing the resources
of the University, or perpetrating injustice or oppression toward
any of its debtors. The Board deprecate legislative action in this
matter and feel persuaded that a judicious investigation of the entire relations and responsibilities of the claims of the community
for the best disposal of the munificent grant of the United States
for the purposes intended and of the immense importance and
necessity for such a trust to be totally disconnected from and unembarrassed by any political action whatever, will convince every
unprejudiced mind that the funds should be deemed sacred, and
while the Board should be held at all times fully responsible for
the right and best management of them in carrying out the design
of the donor, they should be furnished with the power essential to
the discharge of such duties and responsibilities. The history of all
collegiate institutions in this country dependent immediately on the
State has shown that they have never prospered, as long as they have
been subjected to the influence of desultory legislation, of the uncertainty from year to year whether any system adopted by one




DECEMlBER MEETING, 1841

Legislature might not be changed the next, and of the want of an
efficient Board of Trustees or Regents, of sufficient permanence, and
possessed of adequate power for the responsible care and management of their interests, both literary and pecuniary. The establishment of a collegiate institution in a free state, and the conducting
of its interests, should ever be upon liberal principles, and irrespective of all sectarian predilections and prejudices. Whatever varieties of sect exist in these United States, the great mass of the population profess an attachment to Christianity and, as a people, avow
themselves to be Christian. There is common ground occupied by
them, all-sufficient for co-operation in an institution of learning,
and for the presence of a religious influence, devoid of any sectarian
forms and peculiarities, so essential, not only as the most efficient
policy, but also for the development and formation of the most valuable traits of youthful character, and of qualifications for future
usefulness. Experiments made in other States, by catering to the
morbid prejudices of sectarians, have only embarrassed the institutions of the State, and matured the growth of numerous and rival
colleges avowedly sectarian. Attempts made to exclude all religious
influence whatever from the college, have only rendered 'them the
sectarian of an atheistical or infidel party or faction, and so offended and disgusted the majority of the population agreeing in their
respect for a common Christianity, that they have withdrawn 'their
support, confidence, and patronage, and left them to drag a miserable existence, till they invoked the presence and influence of the
Christian religion in them. The only security that can be had for
the avoidance of sectarianism, and the necessity and desirable influence of Christianity, in the conduct of a collegiate institution,
intended to be the common property of the State, is to be sought in
the character and principle of the men who are placed over it, and
held responsible for its administration. There are men to be found
in all different Christian sects of sufficiently expanded views, and
liberal spirit, and enlightened minds, devoid of the spirit of bigotry
and narrow prejudices of sect and of party, that can be selected
and deputed to such a work, whose public spirit and philanthropy
and whose love of country and attachments to the interests of their
State and its entire population, will always furnish the best and
only true guarantee against the evils of sectarianism. The Board
are happy to state the fact, without meaning in the least to commend themselves, that while they consist of gentlemen from almost,
if not all, the principal Christian sects in our State, there has nothing occurred in their individual intercourse, their deliberations or
debates, or any of their official acts,'which have ever elicited occasion for the expression, or even the existence of jealousy and suspicions growing out of sectarian prejudices or attachments.
All of which is respectfully submitted,

APPENDIX NO. I.
Report of the Faculty.
Pursuant to instructions from the Committee of the Board of
Regents, we proceeded on the 25th of September to organize the
academic classes of the University.  Information previously oh



212


DECE/MBER MEETING, 1841


tained had led us to expect applications for admission to a standing
as far advanced at least as the beginning of the second year. Arrangements were, therefore, made:to organize and instruct the
Freshman and Sophomore classes. All applicants for admission
have been examined, anad six have been received as members of the
Freshman class, while only' one is pursuing the studies of the Sophomore class. Two others who were in advance of the Freshman
class in some studies but deficient in others will join that class next
term. It is hoped that additions will be made to both the classes
before the close of the academic year.
'A Preparatory Department was also organized at the same
time, in which the same course of instruction is pursued as in the
Branches of the University. In this Department, there have been,
during the current term, 'twenty-three students, of whom all but
one are pursuing studies preparatory to the University course, and
seven will probably be able to enter the next Freshman class.
In deciding on the conditions of admission, we have been governed by the general instructions of the Committee, viz., to require
such an amount of previous attainment as would place the University in that respect on an equality with the best colleges in the
United States.
In regard to the plan of studies for the first two years of the
course, which plan has been published by direction of the Committee, some remarks may be proper by way of explanation.
Assuming that the object of the Board of Regents is to furnish
to the youth of our State an opportunity of acquiring a superior
education, we have considered mental' discipline and mental furniture as the two great points 'to be kept in view in the arrangement
of studies, the selection of text-books, and the method of instruction.
Although the lattei of these two points may never be lost sight of,
yet the former seems to require special attention in the early part
of the academic course. In this part, therefore, those branches of
study are presented, and those methods of instruction pursued which
seem best adapted to form in the student, habits of fixing the attention, directing the train of thought, and analyzing with nice discrimination, balancing carefully, evidences presented to the judgment, and arranging and systematizing the knowledge acquired by
memory. The study of ancient languages and of pure mathematics.,
therefore, occupy the greater part of the first two years in the
course. The recitations and exercises in 'these branches are conducted in a manner that is designed to throw the student as much
as possible upon the resources of his own mind, to rouse his individual energy and to give those habits of mental activity without
which the best apparatus of libraries. and scientific collections can
do little more than afford the means of idle amusement.
We are of opinion that the text books named in our schedule of
studies for the first two years,.should so far as the department of
languages is concerned, be regarded as indicating rather the amount
of such language to be read in the proposed time, than the authors
whose works are to be read. For while there are certain authors
of such acknowledged' excellence in both the Latin and Greek Languages that no man of liberal education should be unacquainted
with their writings, there are others among those ordinarily read
in colleges in this country, whose claim to preference is by no means
such as to warrant their exclusive use. Nor do we see any sufficient
reason for requiring each class to read precisely the same authors,




DECEIMBER lMEETIANG, I84I


213


whilst some variety in this respect might promote the taste for
classical learning. We, therefore, respectfully suggest to the Committee that this matter be left subject to such arrangements from
year to year as the progressive standard of liberal education in the
country shall require.
Natural History has been inserted in the list of studies of the
first two years, under the impression that, with the means provided
for this purpose, the subject might be commenced early in the
course with advantage. Besides the knowledge that would be acquired, it would seem to vary the objects of attention for the student, and could be made valuable as a means of forming habits of
classification and arrangement. We are aware, however, that a
knowledge of the principles of Chemistry must precede any attempt to give thorough instruction in Natural Science.
Each student in the college classes pays the fee of $Io on his
admission, and a tax for incidental expenses of about $2.50 per
term. In the Preparatory Department, the students pay tuition as
in the Branches of the University. Six dollars per term is charged
for tuition, and an incidental tax of from fifty cents to $I.50 per
term.
Board may be obtained at from $I.50 to $2.00 a week; washing
is obtained at from three to six shillings per dozen; firewood costs
the student from $I.25 to $I.50 per cord.

said Branch of $500 for one year, shall not be considered by said

to become responsible for any appropriations beyond said term.
On motion of Dr. Pitcher, the Board adjourned till
Thursday, the 3rd February next.
FEBRUARY       MEETING, 1842.
Detroit, February 3rd, 1842.
The Board met pursuant to adjournment.
PresenIt: Governor Barry, Justice Ransom, Messrs.
Fletcher, Duffield, Trowbridge, Kearsley, Draper, and
Owen.
The Minutes of last meeting were read and approved.
Maj. Kearsley, from the Select Committee to whom the
report made by him at the last meeting was recommitted,
reported the same back, together with a supplementary report as follows:
The undersigned Select Committee to whom were referred the
resolutions of the Board of Regents adopted on the 24th inst., have
had the same under consideration and respectfully report,
That, under the first Resolution, the Committee have obtained
an account from the Bank of Michigan, embracing a credit to the
University of $I06,ooo, being the principal and premium of the loan.
The Bank has also given a credit of balance of interest, according
to the tenor of their bond, amounting to $10,754.94. Thus the aggregate of the credits of the University, on account of the loan, as
stated by the Bank, amounts to $II6,754.94. The Committee have
examined the statement agreeably to. the data assumed by the Bank,
but as respects the interest account, do not agree with this Bank as
to the period upon which the Bank charges interest upon the several sums paid. The Bank also appears to have credited the Regents with interest upon the $o10,000 from July 25, I838, whereas
the interest upon that sum commenced' July Ist, 1838, that being the
date of the State Bonds. The Regents are, therefore, entitled ito
the further sum of $44I.14, being the amount of said interest. Again,
your Committee perceive that the Bank has charged in some instances 10 per cent premium upon the amounts necessary for payment to be made by the Regents in the City of New York. This
your Committee deem inconsistent with the bond of the Bank, as
specie or its equivalent in Detroit was covenanted to be paid by the
Bank. The Committee think 2 per cent. a full compensation for a
sight draft on the City of New York. By computation made by
your Committee, the Bank has charged an excess of 8 per cent. upon
about $5,427.50, amounting to about $441.90, which the Bank yet




FEBRUARY MEfEETING, 1842


221,owe upon the $Ioo,ooo loan. It is proper, however, to remark that
owing to the very limited time allowed for making the statement
by the Bank and for its examination, your Committee have only
approximated, as they believe, very nearly, rather than with absolute precision, to the sum remaining due from the Bank. The security for the fulfillment of the obligations on the part of the Bank,
as respects this loan, is most abundant. In addition to the obligation of the corporation, the personal liability of E. P. Hastings, C.
C. Trowbridge, James Abbott, D. G. Jones, Darius Lamson, and
Peter J. Desnoyers, is assumed by their respective signatures and:seals.
The Committee have had a conference with the assignees upon
the subject matter of the Third Resolution, and have inspected a
large amount of assets belonging to the Bank, of which the assignees propose to transfer, at a valuation stated, any claim of an
amount corresponding or nearly so, with the indebtedness of said
Bank to the.Regents on account of $7,oo6.85 now on deposit in said
Bank to their credit, together with some interest thereon. The attention of your Committee has been called to one item of this schedule. This consists of a loan to the Trustees of a corporation char-tered in the City of Detroit for the benefit of female education.
The Corporation of the City of Detroit originally granted to
this corporation for female education a valuable and large lot of.ground, bordering upon the Campus Martius, containing about
I7,840 square feet. A spacious brick building has been erected thereon, which, with the outhouse and fences, cost about $9ooo. Of this.sum with interest, $5,696.18 is due to the Bank of Michigan. The
Common Council some years since authorized the Corporation for
the benefit of female education, to sell the property under certain
restrictions. Your Committee are of opinion that should said Com-mon Council deem it advisable to give the power to the Trustees to.convey this property to the Board of Regents, they could thus balance the account with the Bank of Michigan, and then the Regents
would become possessed of a property which will always be valua-.ble, and might be hereafter converted into' cash or might be used
for the purpose of education. When it is recollected that it is,contemplated to locate the Medical Department of the University
in the City of Detroit, it will be seen either that this lot and building might be used for that purpose or readily exchanged for a
more suitable site. The Common Council might be the more readily induced to give this authority from the fact that the State now
occupy one front of this lot by their depot, car houses, etc., erected
thereon to the great deterioration in the value of said lot. In answer to the requirements of the second Resolution, your Committee
have ascertained that in addition to the foregoing sums still alleged
to be due on the account of the $ioo,ooo loan, the Regents possess
the following means for meeting the interest due upon the State
Bonds for $Ioo,ooo received and disposed of by the Regents, viz.
Remaining in the hands of the-Treasurer, State
Scrip........................................$817.78
Bills of Bank  of Michigan........................ 549.97  1,367.75
On deposit in Bank of Michigan to credit of Treasurer..  6,456.88
T otal..........................................  $7 824.63




222


FEBRUARY MIEETING, 1 842


The Committee need not remark that these funds are totally
unavailable for the payment of their indebtedness in the City of
New York.
Your Committee deem it due to themselves, to the Board of
Regents, and to the people of this State, by whom this Board have
been entrusted with so large a fund, briefly to recapitulate the receipts and expenditures of the Board since its earliest organization.

Total received and expended..................... $I270o68.4o
In addition to the above, the Superintendent, as will be seen
from his report to the Legislature, just submitted, states the sum
of $248.50, as the entire amount of interest received on University
Lands heretofore sold, during the year 184I. But as this sum has
been neither received nor disbursed, it has not been taken into the
account.
In conclusion, your Committee may also remark that inasmuch
as the Legislature have given the Board of Regents no control
whatever over the collection of interest due from individuals, of
which a very large sum now remains due and unpaid, this Board
cannot justly be held responsible for the default in the payment of
interest due upon the loan on the 2ISt December, 184I, or for any
future failure to meet promptly the interest which may accrue. So
long as the Legislature control the collection, so long must that
body be responsible for the payment of not only the interest but
also the principal upon their bonds. One further remark and your
Committee would close their report. Various amendments or alterations have been brought forward in the Legislature respecting the
price and terms of payment of University Lands. When the Legislature granted and the Regents accepted State Bonds to the amount
of $Ioo,ooo, the Regents expected and had; every reason to depend
upon the price and terms of payment then by law existing. These
laws have been altered and modified to a very great extent; payments of interest have not been enforced, and in many instances
the minimum price has been very much lessened, thus deteriorating
the fund and encouraging remissness and neglect in payment of
interest. In a word, the original prospects of the Regents have been
so invaded and prostrated by legislation that it is not possible to
estimate how far they may be permitted to fulfill any engagement;




FEBRUARY ~MEETING, 1842


223


and therefore the Regents no longer feel bound to fulfill, leaving
that to the Legislature by such ways and means as that body in its
wisdom may devise.
All which is most respectfully submitted.

Supplemelltary Report.
In obedience to the Resolution of the Board of Regents, dated
January 3ist, 1842, accompanying the recommitment of the report
made on that day, the Select Committee having given their attention to the same, respectfully report:
First. That on account of the State Bonds sold by the agent
of the Board of Regents to the Bank of Michigan, said Bank is indebted, at this date, to the Regents in the sum of $872.02 as per an
account herewith submitted,. See appendix "A."
Second. The Committee report, in regard to -title to "the Female Seminaryi Lot," so called, that by their deed dated March 29th,
1830, the Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen, and freemen of the City of
Detroit, conveyed said lot (containing 17,846 square feet as per
meter, bounds, and contents, expressed in said, but agreeably to a
diagram from the records of the City Surveyor, herewith submitted, 22,083 square feet) to the "Association for the Promotion of
Female Education" of the City of Detroit, in trust for the purposes of female education. And further, on the Ist day of April,
1837, said Mayor, etc., authorized and empow'ered the Trustees of
said Association to sell and convey said lot of ground for the purposes of discharging the then indebtedness of said Association, and
the balance of the proceeds of such sale to be invested in the purchase of some other site, suited to said purposes of female education, and' the erection of buildings thereon. The doings of said
Trustees to be reported to the Common Council of said City and
said lot of ground not to be disposed of otherwise than in accordance with said authority thus granted, unless with the approbation
and consent of said Common Council.
Third. Therefore, in the judgment of your Committee, the
legal title to said lot is now vested in the Trustees of said "Association," and that with the approbation, and concurrence of the
Mayor, Recorder, etc., of said City, said Trustees have the legal
right unconditionally to sell and convey the same; and no good
reason exists, in the opinion of your Committee, why the said Mayor, Recorder, etc., should not readily assent to such conveyance
to the Regents of the University.
Fourth. The assignees of the Bank of Michigan therefore propose that if the Regents will give the Bank a full discharge upon
its liabilities, amounting to $7,878.87, said assignees will release to
said Association the amount of its indebtedness to the Bank, being
$5,696.I8, and will also covenant, by good and satisfactory personal
security, to pay and; adjust the entire amount-due by said Association and for which the Trustees are liable to individuals, amounting
to the sum of $4,805.25,-thus making the aggregate which the Bank
has heretofore loaned with that now assumed, $Io,50I.43.
The Committee have requested an estimate of the cash value of
said lot, buildings, etc., from disinterested gentlemen alleged to be

who have expressed it as their judgment that the same are worth

Fifth. The Committee believe that no Legislative action will be
necessary.
In conclusion, your Committee recommend the adoption of the
following resolution:
Resolved, That Messrs. Kearsley, Richardson, and Pitcher, as a
Committee of this Board, be and they are hereby authorized to:settle with and release 'the Bank of Michigan of its indebtedness to
this Board, on condition that said Bank shall first make or procure
to be made to the Board, a good and sufficient title to the Female
Seminary lot in the City of Detroit.

The said report and resolution were thereupon, on motion, adopted.
M\r. Trowbridge, from    the Committee on Finance, to
whom was recommitted the report of said Committee on the
claim of Maj. Kearsley, with instructions, made the following report.
The Committee on Finance to whom was recommitted the
claim of Jonathan Kearsley, agent of the Board of Regents negotiating the loan of $Ioo,ooo. in Bonds of the State of Michigan,
with instructions, respectfully report,
That they find in the Journal of the Board a full statement of
the services rendered by Major Kearsley in consideration, of which
this claim has been presented, in a report read and laid on the table
July 17th, I838, to which your Committee respectfully ask leave to
refer.
Your Committee would also state that, in their opinion, inasmuch as Major Kearsley acted as the agent and not as a member
of a Committee in behalf of the Regents, he has a legal right to
charge for services thus rendered.
Your Committee being of this opinion and having in mind the
precedent established in the history of the State, would again recommend the allowance of one-fourth of one per cent. on the amount
of Bonds disposed of by said Kearsley, all of which is respectfully
submitted.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment.
Present:   Governor Barry, Chief     Justice  Fletcher,
Messrs. Duffield, Pitcher, Trowbridge, Kearsley, Kundig,
and Owen.
The Minutes of the 3rd February were read and approved.
The protest of Mr. Duffield presented by him    on the
3Ist January last, and laid upon the table, was, on motion,
taken up and ordered to be entered upon the Journal of the
Proceedings of the Board.
The undersigned respectfully enters his protest against the
resolution of the Board adopted the 24th ult. relative to the Principals of the Branches, requiring them to report the amount of
tuition received from each scholar and to pay the excess of the
same, if any, over the rates established by the Board some years
since, into the Treasury of the Board, and request that it may be
entered on record for the following reasons.
ist. When the system of Branches was changed in January,
1841, so as to appropriate from and after August of that year the
sum of $500 per annum to each Branch instead of paying a full
sarary as before to the Principals and Assistants severally, it was
distinctly understood that the Board would not require the Princi



SECOND FEBRUARY MIEETING, I842


227


pals to adhere to the prices of tuition as they had been established
under that system, but leave the Principals to make such changes
as they should judge best, the Board declining all responsibility on
the premises, all dictation, either to Principals or patrons of the
Branches, in a matter which they were judged best competent to
determine.
2nd. The Principals of the Branches were to look no longer
for aid from the Board for the employment of Tutors and Assistants nor for the payment of their former salaries, but in view of
the reduction of their salaries by the Board to a mere appropriation
of $500. per annum, of the uncertainty as to the number of pupils
and the amount of tuition and especially of the obligation of the
Principals to employ and pay out of their own pockets the Tutors
and Assistants requisite fully and faithfully to carry out the course
of instruction prescribed for the Branches, it was understood to
be but appropriate and just that the entire amount of tuition should
be conceded to the Principal on his own, and that consequently the
sole responsibility of graduating the prices and collecting the
amount of tuition should devolve on the Principals and that the
Board should have no further care or responsibility on the prices
and collection of tuition.
3rd. Although no specific resolution was drafted and adopted
by the Board to the effect as above stated,-' yet it was frequently
admitted by the members at the meetings of the Boardl that such
were the facts, and accordingly the Committee on Branches, through
their Chairman, gave such information to the Principals, and most
especially and formally as an inducement to his acceptance of the
appointment as Principal by the Committee to Mr. Meigs, the
Principal of the Branch of Detroit, so that the requisition of the
Board, in the resolution protested against becomes a disturbance
of contracts virtually and formally made, and in the judgment of
this protestant subjects the Board to the charge of injustice in 'the
violation of their own contract.
4th. Nothing was ever said at any of the meetings of the
Board and no instructions ever given to the Committee of Branches
to inform the Principals that they must not exceed the prices of
tuition as established under the salary system. The Committee
of Branches never so informed them, nor did they ever imagine
that they were so required to inform them, nor did a member of that
Committee or the Board to the knowledge of this protestant ever
drop the idea, that a maximum price of tuition was fixed by the
Board, and the right of graduating prices conceded to the Principals was confined only to their reduction, until the recent proced:ure in reference to the Branch at Detroit and the claim of
Mr. Meigs.
Detroit, January 31st, 1842.  (Signed) G:o. DurlIELD.
The resolution laid upon the table by Maj. Kearsley
on the 3Ist January last relative to the Principal of the
Detroit Branch, was, on motion, taken up for consideration
and the same was adopted.
The resolution, laid upon the table by M\'aj. Kearsley
on the 31st January last, relative to the appropriations to




228  SECON;D FEBRUARY M1EETING, I842


the Branches, was, on motion of Dr. Pitcher, taken up for
consideration.
IMr. Duffield moved the following as a substitute for
the resolution:
WHIRrAS, The Board of Regents have for three successive years
represented to the Legislature the necessity of such changes to be
made in the Organic Laws of the University as would give the
Board more efficiency and especially enable them, if not to attend
to the collection of the revenue of the University, at least to
know with certainty what portion of that revenue might be annually expected, and
'VJHERZAS, The Board have remonstrated against the action of
the Legislature on the reduction of the maximum price of lands
and the measures affecting the revenue, believing that they would
certainly and necessarily operate to the injury of the University, and
WHMEREAS, Further, the Legislature have not judged it expedient
to meet the wishes of the Regents and relieve them from the embarrassments they anticipated by giving them the responsibility and
empowering them  through the appropriate fiscal offices of the
State to require the collection of the interest due on the sale of
the land of the University; and
\WHEREAS, The revenue of the University has rapidly diminished
since the Legislative action above referred to, so that now the
Board having expended the loan in the erection of buildings, the
procurement of Mineralogical Cabinet, and Library, and the support
of Branches for several years so supported, and being without the
pecuniary means with which to meet large amounts that are due,
and without any certain prospect of receiving any funds, or being
able directly or indirectly to secure their collection, are consequently
totally unable to meet their obligations to the gentlemen in their
employment as Principals of Branches, and Professors of the
University, therefore:
Resolved, That while it gives the Board deep pain to be under
the necessity of doing so, yet do they feel bound to give information to the Principals of the Branches and the Professors of the
University that the Board are totally without means to meet their
engagements to them and without all legal ability to attend to,
advise, coerce, or in any way superintend and manage the collection of the revenue of the University.
Resolved, further, That a copy of this preamble and resolution
be transmitted to each of the gentlemen referred to and published
in the newspapers of the City of Detroit, so that the Principals,
Professors, students, and public may be fully advised of the condition of the University'and suffer no disappointment in any expectations they may now entertain of the permanence or continuance
of the University and its Branches.
On motion of Judge Fletcher, the resolutions were
referred to a Select Committee of three, with instructions
to report to the next Quarterly Meeting.
The Chair announced the following as said Committee,
Messrs. Pitcher, Owen, and Duffield.

Lands; approved April 15th, 1842.
i5-th. An Act to provide for the sale of certain lands to the
persons therein named; approved February 9th, 1842.
The foregoing schedule constitutes the sum  of Legislationr
affecting the University of Michigan, with the exception of two
joint resolutions, one of which relates to public documents and the
other required the Board of Regents to report to the Legislature
to be convened in 184I, "What changes are necessary to be made
in the Organic Law of the State relative to said University in
order to secure more effectually the objects of the same."
By the Act of March 2Ist, I837, the Superintendent of Public
Instruction was authorized to sell at public auction so much of the
University Lands as shall amount to the sum of $50o,000 at the
minimum price of $20. per acre, one-fourth of the purchase money
to be paid down, the remainder in annual installments of five per
cent. commencing in five years from the sale, at an interest of
seven per cent. 'to be paid annually. In June of that year, this Act
was so amended as to require only one-tenth of the purchase money
to be paid at the time of sale and one-tenth annually thereafter.
\vith interest on the amount unpaid; and when in the opinion of




232


APRIL MtEETING, 1842


the Superintendent of Public 'Instruction, one-tenth of the purchase money did not sufficiently secure the interest of the State,
he was authorized to require additional security of the purchaser.
The Act of March 20th, 1838, was never carried into effect, the
person named therein as the executor of the law   declining for
obvious reasons to perform the duties required of him.
From the report of the Rev. J. D. Pierce, Superintendent of
Public Instruction, it appears that there were University Lands sold
in I837 amounting to $I50,447.90, at the average price of $22.85
per acre.
In April (the 6th) of I838, the time of payment of the University and School Moneys was extended to December next ensuing.
upon condition, in the opinion of the Superintendent, not prejudicial
to the said funds respectively. By the Act of March 4th, 1839, all
delinquencies were cured which took place in December I838, if the
delinquent made payment by the first day of May, 1839. All further
payments were extended to the first day of December, I839, "at
which time, on the payment of all interest then due and enough of
the principal to make twenty per cent. with what shall have been
paid theretofore, the, said Superintendent may suspend further
payments one year from that time, at which he may receive the
interest and five per cent. of the principal to be paid by the first
day of December, I840."
Up to this period in the history of the University no measures
had been consummated tending directly to lessen the resources of
the Institution, although the Regents had experienced embarrassments growing out of the delays in the payments of the interest due
on the University Fund, annually legalized by the Legislature, on the
prompt and regular receipt of which the success of their efforts
essentially depends. Subsequently, however, in the opinion of your
Committee Acts have been passed productive of very different
results.
Under the Act of March 25th, 1840, which provides for the
sale of certain lands to the settlers thereon, 4,743.I2 acres of appraised University Lands were sold at the average price of $6.2I
per acre. In the year I84I, 367.66 acres of University Lands were
sold at an average price of $I7. per acre. During the same year
as appears from the Report of F. Sawyer, Jr., Esq., Superintendent
of Public Instruction, there were sold 60o acres of appraised University Lands at $8. per acre, and of the forfeited lands resold,
168.32 acres at an average price of $I9.52 per acre. Now, when it
is borne in mind that the agent appointed by the Legislature to
relocate the sixteen sections of University Lands in lieu of those
proposed to be relinquished to the United States by the Act of
March 20th, 1838, found the faithful execution of his trust to be
impracticable because there were no surveyed lands, unlocated, as
valuable as those already selected, and that the average price of
lands sold in 1840 when the state of the times was equally unfavorable, was $I7., whilst that of the appraised lands sold in I840,
was $6.21, and in 1841 only $8. per acre. Whereas the forfeited
lands resold in 184I brought $I9.52 per acre, your Committee would
respectfully inquire, if it be not the duty of the Board, who are
liable to be charged with all the responsibility attached to a failure
on the part of the University to meet the just expectations of the
public, at all times firmly to remonstrate against such evident mis



APRIL MEETING, 1842


233


application of the grant and by an undisguised exposition of its
affairs to place the accountability for maladministration of the
trust where it properly belongs?
Another Act to extend the time of payment for University and
School lands was approved March 30th, I840. The Legislature
elected to serve for 1841 and for 1842, which under the Constitution
becomes for the time being, the Trustees of the University Fund,
have each passed an Act to reduce the minimum price of University
Lands, the former to $15 and the latter to $12. per acre. Your
Committee will not here stop to question the wisdom or the expediency of these measures, could they be made to work equitably,
believing as they do that the price was originally too high. They
will, however, record their regret that the movements for the
accomplishment of these measures should so generally have eman'
ated from sources having interests antagonistic to the University.
On a careful review of the Legislation touching the financial
relations of the University, your Committee find that on the
return of each political year some step has been taken tending to
embarrass the operations of this Board, either by authorizing delay
in the payments of the sums of interest annually due, on the prompt
receipt and due application of which the vitality of the University
depends, or by granting qualified pre-emption claims in direct contravention of the laws of the United States, whereby the principal
and consequently the interest of the Funds were diminished. It
is therefore in their opinion unsafe for the Board to enter into
any engagements involving pecuniary responsibility.  For these
reasons your Committee would recommend the adoption of the
resolution referred to them, and the preamble as amended.

Dr. Pitcher presented an application of Patrick Kelly,

basement of one of the Professors' houses at Ann Arbor,
and, on motion, the request was granted, if the occup:tion
of said room did not affect the insurance.
On motion of Mr. Duffield, the Secretary was instructed
to correspond with the Superintendent of Public Instruction
on the subject of the Funds, both interest and principal of
the University, the probable amount of funds to be received

The Proceedings of last meeting were read and ap-proved.
Dr. Pitcher, from   the Committee on Branches, presented the reports of the Principals of the Kalamazoo,
White Pigeon, Tecumseh, and Detroit Branches and of
the Professors of the University having charge of the
Preparatory Department of the University at Ann Arbor.
Dr. Pitcher also presented to the Board two letters from
Dr. Asa Gray tendering his resignation of the Professorship
to which he had been appointed on the I7th July, I838, and
giving in explanation of the fact, that he had accepted an
appointment from the Trustees of the Harvard College before he had heard of the action of the Board on his resignation; whereupon, the Board
Resolved, That the Board accept the resignation of Dr. Asa
Gray of his Professorship of Botany, and in doing so express their
regret that -the unavoidable delay in opening the University and

DECEMBER;MIEETI\NG, 1842                  253
Mr. Duffield, from the Committee appointed at the last
meeting to prepare the Annual Report of the Board to the
Superintendent of Public Instruction, made the following
report which was adopted:
REPORT OF I'TH1 BOARD OF REGENNTS TO iTH'E SUPERINTENDENT OI
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.
Sir:The undersigned, agreeably to a resolution of the Board of
Regents, adopted Dec. I2th, 1842, and in their behalf present to you
their Fifth Annual Report.
In their last Report, the Board had the pleasure to announce
the organization of a Faculty and the commencement of the Collegiate Department at Ann Arbor, with the prospect of as large a
share of success as could rightfully have been anticipated during the
first year of a new Institution. That prospect has been fully realized. For several months however after the commencement of the
year just expiring, there seemed to settle around the affairs of the
University a deep and thickening gloom. Although the circumstances of the Board were made known to the gentlemen appointed
as Professors and to the Principals of the several Branches, and.although they had promptly and cheerfully expressed a willingness
to endure privations and hardships as long and as far as there
might be hope of ultimate success in getting the University under
way, yet the money concerns of the Board became much more embarrassing and perplexing than they had anticipated, insomuch that
for a season it seemed as if the entire and absolute cessation of all
instruction in the University proper and in its several Branches must.speedily take place and the gentlemen in the employment of the
Board be advised of the necessity of taking some other sphere for.their useful labors.
The amount of available funds in the Treasury at the time of:the last Report was but $1,72I.9I, in State Scrip nominally equal to
the amount of outstanding warrants. The moneys due, for interest,on lands sold previous to I84I, amounted to $58,210.62, a sum far:more adequate to meet all the necessary and contingent expenses of.the University and of its Branches, to pay the interest on the loan,of $Ioo,ooo, to purchase Philosophical and other apparatus, to commence a Botancial Garden, to erect a Laboratory and additional
buildings now imperiously needed, and to contribute to a Sinking
Fund. Yet the fear was expressed that, judging from the experience of the two-preceding years, there would scarcely be received:sufficient to prevent the suspension of her Branches and the dismission of the Faculty. Still, it was hoped that if we could struggle
through a few months, the Treasury would be so far replenished
as to prevent such a result.
The legislation designed to administer relief to the purchaser:and settlers of the University Lands, postponed the period for the
payment of interest due till March, I842, before which, it was inti-.mated, the Superintendent would not collect and would be unable
-to pay anything to the relief of the Board. It was also thought,doubtful whether even after that date there would be sufficient
collected.amd paid over to the Board to meet the interest on the




254


DECEMfiBER JLEETING, I84p


loan, viz. $3,000. falling due in January last, and the further sum
of $3,000. falling due in July last, besides the necessary current expenses.
Under the influence of such prospects and fears, the Board
earnestly desired that the attention of the Legislature should )e
given to the subject, and that such changes might be made in the
Organic Law as would secure more efficiency and are as indispensable to the permanently successful discharge of the duties devolving upon them and to the management of the interests in education entrusted to them; especially as the subject had been brought
before the Legislature of 1840 and 1841, with hope of more definite
action. The Board are under the necessity of again calling the
attention of the Legislature to the subject and of urging such further legislation as may be necessary to give the requisite powers and
efficiency to the Regents that they may meet the expectations which
the public entertain from them. It is ow'ing to the zeal and measurable success of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, beyond
what was anticipated, that the Instruction has been enabled to continue during the past year.
Of the $58,2I0.62 due and receivable during the past year, there
have been but $9,966.45 received by the Treasurer of the State,
leaving a balance from last year yet due of $48,264.I7, which, in
addition to the amount of $14,000.00 more falling due in 1843, will
make the total sum now due to the University for interest $64,264.I7.
Of the sum of $IO,146.45 received, during the past year by the
Treasurer of the Board there have been paid $6, I50. for interest
and expenses of transmission due on the loan of $Ioo,ooo; $3,992.96
for the necessary and contingent expenses of the University and its
Branches, all of which will appear in the report of the Finance
Committee.
It was a matter of deep regret to the Board that the $3,000. of
interest due in January last was not and could not be paid till May
30th, and the further sum of $3,ooo. due in July last, not till Oct.
7th. From the State Treasurer's account-it will be seen that the
receipts together with the balance previously on hand for the past
year, have amounted to $Io,959.53, and the expenditures to $IO,I42.96, which leaves a balance now in the hands of the Treasurer
of $816.57. The expenses of the Board' for the ensuing year will
be, interest on loan and expenses of transmission, $6,i1o. Expenses
of the University including Professors' salaries, Preparatory Department at Ann Arbor, and estimated contingencies of the University and of its Branches, $2,550'; total, $8,700. The expenses of the
University proper, at present, for the support of Professors, amount
to $I200 per annum. The Board have felt themselves constrained
to add $Ioo each to the Professors of Languages and of Mathematics, being satisfied that the salary of the last year was not adequate to their comfortable support.
Soon after the commencement of the last year, Doctor Gray,
who had been elected several years ago Professor of Botany and
Zoo1logy and whose services, except in the manner of obtainlilng a
Library, had not been called into requisition, tendered his resignation, having received' an eligible situation as Professor in Harvard
College, whose resignation the Board were constrained to accept,
and he receiving no salary while not actually engaged in the business
of instruction. The labor imposed upon Dr. Houghton in opening




DECEMBER        MlEETING, 1842                 255
and arranging the Mineralogical Cabinet, rendered it desirable that
some aid should be furnished to him in his work, and to make arrangements at as early a period as practicable to commence instruction in the classes in the Department of Natural History.     The
Board consider themselves fortunate in having been able to secure
the services of Dr. Abram Sager, who was appointed Professor of
Botany and Zoology in place of Dr. Gray, resigned, and who, while
he will render important aid in the opening and arranging of the
Mineralogical Cabinet and of the Geological' Collection, will not
expect to receive any salary until his services shall be demanded in
the actual instruction of the classes.
A small Chemical and Philosophical Apparatus sufficient for
immediate demands has been secured at a very moderate rate and
been forwarded to Ann Arbor, under the direction of Dr. Houghton, which the Board are desirous as soon as possible to enlarge,
as well as to erect and furnish a suitable building for a Chemical
Laboratory.
From the report of the Faculty it appears that there are now
in the University twenty-five students, fifteen in the Freshman
and ten in the Sophomore Classies,' besides twenty-seven in the Preparatory Department, in all, fifty-two. The Course of Studies pursued and other important information are furnished in the same.
From  the report of the Executive Committee, it will be seen
that the subject of appointing another Professor to take charge of
the classes in the Department of Belles-lettres and of the' Moral
Sciences, is now under the consideration of the Board. The appointment of such a Professor will become necessary in the course
of the ensuing year for a more efficient prosecution of the great
interests of education.
1The Report of the Faculty here referred to has been preserved in the
Report of the Board of Regents to the Superintendent of Public Instruction,
printed in his Report for 1842, and contains the list of these twenty-five
students, as follows:

256           DECEMBER M/IEETING, I842
By the report of the Committee on Branches, it will be seen
that there are but four in operation. The Board has been constrained to reduce the appropriation to the sum of $200 per annum.
It is believed that this sum, with the tuition fees, will be sufficient
to enable the Branches to support themselves. It is an object particularly had in view by the Board to extend as far as possible the
Branches throughout the State. The embarrassed and uncertain
state of the finances have thus far prevented any action in refer-,ence to the extension of the system beyond those actually in operation. Should the finances of the Board admit of it, it would give
them great pleasure to hold out inducements for the organization
of a Branch in each County where the population might need or
desire it. But in the present percarious and uncertain condition of
the revenue, the Board have been deterred from any definite action
on the subject beyond what has just been stated.
It is sincerely hoped that the attention and wisdom of the
Legislature will be given to the subject of the resources of the
Board and the powers necessary to a permanent and successful
prosecution of the interests of education. Of so large a sum as
$64,246.I7* now due, it is impossible to conjecture what amount
will be paid during the ensuing year. Uncertainty attendant on the
collection of the revenue, postponement of the times for the payment of interest, liquidation of claims, and any other measures which
might excite a hope of successful delay of payment on the part of
debtors, it is obvious cannot fail to prove disastrous to any Institution dependant on its annual income. The Board of Regents do not
impeach the wisdom or motives which have influenced the legislation for several years relative to the sale of University Lands and
the collection of the proceeds thence arising. Having the immediate responsibility for the welfare and success of the University,
however, devolved on them, they feel it due to themselves, to the
Legislature, and to the community at large, whose interests are to be
subserved by the faithful discharge of their duties, when making
their annual report, once more, under circumstances embarrassing
and perplexing, and while soliciting such legislation as may be necessary to give efficiency to the Board, to present the following brief
historical statement of the legislative enactments on the subject.
ISt. An Act to provide for the Organization and Government
of the University of Michigan. Approved March I8th, I837.
2nd. An Act to locate the University of Michigan. Approved
March 20, I837.
* Since this report was prepared, the Board have received information that this sum is much greater than what actually falls
due to the University, in consequence of forfeitures and of the reverting of lands by the failure of purchasers to meet their obligations. The number of acres of University Lands now remaining
unsold, is 34,871 acres, leaving the avails of I3,129 acres, giving
$I32,576 as the amount of principal bearing interest at seven per
cent, and making the annual sum of $9,280.32, instead of $I4,000,
which would have fallen due for this, according to the sales formerly reported and contemplated in the above statement.   The
Board are unable to ascertain, until further and more specific information is in their possession, what amount of back interest due
has been forfeited, or whether any portion of the same will eventually be received.

Lands. Approved April I5th, 1842.
I5th. An Act to provide for the sale of certain lands to the
persons therein named. Approved February 9th, 1842.
Besides these Acts, two joint resolutions have been adopted by
the Legislature relative to the University, one relating to public
documents, and the other requiring the Board of Regents to report
to the Legislature convened in 1841, "What changes are necessary
to be made in the Organic Law relative to said University, in order
-to secure more effectually the objects of the same."
By the Act of March 2Ist, I837, the Superintendent of Public
Instruction was authorized to sell at public auction so much of the
University Lands as shall amount to the sum of $5o0,ooo, at the
minimum price of $20 per acre, one-fourth of the purchase money
to be paid down, the remainder in annual installments of five per
cent, commencing in five years from the sale, and at an interest of
seven per cent. to be paid annually. In June of that year this Act
was so amended as to require only one-tenth of the purchase money
to be paid at the time of sale and one-tenth annually 'thereafter,
with interest on the amount unpaid, and when, in the opinion of the
Superintendent of! Public Instruction, one-tenth of the purchase
money did not secure the interest of the State, he was authorized
to require additional security of the purchaser.
The Act of March 20, 1838, was never carried into effect the
person named therein as the executor of the law declining, for obvious reasons, to perform the duties required of him.
From the report of the Rev. J. D. Pierce, Superintendent of
Public Instruction, it appears that there were University Lands




258


DECEMBER M1EETING, 1842


sold in 1837 amounting to $I50,447.90, at the average price of $22.855 per acre; subsequently sales were reported to have been made
amounting in all to upwards of $200,000. In April (the sixth) of
I838, the time of payment of the Univeristy and School Moneys
was extended to December next ensuing, upon conditions to be, in
the opinion of the Superintendent, not prejudicial to the said funds
respectively.
By the Act of March 4, 1839, all delinquencies were cured
which took place in December, I838, if the delinquent made payment by the first day of May, I839. All further payments were
extended to the first day of December, 1839, "at which time on payment of all interest then due and enough of the principal to make
twenty per cent. with what shall have been paid theretofore, the
said Superintendent may suspend further payment one year from
that time, at which he may receive the interest and five per cent.
of the principal to be paid by the first day of December, 1840."
Up to this period in the history of the University its resources
had not been diminished. Embarrassments had been experienced
growing out of the delay in the payment of the interest due on the
University Fund, upon the regular receipt of which, obviously, the
success of the University depends. Under the Act of March 25th,
I840, which, provides for the sale of certain lands to the settlers
thereon, 4,743.12 acres of appraised University Lands were sold at
the average price of $6.2I an acre. In the year 184I, 367.66 acres
of University Lands were sold at an average price of $1I7 per acre.
During- the same year, as appears from the report of F. Sawyer, Jr., Esq., Superintendent of Public Instruction, there were
sold 60o acres of appraised University Lands at $8 per acre, and of
the forfeited lands, resold 1i68.28 acres at an average price of'
$19.52 per acre.
The agent appointed by the Legislature to relocate sixteen sections o f University Lands in lieu of those proposed to be relinquished to the United States by the Act of March 20th, 1838, found
the faithful execution of his trust to be impracticable because there
were no lands unlocated as valuable as those already selected. The
average price of lands sold in I84o, was $I7; that of appraised lands
sold the same year, was $6.2I, and in I84I, $8 per acre. Forfeited
lands were resold in 184I at $I9.52 per acre.
In March, I840, the time of payment for University and School
Lands was extended. In 184I, the minimum price of Universitv
Lands was reduced to $I5 per acre, and, in 1842, to $12 per acre.
In review, therefore, the Board of Regents, on whom the actual and ostensible responsibility for the successful establishment
of the University and for the distribution of its Branches rests,
respectfully submit to the consideration of the Superintendent of'
Public Instruction, to the Legislature and their fellow citizens, the
embarrassments attendant on their efforts which must shortly prove
disastrous and ruinous to the interests of education in the State,
unless some permanent and stable measures can be adopted for the
management and collection of the revenue of the University. The
Board do not wish to shrink from responsibility. They are ardently
devoted to 'the trust which has been devolved upon them, and ambitious to prosecute and discharge it in such way as to render the
munificent appropriation of the United States for the purpose of
the University, most efficient and diffusive, and so as to accomplish.

the intent of the donors, do credit to their munificence, and to
render it a blessing to the State and be conspicuous for its advantages and facilities for education. All they desire is the necessary
power to accomplish their trust, and measures to render the revenue
of the University regularly and permanently available.

APRIL MEETING, 1843


263


The Finance Committee, to whom was referred the resolution relative to compensation to, be paid to members of the
Board, reported the same back with the following opinion:
Elon FarnszCorth, Esq.: —
Question: Have the Board of Regents power or authority to
direct payment to be made to the members of the Board under the
laws relative to the University?
(Signed) A. TEN EYCK,
Secy. Board of Regents.
Detroit, April 4th, I843.
The above enquiry is general, and to define the extent and limits
of the power of the Board upon the subject embraced in the question would require a more extended reply than time would permit.
But understanding that the object of the present inquiry is to
ascertain my views upon the authority of the Board to allow the
expenses actually incurred by its members in attending its sessions,
the reply may be limited to that point.
The Legislature did not contemplate that the.members of the
Board should receive pay for their services. But if it becomes
necessary in order to procure the attendance of the members of the
Board and insure a proper administration and execution of the trust
that the expenses actually incurred and paid by members in attending its sessions should be allowed them, I think under the general
powers granted, it would be competent to adopt a rule or by-law of
general application, authorizing such actual expenditures to be paid.
The exercise of similar powers, without special authority, by
Boards of Trustees has not been unusual and when done in a fair
and proper manner, I am not aware that the right to do so has ever
been questioned.
E. FARNSWORTH.
The resolution was, thereupon, adopted.
On motion of Dr. Pitcher, the President was authorized
to execute a quitclaim deed to Jos. Lester of a lot in Utica,
Maacomb Co., heretofore deeded to this Board by said Lester.

WHER;AS, Intelligence has been received in this city since the

Resolved, That in view of this afflictive visitation of an overruling Providence by which the ties that bound him to life have
been sundered forever, this Board will place on its records an
expression of its regret that a career so brilliant as his should so
soon have been closed by the intervening darkness of the tomb, and
of its sympathy with those between whom and himself there subsisted the more endearing relations of consanguinity.
Resolved, That this Board being the constituted guardians of
a Fund bestowed upon the University of Michigan by the Congress
of the United States for the promotion and growth of Science and
Learning as well as its dissemination among the people of the State,

Interest Fund, and report the same to the Superintendent of Public
Instruction for publication and also to this Board at their next
meeting.
Dr. Pitcher, from   the Executive Committee, made the
following report:
Report of the Exectlive Co nimn iftce.
The Executive Committee beg leave to submit to the Board a
report from the Faculty of the University at Ann Arbor, which
exhibits the condition and the capacity of that Institution to be
useful, and the Course of Studies pursued by the classes which had
been organized therein prior to the commencement of the present
academic year. Since the last Annual Report was published, the
Board of Regents have deemed it necessary to appoint an additional
Professor at Ann Arbor. The appointment of Professor of Moral
and Mental Philosophy was accordingly conferred on the Reverend
Edward Thomson, who the Committee are assured. will enter upon
the discharge of his duties in the course of the ensuing spring.
In the interim, Mr. J. Beach has been employed to act as Tutor
in order to relieve the Professors of Languages and Mathematics,
so:as to enable them in some measure to perform the duties of
Professor Thomson and those appertaining to the Chair of Natural
Philosophy. The organization of a Junior class and the advancing
condition of the Freshman and Sophomore classes, in the opinion
of your Committee render it absolutely necessary that provision
should be made immediately for a Course of Instruction in the
elements of Chemistry and that a Professor of Natural Philosophy
should be appointed at an early day. A Philosophical Apparatus
and a room for a Chemical Laboratory are much needed at the
present time.
Your Committee feel a just pride in contemplating the present
degree of maturity of a temple devoted' to learning, reared in the
midst of a p'eople who have but recently reclaimed the country
they occupy from a savage state.

Maj. Kearsley presented a communication from         M. A.

motion, the same was referred to the Committee on Finance.
MIaj. Kearsley, from   the Select Committee appointed to
prepare the Annual Report to the Superintendent of Public
Instruction, made the following Annual Report, which was
adopted.
Sixth Annual Report of the Board of Regents.
The undersigned, in compliance with a resolution of the Board
of Regents of the 22ndc ultimo, submit for their approbation, the
following report:
To the Superintentdent of Public Instruction:
In their last Annual Report, dated December I2th, 1842, the
Board gave a detailed review of the legislative enactments relative
to the University, the financial condition thereof, present and prospective, and the anticipated embarrassments in sustaining the University and Branches.




DECEMBER lIEETING, 1843


277


The Board deem a repetition of these embarrassments superflous, referring to that report for their causes. Sufficient to say
they now exist with increased effect.
From the last Report it will be seen that the University proper
has been organized,-that four Professors were then appointed, two
only of whom are in the receipt of salaries. Owing to the increase
of students and their progress increasing the number of classes
yearly, it has been found necessary to appoint a Professor of Mental
and Moral Philosophy, who is expected to enter upon his duties
the ensuing spring. A Tutor has been, in the interim, employed to
meet the exigencies of the present term. It is, however, questionable
whether the services of the Tutor can be discontinued even when
three Professors are fully employed.
There are at this time three Branches, to the Principals of
which an annual salary of $200 each is appropriated, in addition to
the tuition fees, and there is at least one other Branch now in prosperous operation, to which similar appropriation should in justice
be extended.
The unavoidable expenses for the next fiscal year may be
estimated as follows:
For two Professors at the annual salary of $600 each....$I,200.00
One  Professor, salary  for six  months.....................  300.00
One  Tutor  at  salary  of  $300..............................  300.00
Four Principals of Branches at an annual salary of $200
each................................................  800.oo
Incidental expenses, including salary of Secretary, insurance, and expenses of Regents for travelling to and
from  the  meetings of the  Board......................  500.00
Interest on $Ioo,ooo loan at 6 per cent payable (semiannually, $3,000)  in  New  York....................... 6,ooo.oo
$9,Ioo.oo
Deduct:
Estimating the receipt of Interest Fund the same with
that of the past year, as per report of the Commissioner of the  State  Land  Office.......................$7,409.05
The estimated expenditures will exceed the receipts.......$I,690.95
To which should be added outstanding warrants, etc.,per
report of Finance Committee......................... $I,231.59
$2,922.54
The Regents also feel it due to the cause of education, and
the high and important trusts committed to them to express the
opinion that to afford to the students of the University the opportunity of a proper course of thorough instruction expected at such
an Institution, the services of at least one of the Professors heretofore appointed will be required during the next year to whom
no salary has been heretofore paid. This will adid to the estimated
expenditure $600.
All admit the practical importance of Mineralogy, Geology,
Chemistry, and other branches of Natural Science, and those the
least acquainted with a collegiate course know that the study of
the Sciences should be commenced during the Sophomore year.




278


DECEIMBER VIIEETING, 1843


Should the appropriate duties, therefore, of the Professors to whom
salaries are now paid, be found incompatible with their labors in
other branches, the expediency of extending a salary to another will
be apparent.
A further cause for the existing pecuniary embarrassments of
the University is that which was in common with our entire State
and Country. The failure of the Michigan State Bank found the
University Interest Fund its depository to the amount of about
$6,ooo and! the Bank of Michigan more than $9,ooo. To liquidate
these debts, the Board have been obliged to take real estate or
mortgages thereon.' These are to the Board as yet unproductive,
although it is believed the property may ultimately realize to a considerable extent, the sums for which it has been taken.
The deficit of revenue agreeably to the above estimates, must
be provided for. The important question, In what manner? must
be decided. Several expedients have claimed the consideration of
the Regents. Shall the parent Institution be closed? The Board
answer, No. This measure must not be thought of. The University is in a condition both as to reputation with our fellow citizens
and numbers of students within its walls, exceeding the expectations of the most sanguine, and it is now confidently believed will
afford the means of a most thorough education to the sons of our
own and other States who may appreciate its advantages. If once
closed, even for the shortest period, years would elapse before it
could regain the confidence and prosperity it now possesses. A
reduction of the number of Professors is shown to be impracticable,
and an increase of at least one, highly expedient, if not necessary.
Shall all appropriations to the Branches be suspended? The
Board would adopt this measure with the greatest reluctance, and
only under a conviction of its imperious necessity. The manifest
intention, however, of the original grant of two townships of land
(the basis of the University Fund) and the ultimate advantages
to be attained, indicate to the Regents that should necessity compel
the adoption of one or other of these measures, the Branches must
be the sacrifice. The Board yet cherish the hope that such legislative aid may be extended to this Institution as will meet the demands upon its Treasury agreeably to the foregoing estimates.
To effect this object, the Regents reocmmend such alteration
in the Organic Law as shall provide for the assessment of such
tuition fees to be paid by the students individually as the Board
may deem reasonable.
Following the previous practice of the Superintendent of Public
Instruction, the Commissioner of the Land Office has received in
payment of principal for University Lands, State Treasury Notes.
The amount of State Scrip thus received, agreeably to information
received from the State Treasurer, is $6,5I3.5I. This evidence of
State debt cannot be re-issued or placed on loan by the State 'reasurer; consequently the Regents are deprived of the annual interest,
amounting to $455.94, which they would receive had payment been
required of the purchasers of University Lands in cash and this
loaned, upon interest.
The State having thus, in effect, become the borrowers, justice
would seem to require 'that the interest thereon should be deducted
semi-annually from the interest for which the University Interest
Fund is holden to the State upon the $Ioo,ooo loan. There is also




DECEM4BER M/EETING, 1843


279


on hand in the Treasury of the University the sum of $2,553.27 in
warrants of the Auditor General, drawn against the Internal Inprovement Fund which are bearing interest and for the payment of
this interest, and for the payment of this interest it is hoped the
Legislature will make like provision amounting annually to $178.73.
The passage of a law complying with the above suggestion is therefore earnestly recommended.
For detailed information relative to the action of the Regents
in performance of the trust confided to them reference may be had
to the reports of the respective Committees of the Board, herewith presented, marked 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

JANUARY MEETING, 1845.
Detroit, January 9th, I845.
Board met pursuant to adjournment.
Present: Governor Barry, Lieutenant-Governor Richardson, Messrs. Ransom, Whipple, Goodwin, Mundy, Crane,
Allen, Duffield, Kearsley, Pitcher.
Dr. Pitcher presented the report of the Principals of the
Tecumseh, Kalamazoo, and White Pigeon Branches, which

Sevenlth A1ntual Report of the Board of Regenlts.
In pursuance of the direction of the Board of Regents, the undersigned present the following as their report:
To the Superintendenit of Public IJlstruction:
It affords the Board the greatest pleasure to express the deep
and grateful sense of obligation under which they feel themselves
placed by the very efficient and opportune aid extended to them by
the last Legislature. For the two previous years it has been their
painful task and duty to set forth the embarrassments already experienced and yet further anticipated in sustaining the University
and its Branches. Happily, all ground of fear and cause of complaint have been removed by the Legislative Enactments during the




294


fJA4i UiARY MlEETING, 1845


last session of the Legislature, which have enabled the Board of
Regents to reduce their permanent debt, nearly $40,000, and their
floating incidental debt one-half. Nor is it the least gratifying circumstance that the arrangement by which this has been effected has
operated as propitiously to the interests of the State as to the
Board, by putting the former in possession of a valuable lot and
building adjacent to the railroad depot, which, while it furnishes
convenient offices for the various functionaries of the Government,
affords peculiar advantages from its location to citizens from the
interior of the State who have business to transact with them.
The fears once entertained have given place to sanguine hope,
and the Board take special satisfaction in the assurance thus given
by the Legislature that they feel a deep interest in the success and
prosperity of the University and are determined to render it what
its ample resources are abundantly capable of making it, an ornament as well as a blessing to the State.
The number of students in the University has increased during
the past year so much as to bring into requisition the whole of the
dormitories in the large and commodious building erected for their
use, which now is insufficient for the accommodation of all. An
extension of their edifices for this purpose, and the erection of a
Chemical Laboratory will very shortly become necessary.
The entire classes commonly organized in Collegiate Institutions are now formed and making progress in their studies in the
University. During the coming year the first class will be graduated, which, from past examination, may be confidently anticipated
will prove the first fruits and pledge of yet greater numbers of the
youth of our State to be introduced to the different Professors
through the instrumentality of the University.
The services of a gentleman have been secured for a season
without expense to the Board in the Professorship of Chemistry,
so as to meet the reasonable expectations and demands of the class
to be graduated and leave the Professorship open for the appointment of a permanent Professor when the funds of the Institution
will justify it and the number of the students render it necessary.
The report of the Committee with its appended documents
shows the amount by which the permanent debt has been reduced
to be $39,2I2.48. The disbursements of the Board during the past
year will be seen in the documents of the Finance Committee hereto appended, to have been less than the receipts and to have extinguished about one-half of the incidental debt of last year, thus
affording hope that at the expiration of the present year the Board
will be able to meet all its outstanding liabilities after paying the
current expenses.
The reports of the several standing Committees charged with
specific duties are appended in which the general condition and interests of the University are given in such detail as to render nothing further necessary from the Board.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

State Treasurer," of $112.23. (This does not include the warrant
first on this list, No. 333, for $I33.33. By accident this was omitted
last year in the list furnished you. It should have come in in

State Treasurer's Office,
Detroit, Dec. 30th, 1844.
I certify the above to be a correct abstract of the account with
the University Interest Fund from the books of this office.
The balance to the credit of the principal of the University
Fund on the 30th ult. was $39,212.48, being for Treasury Notes
and Warrants received on account of principal of University Lands
sold for purchase money of the building in this city bought of the
Regents and for other warrants paid in by the Regents under the
provisions of the Act entitled, "An Act for the relief of the University of Michigan," approved March    i th, I844.  On the above
amount and on whatever further amount may be paid in to the
credit of the University Fund during the present fiscal year, the
University Fund will be entitled to a credit for interest quarterly
under the provisions of the above mentioned Act, and the University will therefore be relieved to that extent from meeting the inter

est for the next year on the $Ioo,ooo loan. Under authority of
another Act of the Legislature at their last session, some temporary advances were made on the salaries of the Professors in
the University until last summer, when they were repaid, but it will
be seen that the University Interest Fund is again overdrawn nearly
$200.

Board Regents.
Annual Report of the Executive Co,01littee.
For a detailed statement of the Course of Study pursued during the past year by the several classes now organized at the University, the Committee ask leave to refer to the report of the Faculty
hereto annexed. The Committee take pleasure in presenting this
Report of the Faculty to the Board of Regents as it contains gratifying evidence of the fidelity of the Professors and of the progress
of the pupils in those pursuits which tend to elevate themr in the
scale of intelligence which at the same 'time they are taught to
keep in mind their relation to Him "Who in his strength setteth
fast the mountains," and hath said, "Verily there is a reward for the
righteous, doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth."  Since
the date of the last Annual Report of the Committee to the
Board and at a time he was expected to enter upon the discharge,of his duties, the Reverend Edward Thomson, Professor of Moral
and Mental Philosophy, found it necessary under the paramount
claims for his services from the religious body with which he is
connected to resign his appointment. At a special meeting of the
Board of Regents held soon after, the Reverend Andrew Ten
Brook was appointed to the Chair vacated by the resignation of
Dr. Thomson, who entered upon the discharge of his duties at the
beginning of the present collegiate year. The discontinuance of
the Preparatory Department which was established under the per-.sonal superintendence of the Professors coetaneously with the University, also suspended the appointment of Tutor held by Mr.
Beach. On the formation of a Senior Class in the University, it
was found that the aid of a Tutor to the Professor of Languages
was indispensable. Such an appointment was accordingly conferred,on Burritt A. Smith, A.B. Silas H. Douglass, M.D., has also been
appointed an Assistant to the Professor of Geology and Mineralogy
with special reference to the performance of duties appertaining to
the Chair of Chemistry.
The following is a Catalogue of the Faculty resident at the
University.
Rev. Joseph Whiting, A.M., Professor of Latin and Greek.
Rev. G. P. Williams, A.M., Professor of Mathematics, etc.
Rev. Andrew   Ten Brook, A.M., Professor of Mental and
Moral Philosophy.
Silas H. Douglass, M.D., Assistant to Professor of Geology, etc.
Burritt A. Smith, A.B., Tutor.
Professors Houghton and Sager being non-residents and not,engaged in the business of instruction are not included in the foregoing schedule.
Your Committee would earnestly call the attention of the Board

to the necessity which still exists of making arrangements for the
purchase of the more essential articles of a Philosophical Apparatus
and the construction of a Chemical Laboratory.
Respectfully submitted in behalf of the Committee.
ZINA PITCHER, Chairman.
Detroit, December Ioth, I844.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THVE FACULTY.
To the Chairnmalna, of the Executive Colzmmnittee of the Board (o
Regents of the Unliversity of 1lMichiganz:
There are now in the University four classes and an aggregate
of fifty-two stude:nts. The Catalogue will soon be published and
forwarded to the Committee..
During the year included in this report, the Senior Class have
read and reviewed as follows:
In the Department of Mathematics and Natural Science, Olnmsted's Natural Philosophy, Vol. 2nd; Kanes' Chemistry, 5oo pages;
and Olmsted's Astronomy with the calculations of four eclipses for
the year I845.
In the Department of Literature, Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus
and extracts from Greek Anthology; also exercises in Forensic
Disputations and English Composition.
In the Department of Moral and Mental Science, Paley's Natural Theology, Stuart's Philosophy of the Human Mind, and Cousin's
Psychology. On all the principal subjects treated in the last two
works, essays have been written by the class.
The Junior Class have read and reviewed as follows:
In the Department of Mathematics and Natural Science, Davies'
Descriptive Geometry, 144 pages; Davies' Analytical Geometry, 200
pages; Bridge's Conic Sections; and Olmsted's Natural Philosophy,
Vol. I st.
In the Department of Literature, Homer's Iliad, two books;
extracts from  Sophocles, Demosthenes, and' Plato, 70 pages. Soo
Cicero de Officiis, de Oratore, de Senectute, and de Amicitia, Tacitus's Germania, and Vita AgricolT, and Newman's Rhetoric.
The Sophomore Class have read and reviewed as follows:
In Mathematics, Bourdon's Algebra, Ioo pages; Legendre's
Geometry; Application of Algebra to Geometry, 25 problems; and
Plane and Spherical Trigonometry.
In Languages, Homer's Iliad, 4 books; extracts from Xenophon
and Herodotus; Livy, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Books and all of
Horace except some of the Epistles.
The Freshman Class have read and reviewed as follows:
In Mathematics, Bourdon's Allgebra, 170 pages.
In the Department of Literature, Latin and Greek Grammars:
reviewed Livy, 15 pages; and Xenophon's Cyropedia in the Graeca
Majora, 15 pages. Weekly translations have also been written by
the class.
In addition to the above, all the classes have had a weekly
exercise in Composition and Elocution.
It will be seen by the above that by reporting at the close of'
the first term of the collegiate year, two-thirds of the studlies of each
class, as reported will be those pursued under their former name..




JANUAR Y lIEETINi, G       845            303
For this reason as well as for other reasons, which will naturally
suggest themselves to the Committee, the Faculty have thought
it better that their report should hereafter be given at the end of
the collegiate year and would respectfully recommend the same.
They would further suggest whether it would not be sufficient
for the Faculty to make their Annual Report upon those general
matters relating to the condition of the University which cannot
be embraced in a catalogue, and refer the Committee to the CataIogue for items which it embraces. The Catalogue will be expected
to embrace as correctly as report can, the number of students with
the studies pursued by them, and no more.
The students are required to attend Religious exercises, reading
of the Scriptures, and prayer every morning and to attend on the
Sabbath such place of worship as their-parents or guardians may
wish. Aside from this, the Faculty exercise no control over the
students in the matter of religion; but the students have, as many
of them as are so disposed, a social meeting on some part of the
Sabbath, and on a week day evening entirely subject to their own
direction. The moral influence among the students is as good as at
any place of the kind. Where cases of discipline have been necessary, they have been attended with salutary effect, and there have
been fewer demonstrations of insubordination than in eastern institutions of like character. The moral sense of the students is generally good, and those who have committed improprieties seem never
to have done it for the purpose of arraying themselves against the
exercise of wholesome discipline.
The Faculty would further suggest that the Regents have their
representatives in the form of.a Visiting Committee or some other
form, at all the examinations, as this will prevent the necessity of
repeating an examination upon all the studies of the year at its
close.
Respectfully submitted in behalf of the Faculty,
ANDREW TEN BROOK.

The Executive Committee who were instructed by the Board

as to furnish a room for the Laboratory, a lecture room and Chapel,
all under the same roof.

the Regents and used at the University Buildings at Ann Arbor,
report, that believing said bell to be too small for the permanent
purpose of the University, your Committee deem   the purchase

January I4th, I845-. J. EARSLVY, Chairman.
Maj. Kearsley, from    the Committee on Branches, to
whom was referred a petition of citizens of St. Clair for
the location of a Branch of the University at that place,
made the following report, which was accepted and the
resolution of the Committee was adopted:
The Committee on Branches, to whom the matter of the petition
of the inhabitants of St. Clair County and others for the location
of a Branch of the University at Palmer (now called St. Clair)
village, in said county, report:
The following appears upon the record of the Board of Regents
to have been the action of said Board:
On the I4th Nov., 1837, the Committee on Branches made a
report submitting therewith the report of Dr. Gibson (an agent
appointed by the Board of Regents) in which a location of a Branch
at the village of Palmer is recommended, Jan. 6th, 1838. So much
of the report of Dr. Gibson as recommends the establishment of a
Branch at Palmer was agreed to Sept. I7th, 1838. The Secretary of
the Board was directed to furnish the Superintendent of Public
Instruction with a list of Branches established for his approval.
January Ioth, I845, the approval of Superintendent of Public Instruction was filed. Your Committee therefore submit the following resolution:
Resolved, That as a Branch of the University has been heretofore established at the village of Palmer (now called St. Clair)
subject to the conditions required by the Board, which conditions
do not appear to have been complied with, and it being incompatible
with the financial condition of the Board to make any appropriation
in aid of said Branch, further action relative thereto is not
required.
Maj. Kearsley, from the same Committee, who were instructed to inquire into the propriety of dividing' the amount
appropriated to the support of the Branches, etc., made the
following report, which, on motion of Maj. Kearsley, was
laid upon the table.
The Committee on Branches, to whom was referred the following resolution:
That the Committee on Branches be instructed to inquire into
the propriety of dividing the amount appropriated to the support
of the Branches in proportion to the number of students taught,
having regard to the studies pursuedl by each student and report
to this Board, beg leave to report:
The Committee have given that consideration to this resolution
lwhich its importance demands.




3o8   SECONtD JANAUARY MEETIVNG, 1845


The primary object, in the opinion of your Committee, with
the Board of Regents should be to adopt such measures as shall
receive the greatest number of students properly qualified for admission to the parent Institution.
The condition of the finances of the Board renders it inexpedient to increase the annual amout at present appropriated to
Branches, and for this reason, complaints are indulged that the
Regents make appropriations annually to some Branches andl not to
6thers; also, that many institutions of learning within this State
have been neglected.
Therefore, to obviate all just cause -for dissatisfaction and
to incite in all instructors of youth a laudable emulation to advance
the interests of the University, your Committee recommend the
adoption of the following:
Resolved, That from and after the commencement of the next
academic year, which will be in September, I845, the aggregate sum
of $8o0 annually be appropriated for sustaining and encouraging
the instruction of pupils in such Course of Studies as shall qualify
them for admission to the Freshman, or other more advanced classes
in the University, and that said aggregate appropriation shall be
divided and distributed to the several Principals of Branches and
Principals of all the Institutions in this State in proportion to
the number of students that may be admitted within the year to the
University, as aforesaid, prepared by said respective Institutions,
and all Institutions of Learning within this State not heretofore
recognized as Branches that shall furnish students as aforesaid
shall be considered Branches of the University. Provided, however,
that no sum exceeding $20 shall be allowed or paid for any one
scholar admitted to the University, as aforesaid. Provided, also,
that no such recognition of Branches shall conflict with the Organic
Law relating to this subject. Which report was laid upon the
table.
The report of the special Committee to whom     was referred the communication of the Reviser of the Laws and
which report was laid upon the ta'ble at the meeting of the
9th instant with instruction, etc., was taken up for consideration.  The question being upon the adoption of the first
amendment proposed by the Committee, the same was disagreed upon, when, on motion of Maj. Kearsley, said report
was committed to the Judges of the Supreme Court with
instructions to make such suggestions to the Reviser of the
Laws in reference to the Organic Law of the University as
to them may seem meet and proper.
On motion of Maj. Kearsley, the vote was taken upon
the passage of the resolution of the 9th instant requiring
Professors Whiting and Williams to pay over the sum of
$440, was reconsidered and on like motion the following
was adopted as a substitute.




APRIL MEETING, G1845

by Professors Whiting and Williams, be remitted and that the payment of such sum be assumed by this Board.

AUGUST MEETING, 18 45


321


after a few days illness, by a violent attack of disease suddenly depriving us so shortly before the Commencement of his valuable
services, has produced as much sadness in the minds of the Regents as gloom on the part of the Faculty and students. Professor Whiting having been from the very commencement of the labors of this Board associated with us in our enterprise as Principal of a flourishing Branch, and having afterwards been selected
as one of the first who were called to aid in the organization of the
University proper, having participated largely in the cares, anxieties, and labors incident to the first years of the University, having
shown his fidelity and devotion to its interests and his peculiar
qualifications as well for the counsel and government of youth as
for their instruction in Classical Science, and having endeared himself to us individually by his many amiable properties and virtues
as a citizen, a Christian, a minister of religion, and a Professor in
the University, we feel that in his death we have met with a very
great and serious loss. While we mourn for our own loss, and
that of the friends of Literature and Science, and the community
at large, we truly sympathise with his bereaved and afflicted, widow
and family to whom his death has been an irreparable calamity.
Resolved, That the Secretary be directed to transmit a copy of
the above resolution to Mrs. Whiting, and also to the editors of
the papers in this village and in Detroit.
On motion of Mr. Duffield,
Resolved, That the Committee appointed to take charge of the
University Grounds be instructed to have their contract with the
Janitor reduced to writing, and their plan arranged before the
ground shall be seeded this fall.
Maj. Kearsley moved that the Board proceed to the
reading and amendment of the Report of the Committee on
Professorships of April 2d, I845. Carried.
The first clause of the Resolution under the first head,
entitled, "A plan to prevent frequent meetings of the Board
of Regents," was amended by adding after the words, "Annual Meeting," the following:
"Special meetings of the Board may be called by the
President, when it shall be thought necessary by the Executive Committee, by giving at least ten days previous notice thereof."

Branches was amended by adding at the end thereof the following words:
"And fill any vacancy that may occur in their number
until the next meeting of the Board."

Executive Committee was amended as follows:
After the words, "appoint a Tutor," insert, "Librarian."




322

At the end of the clause, "and who shall annually make a
full and exact report of their doings, at the Annual Meeting, to the Board of Regents," add, "and also prepare a
report to 'be submitted to the Superintendent of Public Instruction."
A proposition to insert after the provision, "A faithful
record of their proceedings shall be kept," the words, "by
the Secretary of the Board," was carried by yeas and nays
as follows:
Yeas: Barry, Fitch, Crane, Kearsley, Duffield, Wing. 6.
Nays: Felch, Fletcher, Allen, Mundy. Lane. 5.
At the end of the sentence commencing, "In case of the
death of a Professor," strike out all after the words, "a
meeting of the Board," down to and including, "as speedily
as convenient."
The second head was amended as follows:
By striking out the word, "week," in the fourth subdivision and inserting in lieu thereof the words, "fourth Wednesday next."
The third head was amended as follows:
In subdivision three, instead of the words, "having inserted the name of each graduate," read "having caused
the name of each graduate to be inserted."
The Report as amended was then adopted.
On motion of Maj. Kearsley, a special Committee, consisting
of Messrs. Duffield, Allen, and Goodwin was appointed to procure
such information and make such nomination and report the same
to the Board at their next meeting, as may enable them to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of Professor Whiting.

To the Superilftecldenlt of Public Ilstrulctiout:
The Board of Regents in presenting their Eighth Annual Report, have occasion to congratulate themselves and the friends of
Literature and Science in our State in view of the continued and
increased prosperity of the University whose interests have been by




332


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1845


Law confided to their management. Since the last Annual Report,
the Senior class has graduated and the following young gentlemen
have been admitted to the first degree of Bachelor of Arts, viz.
Charles A. Clark, of Monroe, Mich.
Judson P. Collins, of Lyndon, Washtenaw Co., Mich.
Thomas E. Cumming, of Grand Rapids, Mich.
Edmund Fish, of Bloomfield, Oakland Co., Mich.
Merchant H. Goodrich, of Ann Arbor, Mich.
Edwin A. Lawrence, of Monroe, Mich.
John MacKay, of Calais, Maine.
Fletcher O. Marsh, of Kalamazoo, Mich.
George E. Parmelee, of Ann Arbor, Mich.
George W. Pray, of Superior, Washtenaw Co., Mich.
Paul W. H. Rawles, of Kalamazoo, Mich.
The report of the Examining Committee and the recommendation of the Faculty together with the exercises of the Commencement all bore favorable testimony to their scholarship. From this
specimen of the first fruits we may safely and justly anticipate the
future popularity, usefulness, and prosperity of the University.
The Board deeply regret that a shade of gloom was thrown
over the occasion of the Commencement by the death of the Rev.
Joseph Whiting, Professor of Languages, which occurred but a
short time before. In the death of Professor Whiting, the University has sustained a severe loss. He had been with us from the
beginning, had been thoroughly acquainted with- the history, cares,
interests, and condition of the University, participated with earnest
and zealous effort in the Board's desire to promote the usefulness
of the Institution, and was particularly qualified for his station,
not only by his classical attainments and aptness to teach, but by
his urbanity and gentleness of manners, by his knowledge of character, and other properties which especially fitted him to act the
part of a governor and counsellor of youth. He was taken away
most unexpectedly in the midst of his usefulness and has left a
large family in circumstances and years peculiarly requiring a father's care. The duties of Professor Whiting's Chair were promptly
discharged by the other Professors and Tutor during the short
interval that passed from his death till the Commencement.
There has been a fourth Professor appointed by the Board,
viz. the Rev. D. D. Whedon, who has accepted the appointment and
is now discharging his duties in the University as Professor of
Logic, Rhetoric, and the Philosophy of History.
The vacancy occasioned by the death of Professor Whiting in
the Professorship of the Latin and Greek Languages will be filled
at the meeting of the Board to be held: September 30th, I845.
This Report is brought down to August 3ist, as are also the
accompanying reports of the various standing Committees entrusted
with particular duties. Heretofore the report was brought down
to the latest period in December at which the Board met previously
to the meeting of the Legislature, but the Board have found it convenient and desirable for the purpose of preventing unneccssary
expense to have but one Annual Meeting of the Regents to be held
at the time of Commencement, to which date the standing Committees entrusted with duties to be performed during the adjournment of the Board are instructed to report. This will explain the
reports hereto appended to which reference is made for a full and
detailed view of the condition of the University. From the report




SEPTEMBER        MIEETING, 1845              333
of the Executive Committee on Finance, it appears that the permanent debt of the Board has been reduced during the past year to
the amount of $43,225.86, and that the total amount of receipts during the past year has been.......... and of expenditures..........
leaving  a balance  of...........
The Committees are appointed at the Annual Meeting, and the
names of the gentlemnen composing the several Committees for the
current year are hereto also appended, viz.
Committee on Branches: Messrs. Mundy, Crane, Wing.
Executive Committee: Messrs. Kearsley, Pitcher, Lane, Fitch,

All which is respectfully submitted.
By order of the Board.

No additions have been made to the number of Branches since

close of the present collegiate year give the following results.

UG UST MEETIVNG, 1846


Ir. Duffield then moved the adoption of the resolution.
Carried. And the memorial of the Faculty was then read.
Justice Whipple moved it be again referred to the Executive
Committee, which motion prevailed.       Mr. Duffield subsequently stated the wish of the Faculty to withdraw it for
the purpose of presenting a fuller statement of facts and
views, which was acceded to.
Dr. Pitcher presented the Janitor's accounts and moved
their reference to the Executive Committee. So referred.
Mr. Pilcher, from the Committee on Professorships, appointed at the last meeting, submitted the following:
Report of the Committee on Professorships.
The Committee to whom was referred the subject of filling the
Professorship of Chemistry, etc., have had the subject under consideration and beg leave to report, that they have ascertained that
the Professor of Chemistry may be supplied temporarily as it has
been and that a Professor of Geology, etc., may be obtained who
will render all the services which may be required during the Winter Season (he being at liberty for the summer) free of charge.
It would be desirable to make a permanent appointment provided
the state of the finances would justify. But in view of the present
state of funds, your Committee is inclined to recommend the temporary arrangement. Should' the Board' think advisable to fill the
place at this time, we would recommend the combination of Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, and Geology, together for the present. The
following gentlemen have been named to your Committee as suitable to fill that Chair, viz. B. A. Smith, Dr. Douglass, Dr. Sager,
Prof. Shepard, and Prof. A. V. Blaney, of the Medical College of
Chicago. They would recommend the appointment of a Professor
of Modern Languages under the following arrangement, that he be
allowed a compensation for the small portion of the year that his
services may be demanded and that he be free from all responsibility connected with the government of the Institution; or that theappointment be made and he ieceive his salary by a tuition fee
charged upon those who wish to pursue those studies, the maximum
of which will be fixed by the Board. We are inclined to the first
named arrangement. We regard this as a subject well worthy the
attention and action of this Board. Two, gentlemen have been
named to us as suitable to fill that place,-Mr. Fasquelle and Mr.
C. A. Roy,-the former of whom is a man of undoubted qualification.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
E. H. PILCHER, Chairman.
Mr. Taylor moved that the Committee to whom was referred the subject of discontinuing the Branches be also instructed to consider the expediency of establishing a Branch
at Ann Arbor. Carried.
Mr. Allen moved that the Committee on Professorships

at the same place.
Wednesday Evening, Aug. 5th, I846, 8 o'clock.
Present: same as in the morning.    Called to order by
the Governor.
M\r. Pilcher moved that the report of the Committee on
Professorships be adopted and the Committee discharged.
Dr. Pitcher offered the following resolution, which was
carried:
Resolved, That the Board do now proceed to the appointment
of a permanent Professor of Chemistry.
Recommendations were presented in favor of several
gentlemen named in the report of the Committee, and were
read by the Secretary, when on motion of Mr. Allen an informal ballot was taken which resulted as follows, viz.
For Dr. Douglass.........8
Prof. Shepard......2
B. A. Smith........ 
On motion of Justice Whipple,

On motion of Justice Whipple it was further,
Resolved, That the Executive Committee be authorized to devolve, if they shall deem it expedient, the duties of Professor of
Mineralogy and Geology upon the Professor of Chemistry, or in

A UGUST illEE TING, 1846


On motion of Justice Whipple, also further,
Resolved, That the Professor of Chemistry receive for his services the salary now paid the other Professors, viz. at the rate of
$700 per annum, for the time actually engaged in the performance of
his duties.
On motion of Chancellor Farnsworth,
Resolved, That the sum of $Ioo be added to the salary of each
of the Professors per annum.
Mr. Pilcher, from Committee, reported in favor of continuing the office of Tutor and moved the appointment of
one forthwith. After some discussion the motion was withdrawn, and the following offered by Justice Whipple was
adopted:
Resolved, That the Executive Committee be instructed not to
make an appointment of Tutor until the further order' of the
Board.
Mr. Redfield, from the Committee raised to consider the
expediency of discontinuing.the Branches, presented the
following report:
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents, of the University of M1ichigan:
Your Committee appointed by resolution of yesterday to inquire into and report upon the propriety of discontinuing the appropriations to any or all of the Branches of the University respectfully report that they have had the subject embraced by the resolution under consideration, but by reason of the brief time allowed
them to collect and arrange the necessary facts, they are enabled
to give but few reasons for the conclusion to which they have arrived.
They would recommend to the Board' the propriety of discontinuing,for the present the annual appropriation heretofore made to
all the Branches.
Your Committee are 'of the opinion lthat the revenue of the
University is not at the present time sufficient to make the University what it 'should be. Additional Professors,are wanted; the
Library and other necessary means of 'instruction should be increasedc.:Exipend!iture is' much' needed to repair and keep in repair
the buildings and grounds and other things connected therewith.
With the whole olf the income of the Funds much Imore could be
done to place:the University on a footing with the higher Institutions of other 'States. We believe that things of this kind unless
well done are better not attempted. T'he Branches in such places
as they are wanted' by the Ipeople we believe will be sustained without
the appropriations, and 'in other places they certainly do not deserve
the appropriations.
The Branclhes are 'but little more than the Common School of
the villages where located and but of little more than local advantage. Besides we can see no good reason why a few village schools
should continue to be favored by appropriations at the expense of




AUGUST MEETING, i846

and to the injury of the University, rather than many other towns
and villages, and we certainly are not able to carry out the system
generally, as was no doubt originally contemplated in the system of
sustaining a Branch in each iCounty. Were the funds sufficienteven to sustain a few Branches, still we think it would be better
not to do so until the system could be carried out. If we do preparepupils in a few Branches, yet 'if the University is allowed to languish we; cannot 'hope to Igather them into ilt, much, less call we
hope to attract students from abroad. We believe with a con —
centration and judicious use of all the funds' the 'University can
be made to compete successfully with any Institution 'in the Union.
Tlhe assistance 'of a few villages also does injury by creating jealousies among the towns, and villages of the iState.
We would offer the following resolutions:
I. Resolved, That the appropriation of $200 per annum 'heretofore made for the support of the Branches a't Tecumseh, Wh;lite
Pigeon, Kalamazoo, and Romeo be discontinued.
2. Resolved, That the Preparatory Department at Ann Arbor
'be discontinued, and that a Branch 'be located at that place, wiltlhouthowever, any appropriation. Also,
3. Resolved, T'hat the appointment of Principals to the Branches:
be hereafter discontinued.
Respectfully submitted, by direction of the Committee.
Z. PI'ITCHR, Chairman.
Mr. Redfield also presented' the petition of Edw. Bradley and
others, citizens of Marshall, for the establishment of a Branch at
that place.
On motion, the report of the Committee was accepted.
Justice Whipple moved to, adjourn until 8 o'clock tomorrow. Not seconded.
Chancellor Farnsworth moved that the resolutions reported 'by   the  Committee on     subject of discontinuing
Branches be laid on the table, but afterwards withdrew the
motion. Resolution No. i was then adopted. On motion
of Dr. Pitcher, No. 2 was laid on the table, and No. 3
amended so as to read:
Resolved, IThat the appointment of 'Principals to the Branches
be discontinued for the future.
Mr. Mundy, from the Committee on the subject of books
-missing from  the Library, reported that all but four had
been found.
On motion of Mr. Taylor, the Board proceeded to the
appointment of a Professor of Modern Languages. Letters
of recommendation were read in favor of Mr. C. A. Roy,
when on motion of Chancellor Farnsworth, it was:
Resolved, That Professor Louis Fasquelle, of th-is State, be
and he is hereby appointed Professor of Modern Languages in the
University of Michigan.




346            A UG UST MEETING, 1846
Mr. Pilcher moved that the Executive Committee be
authorized to make such arrangements with M1r. Fasquelle,on the subject of compensation as they shall deem proper.
Carried.
Mr. Allen moved that Mr. Lothrop be notified that the
Board will now hear him in behalf of Major Kearsley. Carried. And Mr. Lothrop appeared and addressed the Board.
No; action, however, was taken on the subject.
Mr. Wing moved that the special Committee on Ornamenting the College Grounds be discharged. Carried. And

Resolved. That the Executive Committee be authorized to appoint some suitable person to superintend the college grounds.
The Secretary was instructed to send copies of all resolutions in relation to the Faculty and College to the President of the Faculty.

or Monroe Branches.
E. MUNDY,
Ann Arbor, Aug. 4th, I846.     COhairman o'f Committee.
Report of Ex.ecutive Colimnlittce.
This report embraces only the period from the last meeting of
the Board, Apr. 2ist, I846, to the present time. From  the last
Annual Meeting to the last special meeting referred! to ithe labors
of the Committee were confined to the ordinary duties of auditing
accounts of the.Officers. of the University and keeping the buildiings
in repair, a statement of which has been made by ithe Secretary and
forms a part of the report of the Committee on Finance.
At the meeting of the Board in April, a large number of
accounts, some!of them of several years standing, w'hiclh the Committee had not felt authorized to allow,, were laid before the Board
by the IChairman, Maj. Kearsley. 'These accounts were most of
them again referred to the Committee with authority to allow. and'
pay them in their discretion, and have since been passed upon and
such as were deemed. just, allowed. Most of t;he warrants stated, by
the Secretary as drawn on the 2d of May, I846, are for their payment.
The resolution authorizing the employment iof Dr. Sager in tlhe
Professorship of B'otany and' Zoology, during the Sprinlg Term has
not been carried into effect. The Committee upon consultation with
Dr. Sager, found that gentleman unwilling to leave his professional
business at Jackson 'for the short period proposed, deeming the compensation offered too 'inadequate to warrant it. As the IComrmittee
did 'not consider the subject of sufficient importance, no other gentleman was' engaged.
Soon after the last meeting of the Board, arrangements were
made by the Commititee with!Dr. Douglass for the completion of
the Course of Lectures on Chemistry, Mineralogy, etc., for the
academic year.
A resolution having passed" the Legislature o'f the 'State in
relation to t'h'e Cabinet of Mineralogical Specimens at the University, the Board referred the subject to, this Committee 'wit:h power
to act "as they should deem  expedient." As the resolution was
thought to be not sufficiently favorable to the interests of the Universit-, the Committee after some effort 'succeeded in procuring
the passage of an Act by the Legislature entitled, "An Act relative
to the Department of Natural History in the University of Michigan," approved May Ilth, I846. This is a modification of the resolution and is much more liberal in its provisions. At a meeting of
the Committee after its passage, Dr. Pitcher and Acting Professor
Douglass were appointed and authorized to carry it into effect.
Z. PITCHER, for Committee.

The Report of the Finance Comimi:ttee exhibits the receipts of
the University and the expenditures during the past year.

Chemistry, and' Louis Fasquelle, Prof essor of Modern Languagees.
The salary of the itwo Professors last named is limited to such proportion o'f each year as they may be respectively employed. The
number of students cannot be accurately ascertained; and given in
this report by reason of the period it embraces, but will appear from
the Annual Catalogue published by the Faculty. It may be safe
to say they are steadily on the increase.
iFrom data furnished 'by the State Treasurer and Colmmissioner
of the State Land Office, the $Ioo,ooo debt of the University has
been reduced $66,I50, and it therefore appears the University is now
indebted on account of said loan, $33,350. The resources of the
Interest Fund have been adequate to meet the current demands upon
the Treasury of the University during the past year. It is hoped
that the system relative to the University Fund 'imay now be considered as permanently settled, and that future legislation may not

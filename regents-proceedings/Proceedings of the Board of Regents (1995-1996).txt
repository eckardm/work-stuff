JULY MEETING, 1995


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, July20, 1995
The Regents met at 9:15 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Palmer, Provost Whitaker, Executive Vice President Womack, and Vice Presidents Harrison and Hartford
were also present. Vice Presidents Kinnear and Neal and Chancellors Nelms
and Renick were absent.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and recognized Regent
Newman, who made the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(e) and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in
closed session on July20, 1995, for the purposes of consulting with our
attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection with
specific pending litigation [Sec. 8(e)]; and considering material exempt
from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information
Act [Sec. 8(h)]. Such exempt material consists of written opinions from
the Board's legal counsel.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The Regents then proceeded to meet in executive session.
The meeting reconvened in public session at 2:05 p.m. in the Regents'
Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Horning,
McFee, McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Palmer, Provost
Whitaker, and Executive Vice President Womack were also present, as were
Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors
Nelms and Renick. Regent Deitch arrived at 3:15 p.m.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and welcomed Ms.
Roberta Palmer, newly-appointed secretary of the university, to her first
Regents' Meeting.
President's Report
The president noted that the role of affirmative action has been a major
topic of discussion in higher education circles of late, and that the University
of California Board of Regents was to decide that day whether or not to
retain its current affirmative action policies. He stated that the University
of Michigan has had a fundamental commitment to building a diverse
campus for a number of years, and that the increased numbers of women and




July Meeting, 1995


minority faculty, staff, and students have strengthened and enhanced the
institution. He noted that the commitment to diversity is part of the fundamental character of the University and reiterated his intention to maintain
that commitment.
Regent Varner thanked President Duderstadt for his comments, and
noted that the Board of Regents has strongly supported diversification and
affirmative action, with significant results. The progress that's been made
has not been accidental, she said, but the result of a conscious effort. She
expressed the hope that the University would continue to remain committed
to doing what is right.
Regent McGowan observed that the timing of the president's remarks
should be reassuring for the many people on campus who count on that
commitment's being a part of the University of Michigan.
Regent McFee commented that this is the only country in the world
with a diverse population that comes from all parts of the world, and that she
strongly believes that the University should reflect that as well. The
strength of the University, she believes, lies in its diversity, and maintaining
that diversity enhances its role in sustaining the unique diversity of American society.
Provost's Report
Department of Communication       Studies.   Provost Whitaker
reported that he had appointed a committee to study the future role of the
master's degree in journalism, and that this committee's work should be
completed within the next few weeks.
International Institute. Provost Whitaker noted that one goal of the
International Institute, founded about one and a half years ago in the College
of Literature, Science, and the Arts, was to hire faculty who would serve as
bridges between the professional schools and LS&A. He reviewed the
backgrounds of four newly-appointed faculty members in the International
Institute to show how they would accomplish that goal.
Shady Trails Camp. Provost Whitaker updated the Regents about
two activities that were being carried out this summer to replace the services
lost by the closing of Shady Trails Camp.
Cost of compliance with regulations. In response to an earlier
request from Regent Newman, Provost Whitaker reported that the "best
guess" of the cost of compliance with federal, state, and other government
regulations is $178 million across all funds. This figure is growing at a rate
of about $600,000 per year.
Chief Financial Officer's Report
Executive Vice President Womack reported about the University's
continuing disagreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over its


2




July Meeting, 1995


requirement that FICA contributions must be withheld from the wages of
student workers. The University's position is that it should determine the
definition of what constitutes a student, not the Internal Revenue Service.
The University is engaged in ongoing discussions with the IRS on this issue,
which affects student workers' take-home pay.
Regent Power commented that this represents another attempt by the
federal government at cost-shifting of educational expenses to state governments, families, or students. He said that it would be helpful if a determination could be made of the costs of the federal government's aggregate
attempt to shift the cost of education from the government to other sources.
Proposed 1995-96 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets, Ann
Arbor Campus
Executive Vice President Womack provided an overview of the four
funds that comprise the University's Current Funds: the General Fund, the
Designated Fund, the Auxiliary Activities Fund, and the Expendable
Restricted Fund.
The proposed 1995-96 Current Funds revenue budget for all three
campuses is $2.577 billion, an increase of 8.5 percent over 1994-95; the total
expenditure budget is $2.446 billion, an increase of 8.7 percent. Executive
Vice President Womack's presentation included ten-year comparisons of total
budgeted revenues and of budgeted revenues by fund, as well as breakdowns
of budgeted revenues by fund and by source for 1995-96. The 1995-96
revenue budget is broken down as follows: $1.027 billion (40 percent) from
the Auxiliary Activities-Medical fund; $172 million (7 percent) from Auxiliary Activities-Other Fund; $839 million (33 percent) from the General
Fund; $453 million (17 percent) from the Expendable Restricted Fund; and
$86 million (3 percent) from the Designated Fund.
Proposed 1995-96 General Fund Budget
Provost Whitaker observed that a budget is a policy document matching
expenditure patterns with policy objectives. Within this context, the role of
the administration is to ensure that unit objectives are consistent with
University objectives, and it is the Board's role to make sure that the University's objectives are met as the budget planning process proceeds. The
central administration's budget objectives are "to continuously improve the
University's role as a world leader, providing excellence in learning, where
the faculty as well as the students are engaged in learning, the faculty is
engaged in new discovery, often with the assistance of students, and where
current knowledge is both transmitted and reinterpreted in the face of new
learning." The University should also be engaged in reinventing the learning
process itself.
Provost Whitaker reviewed the fundamental budget objectives, which
are to maintain and enhance the quality of instructional and research
programs; improve the quality of the undergraduate educational experience;
maintain and enhance access for Michigan undergraduates; improve racial


3




July Meeting, 1995


and gender diversity; increase the investment in infrastructure maintenance
and reduce the backlog of deferred maintenance; and provide reserves
against potential revenue shortfalls to avoid midyear base-budget reductions.
He described management initiatives designed to increase cost effectiveness,
including M-Quality, process improvement, ("re-engineering"), and Value
Centered Management. He also discussed the important role reallocation
has played in the General Fund budget strategy over the last 15 years. For
the past 5 years each unit has been required to reallocate at least 2 percent
of its budget toward its highest priority needs. He pointed out that this
process has resulted in the reduction of over 200 General Fund employees,
resulting in an annual compensation savings of over $11 million.
In response to Regent Newman's question as to whether any budgets
were being decreased, Provost Whitaker said that each unit was to receive an
increase; no budgets had been cut. Regent Power noted that the budget is
presented in terms of dollars, not "dollars per unit of activity". The result is
that economic activities are expressed in terms of raw cost, as opposed to
"cost per unit of volume." He pointed out that use of the latter method
would enable the Regents to more easily interpret the budget figures.
Regent Newman asked why the University wasn't attempting to cut
costs, as opposed to continually increasing costs.  Provost Whitaker
responded that about 70 percent of the budget is for personnel; the objective
of attracting the best possible people requires resources to keep salaries
competitive and to provide the laboratories and facilities needed. Regent
Newman said that she is aware that the University has been making efforts
to reduce costs, but that the message is not getting out about the specific
management decisions that are being made to manage the institution
effectively.
President Duderstadt pointed out that the volume of knowledge being
generated and disseminated at the University is increasing very rapidly,
while the price of obtaining this knowledge (tuition rate) is increasing at a
much slower rate. He believes that this is a point in history where the
burden of paying for education is shifting from the past generation, which
doesn't benefit directly, to the generation that receives the knowledge. Costs
can be cut either by eliminating academic programs or by reducing costs at
lower levels of management. The latter is being done by directing units to
reduce their base budgets by two percent every year, and Value Centered
Management should be even more effective at cost reduction. President
Duderstadt concluded that the challenge is to gather the data and articulate
it in a fashion that will show the results most effectively. Regent Power
reiterated that this will be necessary to be able to address persistent claims
about costs at the University.
Provost Whitaker pointed out that the rate of increase in the General
Fund budget is less than it has been in the past, and this is a result of the
cost avoidance measures that have been implemented. He believes that the
quality of the University has been improved while the rate of growth in
expenditures has been reduced.

July Meeting, 1995


Provost Whitaker displayed charts detailing the recommended FY
1995-96 General Fund expenditure budget of $755.1 million, including
breakdowns by unit and by category of expenditure. Each unit is slated to
receive a base operating budget increase of 2 percent, which is to be matched
by the unit through reallocation. He compared the University's increase
with those of other Michigan public and Big Ten public institutions. He
reported that if the University of Michigan had received the same funding
increase as had Michigan State University, it would have been enough to
have enabled the University to leave resident tuition rates unchanged for
1995-96. He displayed a chart comparing the cost increase for a Michigan
resident to attend the other universities ranked in the top 25 nationally,
illustrating that total tuition cost at the University of Michigan is less than
one-half that of the least expensive of the other institutions, even after
tuition increases have been added in.
The recommended increases in student fee rates for 1995-96 are 4.9
percent for lower division resident undergraduates, 5.8 percent for upper
division resident undergraduates, special increases for Business Administration M.B.A., Engineering, Kinesiology, Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, and Public
Policy, and 6.8 percent for all other students. In response to a question from
Regent Baker as to what the recommended tuition rate would have been if
the state appropriations had been spread equally across all public institutions, Provost Whitaker stated that if the University's appropriation increase
had been equal to the average of that received by all state institutions (47
percent), the tuition recommendation could have been lower.
Proposed 1995-96 General Fund Budget, UM-Dearborn
Chancellor Renick reported that as part of its budget planning process,
the Dearborn campus surveys currently enrolled and former students to
assess their experience. A recent survey revealed that the three major
factors are quality, value, and convenience. He noted that the campus has
increased its enrollment by 2 percent over the previous year, and that it now
represents 25 percent of the total number of University of Michigan resident
undergraduate students for all three campuses.
The recommended average resident student tuition increase for the
Dearborn campus is 4.5 percent. Included in the 4.5 percent increase is a
$7.00 increase in the student activity fee. Nonresident tuition will not be
increased. Incremental funds will be targeted toward teaching and learning
activities, a salary program, student services, and implementation of a touchtone registration system.
Proposed 1995-96 General Fund Budget, Flint Campus
Chancellor Nelms emphasized that UM-Flint seeks to provide a quality
education at an affordable rate. The recommendation is for a 5.0 percent
General Fund increase, funded by a 3.0 percent increase in state appropriation and a 5.8 percent increase in resident undergraduate and graduate
tuition rates. Plans are to reduce the reliance on contingency funding


5




July Meeting, 1995


through the reallocation of $1.2 million. The salary program recommendation is for 2.5 percent; if enrollment increases sufficiently, there will be a
mid-term increase of 1.5 percent to bring the total to 4.0 percent. The 5.8
percent tuition increase will be the smallest on the Flint campus in over five
years, he reported, and total costs of attending UM-Flint remain among the
lowest in the state. Student financial aid will be increased by 6.0 percent.
Chancellor Nelms pointed out that for 1995-96 the campus is instituting a
new technology fee ($10 for part-time students and $20 for full-time). This
recommendation is based on the findings of a task force which recommended
a fee to support the enhancement of existing student laboratories and
instructional resources.
Regent McFee observed that the General Fund budget includes revenues
from a number of sources in addition to state appropriation and tuition. The
setting of tuition, therefore, is affected by such factors as indirect cost
reimbursement rates and voluntary support as well as the amount of state
appropriation.
Provost Whitaker announced that the recommended resident tuition
increase is the lowest in ten years.
In response to a question from Regent Power about when data will be
available comparing conventional budgeting methods with VCM budgeting,
Executive Vice President Womack said that although the data is already
available, his staff is still exploring alternative methods of presenting the
data in the least cumbersome fashion. By early fall, he expects to have a
model that would show what the effect would have been during the course of
the year if the VCM system had been in use.
There followed a five-minute break, after which the meeting reconvened
for Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the
topics indicated: Anne Marie Ellison, student, on the Statement of Student
Rights and Responsibilities; Flint Wainess, president of Michigan Student
Assembly, on the cost of higher education; and Beatrice Green, citizen, on
the Nichols Arboretum hedge.
Following Public Comments, the Regents reconvened at 4:30 p.m. to
continue their earlier executive session.
Friday, July21, 1995
The Regents met at 9:30 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Palmer, Vice President
Whitaker, and Executive Vice President Womack were also present, as were


6




July Meeting, 1995


Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors
Nelms and Renick.
President's Remarks
Freshmen Enrollment.      President Duderstadt reported that in
keeping with the University's efforts to ensure that the number of Michigan
residents in the Fall 1995 freshman class would be at least 3,000, 332
resident applicants had been admitted from the wait list in June. Over
two-thirds of those (233) have accepted the offer, so the University is confident that the fall enrollment goals will be met. Most of these students would
have attended other institutions in the state of Michigan, with the largest
fraction having planned to attend Michigan State University.
Regent Horning commented that despite media predictions that had
been made when the specific percentage of in-state/out-of-state enrollment
figures was eliminated from state legislation, the University has not
increased the proportion of nonresident students.
Affirmative Action. President Duderstadt reported that the Regents
of the University of California had acted to remove affirmative action
programs with regard to admissions, hiring, and contracting. He reiterated
that, as illustrated on the ABC evening news the previous night, the University of Michigan remains firmly committed to its own programs aimed at
increasing the campus' diversity.
Coach Gary Moeller Incident. President Duderstadt observed that
some aspects of the situation that led to Coach Moeller's resignation had
been handled quite well by the University, while other aspects, particularly
involving communications, had not been handled well. He then called on
Regent Baker, who stated that the Regents had reviewed this matter and
were issuing the following statement:
Statement of Regental Concern
Regarding Resignation of Coach Gary Moeller
The head football coach's, Gary Moeller's, resignation from the
University of Michigan has stirred considerable public interest.
The Regents have reviewed the circumstances surrounding this
event, and intend to accept the legal understandings as negotiated
between the University and Coach Moeller. They thank Coach
Moeller for his long service to the University and wish him well in
his new career. The Regents have also asked President Duderstadt
to review the structural, reporting, and operating relationships
between the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics and the
University as a whole and to report his conclusions next fall.
It was emphasized that the Regents expected to receive the report in
September or October of 1995.

July Meeting, 1995


1995-96 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets and 1995-96
Student Tuition and Fee Rates for Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint
Campuses
Regent Varner moved approval of the 1995-96 revenue and expenditure
operating budgets, the 1995-96 General Fund operating budgets, and the
1995-96 student fee rates for the Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint campuses.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion.
Regent Baker reiterated that had the University of Michigan received
the same base increase as Michigan State, Western Michigan, and Grand
Valley State universities, it might have been able to have kept its tuition
increase at 2.5 percent. President Duderstadt pointed out that the state
appropriation has not kept pace with inflation in recent years, and that it
continues to decline.
Regent McFee emphasized how important state appropriations are to
the institution; they are critical to the University's being able to provide the
high level of services it does. Regent Varner observed that loss of state
appropriation causes students to have to pay ever increasing proportions of
the costs, so that without the allocation of University resources, it would no
longer be accessible to low income students. She said her support for tuition
increases has always been based on her belief that the state's citizens want
to maintain the quality of the institution, so it is for this reason that she
continues, albeit reluctantly, to support increased tuition in the face of loss
of state support.
The vote was then taken on the motion to approve the 1995-96 operating budgets, general fund budgets, and student fee rates, and it was approved
unanimously.
Resolution in Honor of Gilbert R. Whitaker, Jr.
President Duderstadt called on Regent Power, who read the following
resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan salute Gilbert R.
Whitaker, Jr., as he prepares to complete his tenure as provost and
executive vice president for academic affairs.
Gil Whitaker came to the University of Michigan in 1979 as
dean of the School of Business Administration and professor of
business economics.  Under his leadership the school enjoyed
remarkable growth in reputation; it became a center of far-reaching
scholarship and innovative, disciplined curriculum planning. A $15
million expansion of facilities, funded through private gifts, doubled
the school's space while its budget tripled and the number of faculty
nearly doubled. At the same time, it developed a more diverse


8




July Meeting, 1995


student body, growing from 5 percent to 28 percent minority
enrollment in the MBA day program.
When the University sought a provost in 1990, it seemed all
but inevitable that it would turn to Gil Whitaker. His success as
dean had been exemplary; he had chaired the Task Force to Study
the Costs of Education; and he had the visionary audacity to call for
a revenue diet that would be imposed without sacrificing excellence.
As provost, Gil Whitaker has continued his legacy of strong
fiscal and academic leadership.  Through wise shepherding of
resources, he has managed to sustain and even increase faculty
compensation levels. Under his direction, programs designed to
increase the number of underrepresented minority and women
faculty and to provide support for their scholarship have achieved
significant results.  He has also been a strong supporter for
increased attention to teaching and for improving the experiences of
undergraduates.
Throughout Gil's tenure as both dean and provost, his wife,
Ruth Whitaker, has been an equally effective leader, contributing
with unique style and grace to a wide array of University and
community organizations. Ruth and Gil have been an exceptionally
dedicated team whose efforts have had a lasting impact on the
entire community.
With deep appreciation for his dedication, commitment, and
leadership, and, appropriately enough, on the day of his last official
budget presentation, the Regents now name Gilbert R. Whitaker,
Jr., dean emeritus and provost and executive vice president
emeritus for academic affairs, effective September 1, 1995.
The motion was accepted by acclamation. There followed a round of
applause and a standing ovation. Regent Baker noted the "wonderful and
significant contributions" made by Gil and Ruth Whitaker during their long
association with the University.
Provost Whitaker thanked the Regents for the resolution and quoted
Lao-tzu in characterizing how he would like to be remembered:
"'But of a good leader who talks little
When his work is done, his aim fulfilled
They will all say, "We did this ourselves.'"
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted the minutes of the June 1995
meeting.

July Meeting, 1995


Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports on
investments, plant extension, litigation, personnel-labor relations, and
noncompetitive purchases from single sources for the period April 1 through
June 30, 1995. He reviewed problems that have recently been experienced
by the Common Fund, which stem from a loss it incurred as a result of
unauthorized trading in violation of written guidelines by one of its managers. This loss affected the University of Michigan by an estimated $1.5-2.0
million reduction in return for fiscal year 1994-95.
He described how the Common Fund is organized and noted that it has
performed a very useful service to higher education, particularly to smaller
endowments. Executive Vice President Womack responded to comments
from the Regents about how best to respond to the current situation and
about whether, given the size of the University's endowment, the Common
Fund is still an appropriate vehicle.
Vice President Neal submitted reports of projects established and
summaries of a selection of current research for the month of June 1995. He
also reported that the Matrigen Agreement discussed at the June Regents'
Meeting had been successfully concluded.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear commented that the
final report of fiscal-year gift receipts, including the totals for the month of
June, will be presented in the September meeting. He reported, however,
that voluntary support for 1994-95 was expected to reach a record level, and
that the Campaign for Michigan had reached about $846 million towards its
$1 billion goal.
Personnel Actions. Provost Whitaker and Chancellors Nelms and
Renick submitted a number of personnel actions.       Regent McGowan
commented on the strong support of the faculty for the appointment of
Nancy Cantor as dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies. She also expressed her own enthusiasm for that appointment as
well as for the quality of the newly-appointed tenured faculty members.

Retirement Memoirs. Eight retirement memoirs were submitted.
Malcolm S. Cohen, associate research scientist and former director of
the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations, retired from active faculty
status on November 15, 1994, after 26 years of service to the University of
Michigan.
Dr. Cohen received his B.A. degree summa cum laude from the University of Minnesota in 1963 and won a full academic scholarship to pursue
graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he
earned his Ph.D. degree in 1967. He began his career at the University of
Michigan in 1968 as assistant to the vice president for state relations and
planning and in 1969 as assistant professor of economics. In 1969, he
chaired the Management Information System Team, a group charged with
responsibility for determining the University of Michigan's management
information needs. He joined the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations
in 1972 and became co-director of its research division in 1973. He served as
director of the institute from 1983-93. He also served as chair of the
Program for Human Resource Development, a certificate program under the
auspices of the University's Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies.
Dr. Cohen is nationally known for his work in the area of labor market
information, particularly with regard to labor shortages. He developed a
methodology for identifying labor shortages by occupation, which the U.S.
Department of Labor has considered in its criteria for deciding whether to
grant labor certification to foreign applicants, and has written a book
describing this methodology and the research behind it (University of Michigan Press, 1995).
Dr. Cohen has testified as an expert witness, chaired boards of directors,
and lectured extensively. He has also conducted studies involving labor
market information for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Cost of
Living Council, and numerous state and federal government agencies.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Malcolm S. Cohen associate research scientist emeritus.
Howard A. Crum, professor of botany in the Department of Biology
and curator of bryophytes and lichens in the Herbarium, will retire from
active faculty status on August 31, 1995.
Professor Crum received his B.S. degree magna cum laude from Western
Michigan College in 1947 and his M.S. (1949) and Ph.D. (1951) degrees from
the University of Michigan. He served as curator of cryptograms in the


19




July Meeting, 1995


National Museum of Canada from 1954-65, when he joined the faculty at the
University of Michigan as associate professor of botany and curator of
bryophytes. He was promoted to professor in 1969, served as chair of the
Department of Botany from 1981-83, and was editor of The Michigan
Botanist from 1977-84.
Professor Crum is widely considered one of this century's foremost
authorities on the taxonomy and phytogeography of mosses. With L. E.
Anderson, he published Mosses of Eastern North America, which received
the H. A. Gleason Award from the New York Botanical Garden in 1981.
Other major floristic works that he authored or co-authored have treated the
mosses of the Great Lakes forest, Puerto Rico, and Mexico, and the genus
Sphagnum in North America. A steady stream of over 230 papers in journals
continues unabated. Professor Crum also served bryology as editor or associate editor of The Bryologist from 1954-76 and as president of the American
Bryological and Lichenological Society from 1962-63. His doctoral students
occupy important bryological positions in three nations, and practically every
bryologist in the United States and Canada has taken his famous course at
the University of Michigan Biological Station. For his achievements as a
teacher at the Biological Station, he earned an Excellence in Education
Award from the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in 1993. Since
1973, Professor Crum has also served as an academic counselor for the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. His friendly curiosity, wry
humor, and warm and supportive manner earned him the Ruth M. Sinclair
Memorial Award for Freshman-Sophomore Counseling in 1978.
The University of Michigan Herbarium has long had one of the
hemisphere's largest and most important collections of bryophytes and
lichens. Under Professor Crum's curation, those collections have been
reorganized, greatly enlarged, and extensively studied.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and scholar by
naming Howard A. Crum professor emeritus of botany and curator emeritus
of bryophytes and lichens.
Cedric V. Fricke, professor of business administration at the University
of Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active faculty status on April 30, 1995,
following 35 years of service.
Professor Fricke received his B.S.E. degree in chemical engineering in
1949, his M.B.A. degree in accounting in 1950, and his Ph.D. degree in
business administration in 1959, all from the University of Michigan. He
joined the faculty of the University of Michigan-Dearborn as an assistant
professor of finance in 1960 after several years of teaching at Wayne State
University. He was promoted to associate professor of business administration in 1963 and professor in 1967.
During his tenure at Dearborn, Professor Fricke helped develop the
finance, business economics, and general management curricula and enjoyed
a very successful career as a teacher and advisor. Because of his professional
experience in industry, he was able to integrate theory and practice in the
classes that he taught, thereby enriching his students' classroom experiences
and making their courses more meaningful.


20




July Meeting, 1995


While on the faculty, Professor Fricke contributed actively to business
and industry by serving as a board member of a number of Detroit area
businesses. He was also a member of several professional and academic
associations.
The Regents now salute this dedicated teacher and senior member of the
Dearborn campus by naming Cedric V. Fricke professor emeritus of business
administration.
Joel A. Grinker, professor of human nutrition in the School of Public
Health, professor of nutrition in the Medical School, and research scientist in
the Center for Human Growth and Development, will retire from active
faculty status on July 1, 1995.
Professor Grinker received her B.A. degree in psychology from Wellesley
College in 1961 and her Ph.D. degree in experimental social psychology from
New York University in 1967. From 1967-69, she served as a Russell Sage
Postdoctoral Fellow at Rockefeller University. After serving on the faculty
at Rockefeller University from 1971-82, Professor Grinker joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1982 as professor of human nutrition and served
as director of the Program in Human Nutrition from 1982-88. In 1983, she
received the additional appointment as professor of nutrition in the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, Medical School; in 1984, was
named research scientist in the Center for Human Growth and Development.
Professor Grinker taught courses in the areas of nutrition and aging and
in maternal and child nutrition. During her tenure as director of the
Program in Human Nutrition, she directed teaching responsibilities in
human nutrition.
Professor Grinker's principal research focus was in the area of childhood
obesity. She received funding from the National Institutes of Health for her
research in this area and was a frequent speaker on the subject at nutrition
conferences in many parts of the world.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Joel A. Grinker
professor emerita of human nutrition, professor emerita of nutrition, and
research scientist emerita.
Jane M. Lucas, associate librarian, will retire from the Business
Administration Library on July 31, 1995.
Ms. Lucas earned her B.B.A. degree in 1947 from Michigan State
University and her A.M.L.S. degree in 1971 from the University of Michigan.
She was inducted into Sigma Epsilon, an honorary society for business
administration graduates, and into Beta Phi Mu, the national honorary
society for library science graduates. Prior to joining the University of
Michigan School of Business Administration Library in 1971, she was
employed at Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and the Detroit
News.
At the Business Administration Library, Ms. Lucas began in reserves,
and then moved into reference work. With her business background, she
contributed effectively to the publication selection process and handled a
number of key subject areas, including accounting, finance, statistics, and


21




July Meeting, 1995


most recently, international business. Her selection responsibilities have
grown over the years, and she is currently the library's collection
coordinator. In this role, she works not only with faculty and departments,
but with technical services staff to ensure that selected materials are
acquired and retained appropriately.
Among Ms. Lucas' unique achievements are those which have improved
the library in an often "unsung" way. She developed a career information
center, setting up the career information structure currently in place in the
library and managing and maintaining the most current information
available. Another of her contributions is in the area of working papers.
Due to her efforts, the library has a collection of about 5,000 working papers
from approximately 80 institutions to assist patrons in their research work.
Ms. Lucas has also written a number of guides and bibliographies to assist
patrons in their searches and has co-authored a paper entitled "Compromises
in the Management of Working Papers," which appeared in the October 1992
issue of the refereed journal Library Resources and Technical Services. She
has made significant and long-lasting contributions to the Business
Administration Library.
The Regents now salute this librarian by naming Jane M. Lucas associate librarian emerita.
George I. Mavrodes, professor of philosophy, retired from active
faculty status on May 31, 1995, after a distinguished career as one of the
world's foremost philosophers of religion.
Professor Mavrodes received his B.S. degree (1945) from Oregon State
College, his B.D. degree (1953) from Western Baptist Theological Seminary,
and his M.A. (1960) and Ph.D. (1961) degrees in philosophy from the University of Michigan. He taught at Princeton University from 1960-61, after
which he returned to the University of Michigan as assistant professor of
philosophy. He was promoted to associate professor in 1967 and professor in
1973. He made important contributions to the Program on Studies in Religion, as well as to the Department of Philosophy.
Professor Mavrodes has been in the vanguard of an influential
movement that has used the tools of contemporary analytic philosophy to
elucidate the foundations of religion, and of Christianity in particular. He is
the author of Belief in God: A Study in the Epistemology of Religion (1970)
and Revelation in Religious Belief (1988) and has edited two anthologies:
Problems and Perspectives in the Philosophy of Religion (1967) and The
Rationality of Belief in God (1970). His nearly one hundred other publications cover such topics as revelation, divine omnipotence, resurrection,
miracles, personal identity and survival of death, and faith and reason, as
well as ethics and social policy issues that intersect with religion and morality-abortion, pacifism, the just war, and nuclear deterrence.
A leader in his field, Professor Mavrodes has served as president of both
the Society for Philosophy of Religion and the Society of Christian Philosophers and as a member of the executive committee of the American Theological Society.  He has served in editorial capacities for The American
Philosophical Quarterly, Faith and Philosophy, and The Reformed Journal.


22




July Meeting, 1995


He has been a fellow of the Calvin Center for Christian Scholarship at Calvin
College and of the Center for Philosophy of Religion at the University of
Notre Dame and has held visiting positions at Carleton and Kenyon colleges.
Over the years, faculty colleagues came to rely on Professor Mavrodes'
shrewd and incisive philosophical criticism, while students took advantage of
his wide learning and scholarship in philosophy, religion, and theology, and
staff appreciated his consideration and personal kindness.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his 33
years of service by naming George I. Mavrodes professor emeritus of
philosophy.
William C. Stebbins, professor of otorhinolaryngology in the Medical
School and professor of psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1995.
Professor Stebbins received his A.B. degree from Yale University in 1951
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University in 1954 and 1957,
respectively. He served as an assistant professor at Hamilton College from
1957-61 and was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington from
1961-63. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1963 with appointments in the departments of psychology and otorhinolaryngology and in the
Kresge Hearing Research Institute.
Professor Stebbins is the author of more than 60 journal articles and 30
book chapters and has edited or written 7 books. Although these contributions cover a wide range of topics, most deal with his primary interest, which
is the measurement of sensory function, particularly hearing, in animals.
Perhaps nowhere is this interest better illustrated than in his book, The
Acoustic Sense ofAnimals, a scholarly yet readable treatise on animals' sense
of hearing that deals not only with how animals hear, but why they listen.
Within the University, Professor Stebbins has chaired the Budget Priorities Committee and has served as acting director of the Kresge Hearing
Research Institute, chair of the psychobiology area and of the graduate
program in the Department of Psychology, chair of the Faculty Senate,
LS&A ombudsman, and associate dean for faculty programs in the graduate
school. At the national level, Professor Stebbins has served as president of
the Association for Research in Otolaryngology, as a study section member of
NINCDS, and has been active in the American Academy of Ophthalmology
and Otorhinolaryngology.  He has also served on the external advisory
committees for a number of institutions across the U.S., has served on the
editorial boards of numerous journals, and has been a reviewer for several
funding agencies. His honors include his appointment as a fellow of the
Association for the Advancement of Science, a fellow of the Acoustical
Society of America, and a fellow of the American Psychological Society.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
William C. Stebbins professor emeritus of otorhinolaryngology and professor
emeritus of psychology.
William J. Wrobleski, proei fessor of statistics in the School of Business
Administration, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1995.


23




July Meeting, 1995


Professor Wrobleski received his B.S. degree in 1953, his M.S. degree in
1954, and his Ph.D. degree in 1963, all from the University of Michigan. He
joined the faculty of the School of Business Administration as an assistant
professor in 1963 and was promoted to associate professor in 1966 and
professor in 1974. From 1981-84, he served as chair of the school's statistics
and management area.
During his tenure at the School of Business Administration, Professor
Wrobleski was recognized for his work in nonlinear time series analysis and
its application to important issues in economics and business administration.
He conducted some of the early international analysis of U.S. monetary
policy effects on major foreign money and capital markets. He has an
impressive publication record and has served as a referee on some of the
major professional journals. Professor Wrobleski has been a good citizen of
the school and a strong teacher. He has served on sixty-four dissertation
committees and is completing service on three more; this is an extraordinary
contribution to graduate education. He has made significant contributions
to the school and to his profession, and the faculty and staff wish him a long
and satisfying retirement.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming William J.
Wrobleski professor emeritus of statistics.

Mr. Doug Hanna, university architect, presented the proposed design of
the five-story addition to the University Health Service building, a project
that had been previously approved by the Regents, along with projects
involving the Michigan Union, Michigan League, and North Campus
Commons. He displayed schematic drawings, an elevation of the front of the
building, and an architectural model of the building with the proposed
addition.
Following Mr. Hanna's presentation, Regent Deitch moved approval of
the design of the University Health Service addition, and authorization for
soliciting bids and awarding construction contracts for the four projects and
two associated projects as described in the Regents Communication, providing the contract values are within the approved budget. Regent Power
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

July Meeting, 1995


Energy Conservation Projects
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Varner, the
Regents unanimously approved proceeding with energy conservation projects
at the Kresge Medical Research Building I and the UM-Dearborn Mardigian
Library and University Mall, as described in the Regents Communication.
Lease Assumption Agreement with Dr. Robert E. Anderson and Mr.
Saul Rose
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a lease assumption agreement with Dr. Robert E.
Anderson and Mr. Saul Rose for a medical office building located at 4990
Clark Road, Ypsilanti, Michigan. Because Dr. Anderson is also a University
employee by virtue of his appointment as a clinical instructor II in the
Medical School, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan, Dr. Robert E.
Anderson, and Mr. Saul Rose.
2.   Terms of the contract are as follows: The duration of the contract is 34
months. The University will lease property located at 4990 Clark Road,
Ypsilanti, Michigan. The medical office facility is 1,666 square feet, at a
rental rate of $15.65 per square foot, $26,067.12 annually, beginning on
March 13, 1995, plus the Tenant's pro rata share of the Landlord's operating expenses for each calendar year during the term of the lease. The
medical center will place clericals, medical office assistants, nurses, and
physicians to provide necessary primary care services to the community.
3.   Dr. Anderson's pecuniary interest arises from his commitment to the original lease agreement with Mr. Rose. Dr. Anderson will be relieved of his
liability for the original lease, and Mr. Rose will receive revenues generated
by the leasing of the property to the University.
Lease Agreement with Barron Associates
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a lease agreement with Barron Associates. Because
Dr. Parviz Panahi, a University employee with a 100 percent appointment in
the School of Medicine, has a 12.07 percent equity interest in Barron Associates, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Barron
Associates.
2.   Terms of the contract are as follows: The duration of the contract is 60
months. The University will lease property located at 4870 Clark Road,
Ypsilanti, Michigan. The medical office facility is 2,445 square feet, at a
rental rate of $16.00 per square foot, $39,120.00 annually, beginning on July
1, 1995, plus the Tenant's pro rata share of the Landlord's operating
expenses for each calendar year during the term of the lease. The medical
center will place clericals, medical office assistants, nurses, and physicians to
provide necessary primary care services to the community.


26




July Meeting, 1995


3.  Dr. Panahi's pecuniary interest arises from his 12.07 percent interest in
Barron Associates, the owners of the building. Through Barron Associates,
he will receive a percentage of revenues generated by the leasing of the
property to the University.

On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Varner, the
Regents unanimously approved a new degree program, "Master of Arts in
Adult Instruction and Performance Technology," to be offered by the School
of Education at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.
733 South State Street, Ann Arbor
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved acquisition of the property at 733 South State Street
(the former Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house) at a price of $630,000,
subject to satisfactory completion of the University's environmental due
diligence.
New Degree Program for UM-Flint School of Health Professions
and Studies

University would begin implementing its new Value Centered Management
(VCM) budgeting system, using it in tandem with the current system for this
first year. He observed that VCM represents a significant change from the
traditional method of budget management, and said he was looking forward
to examining its potential impact at the earliest convenient opportunity in
the fall.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1995


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, September 21, 1995
The Regents met at 9:20 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Palmer, Interim Provost Machen,
Executive Vice President Womack, and Vice President Harrison were also
present. Vice Presidents Hartford, Kinnear and Neal and Chancellors Nelms
and Renick were absent.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and recognized Regent
Baker, who made the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(a) and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act,
as amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet
in closed session at 9:00 a.m. on September 21, 1995, and reconvene
at 7:30 a.m. on September 22, 1995, for the purposes of considering
periodic personnel evaluations of people who have requested
confidentiality [Sec. 8(a)] and considering material exempt from
discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information
Act [Sec. 8(h)]. Such exempt material consists of a written opinion
from the Board's legal counsel.
Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. The Regents then proceeded to meet in executive session.
The meeting reconvened in public session at 2:05 p.m. in the Regents'
Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch,
Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Palmer,
Interim Provost Machen, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents
Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal, and Chancellor Nelms were also
present. Chancellor Renick was absent.
President's Report
The president observed that higher education has been under pressure
to increase productivity and noted that while staff productivity is relatively
easy to measure, faculty productivity is more difficult to assess. That is
because faculty productivity, as evidenced by a factor such as a high reputational ranking, is not determined through quantitative measures, but
through competition for the respect and high evaluation of knowledgeable
colleagues. Intercollegiate athletics is another example of a case where
reputation is not measured in quantitative measures, but by a team competing for a specific competitive goal. These examples indicate that measuring


29




September Meeting, 1995


productivity in an academic institution is very complex; although there are
some measurable products, the level of an institution's quality is evaluated
by such factors as respect by peers, diversity, intellectual breath, and leadership impact, all of which are very difficult to quantify. A means has yet to be
devised for measuring the productivity of knowledge-intensive enterprises.
Provost's Report
Interim Provost Machen observed that his first month on the job had
been exciting and enjoyable. He reported that freshman orientation week
had been very successful, and that he had received many positive comments
from parents. He reviewed the activities planned by SACUA for the coming
year and noted that the president would be appointing three faculty task
forces to address the future composition of the faculty, the faculty contract,
and the recruitment and retention of exceptional faculty and students.
Provost Machen observed that in a recent study of U.S. colleges and
universities, 38 University of Michigan academic programs had been ranked:
four were ranked in the top three of their discipline, eight in the top five, and
thirteen were in the top ten of their respective disciplines. He reaffirmed the
University's commitment to institute value centered management in 1996.
Chief Financial Officer's Report
Executive Vice President Womack reported that earlier that week he
had accepted the 1995 Corporation of the Year Award-Educational Sector,
which had been given to the University of Michigan by the Michigan Minority Business Development Council for its continued commitment to minority
business development. He recognized three individuals who had been
responsible for the University's winning this award: Dick Throne, Minority
Vendor Program Coordinator, who had started the program with former
purchasing director Eugene Ingram in 1983; Dennis Pozywak, senior
purchasing agent on the Flint campus, and Philip Abruzzi, director of
purchasing. The three men stood and received a round of applause.
Regent Varner observed that the winning of this award marked a major
milestone for the University, and that she had been encouraging the University to adopt an attitude of welcoming minority businesses since she was a
faculty member in the early 1970s. It was personally very rewarding to her
that the University had received this award.
Executive Vice President Womack then commented on the University's
new "Flex Benefits" program, which will be inaugurated in October. He
noted that many individuals in the Human Resources office had worked hard
to make sure that the University community would have an understanding
of this program.
Regents McFee and Power commented on the importance of flexible
benefits programs, given the changing and diversified nature of the work
force.


30




September Meeting, 1995


Michigan Student Assembly Biannual Report
Vice President Hartford called on Mr. Flint Wainess and Mr. Sam
Goodstein, president and vice president, respectively, of Michigan Student
Assembly, to present the first MSA biannual report to the Regents.
Mr. Goodstein noted that the presence of MSA officers at the Regents'
table is evidence of the improving relationship between MSA and the administration and thanked the Regents and past MSA administrations for their
hard work in arriving at this point. He observed that although MSA has long
been labeled as ineffective and out of touch, it is now a credible, responsible,
effective student government that is capable, willing, and able to address the
needs of its constituencies. Student government officials are expected to
follow up on their campaign promises and are held accountable for doing so.
They also are looked to by other students to provide leadership on issues of
concern to students and to voice student concerns to the administration.
Mr. Wainess noted that work on the new draft of the Statement of
Student Rights and Responsibilities has been a source of friction between
students and the administration, although he was optimistic that all parties
will eventually be able to agree on a reasonable outcome. He expressed the
concern that the October deadline will be difficult to meet because it will not
allow sufficient time to receive feedback from students. He requested that
the deadline be extended to November, by which time he believes a reasonable consensus could be reached among all the parties.
Finally, Mr. Wainess expressed concerns brought to him by the Campus
Safety Task Force. He asked that the Regents be mindful of safety concerns
brought about by construction on campus.
Mr. Goodstein closed with the observation that now that the Michigan
student government had achieved its goal of formally representing student
concerns to the Board, it was the envy of other Big Ten student government
organizations.
Regent Power asked Vice President Hartford if she felt there was any
merit to the notion of extending the deadline for adoption of a Statement of
Student Rights and Responsibilities to November. She responded that it
could be done in October, but it would be easier to do in November. Regent
Power observed that if the outcome would be better, he was in favor of
extending the deadline. Regent Newman stated that she would prefer to
wait until November, both for that reason and to be responsive to student
concerns that it not be taken up in October since that meeting would be
taking place in Flint.
University Program Rankings
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Harrison, who in turned
called to the table Robert Weisbuch, interim dean of the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies, and Marilyn Knepp, director of the Office of
Academic Planning and Analysis. Vice President Harrison reviewed the


31




September Meeting, 1995


history of the U.S. News and World Report rankings. He pointed out that
there is a distinction between guides and rankings. Guides provide descriptions of colleges and universities, with the intent of showing prospective
students the differences between them. Rankings only began proliferating in
the 1980s, and their purpose is more to assign quality rankings that infer
one institution is better than another. He called on Ms. Knepp, who gave a
presentation describing the types of methodologies used to produce the
various rankings of colleges and universities, the underlying assumptions
that accompany rankings employing each methodology, and the pros and
cons of each type.
Ms. Knepp observed that not all universities measure and report the
same way to the organizations compiling the rankings; thus, the results must
be viewed and interpreted with caveats in mind. Rankings imply a precision
that doesn't exist, for instance, that there is a material difference between
institutions that vary from each other by only a few points in any particular
ranking. She suggests viewing the rankings as indicating broad bands of
institutions; within any one band, institutions are probably very similar in
quality. When many rankings, all prepared using different methodologies,
are viewed collectively in a "meta-analysis", the result confirms this view.
In conclusion, Ms. Knepp noted that all rankings of quality are subjective. It is better to look at groupings of institutions, rather than absolute
rank orders, and to look at groupings of studies employing different methodologies, rather than one study in isolation.
President Duderstadt observed that the only category in the UVS. News
and World Report rankings that should be of concern is academic reputation,
an area in which the University of Michigan consistently ranks highly.
Next, Interim Dean Robert Weisbuch gave a report on the National
Research Council (NRC) Survey of graduate programs. He noted that the
University of Michigan had 14 programs in the top ten, but said that ranking
matters less than ratings of faculty quality. In the latter area, 19 of the 25
programs rated in 1982 improved in 1993. Dean Weisbuch reviewed various
aspects of the NRC study's rankings of the University's programs, noting
that some of the University's strongest programs were not considered. He
concluded that "we know ourselves much better than strangers can and are
constantly evaluating ourselves."
Dean Weisbuch reported that he and prospective Dean Nancy Cantor
had selected four themes for the graduate school: 1) "Sponsoring the future"
(learning where the new paradigms and new ideas are so that these can be
translated into courses and programs); 2) "Better the good" (continuing to
make tough decisions, to award differentially, and to award most the
programs with the strongest ambitions and the best ideas); 3) "Population
control" (with fewer students and the same amount of resources, better
support and better education can be provided to students); 4) "Pedagogy is
us" (the promotion of graduate student teaching skills as integral to the
professional development of all graduate students).


32




September Meeting, 1995


There followed a discussion about how influential the U.S. News and
World Report and National Research Council rankings are in helping
students determine which university to attend. Vice President Harrison
asserted that the rankings are influential, especially with respect to undergraduate and professional schools. Regent Deitch asserted that if these
rankings are important and widely read, it is incumbent upon the University
to respond in some fashion. President Duderstadt pointed out that the
disparity between the results of the U.S. News and NRC rankings clearly
shows the bias of the former toward private institutions. Dean Weisbuch
reported that the graduate school is composing a two-page handout that
discusses some of the issues surrounding rankings that will be made available to departments to send to applicants.
"Welcome to Michigan '95" Activities
Vice President Hartford gave a report on move-in and welcoming activities that had taken place for incoming students at the start of the school
year. She stated that her office had received many positive comments from
parents about the success of both the move-in itself and all of the events that
had been scheduled as part of the "Welcome to Michigan" week. She also
commented on the extremely tight housing situation, noting that over 1,000
residents were living in rooms that had been converted from doubles to
triples ("converted triples"). She reported that members of her and Executive Vice President Womack's staffs had begun preliminary discussions to
consider whether the construction of new residence halls would be desirable.
Regent Power said that creativity needs to be employed when thinking
about possible new residence hall construction. He reinforced the notion
that removing students from converted triples should be the highest priority.
Vice President Hartford responded that her highest priority is to place
students in housing that is sized appropriately for the academic demands
that are placed on them and noted that there are a lot of creative ideas on
this issue.
The meeting recessed at 3:55 p.m. and reconvened at 4:15 p.m. in the
Anderson Room of the Michigan Union to hear Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the
topics indicated: Craig Stutzky, student and chair of Students for Representative Diversity, on expanding the definition of diversity to include economic
diversity; and Michael Schroer, citizen, Jane Ferguson, David Kwan, and
Paul Rogers, prospective president, treasurer, and member, respectively, of
the Oxbridge Neighborhood Association, Barbara Bach, citizen, and Barbara
Levin Bergman, member of the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners,
all on the topic of possible relocation of the Burnham House to the Geddes
Avenue entrance to the Arboretum.
The meeting recessed until the following day.


33




September Meeting, 1995


Friday, September 22, 1995
The Regents met at 9:15 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Palmer, Interim Provost
Machen, and Executive Vice President Womack were also present, as were
Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellor
Nelms. Provost Simpson was present in place of Chancellor Renick, who
arrived shortly after the start of the meeting.
University Annual Financial Statements for 1994-95 and Year-End
Financial Information for 1994-95
Executive Vice President Womack reported that Ernst & Young, the
independent auditors, had issued a clean opinion in its audit of the University's financial statement. He noted that the auditors would be present at
the next month's meeting to present their opinion in detail and to answer
any questions the Regents might have.
Executive Vice President Womack called on Associate Vice President
Randy Harris, who gave a slide presentation on the year end financial information for 1994-95 compared with 1985-86. Mr. Harris explained that the
Current Funds consist of the Educational and General funds (E&G)
(General, Designated, and Expendable Restricted Funds), and the Auxiliary
Activities funds. In 1985-86, state appropriations accounted for 34 percent
of the Current Funds revenues; in 1994-95, these constituted 24 percent of
the total. Student fees increased from 26 percent to 32 percent of the
Current Funds during the same ten-year period, and government programs
increased by 4 percent.
The compound growth rate adjusted for inflation (real growth rate) for
student fees for the ten year period was 6.7 percent, while for state appropriations, it was 0.2 percent. In 1975, student fees made up 32.0 percent of
the combined revenues from student fees and state appropriations; in 1995,
student fees made up 57.0 percent of the total, a 25.0 percent increase.
Revenues from government programs and gifts and sponsored programs
experienced 6.0 percent compound growth rates since 1985-86, while
revenues from all other sources grew by 2.2 percent. Total Educational and
General revenues grew by 4.2 percent during this period, from $647 million
to $938 million.
Total Auxiliary Activities revenues ($1.051 billion in 1994-95) had an
adjusted compound growth rate of 5.6 percent since 1985-86, with the hospital, medical, and dental component of that having grown by an adjusted rate
of 6.0 percent to a total of $919 million.
Expenditures and transfers for the Educational and General portion of
the Current Funds totaled $634 million in 1985-86 and $1.270 billion in 1994 -95, for an adjusted compound growth rate of 4.2 percent. Salaries and wages
decreased from 51.0 percent of this category in 1985-86 to 46.0 percent in


34




September Meeting, 1995


1994-95, while staff benefits increased from 11.0 percent to 13.0 percent and
scholarships and fellowships increased from 7.0 percent to 9.0 percent. Total
compensation (salaries and wages plus staff benefits) experienced a 10-year
adjusted compound growth rate of 3.7 percent, increasing from $390 million
to $748 million, and scholarships and fellowships grew by 7.4 percent (from
$46 million to $120 million). Supplies expenditures grew by 4.2 percent,
from $143 million to $286 million, and equipment and plant expenditures
grew by 4.9 percent, from $54 million to $116 million. Total Auxiliary Activities expenditures grew from $407 million to $1.131 billion, for an adjusted
compound growth rate of 8.1 percent. The hospital, medical, and dental
portion of those expenditures grew from $339 million to $1.003 billion, for an
adjusted growth rate of 8.8 percent for the ten-year period.
In 1985-86, Current Funds revenues totaled $991 million, with Auxiliary
Activities comprising 42 percent; General Funds, 38 percent; Expendable
Restricted, 17 percent; and Designated, 3 percent. In 1994-95, total revenues
were $2,347 million, consisting of 45 percent Auxiliary Activities, 34 percent
General Fund, 18 percent Expendable Restricted Fund, and 3 percent Designated Fund.
Total expenditures and transfers were $1,041 million in 1985, with
salaries and wages accounting for 51 percent; supplies, 22 percent; staff
benefits, 11 percent; equipment and plant 9 percent; and scholarships and
fellowships 7 percent. In 1994-95, expenditures and transfers totaled $2,401
million, with salaries and wages decreasing to 46 percent of the total, staff
benefits increasing to 13 percent, scholarships and fellowship increasing to 9
percent, and the other two areas remaining relatively constant.
Following his presentation on the budgets, Associate Vice President
Harris updated the Regents about the status of the new M-Card. He distributed cards to each Regent and the executive officers.
Executive Vice President Womack explained that in the system of fund
accounting, any transfer is treated as an expenditure. In the case of the
Auxiliary Activities fund, the Hospitals deliberately transfer excess revenue
to funds functioning as endowment. That transfer results in an increase in
expenditures, when in fact, this has not really occurred. It will always
appear that expenditures and transfers have exceeded revenues when fund
balances are invested in a different way or if funds have been accumulated
for the purchase of expensive equipment or capital items.
Regent Power observed that during his tenure on the Board, the financial reports have consistently contained clean opinions, have come out on
time, and have been comprehensible and well-organized. Regent Power
moved adoption of the financial statements for fiscal year 1994-95 and
December 31, 1994, as submitted. Regent Horning seconded the motion, and
it was approved unanimously.

Regents' Resolution
Consistent with past practice, the Regents grant to President
James J Duderstadt for fiscal year 1995-96 a 5 percent ($11,621)
increase to his current annual salary of $232,421.
In 1993, the Regents adopted a presidential compensation
policy and inaugurated a        three-year phased equity adjustment
program to bring the salary of the president of the University of
Michigan    into  conformity    with   this policy.    This portion     of
presidential compensation is funded from        the Auxiliay Activities
Fund rather than from        tax dollars in the General Fund.         The
Regents implement the last installment of this program, granting
President Duderstadt an annual increase of $16,667.
These two increases bring President Duderstadt's total annual
salary for fiscal year 1995-96 to $260, 709.
Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

Retirement Memoirs. Six retirement memoirs were submitted.
David R. Bassett, M.D., associate professor of internal medicine,
retired from active faculty status on July 31, 1995.
Dr. Bassett received his B.A. degree in 1949 from Harvard University
and his M.D. degree in 1953 from Tufts College Medical School in Boston.
He completed his residency in internal medicine at the Jefferson Medical
College Hospital in Philadelphia in 1955. In the last three years of his
postdoctoral training, he held the title of NIH Postdoctoral Research Fellow
in Cardiology and was an instructor in medicine at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine. In 1963, Dr. Bassett went to Queen's
Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he was assistant chief of medicine in
charge of teaching. In 1966, he was also appointed associate professor of
public health at the University of Hawaii; he was appointed associate professor of medicine in 1967.
In 1968, Dr. Bassett came to the University of Michigan as an associate
professor of internal medicine. His hyperlipidemia program within the
Division of Hypertension became a major referral and training center in
atherosclerosis prevention and coronary risk reduction.   Dr. Bassett's
concept that an individual's lipid and blood sugar status should be the basis
for both prevention and clinical services is reflected in his work on standardization of laboratory methods and in the organization of outreach screening
programs for atherosclerosis risk factors. These programs became the logical
base for his research productivity.
During his 27 years of service at the University of Michigan, Dr. Bassett
has distinguished himself by his devotion to his work, his scholarly approach
to all issues at hand, his sincere interest in his patients, his readiness to
educate others, and his unswerving concentration on cardiovascular prevention, both as a clinical and as a public health problem. His always-evident
idealism and humanism, his unselfish cooperative spirit, and his personal
modesty have made him a highly appreciated and respected colleague and a
role model to younger physicians.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming David R.
Bassett associate professor emeritus of internal medicine.
Harriet A. Burge, associate research scientist in the Department of
Internal Medicine, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1993.
Dr. Burge received her B.A. (1960) and M.A. (1962) degrees from San
Francisco State University and her Ph.D. degree (1966) from the University


70




September Meeting, 1995


of Michigan, under the guidance of Professor Robert Shaffer. She was a
research assistant and Rackham predoctoral fellow during this period and,
subsequently, a postdoctoral assistant to Professor Shaffer (1966-68).
Dr. Burge joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1972 as a
research associate in the Department of Internal Medicine.  She was
promoted to assistant research scientist in 1977 and associate research scientist in 1988. During their 25-year collaboration, she and Dr. William
Solomon systematically evaluated the prevalence and clinical impact of a
broad range of airborne allergens. This work was recognized by the Distinguished Service Award of the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology
in 1988. Dr. Burge's painstaking studies of differential bioparticulate recoveries by mechanical sampling devices were especially critical to the success of
this effort. Her work facilitated initial clinical appraisal of many important
fungus materials, and she also conducted productive studies of pollen, mite,
and insect allergens. Many fellows of the Allergy Division were introduced to
bench research under her supervision, and several of them have continued to
pursue aeroallergen studies as academic physician-scientists.
In the course of her work, Dr. Burge developed special interest in the
microbial ecology and, especially, aeromycology of enclosed situations. In
addition to her many-layered research effort and resulting publications, she
developed a clinical reference laboratory for the analysis of indoor air
samples in the Midwest. Her input was increasingly sought in the analysis of
"sick buildings," and she served as a consultant to NASA, EPA, and several
state departments of public health. Especially notable contributions were
made in the area of aircraft cabin air quality and as coordinator of a national
bioaerosal sampling network that continues to grow.
Dr. Burge's career epitomizes the value of interdisciplinary research,
exemplifying both the benefits and the best traditions of the research
university.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Harriet A.
Burge associate research scientist emerita.
Sylvie J. Carduner, lecturer III in French and director of the French
Language Program in the Residential College, retired from active faculty
status on May 31, 1995.
Sylvie Carduner received her B.A. degrees in Latin, Greek, English
(1947), and Philosophie Lettres (1948) and attended the school for the
Professorat de Frangais a 1'Etranger at the Sorbonne (1949-52).  She
received her A.M. degree in education from the University of Michigan in
1971 and joined the faculty that year as a lecturer in French.
For 21 years, Ms. Carduner served as head of the Residential College's
French Program. Under her expert guidance, students enjoyed a vigorous
and rewarding education in French, while teaching assistants and lecturers
profited from her expertise in teaching. Ms. Carduner reorganized the
foreign language proficiency programs; developed criteria for evaluation of
language skills; designed an accelerated review course; organized innovative
upper-level seminars; created a program known as FLAIR which enabled
students to earn additional credit by reading texts in other programs in the


71




September Meeting, 1995


original language; and developed the course, "Advanced Proficiency in
French," for students who participate in the Junior Year Abroad in France
Program.
She is the co-author of several language textbooks, workbooks, language
readers, and articles on second language learning. She has been a member of
the American Association of Teachers of French, the Alliance Fran~aise, and
the American Council on Teaching Foreign Languages. In 1984, the University awarded her the Matthews Underclass Teaching Award. Her contributions to education were also recognized by the French government in 1992,
when it awarded her the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre des Palmes
Academiques.
Over the course of two decades, Ms. Carduner's students have been
consistent in their enthusiastic commendation of her excellence as a teacher.
She is extremely well-organized and is an excellent lecturer, who knows her
subject thoroughly and communicates it effectively. With her wonderful
sense of humor, and her warm, encouraging, and understanding manner, she
personifies the Residential College spirit.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher for her dedicated
service by naming Sylvie J. Carduner lecturer emerita in French.
Robert A. Green, M.D., professor of internal medicine, retired from
active faculty status on August 31, 1995.
Dr. Green earned his B.S. and M.D. degrees from the University of
Illinois College of Medicine in 1946 and 1948, respectively. He completed an
internship at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City in 1949 and a residency
at the Bronx VA Hospital in 1951. After serving in the U.S. Public Health
Service from 1952-54, Dr. Green returned to the Bronx VA Hospital as assistant chief of the pulmonary diseases service from 1954-58. In 1958, he joined
University of Michigan faculty as an instructor in the Department of Internal Medicine. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1960, associate
professor in 1963, and professor in 1970. Dr. Green also served as chief of
the pulmonary diseases section at the Ann Arbor VA Medical Center from
1958-72 and as assistant chief of the medical service there from 1960-65. He
was assistant dean of the Medical School from 1967-68, associate dean for
student affairs from 1968-74, and associate dean from 1974-77. He was a
member of the Senate Assembly and the Senate Advisory Committee on
University Affairs, which he chaired in 1985-86.
Dr. Green has received numerous awards for his teaching contributions,
including the Senior Award from the 1963 Class of Medical Students, the H.
Marvin Pollard Award for outstanding teacher of residents in 1966, rating
among the top 10 attending faculty in internal medicine in 1984-85 and,
more recently, the Galens Medical Society's Silver Shovel Award in 1992 and
the Kaiser Permanente Award for Excellence in Teaching Clinical Sciences in
1992. In 1995, he was awarded special recognition for contributions to the
medical student teaching program. Dr. Green has also lectured on pulmonary diseases at numerous institutions, has chaired the Michigan Advisory
Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis since 1992, and has also been


72




September Meeting, 1995


an active member in the American Lung Association of Michigan, serving as
president from 1990-92.
Dr. Green's most recent interest is in the field of geriatric medicine. He
passed the initial certifying examination in this specialty in 1988 and, in
1992, he formally joined the Division of Geriatric Medicine. In this new role,
he has actively participated in the clinical care and teaching activities for
older adults in the long-term care setting at the Ann Arbor VA Medical
Center.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Robert A. Green professor emeritus of internal medicine.
Dorothy J. Himmelberger, associate librarian at the University of
Michigan-Flint, retired from active status on June 30, 1995, after a productive career as a reference librarian.
Ms. Himmelberger received her A.B. degree in English in 1970 and her
M.L.S. degree in 1976, both from the University of Michigan. She joined the
staff of the University of Michigan-Flint Library in August 1977, serving as
reference librarian for 18 years.
In addition to her faithful and important work at the reference desk
assisting students and faculty in their use of the resources of the University
of Michigan library system, Ms. Himmelberger served as liaison with a
variety of academic departments, including art, music, philosophy and education. She was responsible for book selection in those disciplines, along with
religion, dance, and children's literature (which do not have formal academic
departments on the UM-Flint campus). Ms. Himmelberger was also responsible for compiling and scheduling library displays, including the library's
annual holiday display of new and classical children's books.
Among her special achievements, Ms. Himmelberger was instrumental
in the appointment of UM-Flint as one of the select sites for the Foundation
Center's "Foundation Center Cooperating Collection." She subsequently
served as supervisor of the collection. The Foundation Center Collection,
unique in the Flint area, serves as an up-to-date resource for vital information on grants and other funding sources. The collection is heavily used not
only by UM-Flint patrons but also is regularly consulted by a wide variety of
individuals and organizations in the greater Flint community.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated
service to the students, faculty and friends of the University of MichiganFlint, by naming Dorothy J. Himmelberger associate librarian emerita.
Nicholas P. White, professor of philosophy in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on May 31,
1995.
Professor White received his A.B., A.M., and Ph.D. degrees from
Harvard University in 1963, 1965, and 1970, respectively. He joined the
University of Michigan Department of Philosophy as an assistant professor
in 1969 and was promoted to associate professor in 1975 and professor in
1981. He has also been adjunct professor in the Department of Classical
Studies since 1987.


73




September Meeting, 1995


Professor White has contributed two books, Plato on Knowledge and
Reality (Hackett, 1976) and A Companion to Plato's Republic (Hackett,
1979), and twenty-five articles in ancient Greek philosophy. His Modern
Morality and Greek Ethics is in preparation. He has also published a translation of Epictetus' Handbook and has a forthcoming translation of Plato's
Sophist.   Professor White's wide-ranging interests in contemporary
metaphysics, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of language, and ethics
have infused his research and teaching over the years. He has held American
Council of Learned Societies, Guggenheim, and National Endowment for the
Humanities fellowships, as well as a fellowship at the Center for Hellenic
Studies.
A world leader in the field of classical philosophy, Professor White was
president of the Society for Ancient Greek Philosophy from 1986-87. He has
served as consultant to the dean at the Georgetown University Law Center
and as a member of the Advisory Committee, American Academy of Judicial
Education, National Endowment for the Humanities Project on Jurisprudence. In addition to his service to the University's College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts and the Senate Assembly, Professor White served as
associate chair, placement director, and chair of the Committee on Graduate
Studies in the Department of Philosophy.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated
service by naming Nicholas P. White professor emeritus of philosophy.
Memorial Statements. Two memorial statements were submitted to
the Regents:
Marilyn Sibley Fries, associate professor of Germanic languages and
literatures and women's studies, passed away on August 1, 1995, after a long
struggle against cancer. She was only 49 years old.
Born in Honolulu, Professor Fries was raised in the small college town
of Alfred, New York, where her father taught philosophy and her mother
taught English. While in high school and following her undergraduate career
at Bennington College, she studied for a year in Berlin, a city she came to
love, and which later became the focus of her scholarly work. Her doctorate
was obtained at Cornell, where she chose to write with an unknown beginning assistant professor named Sander Gilman -- currently president of the
Modern Language Association.
After ten years as an assistant professor at Yale, Professor Fries came to
the University of Michigan in 1985 and was eventually given tenure. By the
time of her death, she had emerged as an internationally-recognized expert
on twentieth-century German literature and culture, specializing in the work
of Christa Wolf. The symposium on German reunification she organized and
hosted in Ann Arbor in October 1990 was widely regarded to have been the
best scholarly assessment of that watershed event. In recent years, her
interest had begun to expand further in the direction of literacy theory and
German-Jewish writers such as Walter Benjamin.
Professor Fries was a devoted and much-beloved teacher and mentor,
especially to the many younger women who were drawn to her. For two
years, she served as special assistant to the dean for international affairs, in


74




September Meeting, 1995


which capacity she undertook a number of important initiatives, such as the
new LAC (Languages Across the Curriculum) program.
We join her husband Brant and two daughters, Kyra and Lorin, in
mourning the loss of our dear colleague. She had a fine mind, a warm heart,
and many friends who will miss her terribly.
Miranda Hsu-Yung (nee Lee) Pao, professor of information and
library studies, died of glioma on August 10, 1995, following an extended
period of illness under the loving care of her husband, Richard.
Professor Pao was born on February 14, 1936, in Shanghai, China, into
a distinguished Cantonese family. She came to the U.S. in 1956 and earned
bachelor's and master's degrees in piano performance and music literature
from the Julliard School in New York City. In addition to pursuing a career
in music, she earned master's and doctoral degrees in library and information science from Case Western Reserve University, where she began her
academic career in 1972. She joined the faculty of the University of Michigan School of Information and Library Studies in 1986.
Professor Pao's steady rise to international stature as a distinguished
scholar in information and library studies resulted from the excellence of her
teaching and research in bibliometrics, information retrieval, and evaluation
of information systems. She received numerous awards, including the
National Library of Medicine Medical Informatics Fellowship (1994), the
School of Information and Library Studies Excellence in Research Award
(1994), and the Lazerow Lecturer Award from Texas Women's University
(1993). She was also honored as the only scholar in the field of information
and library studies to receive the National Library of Medicine Research
Career Development Award (1983-1988).
Professor Pao made significant contributions to a variety of information
retrieval and dissemination problems in medicine, including use of medical
retrieval systems by health sciences practitioners; design, implementation
and evaluation of state-of-the-art medical information retrieval systems; and
bibliometric applications in biomedical literature. She authored a widelyused textbook on information retrieval and also wrote numerous journal
articles, book chapters, and conference papers. Miranda Pao was a superb
mentor to all and a guiding light to her doctoral students, showing them how
to teach, how to write, and most importantly, how to be generous with time
and service. Her warm personality, wit, and generosity touched many
people. A thoughtful and meticulous person, she showed genuine concern
and helpfulness for others.
Miranda Pao is survived by Richard Hsien-Feng Pao, her husband of 34
years, as well as two sisters, three brothers, and several nephews and nieces.
She left an enduring mark on her students and colleagues, both through her
professional accomplishments and her quiet mentoring and dedication. As
we celebrate the life of this distinguished scholar and teacher, our condolences go to her husband Richard Pao, as well as her brothers, sisters, nieces,
and nephews.
Degrees. There were no actions with respect to degrees this month.

September Meeting, 1995


Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Newman,
seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents unanimously approved the
consent agenda.
The University's Investments at June 30, 1995
Executive Vice President Womack submitted a set of seven "snapshot
reports" describing the status of the University's $2.4 billion in investment
portfolios as of June 30, 1995. University Treasurer Norman Herbert
reviewed the reports, which include the University Endowment Fund, the
Business School Growth Fund, the Donor Pooled Income Fund, the charitable remainder trusts, the University Investment Pool, the Veritas Insurance
Corporation, and the Long-Term Portfolio and responded to questions and
comments from the Regents about the portfolios and the investment
objectives.
Mr. Herbert emphasized that the University continues to make a
concerted effort to invest a significant portion of the Long Term Portfolio in
alternative investments, as it is believed these investments will add value in
the long run and outperform the identified benchmarks.
The real value added in the University Endowment Fund was 3.9
percent over the level of inflation plus distribution during the past year. Mr.
Herbert also reviewed the performance of the other funds in the investment
portfolio, noting that the charitable remainder trusts and Donor Pooled
Income Fund returned 21.3 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively, and the
University Investment Pool and Veritas returned 7.9 percent and 9.2
percent, respectively.
1995-96 Budgets
Executive Vice President Womack commented that the University's
Budget Book for 1995-96 had been distributed with the agendas.

Horning, the Regents unanimously approved the design and budget for the
General Campus Renovation Project Phase II Addition and authorized
issuing the project for bids and awarding a construction contract providing
the project is within the budget.
Tennis Center
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that a contract
for construction of the Tennis Center building had been awarded to the low
bidder, Freeman-Darling Construction Company, and a contract for the site
work had been awarded to the low bidder, B&V Construction.
Financing for the University of Michigan Tennis Center
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Power, the
Regents unanimously approved adoption of the resolution authorizing the

sale and remarketing thereof, all within the limitations of the following

The text of the resolution is in Appendix A, page 87.
Construction and Renovation Projects Student Fee Bonds, Series 1995
Executive Vice President Womack said that the purpose of this proposal
is to arrange for a loan of $1.2 million to the Alumni Association through the
issuance of debt which the Alumni Association would be obligated to repay
over a period of ten years. Regent Baker noted that this was an unusual
request and asked for assurance that the Alumni Association would be able
to repay the loan, and with what funds. He noted that there had not been an
appraisal of the property or an environmental impact evaluation.
Executive Vice President Womack responded that he would not have
made the recommendation if he did not believe that the Alumni Association
had the capacity to retire the debt. He also pointed out that the Association's property at Camp Michigania, which would be used to secure the debt,
is clearly worth more than the amount being financed. It is difficult to argue
that the Alumni Association is not an integral part of the University, and
this means of assisting them is, in his judgment, entirely appropriate.
Regent Baker said his concerns were satisfied and he supported the
recommendation. Regents Deitch observed that the real estate occupied by
Camp Michigania is extremely valuable and that supporting the Alumni
Association is entirely appropriate. Regent Deitch then moved, Regent
Power seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved adoption of the
resolution, authorizing the executive vice president and chief financial officer
to:
1.  together with the Underwriter develop the terms and legal documentation
for the Bonds, and to prepare, circulate and execute preliminary and final
official statements describing the Bonds, the University and its affairs; and
2.  apply for and obtain from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's
Corporation their ratings on the Bonds; and
3.  obtain a fmal proposal for the Bonds, including price and initial interest
rate, negotiate, execute and deliver the Bond Purchase Agreement to the
Underwriter and Remarketing Agent to be selected, and prepare related
documentation setting forth the terms of the Bonds and the sale and delivery thereof, and to execute and deliver the Bonds; and
4.  arrange for a loan of $1,200,000 to the Alumni Association, hold a Tax
Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act hearing (TEFRA) and negotiate a
secured loan agreement, all within the limitations of the following
Resolution.
The text of the resolution is in Appendix B, page 133.

September Meeting, 1995


University of Michigan Medical Center East Campus Primary Care
Facility Project
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that a construction contract for the structural steel package for the Primary Care Facility
has been awarded to the lowest responsive bidder, Art Iron, Inc., of Toledo,
Ohio, and a construction contract for the exterior building enclosure package
has been awarded to the lowest responsive bidder, Clark Construction Co. of
Lansing, Michigan.
University of Michigan Medical Center East Campus Primary Care
Facility Project (increase in project scope)
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. John Forsyth, executive
director of University of Michigan Hospitals, to review a request to increase
the scope of the Primary Care Facility Project to include a mammography
unit and an additional radiology imaging room. Mr. Forsyth explained that
the original plans for the East Campus called for a women's clinic to be the
next major facility placed there, so for that reason, the Primary Care Facility
purposely did not include a mammography unit. In light of the general
uncertainty in the health care markets, it has now been decided to make
improvements in Women's Hospital instead and to delay decisions with
regard to construction of a women's clinic on the East Campus. However,
this decision means that the Primary Care Facility would not have a
mammography function. Therefore, it is proposed to create a mammography
facility and to complete the creation of a fully functioning radiology referral
center by adding an additional radiology imaging room within the Primary
Care Facility.
Regent Baker moved approval of increasing the scope of the Primary
Care Facility project to include a mammography component and an
additional radiology room, as well as approval of the site and design for the
mammography component and approval to proceed with bids and award of
the construction contract for the mammography component along with the
Primary Care Facility. Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
Regent Baker announced that he had to leave the meeting, but asked
that when the issue of moving the Burnham house to the entrance to the
Arboretum is addressed, that other options mentioned in the previous day's
public comments session be considered. He then left the meeting (10:55
a.m.).
University of Michigan Medical Center Demolition of Terrace
Apartments and Construction of Parking Lot
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent McGowan, the
Regents unanimously approved proceeding with a project to demolish the
Terrace Apartment Buildings and construct a 308-space parking lot on the

September Meeting, 1995


University of Michigan Medical Center Women's Hospital Renovation Project
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved a project and budget for renovation of
Women's Hospital to provide office functions as described in the Regents
Communication, the appointment of Giffels Hoyem Basso as architect, and
proceeding with the project as described.
University of Michigan Medical Center Med Tnn Building Renovation Project
Regent Power moved approval of a project and budget for renovation of
the Med Inn Building to allow relocation of most of the Cancer Center
administration to that building, renovation of the Hospitals' executive offices
on Level 2 of the Med Inn Building, removal of trailers adjacent to the
Simpson Institute, submission of a Certificate of Need application to the
Michigan Department of Public Health, and proceeding with the project as
described in the Regents Communication. Regent McFee seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously. Regent Power observed that the
Med Inn facility has been enormously valuable for families of Hospitals'
patients.
Regent Newman left the meeting at this point, at 11:15 a.m.
Nichols Arboretum Project
Executive Vice President Womack called on University Planner Fred
Mayer to present this request for relocation of the Burnham House from 940
Maiden Lane to the Geddes Road entrance to the Arboretum to house an
Urban Environmental Education Center.
Mr. Mayer noted that the School of Natural Resources and Environment
has long believed that the educational value of the Arboretum would be
enhanced if there were an interpretive center to provide space for interpretive talks, on-site classroom space, and other support facilities. To that end,
Professor Harrison Morton, the director of the Arboretum, began a fundraising campaign which has so far raised about $200,000. Last year, a class in
the College of Architecture and Urban Planning produced a design for such a
facility, which would cost over $1 million to construct.
When the University purchased the site that contains the Burnham
House, which was built in 1839, local historic preservation groups had urged
the University to try to save it. At that point, Professor Morton suggested
that consideration be given to moving the house to the Arboretum for use as
an interpretive center. Mr. Mayer reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of the three sites that had been considered for placement of the house,
and the most desirable was determined to be at the Geddes Road entrance to
the Arboretum.


80




September Meeting, 1995


Relocating the historic house would serve the needs of the School of
Natural Resources and Environment at a significantly lower cost than building a new building. Mr. Mayer suggested that as a next step the University
should further investigate the details of moving the house, work with architects and landscape architects to determine the precise location for the building, and meet with the residents of the surrounding areas to address their
concerns about the proposal to move the house to that location. After this
consultation has been completed, a specific recommendation would be made
to the Regents.
Regent Power stated that he believes the Regents support the notion of
an interpretive center and of investigating the feasibility of reusing the
historic Burnham house for this purpose. However, he is not persuaded that
the proposed site is appropriate, and he believes it is important for the
University to consult with the people in the community who have strong
feelings about the issue.
Regent McGowan suggested that the discussion be tabled until such
time as an action motion can be proposed that addresses the concerns that
have been expressed. Regent McFee expressed her support for this idea.
President Duderstadt observed that there are several competing goals being
addressed by this proposal: preserving a historic house, providing an interpretive center for the Arboretum, and finding the most appropriate site for
such a center, and said that the current proposal might not be the best
method for addressing all of the issues. He expressed concerns about the
proposed site. He also suggested that the original program statement for the
center be reviewed to see whether the goals might be met by designing a
more cost-effective building than the one originally proposed, and then by
finding another site and use for the Burnham house.
Executive Vice President Womack then called on Professor Morton, who
noted that the Arboretum is a designed site, not a natural site, with a
mission of furthering the educational opportunities of University of Michigan
students, Ann Arbor school children, and other visitors. Currently there are
many educational activities taking place at the Arboretum, including 30
University classes, a docent program, a volunteer program, and many special
programs utilized by University and community groups. These educational
and research activities, plus 90 years of use, call for a refurbishing and
remodeling of the original idea of the Arboretum. He believes the site is
appropriate, and noted that as a teaching and research facility within
walking distance from campus, there is no intention to have parking at the
site. He stated that he has always been willing to work with the community,
but with the idea that the Regents needed to be consulted first. Now that
this has occurred, the public will be fully involved. He noted that there is
some urgency created by the limited window of time available to move the
Burnham house and the necessity in fundraising to have an identifiable facility to focus on.
Regent Deitch noted that he was particularly impressed by some of the
comments made at the Public Comments session, and that the linkage


81




September Meeting, 1995


between the community and the University requires reciprocity and respect.
Although he has always been supportive of the growth and development of
the University, the fact that this site is in the middle of a residential area
means that the concerns of the residents have to be paramount. He also
noted that the use of this historic building for this purpose might not be
appropriate, and suggested that perhaps a more modest proposal for a new
building might be more desirable.
Provost Machen emphasized that the main purpose for this project is for
education and research; it is not for recreation.
The original action request was then tabled for consideration at a later
meeting.

Architects
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Power, all six

percent of market value in 1994 and 3,000 shares at market values in 1995.
In addition, Dr. Fisk receives an annual retainer of $7,500 and $1,000 per

93




September Meeting, 1995 - Appendix A


(a) Interest Rate on Bonds. Interest on the Bonds will be payable as
provided in the Bonds and in this Section. Interest on the Bonds shall initially be
payable under the interest rate determination method determined by an Authorized Officer prior to sale of the Bonds. The interest rate determination method
thereafter may be changed with respect to the Bonds, or any portion of the
Bonds, as described in subsections (c) and (e) of this Section at any time and from
time to time. From and after the occurrence of an Event of Default described in
Article XIII of this Resolution, the interest rate on the Bonds will be the rate on
the Bonds on the day before the Event of Default occurred.
(1) Daily Rate.
(A) When interest on any Bonds is payable at a Daily Rate, the
Remarketing Agent shall set a Daily Rate on each Business Day pursuant to the provisions of this Section. Each Daily Rate shall be the
minimum rate necessary (as determined by the Remarketing Agent
taking into account prevailing market conditions) for the Remarketing
Agent to sell such Bonds on the day the rate is set at their principal
amount plus accrued interest. The Daily Rate for any day that is not a
Business Day shall be the rate for the last day on which a Daily Rate
was set.
(B) If for any reason the Remarketing Agent does not set a Daily
Rate for any Bonds on any Business Day or a court holds that the rate
set for any Bonds for any day is invalid or unenforceable, the Daily
Rate for such Bonds for that day shall be set by the Remarketing
Agent at the rate equal to the Prime Commercial Paper (30 day),
Tax-Exempt rate most recently published by The Bond Buyer, or by
such other publisher as the Issuer shall designate in writing to the
Transfer/Tender Agent and the Remarketing Agent, plus 1/8% per
annum. If The Bond Buyer, or such replacement publisher, does not
publish such a Commercial Paper rate within seven days preceding a
day on which a Daily Rate is to be set, the Daily Rate shall be set by
the Remarketing Agent at 50% of the interest rate for 30day taxable
commercial paper (prime paper placed through dealers) announced on
such date by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, converted to a
couponequivalent rate. In the event that the Remarketing Agent does
not set the Daily Rate as described in the preceding two sentences, the
Transfer/Tender Agent shall set the rate based on the information so
published upon which information the Transfer/Tender Agent shall be
entitled to conclusively rely. Upon delivery to the Issuer of an Opinion
of Bond Counsel to the effect that such action will not adversely affect
the validity of the Bonds or the exemption of interest on the Bonds
from federal income taxation under the Code and of a certificate from
the Remarketing Agent to the effect that the methods described in this
paragraph for setting the interest rate are unavailable or unrealistic in
the marketplace and the reasons therefor, then the Issuer, with the
advice of the Remarketing Agent, may designate a new method of
setting the Daily Rate for any Bonds.
(2) Weekly Rate. When interest on any Bonds is payable at a
Weekly Rate, the Remarketing Agent shall set a Weekly Rate on the Determination Date. The Weekly Rate shall be effective from and including the
Implementation Date, to and including the day preceding the next succeeding Implementation Date. Each Weekly Rate shall be the minimum rate
necessary (as determined by the Remarketing Agent taking into account
prevailing market conditions) for the Remarketing Agent to sell such Bonds
on the Determination Date at their principal amount plus accrued interest.
If for any reason the Remarketing Agent does not set a Weekly Rate
for any Bonds on a Determination Date or a court holds that any rate set for
any Bonds is invalid or unenforceable, the Weekly Rate for such Bonds for
that period shall be set by the Remarketing Agent at the rate equal to the


94




September Meeting, 1995 - Appendix A


Prime Commercial Paper (30 day), Tax-Exempt rate most recently
published by The Bond Buyer or by such other publisher as the Issuer shall
designate in writing to the Transfer/Tender Agent and the Remarketing
Agent, plus 1/8% per annum. If The Bond Buyer, or such replacement
publisher does not publish such a Prime Commercial Paper rate within
seven days preceding the Determination Date for which a Weekly Rate is to
be set, the Weekly Rate for such Bonds shall be set by the Remarketing
Agent at 55% of the interest rate for 30day taxable commercial paper (prime
paper placed through dealers) announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York on the Determination Date, converted to a couponequivalent rate.
In the event that the Remarketing Agent does not set the Weekly Rate as
described in the preceding two sentences, the Transfer/Tender Agent shall
set the rate based on the information so published upon which information
the Transfer/Tender Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely. Upon
delivery to the Issuer of an Opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such
action will not adversely affect the validity of the Bonds or the exemption of
interest on the Bonds from federal income taxation under the Code and of a
certificate from the Remarketing Agent to the effect that the methods
described in this paragraph for setting the interest rate are unavailable or
unrealistic in the marketplace and the reasons therefor, then the Issuer,
with the advice of the Remarketing Agent, may designate a new method of
setting the Weekly Rate for any Bonds.
(3) Quarterly Rate. When interest on any Bonds is payable at a
Quarterly Rate, the Remarketing Agent shall, on each Determination Date,
set a Quarterly Rate for each Bond. The Quarterly Rate shall be effective
from and including the Implementation Date, to and including the day
preceding the next succeeding Implementation Date. Each Quarterly Rate
shall be the minimum rate necessary (as determined by the Remarketing
Agent taking into account prevailing market conditions) for the Remarketing Agent to sell such Bonds on the Determination Date at their principal
amount plus accrued interest.
If for any reason the Remarketing Agent does not set a Quarterly Rate
for any Bonds on a Determination Date, or a court holds that the Quarterly
Rate set for any Bonds for any Interest Period is invalid or unenforceable,
the Quarterly Rate for such Bonds for that period shall be set by the Remarketing Agent at the rate equal to the Prime Commercial Paper (30 day),
Tax-Exempt rate most recently published by The Bond Buyer or by such
other publisher or the Issuer shall designate in writing to the
Transfer/Tender Agent and the Remarketing Agent, plus 1/4% per annum.
If The Bond Buyer or such replacement publication does not publish such a
Prime Commercial Paper rate within seven days preceding a Determination
Date on which a Quarterly Rate is to be set, the Quarterly Rate for such
Bonds shall be set by the Remarketing Agent at the rate equal to 70% of the
yield on 91 day United States Treasury securities as most recently published
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York before such Determination Date.
In the event that the Remarketing Agent does not set the Quarterly Rate as
described in the preceding two sentences, the Transfer/Tender Agent shall
set the rate based on the information so published upon which information
the Transfer/Tender Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely. Upon
delivery to the Transfer/Tender Agent of an Opinion of Bond Counsel to the
effect that such action will not adversely affect the validity of the Bonds or
the exemption of interest on the Bonds from federal income taxation under
the Code and of a certificate from the Remarketing Agent to the effect that
the methods described in this paragraph for setting the interest rate are
unavailable or unrealistic in the market place and the reasons therefor, then
the Issuer, with the advice of the Remarketing Agent, may designate a new
method of setting the Quarterly Rate for any Bonds.
(4) Long Term Rate. When interest on any Bond is payable at a
Long Term Rate, the Remarketing Agent shall, on or before an applicable
Determination Date, set a Long Term Rate or Rates for such Bond, in each


95




September Meeting, 1995 - Appendix A


case for the Long Term Rate Period for such Bond established by the Issuer
after consultation with the Remarketing Agent on or before the Determination Date. The Long Term Rate for any such Bonds shall be effective from
and including the Implementation Date, to and including the day preceding
the next succeeding Implementation Date. Each Long Term Rate shall be
the minimum rate necessary (as determined by the Remarketing Agent
taking into account prevailing market conditions) for the Remarketing
Agent to sell such Bonds on the Determination Date at a price equal to their
principal amount plus accrued interest. A separate Long Term Rate shall be
established for each portion of Bonds with different Long Term  Rate
Periods as designated by the Issuer.
If for any reason the Remarketing Agent does not set a Long Term
Rate for Bonds on an applicable Determination Date, or a court holds that
the Long Term Rate set for such Bonds for any Interest Period is invalid or
unenforceable, the interest on those Bonds shall be automatically converted
to Bonds bearing interest at a Daily Rate, pursuant to Section 203(a)(1)
above, provided that the Issuer obtains an Opinion of Bond Counsel to the
effect that such action will not adversely affect the validity of the Bonds or
the exemption of interest on the Bonds from federal income taxation under
the Code; otherwise, those Bonds shall continue to bear the same Long
Term Rate as had been set for that Interest Period for another Long Term
Rate Period of the same duration as had been previously set for those Bonds
by the Issuer pursuant to Section 203(a)(4).
(b) Interest Rate Determination by Remarketing Agent. The determination by the Remarketing Agent in accordance with this Section of the rates
to be borne by the Bonds during any Interest Period shall be conclusive and
binding on the Bondholders and the other Notice Parties. Failure by the Remarketing or Transfer/Tender Agent to give any notice required hereunder, or any
defect therein, shall not affect the interest rate borne by the Bonds or the rights
of the Bondholders to demand purchase.
The right of the Issuer to change any or a portion of the Bonds to or from
the Long Term Rate from or to another Adjusted Rate shall be contingent upon
its ability to obtain an Opinion of Bond Counsel on or before the date of the first
notice required to be given by the Transfer/Tender Agent pursuant to paragraph
(d) below, dated as of the date of such notice and to be reaffirmed as of the Implementation Date, that following the Implementation Date for the relevant Long
Term Rate Period, the Bonds continue to be the valid and binding obligations of
the Issuer and that the change to or from the Long Term Rate will not adversely
affect the exclusion of the interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal
income tax purposes. The Issuer's exercise of the option to change to or from the
Long Term Rate shall be deemed rescinded in the event the foregoing condition is
not satisfied on or before the date required, in which event the Bonds shall
remain in the Daily Rate, Weekly Rate, the Quarterly Rate, or Long Term Rate,
as the case may be, and the Transfer/Tender Agent shall promptly notify the
affected Bondholders of such rescission. In the event of such rescission the Bonds
affected shall remain subject to Mandatory Purchase on the date originally specified for the change to or from the Long Term Rate. If, in the event of such rescission, the Bonds continue to bear interest at the Quarterly Rate, notwithstanding
any other provision hereof, the next Determination Date shall be the first
Business Day following the Mandatory Purchase Date described in the preceding
sentence and the next Implementation Date shall be the fifth Business Day
following the Determination Date. If, in the event of such rescission, the Bonds
continue to bear interest at a Long Term Rate, the Issuer shall, subject to the
Issuer's tax covenant in the Resolution, determine the length of the next succeeding Long Term Rate Period for such Bonds.
(c) Change in Rate Determination Method. The interest rate determination method with respect to the Bonds or any portion thereof in blocks of
integral multiples of $100,000 may be changed from one Adjusted Rate specified
in Section 203(a) hereof to another Adjusted Rate specified therein upon the


96




September Meeting, 1995 - Appendix A


direction of the Issuer, following consultation with the Remarketing Agent.
Notice of such change in the Adjusted Rate period shall be given by the Issuer to
the other Notice Parties, at least 25 but not more than 60 days before the change
is to be effective. Such notice shall contain (a) the effective date of such change,
(b) the proposed Adjusted Rate (Daily Rate, Weekly Rate, Quarterly Rate or Long
Term Rate) and (c) the Determination Date. The effective date of any such
change shall be the first Business Day of a month; provided, however, that the
effective date of the change of any Bond bearing interest at a Long Term Rate to
another Adjusted Rate shall be the day following the last day of that Bond's then
current Long Term Rate Period, or any other date in which such Bond is subject
to optional redemption. Upon compliance with the provisions of this subsection,
the interest rate on the Bonds or portion thereof so changed shall accrue at the
new rate from the effective date specified in the notice of the Issuer until there is
another change as provided in this subsection.
Upon any change in an interest rate mode for the Bonds or any portion
thereof, the Issuer and the Transfer/Tender Agent shall take all steps necessary
to comply with any agreement entered into with The Depository Trust Company
or its nominee with respect to such change, including, without limitation, the
purchase and designation of sufficient CUSIP numbers.
If the interest rate on less than all Outstanding Bonds is to be converted to
a new Adjusted Rate, the particular Bonds to be converted shall be chosen by the
Transfer/Tender Agent; provided, however, that (i) the portion of the principal
amount of any Bond to be converted shall be equal to an authorized denomination
for the new Adjusted Rate, and (ii) the portion of such Bond not so converted
shall be equal to an authorized denomination for the current Adjusted Rate; and
provided, further, that in selecting Bonds for conversion, the Transfer/Tender
Agent may treat each Bond as representing the number of Bonds obtained by
dividing the principal amount of such Bond into units based on the authorized
denominations for the new Adjusted Rate and the current Adjusted Rate in such
manner as the Transfer/Tender Agent in its discretion may deem proper. If it is
determined that part, but not all, of the principal amount of any Bond is to be
changed to a new Adjusted Rate, then upon notice of intention to change such
part, the holder of such Bond shall forthwith surrender such Bond to the
Transfer/Tender Agent for (i) payment of the Purchase Price (including the
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for
conversion) of such part so called for change of Adjusted Rate, and (ii) exchange
for a new Bond or Bonds in aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate
principal amount of the balance of the principal of such Bond not subject to such
change. If the holder of any such Bond of a denomination greater than the applicable minimum authorized denomination for the current Adjusted Rate shall fail
to present such Bond, such Bond shall nevertheless become due and payable on
the date fixed for change of Adjusted Rate to the extent of the portion thereof
subject to such change (and to that extent only).
(d) Notice to Bondholders of Change in Adjusted Rate Determination Method. When a change in the Adjusted Rate for any Bonds is to be made,
the Transfer/Tender Agent shall mail to the Owners of the Bonds, by first class
mail at the addresses shown on the registration books of the Issuer maintained by
the Transfer/Tender Agent, at least 15 but not more than 60 days before the
effective date of the change a notice prepared by the Issuer which shall state:
(1) that the period for which the Adjusted Rate is effective for such
Bonds will be changed and what the new Adjusted Rate period will be;
(2) the effective date of a new Adjusted Rate period for the Bonds;
(3) a description of the new Adjusted Rate for the Bonds (including
the Determination Date);
(4) the Interest Payment Dates and Record Dates applicable to the
new Adjusted Rate;


97




September Meeting, 1995 - Appendix A


(5) any ratings assigned or to be assigned to the Bonds by Moody's or
S&P effective on such change;
(6) the procedures that must be followed for the Bondholders to Put
their Bonds under the new Adjusted Rate; and
(7) that all Bonds (other than Bonds for which the holder has delivered notice of waiver of purchase pursuant to Section 309(c) and the notice
shall describe the manner of waiving such purchase) shall be subject to
mandatory purchase on the effective date of the change in the Adjusted Rate
period, and all information required to be included in a notice of mandatory
purchase pursuant to Section 309(b), including that any Bonds so required
to be purchased which are not delivered to the Transfer/Tender Agent on or
before 12:00 noon on the purchase date shall be deemed purchased in accordance with the provisions of Section 310.
(e) Fixed Rate
(1) At the option of the Issuer, subject to the conditions enumerated
below, the Adjusted Rate feature of the Bonds (in whole and not in portions)
may be permanently terminated. In such event all Bonds shall thereafter
bear interest at a Fixed Rate determined in the manner provided -in this
subsection. In order to exercise its option, the Issuer shall deliver a notice
to the Notice Parties directing such termination. The notice shall specify
the Fixed Rate Conversion Date, which shall be a Business Day not less
than 45 days following the date such notice is sent; provided, however, that
if any Bonds bear interest at a Long Term Rate, the Fixed Rate Conversion
Date must be the date (or, if not a Business Day, the first Business Day
thereafter) all Bonds bearing interest at a Long Term Rate are subject to
redemption or to mandatory purchase pursuant to Section 309(a)(2). Upon
conversion to a Fixed Rate, the Bonds shall be converted to serial bonds
with maturities corresponding to the mandatory sinking account redemption requirements set forth in Section 301(c), provided that the Issuer shall
have the right to determine that only a portion or none of the Bonds shall
be so converted into serial bonds upon receipt of an Opinion of Bond
Counsel to the effect that such determination would not adversely affect the
validity of the Bonds or the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes under the Code.
(2) The Fixed Rate shall be established by the Remarketing Agent on
the "Fixed Rate Determination Date", which shall occur on or before the
fifteenth day preceding the Fixed Rate Conversion Date (or, if such day is
not a Business Day, the next preceding Business Day) as the rate which
shall result as nearly as practicable in the market value of the Bonds on the
Fixed Rate Determination Date being equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof plus, if the Issuer so elects, any premium necessary to pay for costs
of conversion and remarketing of the Bonds. Upon determining the Fixed
Rate the Remarketing Agent shall immediately notify the Transfer/Tender
Agent and the Issuer of such Fixed Rate, promptly confirmed in writing.
(3) Not less than 30 days prior to the Fixed Rate Conversion Date
stated in the notice from the Issuer, the Transfer/Tender Agent shall mail
by first class mail a notice prepared by the Issuer to each Bondholder
stating:
(A) that the Adjusted Rate feature will terminate and the interest rate on the Bonds will become a Fixed Rate;
(B) the Fixed Rate Conversion Date;
(C) the latest date the Fixed Rate shall be determined;


98




September Meeting, 1995 - Appendix A


(D) that after the Fixed Rate Conversion Date the Bondholders
will no longer have the right to Put Bonds to the Transfer/Tender
Agent for purchase;
(E) that all Bonds shall be subject to mandatory purchase on the
Fixed Rate Conversion Date, and all information required to be
included in a notice of mandatory purchase pursuant to Section 309(b),
including that any Bonds so required to be purchased which are not
delivered to the Transfer/Tender Agent on or before 12:00 noon on such
date shall be deemed purchased in accordance with the provisions of
Section 310;
(F) that any ratings assigned the Bonds may change on and
after the Fixed Rate Conversion Date;
(G) the redemption provisions to which the Bonds are subject
during the Fixed Rate Period;
(H) that during the Fixed Rate Period, Bonds may be issued in
denominations of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof; and
(I)  which Bonds the Issuer has elected will be term bonds
subject to the Mandatory Sinking Account Payments as set forth in
Section 301(c) hereof, and which are to be converted into serial bonds
maturing in the years and at such principal amounts as set forth in
Section 301(c) hereof.
Promptly   after  the  determination  of the  Fixed  Rate, the
Transfer/Tender Agent shall mail a second notice to each Bondholder advising such Bondholder of the Fixed Rate. In the event the Issuer determines
at any time on or prior to the Fixed Rate Conversion Date that it is unable
to meet the conditions set forth herein to convert the Bonds to the Fixed
Rate, the Issuer will promptly so notify the Transfer/Tender Agent and the
Transfer/Tender Agent will give prompt notice to the Bondholders that the
Issuer has elected not to convert to the Fixed Rate.
(4) The right of the Issuer to exercise the conversion option shall be
contingent (i) upon its ability to obtain on or before the date of the first
notice required to be given by the Transfer/Tender Agent pursuant to
paragraph (e)(3) above, an Opinion of Bond Counsel, dated as of the date of
such notice, to be reaffirmed as of the Fixed Rate Conversion Date, that
following the Fixed Rate Conversion Date, the Bonds continue to be the
valid and binding obligations of the Issuer and that the exercise of the
conversion option will not adversely affect the exclusion of the interest on
the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) upon
its ability to effect, on or before the second notice to be given by the
Transfer/Tender Agent pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) above, the execution of
a contract of purchase relating to the Bonds between the Issuer and the
Remarketing Agent or other underwriter or institutional investor, providing
for the simultaneous purchase of all Bonds. The Issuer's exercise of the
Fixed Rate conversion option shall be deemed rescinded in the event any of
the foregoing conditions are not satisfied on or before the date required or
in the event the contract of purchase described in (ii) above cannot by its
terms be performed on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date, in which event the
Bonds shall remain in the Daily Rate, Weekly Rate, Quarterly Rate or Long
Term Rate, as the case may be, and the Transfer/Tender Agent shall
promptly notify all Bondholders of such rescission. In the event of such
rescission all Bonds shall remain subject to Mandatory Purchase on the date
originally specified for the conversion to the Fixed Rate. If, in the event of
such rescission, the Bonds continue to bear interest at the Quarterly Rate,
notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the next Determination Date
shall be the first Business Day following the Mandatory Purchase Date


99




September Meeting, 1995 - Appendix A


described in the preceding sentence and the next Implementation Date shall
be the fifth Business Day following the Determination Date.
(f) Calculation of Interest Generally.
(1) The Transfer/Tender Agent shall compute the amount of interest
payable on any Bonds from the rates supplied to the Transfer/Tender Agent
by the Remarketing Agent or from the rates determined by the Remarketing
Agent or the Transfer/Tender Agent, as the case may be, in accordance with
the terms of this Resolution. The Remarketing Agent shall notify the
Transfer/Tender Agent of any rate set by the Remarketing Agent in writing
or by telephone promptly confirmed in writing by 12:00 noon, New York
time,
(A) on the first Business Day after a month in which interest on
any Bonds is payable at a Daily Rate or a Weekly Rate, of the Daily
Rate or the Weekly Rate, as the case may be, for each day in such
month;
(B) on the first Business Day following a Determination Date
for a Quarterly Rate Period, of the Quarterly Rate set on that Determination Date;
(C) on the first Business Day following a Determination Date for
a Bond in a Long Term Rate Period, of the Long Term Rate and Long
Term Rate Period established for such Bond.
The Remarketing Agent shall inform the Transfer/Tender Agent, and
the Issuer orally at the request of either of them of any interest rate set by
the Remarketing Agent. The Transfer/Tender Agent shall inform the Issuer
and the Remarketing Agent orally at the request of either of them of any
interest rate set pursuant to Section 203(a) other than by the Remarketing
Agent. The Transfer/Tender Agent shall confirm the effective interest rate
by telephone or in writing to any Bondholder who requests it.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Resolution, interest
payable on the Bonds shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(3) When interest on any Bonds is payable at a Daily Rate, a Weekly
Rate, or a Quarterly Rate interest on such Bonds shall be computed on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as
appropriate. When interest on any Bonds is payable at a Long Term Rate or
a Fixed Rate, interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360day year of
twelve 30day months.
(4) The setting of the interest rates and the calculation of interest
payable on the Bonds as provided in this Resolution shall be conclusive and
binding on any Person, absent manifest error.
Section 204.    Purpose. Execution and Delivery of Bonds. The Bonds are
being issued for the purpose of providing funds which, together with other available funds of
the Issuer, will be used for paying the costs of acquiring, constructing, furnishing and equipping the Project and paying certain costs incurred in connection with the issuance and sale
of the Bonds.
The Bonds shall be signed in the name of and on behalf of the Issuer by manual or
facsimile signatures of the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer or the
Associate Vice President for Finance of the University of Michigan. In case any officer
whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any Bonds shall cease to be
such officer before the delivery of such Bonds, such signature or facsimile shall nevertheless
be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such
delivery. No Bonds shall be entitled to any right or benefit under this Resolution unless
such fillyregistered Bond shall have endorsed thereon a certificate of authentication
substantially in the form hereinafter set forth duly executed by the Transfer/Tender Agent.


100




September Meeting, 1995 - Appendix A


No fullyregistered Bond shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless and until such
certificate of authentication shall have been manually executed by the Transfer/Tender
Agent, and such manually executed certificate of the Transfer/Tender Agent upon such Bond
shall be conclusive evidence that such Bond has been authenticated and delivered under this
Resolution. The Transfer/Tender Agent's certificate of authentication on any fullyregistered
Bond shall be deemed to have been executed by it if manually signed by an authorized signatory of the Transfer/Tender Agent, as the case may be, but it shall not be necessary that the
same person sign the certificate of authentication on all of the fullyregistered Bonds issued
hereunder. Upon the execution and delivery of this Resolution, the Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer or the Associate Vice President for Finance of the University of
Michigan shall execute and deliver to the Transfer/Tender Agent on behalf of the Issuer and
the Transfer/Tender Agent will authenticate, the Bonds and deliver them to the purchaser or
purchasers at the place agreed upon by the authorized officers of the Issuer and the original
purchaser of the Bonds.
As per the direction of the initial purchasers of the Bonds, the Bonds shall be issued in bookentry-only form and the ownership of the Bonds shall be registered in the name of Cede &
Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). In the event the Issuer determines that the continuation of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a
successor securities depository) is not in the best interests of the beneficial owners of the
Bonds or the Issuer, it will so notify the Transfer/Tender Agent whereupon the
Transfer/Tender Agent will notify DTC of the availability through DTC of Bond certificates.
In such event, or in the event DTC discontinues its services with respect to the Bonds the
Issuer shall issue and the Transfer/Tender Agent shall transfer and exchange Bonds as
requested by DTC of like tenor, series principal amount, interest or principal appreciation
rate, series and maturity, in authorized denominations to the identifiable beneficial owners
in replacement of the beneficial interests of such beneficial owners in the Bonds. While the
Bonds are in book-entry-only form, payment of principal of and interest and premium, if
any, on said Bonds by the Transfer/Tender Agent or the Purchase Price of Bonds by the
Transfer/Tender Agent, to DTC or its nominee shall be made as shall be provided in a letter

for making Puts of Bonds by Owners shall be in accordance to DTC procedures.

issued pursuant to the laws of the State and may have printed thereon such legend or
legends as may be required to comply with any law, rule or regulation or to conform to

to purchases and remarketing of Bonds and with respect to delivery of Issuer Owned Bonds,

that purpose at the principal corporate trust office of the Transfer/Tender Agent, by the
registered owner thereof in person or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, upon
surrender thereof at the principal corporate trust office of the Transfer/Tender Agent,
together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Transfer/Tender Agent
duly executed by the registered owner or a duly authorized attorney. Upon the transfer of
any Bond, the Transfer/Tender Agent shall issue in the name of the transferee and cause to
be authenticated a new Bond or Bonds of the same sub-series and aggregate principal
amount as the surrendered Bonds. The Transfer/Tender Agent shall make a charge for such
transfer sufficient to pay for any tax or other governmental fee or charge required to be paid
with respect to such transfer, but all other costs of making such transfer shall be borne by
the Issuer.
Subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Record Date and Issuer Owned Bonds,
the Issuer, the Remarketing Agent, and the Transfer/Tender Agent may deem and treat the
person in whose name any Bond shall be registered upon the books of the Issuer as the
absolute owner of such Bond, whether such Bond shall be overdue or not, for the purpose of
receiving payment of or on account of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on and
Purchase Price of such Bond and for all other purposes, including the giving or receipt of
notices, consents or directions as specified herein, and all such payments so made to any
such registered owner or upon his order shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge
the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, and neither the Issuer,
the Remarketming Agent, nor the Transfer/Tender Agent shall be affected by any notice to the


101




September Meeting, 1995 - Appendix A


contrary. Any registered owner of the Bonds may take actions relating to consents or directions with respect to a portion (in authorized denominations) of such Bonds which are inconsistent with the actions taken with respect to other portions (in authorized denominations)
of such Bonds.
Except as provided in Article III, the Transfer/Tender Agent shall not be required (i) to

action being required by the Issuer execute or cause to be executed in the manner specified
above, and the Transfer/Tender Agent shall authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like
tenor in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Bond, upon surrender to the
Transfer/Tender Agent of the mutilated Bond and receipt by the Transfer/Tender Agent and
the Issuer of indemnity satisfactory to them. Subject to and in accordance with applicable
law, if any Bond issued under this Resolution shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of
the loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the Transfer/Tender Agent and if this
evidence is satisfactory to both the Transfer/Tender Agent and the Issuer and indemnity
satisfactory to the Transfer/Tender Agent and the Issuer shall be given, the Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer or the Associate Vice President for Finance of the
University of Michigan, at the expense of the owner, shall, without further action being
required by the Issuer cause to be prepared and execute or cause to be executed in the
manner specified above and the Transfer/Tender Agent shall thereupon authenticate and
deliver, a new Bond of like tenor, bearing any statement required by applicable law in lieu of
and in substitution for the Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen. If any such Bond shall have
matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Bond the
Transfer/Tender Agent may pay the same without surrender thereof.
Section 208.    Cancellation of Bonds. All Bonds which have been retired by
maturity, redemption or purchase by the Issuer shall be canceled by the Transfer/Tender
Agent and returned promptly to the Issuer or cremated or shredded and a certificate of such

against the Adjusted Gross Athletic Revenues and moneys in the Revenue Fund with the

Chief Financial Officer or the Associate Vice President for Finance of the University certifies
that the average of Adjusted Gross Athletic Revenues for the two most recently completed
Fiscal Years for which the audited financial reports have been completed (the latest of which
shall have ended within 18 months prior to the issuance of the proposed additional Parity
Obligations), are equal to or greater than 200% of the maximum future Annual Debt Service
on the Bonds, the Prior Bonds any previously issued additional Parity Obligations secured on
a parity basis with the Bonds and the additional Parity Obligations proposed to be issued;
provided, further, however, that additional Parity Obligations (in any form or designation)

Obligations so long as the maximum Annual Debt Service after issuance of such additional
Parity Obligations shall not exceed the maximum Annual Debt Service immediately prior to

additional Parity Obligations (which may be in cash or in the form of a credit facility), may
be payable from a bond fund established therefor (which shall be distinct from the Bond
Fund in which the holders of such additional Parity Obligations shall have no claim), and
may be secured by a Credit Support Instrument in each case in which holders of the Bonds,
Prior Bonds and additional Parity Obligations therefore or thereafter issued shall have no
claim. Except for the pledge of Adjusted Gross Athletic Revenues and moneys in the

benefit of the Bondholders for such purpose under the provisions of this Resolution, and
sufficient funds shall also have been provided for paying all other obligations payable
hereunder by the Issuer (including the payment of or provision for payment to the

of the Bonds or the Purchase Price thereof. Otherwise, this Resolution shall be, continue

assigns the principal amount specified above on the Maturity Date specified above, unless

its successor (the "Transfer/Tender Agent') and to pay by check mailed to the Registered
Owner as of the Record Date (hereinafter defined) at the registered address, or, under the
conditions specified in the Indenture, by wire transfer, interest on such principal sum from
the date hereof or such later date to which interest on the Bond in exchange for which this
Bond is issued has been paid until payment of said principal sum has been made or duly
provided for, at the interest rates and on the dates set forth herein. Both principal and
interest are payable in lawful money of the United States of America.
In any case where the date of maturity or interest on or principal of the Bonds or the
date fixed for redemption of any Bonds is not a Business Day (hereinafter defined), the
payment of interest or principal shall be made on the next such succeeding Business Day,
with the same force and effect as if made on the date of maturity or the date fixed for
redemption, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date of maturity or date
fixed for redemption.
This Bond is one of an issue of Bonds (the "Bonds') of even date, aggregating the
principal sum of $               all issued pursuant to a Resolution (the Resolution")
adopted by the Issuer on, 1995. This Bond and the series of which it is one
are of equal standing and priority of lien as to the Adjusted Gross Athletic Revenues and
moneys in the Revenue Fund (each as defined in the Resolution) and are equally secured
thereby with the Issuer's Prior Bonds (as defined in the Resolution). The proceeds of the
Bonds will be utilized by the Issuer, together with other available funds of the Issuer, for the
purpose of paying the costs of acquiring, constructing and equipping certain capital projects
of the Issuer's Athletic Program and paying certain costs incurred in connection with the
issuance and sale of the Bonds, all in accordance with the authority vested in the Issuer by
law, particularly Article VIII, Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963.
This Bond is a limited and not general obligation of the Issuer and is payable solely
from the sources specified in the Resolution. This Bond is not a debt or obligation of the
state of Michigan or any political subdivision thereof.
Except as hereinafter provided with respect to purchases and remarketing of Bonds
and with respect to delivery of Issuer Owned Bonds (hereinafter defined), each Bond shall be
transferable only upon the books of the Issuer, by the Registered Owner thereof in person or
by his attorney duly authorized in writing, upon surrender thereof at the principal corporate
trust office of the Transfer/Tender Agent together with written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Transfer/Tender Agent duly executed by the Registered Owner or a duly
authorized attorney. Upon the transfer of any Bond, the Transfer/Tender Agent shall issue
in the name of the transferee and cause to be authenticated a new Bond or Bonds of the
same aggregate principal amount as the surrendered Bonds. The Transfer/Tender Agent
shall make a charge Tor such transfer or exchange sufficient to pay for any tax or other
governmental fee or charge required to be paid with respect to such transfer or exchange,
but all other costs of making such transfer or exchange shall be borne by the Issuer. Subject
to the provisions of the Resolution relating to the Record Date, the Issuer, the
Transfer/Tender Agent and the Remarketing Agent (as defined in the Resolution) may deem
and treat the person in whose name anyBond shall be registered upon the books of the
Issuer as the absolute owner of such Bond, whether such Bond shall be overdue or not, for
the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal and premium, if any, and
interest on and Purchase Price (hereinafter defined) of such Bond and for all other purposes,
including the giving or receipt of notices, consents or directions as provided in the Resolution, and all such payments so made to any such Registered Owner or upon his order shall be
valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the
sum or sums so paid and neither the Issuer, the Transfer/Tender Agent nor the Remarketing
Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
The Bonds, including this bond, Prior Bonds and Parity Obligations (defined in the
Resolution), are equally and ratably secured by an irrevocable pledge of the Adjusted Gross
Athletic Revenues (defined in the Resolution) collected by the Issuer and the funds from
time to time on deposit in the Revenue Fund (as defined in the Resolution). The Bonds are
also served by the funds from time to time on deposit in the Bond Fund (defined in the
Resolution). In addition the Issuer has covenanted, to the extent necessary, to pay the
principal of and interest on the Bonds from Legally Available Funds, (as defined in the
Resolution). Except for the foregoing, no recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds or any claim based thereon against the
state of Michigan, the Issuer or against any officer member or agent thereof or any officer of
the University of Michigan, as individuals, either directly or indirectly nor shall these obligations become a lien secured by any property, real, personal, or mixed, of the state of


123




September Meeting, 1995 - Appendix A


Michigan or the Issuer, other than the Adjusted Gross Athletic Revenues and funds from
time to t ime on deposit in the Revenue Fund and Bond Fund, as more fully described in the
Resolution. By acceptance hereof and as a part of the consideration for the issuance hereof,
the registered owner hereof expressly waives all other recourse.
For a complete statement of the purposes for which the Bonds are issued, the funds
from which and the conditions under which this Bond is payable, the general covenants and
provisions pursuant to which this Bond is issued, the rights of the holders of Bonds, and the
right of the Issuer to issue additional obligations of equal standing and priority of lien as to
the Adjusted Gross Athletic Revenues wi the Bonds ad the Prior Bonds a e o ns, and the terms
and conditions under which this Bond and the series of Bonds of which this is one, or any
part thereof, shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, reference is made to the above
described Resolution. Copies of the Resolution are on file at the Treasureasr's Office of the
Issuer.
Any term used herein as a defined term but not defined herein shall be defined as in
the Resolution.
Prior to the Fixed Rate Conversion Date, the interest rate on all Bonds shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent (as defined in the Resolution), daily, weekly, quarterly or
long term (each an "Adjusted Rate") as provided in the Resolution and shall be the minimum
rate necessary (as determined by the Remarketing Agent taking into account prevailing
market conditions) for the Remarketing Agent to sell such Bonds on the day the rate is set at
their principal amount plus accrued interest. If for any reason the Remarketing Agent does
not set an Adjusted Rate for the Bonds or a court holds that the Adjusted Rate set for the
Bonds for any day is invalid or unenforceable, the Adjusted Rate shall be set pursuant to the
provisions of the Resolution. Interest accrued on this Bond shall be payable on each Interest
Payment Date (as hereinafter defined). Interest on the Bonds shall initially be payable at a
Daily Rate. The interest rate determination method thereafter may be changed with respect
to the Bonds as described in the Resolution. A change in the interest rate determination

Section 602. Student Fees as Source of Payment of Bonds. To the extent that
on the fifth day preceding any Bond Payment Date the moneys then on deposit in the Bond
Fund are not sufficient to meet the interest, or principal and interest, payment coming due
on such Bond Payment Date, the Issuer shall, commencing the fifth day prior to the first
Bond Payment Date, and on each subsequent fifth day preceding each Bond Payment Date
while the Bonds remain outstanding, pay to the Transfer Agent for deposit into the Bond

sufficient to pay the interest, and principal, if any, coming due on the Bonds by maturity on
such Bond Payment Date; provided, however, that in making the payment over to the Transfer Agent, Student Fees shall be divided pro rata between the Bond Fund and any similar
fund for the payment of other obligations of the Issuer secured by a first lien on Student
Fees, to the extent necessary to effect the pari passu basis of the lien on Student Fees.

to receive, collect, expend, invest, use or otherwise hold or dispose of Student Fees as the
Issuer deems appropriate.
Section 603. Funds Legally Available Therefor as Source of Payment for the

University in an amount sufficient to provide annually sums equal to at least two hundred
percent (200%) of the maximum future annual debt service requirements on all outstanding
bonds or obligations payable on a first lien basis from said Student Fees or allocations therefrom. Such collections shall be sufficient, together with other available funds, to provide
such sums as are necessary for the operation, administration and maintenance of the University and its facilities and programs.
Section 605. Limitations of Obligations. No recourse under any obligation,
covenant, stipulation or indenture contained in this Resolution or in an  Bond issued
hereunder or caused by the creation of any indebtedness hereby authorized, shall be had
against the State of Michigan, or the Issuer or any member or officer of the Issuer or any

the State of Michigan, nor shall the same become a lien on or secured by any property, real
personal or mixed, of the State of Michigan or the Issuer, it being expressly understood and
agreed that the Bonds and the obligations created hereunder are secured by and payable only
from Student Fees and moneys in the Bond Fund, and that no other liability whatsoever
shall attach to or be incurred by the State of Michigan, the Issuer, or any member or officer

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Tuesday, October 10, 1995

Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and stated that he was
recommending the appointment of J. Bernard Machen as provost and executive vice president for academic affairs for the period September 1, 1995,
through August 31, 1997. He observed that a search for a new provost had
been underway for several months, but due to his own decision to retire from
the presidency on June 30, 1996, the provost search advisory committee had
recommended that the search be halted until such time as a new president
has been selected. His recommendation is based on the high regard shown
for Dr. Machen's leadership throughout the University since he began
serving as interim provost and in the interest of providing continuity during
this time of transition.
Regent McGowan moved approval of J. Bernard Machen as provost and
executive vice president for academic affairs for the period September 1,
1995, through August 31, 1997. Regent Newman seconded the motion.
Regent McFee thanked Dr. Machen for his willingness to serve in this role,
and observed that it would be important for everyone to work together
during the coming months.
Regent Baker observed that this would be a difficult time and expressed
confidence that Dr. Machen would provide strong leadership. There being no
further discussion, the vote was taken, and the motion was approved
unanimously.
Regent Power congratulated Provost Machen on his appointment, and
expressed the Regents' appreciation to Professor Warner and the entire
provost search advisory committee for their diligence in carrying on the
search for a permanent provost.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Baker made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in


153




Special Meeting, October 10,1995


closed session on October 10, 1995, to consider material exempt

session.

McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner.       Secretary Palmer, Provost
Machen, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents Harrison,
Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellor Nelms were also present.
Chancellor Renick arrived at noon.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and recognized Regent
Baker, who made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in
closed session at 9:00 a.m. on October 19, 1995, and reconvene at
7:30 a.m. on October 20, 1995, for the purposes of considering
material exempt from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan
Freedom of Information Act [Sec. 8(h)]. Such exempt material

Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then continued in executive session.
The meeting reconvened in public session at 1:45 p.m. in the Michigan
Rooms. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Horning,
McFee, McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Palmer, Provost
Machen, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents Hartford,
Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick were also present.
Regent Deitch arrived shortly after the start of the meeting and Vice President Harrison arrived at around 3:00 p.m.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and expressed the
Board's gratitude to Chancellor Nelms and his colleagues for their hospitality
in hosting the meeting. Noting this would be the last time he would chair a
Regents' Meeting in Flint, he commented on the state of the Flint campus as
it approaches its 40th year. He observed that the city of Flint is facing
challenges typical of other cities that had formerly relied on manufacturing
for their economic base. The president suggested that the key determinant
of Flint's future will be education, as it is through education that all of the
other challenges to our society can be addressed. He observed that the city
of Flint not only has a strong public school system and strong community


155




October Meeting, 1995


and private colleges, but also is the home of a major university: the University
of Michigan-Flint.
President Duderstadt observed that Chancellor Nelms has brought great
integrity, personal warmth, energy, and vision to the Flint campus since he
became chancellor. He then welcomed Professor Lawrence Kugler back to
the table as interim provost of the Flint campus and called on Chancellor
Nelms to present the academic plan developed over the past year.
University of Michigan-Flint Academic Plan
Chancellor Nelms reported that over the past year, the UM-Flint
community had been working to create a campus-wide consensus as to how
the campus would proceed through the next decade. The plan had been
developed under the leadership of Interim Provost Larry Kugler, with the
financial support of the Mott Foundation. Chancellor Nelms called on
Provost Kugler, who stated that the charge to the committee had been to
produce a refined mission statement and address the following seven
planning clusters: academic quality, academic programs, educational collaborations, community outreach, student support, minority attainment, and
technology and education.
Provost Kugler said that the committee's extensive consultation with
students, faculty, staff, community leaders, and other stakeholders had
yielded a number of recurring themes, from which the committee drew its
mission statement and recommendations. He reviewed the mission statement and the committee's specific recommendations related to each of the
seven areas mentioned above, all of which are contained in the document
that was distributed to the meeting participants, "A Vision for the Future: A
Report to the Community on the 1995 University of Michigan-Flint
Academic Plan."
Following his presentation, Provost Kugler responded to questions from
the Regents about the academic plan. Chancellor Nelms observed that one of
the responsibilities of a leader is to articulate a vision; his vision is that the
University of Michigan-Flint, because of its academic excellence, its responsiveness to students, and outreach to the community, will become the university of choice in mid-Michigan. He believes that this plan will help the
University to move in that direction. For the next several years, Chancellor
Nelms reported that the Flint campus will focus on the following six areas: 1)
developing a mechanism  to assess quality; 2) managing enrollment to
enhance retention; 3) developing new academic programs that serve the
needs of the region, with emphasis on graduate programs; 4) forming strategic alliances with other educational institutions; 5) delivering courses in
communities experiencing population growth; and 6) enhancing the use of
technology in delivering services to students and providing administrative
support. Chancellor Nelms said that he will fund these initiatives with a
$500,000 academic excellence grant received some years ago.

October Meeting, 1995


Chancellor Nelms acknowledged the presence in the audience of Mr.
Woodrow Stanley, mayor of the city of Flint and a UM-Flint graduate. He
then introduced Mr. Bill White, chair of the Mott Foundation, which had
donated the funds to generate the 1995 Academic Plan.
Mr. White gave an overview of the economic situation in the city of Flint
and the surrounding region, noting that although thousands of traditional
manufacturing jobs have disappeared in the area, there are also world class
high tech industries that require employees with advanced education. He
observed that the presence of the University of Michigan in Flint offers the
University a unique place to confront many of the issues that are plaguing
the nation. Mr. White stated that the former Autoworld property across the
river from the Flint campus should be devoted to higher education, so to that
end, the Mott Foundation has offered funding in the range of $40 million to
help the University of Michigan-Flint bring this about.
Regent Baker observed that the Mott Foundation has supported the
University continuously since its inception. He expressed his gratitude to
the foundation for its latest contribution, the Autoworld property. Regent
Newman also expressed her thanks.
Regent Varner left the meeting at this point, at 2:40 p.m.
Chancellor Nelms then called on Ms. Kristen Skivington, assistant to
the chancellor, who described the Community Stabilization and Revitaliza.
tion Project (CSR), through which the UM-Flint provides technical assistance to businesses and nonprofit organizations in Genesee County. Ms.
Skivington called on Professor Fataneh Taghaboni, who gave a presentation
on the work she had done with Genesee Packaging, Inc., through CSR.
Chancellor Nelms then thanked the Regents for having been willing to
spend a portion of their meeting learning more about the Flint Campus.
There followed a five-minute break, after which the meeting reconvened at
3:10 p.m.
1996-97 and 1997-98 State Budget Requests, Ann Arbor Campus
President Duderstadt called on Provost Machen, who noted that state
support will be critical in the coming year as the University searches for a
new president. He also stated that the means of classifying the state's
universities according to Carnegie Commission criteria, as was done last year
during the appropriations process, is flawed, and our budget request to the
state recommends it not be used again..
For 1996-97, the University is requesting an increase of 3.1 percent
($8.9 million) for inflation and an increase of $9.5 million for two areas of
program revisions: $7.5 million for new and expanded partnerships for
outreach to the state, which will consist of the Center for Learning through
Community Service; the State and Local Policy Research Center; economic
development outreach, done largely through the Business and Industrial
Assistance Division (BIAD); and the Institute for Educational Innovation in


157




October Meeting, 1995


K-12. The second component of the program revision is expansion of opportunities for undergraduate research ($2.0 million). The total incremental
request for 1996-97 is $18.4 million.
For 1997-98, the incremental request is for $10.1 million (3.3 percent)
for inflation on operations, and $10 million for program revisions (further
expansion of partnerships for outreach), for a total requested increase of
$20.1 million.
Provost Machen reported that the program revisions are slated to begin
in the current year. However, he and President Duderstadt both noted that
the additional funding that has been requested will be important to their
continuation.
Regent McFee called attention to the planned Institute for Educational
Innovation in K-12, which she believes will fill an extremely important need.
President Duderstadt noted that it is generally agreed among leaders of
higher education that improving the K-12 education system constitutes one
of the great challenges of our time. He reviewed some proposals for major
changes in teaching credentials and course content that are soon to be
announced in an attempt to respond to these challenges.
In response to a question from Regent Baker as to whether the University had reduced any programs, Provost Machen noted that whenever there
are opportunities to downsize or re-allocate, there is always a huge backlog of
programs waiting to be started. He noted that the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies had eliminated three programs during the past
year.
Regent McFee suggested that the two percent reallocation program
described in the budget request be highlighted to reinforce the University's
commitment to hold down costs.
1996-97 and 1997-98 State Budget Requests, UM-Dearborn
Chancellor Renick observed that outreach and partnership activities
have always been hallmarks of the Dearborn Campus. The UM-Dearborn
budget requests reflect the campus' ongoing priorities, including investments
in technology, competitive faculty salaries, the Environmental Interpretive
Center, and funding for enrollment growth. Specifically, the total 1996-97
incremental request of $3,632,000 calls for $1,477,000 for maintenance of
quality educational programming (compensation and non-compensation);
$955,000 for Technology in Service of Learning (Phase 1); and $1,200,000 for
the Environmental Interpretive Center. The incremental increase requested
for 1997-98 calls for $1,621,000 for maintenance of quality educational
programming; $816,000 for technology in service of learning (Phase 2); and
$663,000 for faculty to support program growth.


158




October Meeting, 1995


1996-97 and 1997-98 State Budget Requests, UM-Flint
Chancellor Nelms reported that the Flint campus' budget focuses on the
growth potential of the campus, student retention, improved use of technology, and faculty and staff compensation. The 1996-97 incremental request of
$2,735,000 calls for $225,000 for improvements in the quality of student life
(student retention and scholarships), $575,000 for new program development
and academic planning initiatives, $800,000 for infrastructure and technology improvements, and a 3.1 percent inflationary salary and non-salary
increase ($1,135,000).
The 1997-98 incremental request of $2,846,000 calls for $175,000 for
improvements in the quality of student life, $625,000 for new program development and academic planning initiatives, $800,000 for infrastructure and
technology, and a 3.3 percent inflationary salary and non-salary increase
($1,246,000).
The president called on Ms. Cynthia Wilbanks, associate vice president
for university relations, and Mr. Ed Bagale, associate vice chancellor for
government relations at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, to comment
on how well these requests respond to the current climate in the state legislature. Ms. Wilbanks stated that she believes the documents respond appropriately to concerns that have been expressed among the legislators, particularly the sections describing the University's efforts at cost-reduction and
value centered management and in the reinforcement of a partnership
relationship with the state's citizens. She and Mr. Bagale believed that the
documents would be received favorably in the legislature.
Regent Deitch commented that he was heartened by the quality of the
team representing the University in Lansing, and said that he was confident
that combined with the efforts of the rest of the administrative team, the
University would be successful in this legislative season.
There followed a 15 minute recess at 3:45 p.m., after which the meeting
reconvened to hear public comments. However, there being no speakers
present for Public Comments, the meeting recessed at 4:00 p.m.
Friday October 20, 1995
The Regents reconvened at 7:30 a.m. to continue in executive session, as
approved on Thursday, October 19, 1995. They then met in public session at
9:20 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and
Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman, and Power.
Secretary Palmer, Provost Machen, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice
Presidents Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors Nelms
and Renick were also present. Regent Varner was absent.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Executive Vice President Womack.


159




October Meeting, 1995


Ernst & Young LLP Management Report with University Responses
Executive Vice President Womack invited Mssrs. Bob Emde, Harold
Miller, and George Johnson, who represent the firm Ernst & Young, LLP, to
the table to present the external auditor's report. Mr. Emde noted that Mr.
Johnson is a managing partner in the firm George Johnson and Company,
which works with Ernst & Young to perform the audit,
Mr. Emde reported that the audit report expresses a clean, unqualified
opinion on the University's combined financial statements, including the
financial statements for those entities that are part of the combined financial
statements, but that are audited separately. In addition, there were no
material weaknesses noted in procedures or controls. In each instance noted
in the management letter, Mr. Emde noted that the University had
concurred with the recommendations.
Regent Baker commented that the Regents were available to meet with
the auditors privately if they deemed such a discussion necessary. Regent
Deitch noted that the Regents do not have an audit committee and asked
whether an audit committee would serve to facilitate communication. Mro
Emde responded that he did not believe having an audit committee would be
particularly productive, given the way the University is organized and the
very public nature of all of its activities. Regent Deitch asked Mr. Emde to
provide the Regents with information on the relationship between audit
committees and external auditors in other public universities that do have
audit committees.
Regent McFee observed that the Regents rely on the objective review
provided by the external auditors to bring to their attention any issues that
the auditors believe merit their involvement.
Presidential Search
his retirement at the end of the current academic year, much interest has
been expressed about consulting with the Board about the search for his
successor.
Regent McFee read the following letter into the record in the form of a
resolution:
An Open Letter to the University Community:
President James J Duderstadt's recent announcement that he
intends to step down from the presidency of the University of
Michigan signals the beginning of one of the most important
responsibilities the University community undertakes: the selection
of its next president. As stewards of the public trust, the Board of
Regents approaches this task with unified resolve to find the best
person for this most important leadership role, a person in the
tradition most recently defined by Harlan Hatcher, Robben


160




October Meeting, 1995


Fleming, Harold Shapiro, and James Duderstadt. We approach this
task with two important principles in mind: clarity and community.
While we are clear that our goal is to find the best possible
president for our great University, we also firmly believe that we
need to consult extensively within the University community before
undertaking the search.  We believe that the involvement of the
entire University community is an essential component of this
process: envisioning the University's needs over the next decade,
defining the qualities the next president must have, and advising us
on the best process for conducting a search. The selection of the next
president of the University is a shared responsibility, and we intend to
consult with all segments of the community —faculty, students, staff,
and alumni-before and during the search.
We call upon all of you, therefore, for your input and guidance.
To that end, we are asking Provost Machen, Vice President Harrison,
and Secretary Palmer to:
1) Plan a series of public forums for the Regents to hear
from various constituencies of the University community.
We will also invite letters and other written communication from faculty, students, staff, and alumni.
2) Provide the Board with background information on past presidential searches here at Mi'chin and review current and
recent searches at other iswitutbns idthin Michigan and
around the country.
We are asking Provost Machen, Vice President Harrison, and
Secretary Palmer to arrange for these sessions to be held and this
information to be gathered within the next two months.
We do want to encourage you all to bring us your ideas and
viewpoints.  'hile the ultimate authority to select the president is
vested in the Board of Regents by the Constitution of the State of
Michigan, your involvement will be vital to our success and to the
future of our great University.
Sincerely,
The Regents of the University of Michigan
Regent McFee offered a resolution that this letter be entered into the
record as an open letter to the University community and as a statement of
how the Regents are to begin this task. Regent Power supported the resolution, and it was approved unanimously.
Comments on the Service of President Duderstadt
Regent Baker made the following statement:


161




October Meeting, 1995


The Regents have accepted the presidents resignation with
regret. We are grateful for his service to the University as a teacher,
professor, researcher, dean, scientist, provost, interim president, and
president President Duderstadt's contributions to the University
have been immense. I personally am very grateful for all he has
done, and it is appropriate that the Regents express their gratitude.
Regent Power supported Regent Baker's statement. Regent McFee
added that the Regents sincerely appreciate the forthrightness and willingness the president has expressed in going forward with this period of transition and making it as expeditious and smooth as possible.
President Duderstadt responded that the Regents would have his
continued, 100 percent effort until the end of his term to maintain the
momentum of the institution.
1995-96 Enrollment Figures
President Duderstadt observed that minority enrollment figures
continue to increase, with students of color comprising 25.0 percent of the
student body and African-Americans comprising 8.7 percent. When international students are included in the calculations, about one-third of the
student body are students of color. Not only is this balance beginning to
reflect the diversity of society, but the quality of the student body is as
strong as it has ever been. This demonstrates the close relationship between
diversity and excellence in higher education, as well as the leadership role
the University continues to play in serving all of our society.
Regent Deitch commented that President Duderstadt's commitment to
diversity and the advances that have been achieved as a result of this
commitment are at the "top of the list" of his accomplishments. As a
Regent, he wished to reaffirm the president's commitment to these principles
and said that seeking out a person with similar commitments and leadership
in these issues will be paramount in his decision-making.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted the minutes of the September
1995 meeting for approval
Reports.   Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports of
investments, plant extension, litigation, and personnel-labor relations, and a
report on noncompetitive purchases greater than $2,000 for the period July
1-September 30, 1995. He commented on the recent performance of the
market, noting that the University's high return is a direct result of its longterm commitment and diversification. He invited the Regents to attend the
Investment Advisory Committee meeting at the end of the month.
Executive Vice President Womack also commented on the large number
of construction projects that is scheduled for completion by Fall 1996. These
include the Central Campus Infrastructure, Haven Hall Connector, East

October Meeting, 1995


Vice President for Development. President Duderstadt noted that
Vice President Kinnear had done an outstanding job of leading the Campaign
for Michigan, and that he had expressed his willingness to serve in this role
through the end of the campaign. Included in the personnel actions is a
recommendation to remove the "interim" from his title and extend his
tenure as vice president for development for two more years. He observed
that Vice President Kinnear is also a noted professor of marketing, and his
willingness to commit himself to leading the campaign shows his extraordinary commitment to the University of Michigan.
Regent Power moved approval of the appointment of Thomas C.
Kinnear as vice president for development from October 1, 1995 through
August 31, 1997. Regent Newman seconded the motion. Regent Power
observed that since August 1994, when Professor Kinnear was named
interim vice president for development, he has raised over $265 million in
new gifts and pledges in the Campaign for Michigan. He commented on the
high levels of energy, confidence, teamwork, and other outstanding attributes he had brought to the position. The vote was then taken and the
motion was approved unanimously. Vice President Kinnear thanked the
Regents, president, officers, and his staff for their confidence and support.
Personnel Actions. Provost Machen, Chancellor Renick, and Chancellor Nelms submitted a number of personnel actions.   Provost Machen
reported that the Medical School had withdrawn the request for establishment of the Frederick G. L. Huetwell Professorship in Ophthalmology.

investigator (Dr. Denise Park) and her principal collaborator (Dr. Roger
Morrell) moved to the University of Michigan from    the University of


179




October Meeting, 1995


Georgia. Because both contracts involve sub-contracts to the University of
Georgia, and Drs. Park and Morrell retain adjunct faculty status there, this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and the University
of Georgia.
2.  The terms of the agreement are as follows: Under Project 1 a total subcontract of approximately $125,000 is planned for the period August 1, 1995
through January 31, 1997. Under Project 2 a total subcontract of $341,120
is planned for the period August 1, 1995 through July 31, 1998. The
University's standard subcontract provisions will apply.
3.  Neither Dr. Denise Park nor Dr. Roger Morrell will receive any compensation from the University of Georgia.

182




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1995


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, November 16, 1995
The Regents met at 10:05 a.m. in the Welker Room of the Michigan
Union. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Horning,
McFee, McGowan, Newman, and Power. Secretary Palmer, Provost Machen,
Executive Vice President Womack, and Vice Presidents Harrison and
Hartford were also present. Vice Presidents Kinnear and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick were absent; Regents Deitch and Varner arrived after
the start of the meeting.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and recognized Regent
Horning, who made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in
closed session at 10:00 a.m. on November 16, 1995, and reconvene
at 7:30 a.m. on October 20, 1995, for the purposes of considering
material exempt from discussion or disclosur   e by the Michigan
Freedom of Information Act [Sec. 8(h)]. Such exempt material
consists of a written opinion from the Board's legal counsel
Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously,
The meeting then continued in executive session.
The meeting reconvened in public session at 1:40 p.m. in the Regents'
Room.   Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch,
Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner.       Secretary
Palmer, Provost Machen, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents
Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellor Nelms were also
present. Chancellor Renick arrived at about 2:30 p.m.; Provost Simpson
attended in his stead until that time.
President's Report
President Duderstadt commented on the recent appointment of Lloyd
Carr as head football coach, noting that this highlights the extraordinary
attention paid by the media to intercollegiate athletics at Michigan and also
highlights why intercollegiate athletics is important to higher education. He
observed that the fact that college sports has become a major form of entertainment for the public at large has led to many of the current difficulties in
intercollegiate athletics. One reason this has become difficult to control is
that the organizations set up to control intercollegiate athletics, particularly
the NCAA, have had great difficulty in coping with the extraordinary
pressure exerted by the media and the public.


183




November Meeting, 1995


The president noted that in recent years, university presidents have
taken steps to reassert their control over intercollegiate athletics and to
better align them with the academic philosophy and purpose of universities.
One such proponent of such activity was the Knight Commission, which
spelled out the following fundamental principles:  that the educational
values, practices, and missions of the institution would determine the
standards by which intercollegiate athletics were conducted; that the responsibility and authority for the administration of the athletic department are
vested in the president and through the president, to the Board of Regents;
that the welfare, health, and safety of student athletics are primary concerns
of athletics; and that every student athlete will receive equitable and fair
treatment.
The University is currently undergoing a major certification effort in
which its programs are being examined in a peer review process in cooperation with the NCAA. President Duderstadt announced that at the NCAA
annual meeting in January, a proposal will be on the ballot that would
restructure the NCAA from an association into a federation. That would
mean that the three principle divisions would become separate entities and
would develop their own internal structures to govern their behavior. He
pointed out that with its current structure, the NCAA doesn't well serve the
large institutions commonly associated with Division IA. The Division I
institutions would be governed by an executive board comprised of presidents, eight of whom would come from the eight major conferences. This
move is seen as the next logical step in the effort to align college sports with
the academic mission of the institutions; if this proposal is not successful, the
president suggested that the NCAA may cease to exist.
Chief Financial Officer's Report
Executive Vice President Womack deferred to Vice President Kinnear,
who said that in response to Regental request, there would be a presentation
on planned giving (trusts and bequests). He turned the floor over to Ms.
Kathy Okun, director of trusts and bequests in the Office of Development,
and Mr. Norman Herbert, University treasurer, who gave a presentation
about planned giving opportunities currently available at the University of
Michigan, as well as recent performance figures and portfolio values.
Following the presentation, Vice President Kinnear observed that some
of the vehicles mentioned in the presentation as issues to be considered for
the future will require Regental approval.
Presidential Search Activities
Provost Machen presented two proposed plans for scheduling public fora
for the Regents to receive input on the presidential search, in response to the
Regents' request to him, Secretary Palmer, and Vice President Harrison at
the October Regents' Meeting. Plan Two is identical to Plan One, except for
the inclusion of two additional fora to be held in western Michigan and


184




November Meeting, 1995


metropolitan Detroit. The proceedings would be recorded for the benefit of
any Regents who might not be able to attend all of the fora.
Regent McGowan noted that consistent with the Regents' invitation for
public input issued at the last meeting, Plan Two is preferable as it extends
the opportunity for accessibility to the widest array of the University's
constituency. Regent Newman concurred. It was decided that it would be
preferable to conclude all of the fora before the January 1996 Regents'
meeting, if possible.
Regent McGowan moved approval of proposed Public Forum Schedule
Plan Two, which calls for the scheduling of nine fora to be concluded by
January 1996. Regent Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Provost Machen proposed that written communication be solicited from
a range of constituencies in the form of a letter from the Board of Regents to
be published as an advertisement in a variety of publications. The letter
would serve the purpose of announcing the fora schedule and would provide
mailing and electronic mail addresses for the submission of public input. All
correspondence received will be copied and bound in notebooks and provided
to the Regents and will be considered public documents consistent with the
Freedom of Information Act.
Regent Power asked what the Regents wanted the public to write to
them about, noting that in previous discussions, three main topics had
emerged: 1) the needs of the University in the years to come; 2) what qualities should be sought in the next president; and 3) what kind of search
should be undertaken.
Provost Machen responded that several drafts in response to this
question have been proposed, each with various nuances. Regent Power
stated that it would be important to state the nature of the Regents'
concerns, rather than invite generalized comment. Provost Machen noted
that this document would be brought before the Regents for approval before
being placed in the public domain.
There followed a discussion of what publications would be used to advertise the public fora; the original suggestions had been the Michigan Daily,
the Michigan Review, the Black Student Monthly, the University Record, the
Michigan Alumnus, and Michigan Today. In response to a question from
Regent McFee about the advisability of advertising in more general public
newspapers, Regent Newman observed that most newspapers will publish
notices of public meetings free of charge. Provost Machen pointed out that
the short time frame for holding the student campus forum prior to the end
of classes might preclude some forms of advertising.
Finally, Provost Machen noted that the report requested by the Regents
about how presidential searches have been conducted at peer institutions, as


185




November Meeting, 1995


well as at the University of Michigan in the past, would be presented to the
Regents at the December meeting.
Report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs
(SACUA)
President Duderstadt introduced Professor George Brewer, chair of
SACUA, to present his report. Professor Brewer gave an overview of the
faculty governance system, noting that while it is advisory, it is wellorganized, comprehensive, and capable of giving the perspective of the
faculty on all areas of University activity.
Professor Brewer thanked President Duderstadt for his service and
leadership on behalf of the faculty. He noted that the quality of the faculty is
the most important determinant of the quality of the University, and that
the University of Michigan has a great faculty. The two keys to developing
maintaining a great university are to recruit excellent faculty and to provide
an environment in which they have an opportunity to excel.
He described the keys to an optimal academic environment for faculty as
an open intellectual climate, the time and resources to develop their scholarship, and an administration that accepts the faculty as partners in charting
the best course for the university. Overall, Professor Brewer asserted that
the environment at the University of Michigan is excellent for faculty.
Professor Brewer noted that perhaps the most important task facing the
new president will be to preserve and even to enhance that environment. Of
paramount concern is that the president come from an academic background,
grounded in scholarship, teaching, and research in order to appreciate and
preserve the University's greatness.  Regarding the presidential search,
Professor Brewer noted that while a closed search is against the law, a search
conducted entirely in the open would fail to turn up the kind of candidates
needed to preserve the University's greatness. He reported that the faculty
had suggested to the Regents a search process modeled after the recent
provost search. This would consist of a faculty advisory committee with
alumni and student representation to provide a list of candidates from which
the Regents could conduct the search in an open manner. He stated that the
general counsel's office had advised SACUA that this approach would comply
with the law, but could not guarantee against a suit. If the Regents do what
is legal and best for the University, he said that the faculty would be supportive.
Professor Brewer reported that "the faculty will accept nothing less than
doing what's best for the University."  He warned that the faculty "has
bitten before and can bite again.  If an unqualified president is rammed
down our throats and soon exhibits those lack of qualifications, the Senate
Assembly is fully capable of rendering a vote of no confidence." Professor
Brewer then observed that he had great respect for each of the Regents as
individuals, but that now it was important for them to function as a team.
This means that each individual must suppress some personal tendencies for


186




November Meeting, 1995


the overall good of the team. He had full confidence that the Regents would
do a good job in the challenge ahead because of their individual personal
strengths and the fact that they each valued the future of the University so
highly.
Proposed Code of Student Conduct
Vice President Hartford invited to the table the students who had been
involved in the drafting of the most current draft of the proposed Code of
Student Conduct. She noted that Dean Jeffrey Lehman of the Law School
would be joining the group and commenting at a later point.
Vice President Hartford noted that two members of the student work
group, Kim Wilson, a senior in LS&A, and Margaret Kinnear, a senior at
Emory University, could not be present. She introduced the other students
as Jack Bernard, a recent graduate of the Law School; Emi Nakazato, a
recent graduate of LS&A; Kenneth Sachs, a senior in LS&A; Christopher
Hodges, a junior in LS&A and the representative from the Civil Liberties
Board; Sean McCabe-Plius, a graduate student in a dual-degree M.S.W. and
Ph.D. program; and Larry LaTarte, a senior in LS&A.
Each student spoke to the Board about various aspects of how the
committee went about its work of drafting a new code. Mr. Bernard concentrated on how the charge to the group, which described the type of code that
was desired, had provided challenges and opportunities in drafting the new
code; Ms. Nakazato, Mr. Sachs, and Mr. Hodges described the methods the
group had used to receive input and feedback; Mr. McCabe-Plius described
the background research done by the group to become familiar with the
issues involved, and Mr. LaTarte reviewed some of the specific examples of
feedback the group had received.
Following the work group's presentations, Dean Jeffrey Lehman spoke
in more general terms about codes of conduct. He noted that every community has some type of code, along with sanctions for when its norms are
violated. He observed that there is a relationship among community codes of
conduct, as people belong to more than one community and must therefore
adhere to more than one code, whether written or not. He enumerated some
of the communities that exist at the University, as well as some of the codes
of conduct, implicit and explicit, that its members are subject to. He gave
examples of some of the conditions and codes of conduct as they apply at the
Law School.
Dean Lehman observed that it is important to have written procedures
that protect members of a community from arbitrary and capricious conduct
on the part of the institution, and it is also important to preserve common
law authority to deal with concerns that might not have been anticipated by
the drafters of a written code. He also believes that even though individual
units might have their own student conduct codes, it would be helpful for the
University as a whole to have a general code of student conduct.


187




November Meeting, 1995


Dean Lehman had reviewed the current code draft from his perspective
as dean of the Law School, and observed that the following aspects of it are
most important to him: 1) Vice President Hartford, her staff, and students
have worked diligently on the document and are happy with it, believing it to
be broad, inclusive, and responsive to the Regents' concerns; 2) the code does
not pre-empt or displace unit-based codes of conduct, such as the one that
governs the Law School; 3) and there will be ample opportunity to amend the
document as experience is gained with it.
Vice President Hartford and President Duderstadt expressed their gratitude to the work group and to Dean Lehman. Mr. Flint Wainess, president
of Michigan Student Assembly (MSA) joined the group to respond to
questions. In response to a question from Regent Newman, Mr. Wainess
stated that he did not have any prepared remarks about the proposed code.
In response to Regent Power's question about his role as MSA president and
MSA's role institutionally in the drafting of the code, Mr. Wainess stated
that the MSA did not have any institutional role in the drafting of the
document with the work group. However, through his membership on the
Student Relations Committee of SACUA, he became involved in the process
after the work group had submitted its recommendations to Vice President
Hartford. Through that involvement, a number of changes were made.
Mr. McCabe-Plius observed that the work group felt it was important to
provide opportunities for input; however, some groups chose not to participate.
Mr. Wainess reported that MSA had voted to encourage the Regents not
to impose any code that exceeds federal and state mandates. MSA also had
expressed support for some changes that had been made from the old Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities to the new Code of Student
Conduct and suggested some additional changes.
Regent Power noted that the Regents had received a letter from SACUA
about the code; Vice President Hartford pointed out that she had not been
invited to discuss the document with SACUA.
Regent Deitch asked the students why they believe a code is needed at
this time, and why the adoption of the code would improve student life.
Mr. Bernard responded that their mandate had been to develop a code,
not whether or not there should be a code. Therefore, the group had not
addressed the issue of whether or not a code was necessary.
Regent McGowan agreed with this assessment.      Regent Deitch
concurred, but said he was interested in the students' views about the code.
Noting that he believes that questions that deal with issues unique to this
community are appropriate for codification, he asked Dean Lehman for his
view on aspects of the code that deal with behaviors that are otherwise
covered by the law.


188




November Meeting, 1995


Dean Lehman responded that the law might impose one set of sanctions
that are appropriate to the interests of the state of Michigan, and the
University might decide as a community that some behaviors mean
something different to its community than they do to the state. The University might decide that its norms and values call for a set of rules and potential sanctions that are special to it and that these are what makes it different
from the state. For example, whether or not the state chooses to punish a
student who falsifies information on an application, the University has a
powerful interest in punishing such a student.
Regent McFee noted that in her opinion, including some actions in the
code that are also considered crimes by the state provides an opportunity to
address some issues in a less severe and more educational manner than
taking someone to court.
Regent Baker wondered whether a student who was found innocent in a
court of a law for a crime but then punished by the University for the same
action would be subject to double jeopardy. Dean Lehman responded that
when people are members of multiple communities, they are subject to the
codes of each community. For instance, if someone commits a crime punishable by both state and federal law, he/she could be acquitted under state law
and convicted under federal law. He also pointed out that standards might
be different for the different communities.
Building upon Regent Deitch's previous question to the work group as
to whether they felt a code was necessary and how they believed it would
improve the lives of students, Regent Baker asked the work group members
if there was anyone in the group who did not favor the idea of a code.
Mr. Hodges responded that he initially had believed the whole notion of
a code was unnecessary. However, as he had learned more about codes and
worked on the draft, his opinion had changed, and he now stands behind the
draft created by the group. He had come to the realization that there are
many issues that the University is better equipped to handle than are the
courts, and that it is in a position to protect students, rather than harm
them. In general, he believes this is a good code.
Regent Baker said that he believes the students who developed the code
should be willing to state whether they endorse it or not.
President Duderstadt recalled that the Regents had specifically stated
that there would be a code, and the only issue was whether it would be
written by the Regents or students. Vice President Hartford pointed out
that both the Dearborn and Flint campuses already had codes in place; the
document under consideration would apply only to the Ann Arbor campus.
Regent Power also supported Regent McGowan's and the president's
point that the Regents had stated very clearly that there would be a code.
Regent Deitch stated that he had no problem with the notion of a code as it
relates to academic issues, as well as the requirements of federal law that


189




November Meeting, 1995


there be a code in place. However, he was wrestling with the notion of
whether this code would make student life better at Michigan, and he was
interested in the views of the students who drafted it.
Mr. Hodges responded that he believed that the code would make life
better for students because 1) it serves as a grievance procedure to protect
students from other students; 2) the jurisdiction is much better defined than
in the previous version, which is helpful to students; 3) the University makes
an effort to work with students, providing various options in the area of
sanctions and in using mediation as the primary means of resolving conflicts.
This will make it function more like a grievance procedure than a more
punitive system.
Mr. Bernard also pointed out that this code goes beyond the requirements of the law in providing due process, giving the students more opportunities to think about the issues and to learn from the process. It thereby
gives students more protections than they would have under the previous
code or if there were no code.
Another student pointed out that this code gives an opportunity to
students to define their own community and their own values. It is positive
for students because it provides clearly defined expectations of the values of
the community.
Vice President Hartford referred to a document first issued by the
American Association of University Professors, the U.S. Students Association, the National Association of Student Affairs, and the AAU, in 1967: "A
Joint Statement on the Rights and Responsibilities of Students."  This
document clearly stated that universities should have standards of conduct,
noting that in communities of teaching and learning there are some behaviors that might also be violations of law but that also get in the way of both
teaching and learning. It is those kinds of behaviors that we should seek to
stop, although perhaps in a different fashion than courts of law.
Regent Power stated that he was impressed by this version of the code,
because it reflects the input of students and seeks to bring forward the
values which they wish to codify to deal with their lives as members of an
academic community. In response to his question of how many contacts had
been received in the form of feedback from students, a committee member
responded that about 500 contacts had been received from students, of the
total of 1,000 contacts.
Presidential Search Process
Regent McGowan noted that Professor Brewer had asserted that the
general counsel's office had taken a position on a model he had proffered as a
process for the presidential search. She requested that General Counsel Cole
respond to those comments.
Ms. Cole reported that the general counsel's office "has not endorsed
any particular approach regarding how to conduct the presidential search,


190




November Meeting, 1995


nor has it examined in depth and subsequently issued any opinion regarding
any particular procedure to use in doing that search."
Regent McGowan commented that while the Regents are genuinely
seeking input from the community on how to design a search procedure that
will best serve the University, there are certain legal limitations that
preclude the ability to start with a totally blank slate.
Regent Newman made the following response to Professor Brewer's
comments:
"I think we all collectively believe that SACUA's comments are
very important to the search process, as we believe all faculty input is
very important However, we are troubled with the tone in which a
portion of your comments were delivered.    Especially in a
community- wide search process, threats are unnecessary and out of
place.  This Board takes its responsibility very seriously and
appreciates constructive comments which can and will add to the
search process."
The meeting then recessed and reconvened at 4:10 p.m. in the Anderson
Room of the Michigan Union to hear Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following people, on the topics
indicated: Brandon Riordan, student and board member of the Student
Buyer's Association (SBA), on SBA's office space in the Michigan Union; and
Anne Marie Ellison, student, Devorah Adler, student, Mary H. Rave, president of the Washtenaw County branch of the ACLU, Eugene Feingold, ACLU
board member, and Sallie R. Churchill, ACLU board member on the topic of
the Code of Student Conduct.
Friday, November 17, 1995
The Regents met at 9:00 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner.       Secretary Palmer, Provost
Machen, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents Harrison,
Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick were also
present.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called the
Regents' attention to a report describing the progress of the first year of the
Michigan Agenda for Women.
Presidential Search Committee
The president called on Regent Newman, who read the following
resolution:


191




November Meeting, 1995


Resolved, that pursuant to the provisions in Section 1.07 of
the Bylaws of the Board of Regents, a committee of the whole to be
known as the Presidential Search Committee consisting of Regents
Deane Baker, Laurence B. Deitch, Daniel D. Horning, Shirley M.
McFee, Rebecca McGowan, Andrea Fischer Newman, Philip H. Power,
and Nellie M  Varner, or the successor in ofice of each such person,
be and is hereby established.
The Committee shall consider all matters in connection with
selecting a president and shall have the power and authority to take
such steps and perform such acts as may be necessary and proper to
carry out its assignment.
The Committee shall elect such chairpersons as may be
appropriate.
Regent Horning seconded the motion. Regent McFee commented that
the committee will meet in public in the same manner as is done for its
regular business meetings. The purpose of the committee is to set forth the
framework of the search and to determine how to proceed. The establishment of this committee does not preclude establishing other advisory
committees; its purpose is provide a framework within which to operate to
make such decisions.
Regent Baker reiterated that the Regents intend to bring into the
process the various elements of the University committee.
The vote was then taken and the resolution was approved unanimously.
Regent McGowan nominated Regent Nellie Varner as co-chair of the
Presidential Selection Committee. Regent Deitch seconded the nomination,
noting that "the University of Michigan has no more distinguished daughter
than Nellie Varner." The nomination was approved unanimously.
Regent Horning nominated Regent Shirley McFee as co-chair of the
Presidential Selection Committee. Regent Newman seconded the nomination, noting Regent McFee's long history of service to her community and
the University. The motion was approved unanimously.
Regents Varner and McFee both expressed their appreciation for the
confidence shown by the other Regents in selecting them as co-chairs of the
committee.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted the minutes of the October 10,
1995 special meeting and the October 19-20 regular meeting for approval.
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports on
investments, plant extension, litigation, and personnel-labor relations. With
regard to the endowment and long term portfolio funds, he observed that


192




November Meeting, 1995


with the market at historically high levels, a correction should be expected to
occur at some point.
Vice   President Neal submitted          reports on     projects established       and
summaries of a selection of current research and sponsored projects for the
month of October 1995.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear submitted the report of
voluntary support for October 1995. He noted that with 75 percent of the
time having passed, the Campaign for Michigan is at 92 percent of its goal.

Retirement Memoirs.        Secretary Palmer submitted two retirement
memoirs.
F. Robert Fekety, Jr., M.D., professor of internal medicine in the
Medical School and professor of epidemiology in the School of Public Health,
retired from active faculty status on October 31, 1995, after a most productive career as a teacher, clinician, and researcher.
A  native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Dr. Fekety received his A.B.
degree from   Wesleyan University in 1951 and his M.D. degree from        Yale
University in 1955. Following an internship in medicine at Yale Medical
Center (1955-56), he served with the Epidemiology Intelligence Service of the
U.S. Public Health Service at the University of Pennsylvania and The Johns
Hopkins University from 1956-58. In 1958, he returned to Yale Medical
Center for a two-year residency, after which he served on the faculty of The
Johns Hopkins University Medical School as an instructor (1960-62) and
assistant professor (1962-67).


204




November Meeting, 1995


Dr. Fekety came to the University of Michigan in 1967 as associate
professor of internal medicine and chief of the division of infectious diseases
in the Department of Internal Medicine. He was promoted to professor of
internal medicine in 1971 and received the additional appointment of professor of epidemiology in the School of Public Health in 1987, while maintaining
the position of chief of infectious diseases until his retirement. Dr. Fekety
established the University's infectious disease training program and has
trained more than 50 fellows who have gone on to positions of prominence
throughout the United States. He is best known for his pioneering work in
the identification and treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis caused by
clostridium difficile, as well as his previous work on the epidemiology of the
staphylococcus.
Dr. Fekety is a superb clinician whose expertise was widely sought. He
is also well regarded as a teacher because of his clarity of thought, ability to
synthesize complex concepts and present them in a clear, concise manner,
and his wonderful sense of humor.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physician for his dedicated
service by naming F. Robert Fekety, Jr., professor emeritus of internal
medicine and professor emeritus of epidemiology.
Frank Whitehouse, Jr., M.D., associate professor of microbiology,
retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1995, after a productive
career as a teacher and counselor in the preprofessional medical arena.
A native of the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area, Dr. Whitehouse received his
B.A. and M.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1949 and 1953,
respectively. He completed an internship at Blodgett Memorial Hospital in
Grand Rapids before accepting a position as an instructor at the University
of Michigan in 1954. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1961 and
associate professor in 1967.
During his tenure at the University, Dr. Whitehouse's interests and
contributions included research on immunoglobulin Fc fragments in burn
patients and the teaching of a variety of students, including medical, undergraduate, honors, and allied health students. He was instrumental in organizing the preprofessional counseling activities at Michigan and in forming the
National Association of Advisors for the Health Professions. In recent years,
Dr. Whitehouse's research focus has been in the area of test-taking
strategies.
The Regents now salute this dedicated educator and counselor for his
contributions by naming Frank Whitehouse, Jr., associate professor emeritus
of microbiology.
Memorials. One faculty death was reported to the Regents this month.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death on October 6, 1995, of Andrea Foote, distinguished
research scientist, director of the Worker Health Program, Institute of Labor
and Industrial Relations, and adjunct professor in the School of Social Work.
Andrea Foote was born in Roosevelt, Utah, on March 23, 1941. She
received her B.A. degree in German from the University of Utah in 1963 and


205




November Meeting, 1995


two degrees in sociology from the University of Michigan-a master's in 1969
and a doctorate in 1973. She joined the University of Michigan Institute of
Labor and Industrial Relations as an assistant research scientist in 1973.
Along with her research partner and husband, the late John Erfurt, she
founded the Worker Health Program that same year. She was named distinguished research scientist in 1994.
A leading expert in the area of health promotion and wellness in the
work place, Dr. Foote was best known for designing and testing health care
delivery systems in industrial settings, with a special emphasis on chronic
disease control (hypertension, alcoholism, substance abuse, and mental and
emotional disorders). She and John Erfurt developed health screening
programs for many major corporations, including Ford Motor Company,
General Motors Corporation, Detroit Edison, and the United Auto Workers
union. She helped guide the U-M's efforts in confronting the problem of
student and employee substance abuse.
Dr. Foote published nearly 50 articles, chapters, and monographs on
topics ranging from controlling high blood pressure to cost-containment of
health screening in the work place. Two books published by her team of
researchers on employee assistance programs were among the first to
address the topic and fast became standard texts in the field. Her more than
20 years of research in the area of hypertension control culminated this fall
in the publication of the manual for the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services' work-site cardiovascular programs.
All of Dr. Foote's staff and colleagues will miss her calm leadership, her
often understated but always keen intelligence, and her unflagging dedication to perfection as she carried out her research. As we mourn the loss of
this distinguished researcher and scholar, our condolences go to her mother
Norma, her son, Brett Miner, her brother, G. Brant Foote, and her sisters,
Brandwyn Foote, Ariel Barfield, and Adrien Taylor, and their families.
Degrees. The Regents took the following actions with respect to degrees:
They approved final degree lists for the May and September, 1995, Law School
commencements and the August 1995 commencements of the various schools,
colleges, divisions, and branch campuses; they approved the December 1995
Doctoral Degree List; and they approved changes to previously approved
degree lists. Copies of all of the degree lists are on file in the Office of the
Secretary of the University.
Honorary Degrees. The president submitted recommendations for
honorary degrees to be awarded to Neil Shine, publisher of the Detroit Free
Press, and Hayden White, historian.
Consent Agenda Approved.       On a motion by Regent Newman,
seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents unanimously approved the consent
agenda.

Capital Outlay Request, 1997-98, All Campuses
President Duderstadt observed that the state did not have a capital
outlay budget for the last fiscal year; it is hoped that there would be one for
the coming year. He submitted a list of new project requests and for the Ann
Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint campuses.
President Duderstadt noted that the University has nearly completed
the rebuilding of the University's campuses. The requested funds for the
central campus are for projects that represent critical needs to complete the
renovation of that campus. Regent Horning moved approval of the 1997-98
Capital Outlay Request for all three campuses. Regent Newman seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Code of Student Conduct
Regent McFee moved approval of the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
Code of Student Conduct; Regent Power seconded the motion.
Vice President Hartford thanked the student work group who had
worked for seven months to produce the proposed code; she also thanked
MSA officers Flint Wainess, Sam Goodstein, and Ann Marie Ellison for their


208




November Meeting, 1995


review and suggestions, as well as staff in the Office of the General Counsel.
She pointed out two changes in the final draft that had been made at the
behest of Board members. She noted that although all of the University's
peer institutions, as well as other state institutions, already have conduct
codes, this code is a unique University of Michigan document.
President Duderstadt pointed out that the code currently in place is the
Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities (SSRR), and that there is
general agreement that the code now under consideration is a better
document. Should the proposed code not be approved, the SSRR would
remain in place, as the University does not have the option of having no
code.
Regent Varner observed that while this code may not be perfect,
students had played a significant role in its development, and she supported
its approval.
Regent McFee expressed her support for this code, noting that the
Regents had mandated that there would be a code. She pointed out that part
of what students learn when they go to college is how to govern themselves.
She commended the student work group for this document, which represents
their best effort in developing a plan for self-government and self-discipline.
Regent Newman reviewed the specific concerns that had been raised by
the Michigan Student Assembly about the current draft of the code, and Vice
President Hartford responded to each of the concerns. Regarding the
overlap between Bylaw Section 2.01 and the Codes' emergency suspension
procedure, President Duderstadt and Vice President Hartford responded that
the procedure outlined in the code is in fact the way this situation is handled
currently under Bylaw Section 2.01.
Regarding MSA's opinion that hearings should be opened upon the
request of the accused, Vice President Hartford stated that the students in
the workgroup believed that each student involved in a dispute had an equal
right to request a closed hearing, and that this was especially true in cases
involving sexual assault or harassment.
Regarding the power of the resolution coordinator, Vice President
Hartford reviewed the systems in place that provide a check on the power of
that position. She also responded to students' concerns about ambiguity of
the definitions in the violations section of the document. Regent Newman
suggested that if the code is adopted, there ought to be a review and perhaps
clarification of definitions in the violations section.
Regent Newman emphasized that she does not believe this document
encompasses any speech codes, and that she had asked that a word be
removed to ensure that it would not be considered a speech code. Vice President Hartford responded that this is not a speech code, and that the student
work group sought to express that notion within the document.


209




November Meeting, 1995


Regent Deitch observed that he had always had reservations about a
code, as he believes that academic integrity should be the University's chief
interest in regulating academic life. He also believes that while the University has a moral duty to address issues of alcoholism and sexual harassment,
beyond that, his personal belief is that an honor code is all that is necessary,
with the caveat that students should obey the law. However, he would be
voting for the code for four reasons: 1) it was student generated in response
to a Regental mandate; 2) this code "treads lightly" because of its emphasis
on mediation; 3) as Dean Lehman had observed, communities can set their
own codes of conduct for their own reasons, even when that creates redundancies; and 4) he respects Vice President Hartford and her work with
students, as well as his colleagues.
Regent Baker reviewed the history of codes at the University and
elsewhere, noting that a speech code had been put in place in the 1980s that
was eventually found to be unconstitutional by a U.S. District Court, and
that other codes have also been found to be unconstitutional. Throughout
the process of instituting codes, there has been tremendous opposition from
students and from some Regents, including him. He believes that if there is
to be any code, it should be a minimalist code. Regent Baker believes that
the arguments presented by the ACLU are convincing, that existing rules
and regulations and that the areas covered in the Code of Student Conduct
govern a very narrow area of student life. He noted that many people on
campus object to the code, and he would liked to have heard from some of
them during this process.
Regent Baker offered an amendment to the motion on the floor that the
code would end in three years unless reviewed and re-approved by the
Regents. Regent Newman seconded the motion.
At Regent Horning's request, President Duderstadt reported that the
University had been cited by the North Central accreditation agency for its
lack of a student disciplinary policy. He stated that the amendment to have
the code disappear at a time certain would be in violation of the law and
would jeopardize the University's accreditation. Regent Varner pointed out
that the code could always be amended if there were problems.
Regent Newman said that the portions required by state and federal law
could remain in place, but that a sunset provision forces the issue to be
reconsidered. President Duderstadt reiterated that creating a sunset provision in which the default would be the elimination of a student disciplinary
policy would be an unwise decision.
Regent Deitch pointed out that to his credit, Regent Baker had voted
against the speech code that had subsequently been found to be unconstitutional. He suggested that Regent Baker's motion be amended to call for a
report and review in three years, with the code remaining in effect. This
would require a reconsideration of the policy after a reasonable period of
time. Regent Baker accepted that amendment.


210




November Meeting, 1995


Regent McFee requested that records be kept as to the type of activities
being governed by this code, including the venues where violations and
complaints arise (e.g., residence halls, classrooms, etc.).
Regent Baker stated that he is concerned that this code of conduct
would control speech.
The vote was then taken on Regent Baker's amendment to the original
motion, as amended, that would require a review and discussion of the code
by the Board of Regents after three years. The motion was approved
unanimously.
Regent Power commented that having been a member of the Board at
the time of Regent Baker's dissent from the original speech code, he believes
this current code has remedied many of the defects of the earlier documents.
He delineated what to him are the four most useful features of this code: 1)
it is written down; 2) it was developed in a consultative way, rather than
being imposed by another body, and reflects this generation of students and
their values; 3) it stresses the norms of an academic community, into which
students enter voluntarily; and 4) it is not punitive, but rather stresses
values and education via the device of mediation. It is a great improvement
over both the earlier version and the former statement that had later been
found to be unconstitutional.
Regent Baker stated that he would be willing to accept a code that could
be put on one page in twelve-point type.
The vote was then taken on the original motion to approve the Code of
Student Conduct for the Ann Arbor campus, and it was approved on a vote of
seven to one, with Regent Baker opposed.
The text of the Code of Student Conduct for the Ann Arbor campus can
be found in the Appendix, page 213.
Recommendations for Appointment to Medical Staff Membership
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent McFee, and on the
recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board,
the Regents unanimously approved several appointments to medical staff
membership.
Report on Research Expenditures for FY 1995
Vice President Neal suggested that the annual research report be given
in two parts. The metrics section would be given now; the other part, which
would describe actual research projects and their impact on students and
technology transfer activities, would be given in February. Regent McFee
expressed support for this approach.
Vice President Neal then proceeded with a report on research expenditures for FY 1995. Total FY1995 expenditures amounted $409.2 million, a
6.0 percent increase over FY1994. Federal research expenditures increased


211




November Meeting, 1995


by 4.0 percent and the number of awards increased by 3.8 percent; the dollar
value of federal awards, $401.9 million, represented a 10.3 percent increase
over FY1994.
Vice President Neal displayed charts and graphs showing research
expenditures by sponsor groups and federally sponsored research expenditures by agency. He reviewed projections of funding levels of the various
federal agencies through 2002, noting that several agencies are facing significant decreases in funding and some are targeted for possible elimination.
Vice President Neal described some of the steps being taken both within the
University of Michigan and in cooperation with sister institutions to prepare
for the future funding situation.
Vice President Neal informed the Regents about some of the changes in
the University's intellectual properties policy that he is preparing to propose
to the Board at an upcoming meeting, perhaps in February 1996.
Regent McFee noted the importance of the faculty's continuing to
submit award proposals of high caliber and of benefit to society so that they
continue to have a high potential of being granted.
President Duderstadt reported that Vice President Hartford had
recently been elected chair of the National Council of Vice Presidents of
Student Affairs.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 10:45
a.m. The next meeting will be held on December 14 and 15, 1995. Regents'
expenses reported for the month of October 1995 totaled $280.22.

November Meeting, 1995


APPENDIX
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN-ANN ARBOR
CODE OF STUDENT CONDUCT
INTRODUCTION
The University of Michigan-Ann Arbor ("the University") is dedicated to maintaining
a scholarly community. As its central purpose, this community promotes intellectual inquiry
through vigorous discourse. Essential values which under gird this purpose include civility,
dignity, diversity, education, equality, freedom, honesty, and safety.
When students choose to accept admission to the University, they accept the rights and
responsibilities of membership in the University's academic and social community. As
members of the University community, students are expected to uphold its values by
maintaining a high standard of conduct. Because the University establishes high standards
for membership, its standards of conduct, while falling within the limits of the law, may
exceed federal, state, or local requirements.
Within the University, entities (such as schools and colleges campus, professional, and
student organizations) have developed policies that outline standards of conduct governing
their constituents and that sometimes provide procedures for sanctioning violations of those
standards. This Code of Student Conduct ("the Code") does not replace those standards; nor
does it constrain the procedures or sanctions provided by those policies. This Code describes
possible behaviors which are inconsistent with the essential values of the University community; it outlines procedures to respond to such behaviors; and it suggests possible sanctions
which are intended to educate and to safeguard members of the University community.
STUDENT RIGHTS
Students at the University have the same rights and protections under the Constitutions of the United States and the state of Michigan as other citizens. These rights include
freedom of expression, press, religion, and assembly. The University has a long tradition of
student activism and values freedom of expression, which includes voicing unpopular views
and dissent. As members of the University community, students have the right to express
their own views, but must also take responsibility for according the same right to others.
Students have the right to be treated fairly and with dignity regardless of age, color,
creed, disability, marital status, national origin or ancestry, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status. The University has a long-standing tradition of commitment to
pluralistic education. Accordingly, the University, through this Code, will not discriminate
on the basis of group status.
Students have the right to be protected from capricious decision-making by the University and to have access to University policies which affect them. The University has an
enduring commitment to provide students with a balanced and fair system of dispute resolution. Accordingly, this Code will not deprive students of the appropriate due process protections to which they are entitled. This Code is one of the University's administrative procedures and should not be equated with procedures used in civil or criminal court.
VIOLATIONS
Behaviors which contradict the essential values of the University community are:
A. Physically harming another person including acts such as killing, assaulting, or battering
B. Sexually assaulting or sexually harassing another person


213




November Meeting, 1995 - Appendix


C. Hazing, stalking, or harassing another person
D. Possessing, using, or storing firearms, explosives, or weapons on
University-controlled property or at University events or programs (unless
approved by the Department of Public Safety; such approval will be given only in
extraordinary circumstances)
E. Tampering with fire or other safety equipment or setting unauthorized
fires
F. Illegally possessing, using, distributing, manufacturing, or selling
alcohol or other drugs
G. Intentionally and falsely reporting bombs, fires, or other emergencies
to a University official
H. Stealing, vandalizing, damaging, destroying, or defacing University
property or the property of others
I.  Obstructing or disrupting classes, research projects, or other activities
or programs of the University; or obstructing access to University facilities,
property, or programs (except for behavior that is protected by the University's
policy on Freedom of Speech and Artistic Expression)
J.  Making, possessing, or using any falsified University document or
record; altering any University document or record, including identification cards
and meal cards
K. Failing to leave University-controlled premises when told to do so by a
police or security officer with reasonable cause
L. Violating state or federal law if such action has serious impact on the
University community
M. Misusing, failing to comply with, or jeopardizing Code procedures,
sanctions, or mediated agreements, or interfering with participants involved in
the resolution process
N. Violating University computer policies
SCOPE OF THE VIOLATIONS
Behavior which occurs in the city of Ann Arbor, on University-controlled roperty, or
at University sponsored events/programs may violate the Code. Behavior which occurs
outside the city of Ann Arbor or outside University-controlled property may violate the Code
only if the behavior poses an obvious and serious threat or harm to any member(s) of the
University community.
The Code of Student Conduct is intended to incorporate other specific University
policies by reference. These policies are:  the University Housing's Community Living at
Michigan Handbook, the Information Technology Division's Condition of Use Statement,
and the Computer Aided Engineering Network's Conditions of Use Policy. The Code will be
used to address violations of these policies only if the violation warrants a process or a
sanction beyond what is available in these policies. In such cases, policy adjudicators may
take intermediate action regarding a complaint as defined by their individual policy;
however, final resolution will occur under the procedures outlined in this Code.
PROCEDURES
The University will use the following procedures to respond to behavior which goes
against the essential values of the University community. The University considers the
procedures for resolving disputes a part of its educational mission and is committed to a
process which provides both peer review and mediation. Persons who have questions about
the Code should contact the resolution coordinator who provides support to all participants.


214




November Meeting, 1995 - Appendix


Resolution and appeal processes are administrative functions and are not subject to the same
rules of civil or criminal proceedings. Because some violations of these standards are also
violations of law, students may be accountable to both the legal system and the University.
Stage 1: Initiating the Resolution Process. Any student, faculty member, or staff
member may submit a complaint alleging a violation of the Code. A student, faculty
member, or staff member may also submit a complaint based upon information reported to
that person. All complaints must be submitted to the resolution coordinator ( RC"), in
writing, within six months after the incident(s) alleged in the complaint. The RC may waive
the six-month limitation when a late submission is reasonable. If the RC determines, based
on an investigation, that the alleged behavior may be a violation of the Code, the RC will
notify the accused student and schedule a meeting as described below.
Stage 2: The Resolution Process. The RC will meet with the accused student to
explain the complaint and the resolution process. The student will have the opportunity to
ask questions and make a statement. The student may be accompanied by an advisor. In all
incidents, except those involving violence, if both parties agree to resolve the complaint
through mediation, the RC will make arrangements for the mediation to occur. The nature
of some complaints, especially those involving violence, may make mediation an unrealistic
option. When violence is involved, the RC must concur in the decision to use mediation.
Parties will be offered the choice of using a University or a non-University mediator.
Mediation is a voluntary process which may or may not result in a mediated agreement.
When a mediated agreement is reached, the case is resolved and parties are encouraged to
use the RC as a resource for future questions. Mediated agreements may not be appealed.
If the parties involved in the dispute do not choose mediation, if the mediator reports a
failed mediation, or if the nature of the complaint makes mediation unrealistic, the dispute
will be resolved through arbitration. The accused student may choose to have a resolution
officer or a student resolution panel arbitrate the dispute. In cases which involve more than
one accused student the RC will choose the form of arbitration if the students cannot agree.
Each party involved in arbitration has the right to be assisted but not represented by an
advisor of her or his choice. At an arbitration, the RC will be in charge of preparing and
submitting information gathered during the investigation. Both parties may have access to
this information prior to the arbitration. To ensure the privacy of the parties and to
maximize the educational potential of the process, both parties must agree to the admission
of any other people (except witnesses or advisors) to the arbitration.
All arbitrated resolutions will result in a recommendation(s) to the dean of students,
who may accept or modify the recommendation(s). The dean may not modify a sanction to
include suspension or expulsion. However, when expulsion is recommended, the dean may
instead suspend the student.
Stage 3: Appealing the Resolution Process. An appeals process is an essential
safeguard for an imperfect human process that attempts very hard to be fair. The appeal
process is available to each party. Appeals may be filed for the following reasons: proper
procedures were not followed, the evidence clearly does not support the finding(s), sanctions
are insufficient or excessive relative to the violation, or there is new evidence not reasonably
available at the time of the arbitration. All appeals must be submitted in writing to the RC
within 10 academic calendar days of the arbitration outcome. The vice president for student
affairs ("the VPSA") may waive the 10 day limitation when a late submission is reasonable.
The appeal will be reviewed by an Appeals Board composed of one student appointed b the
Michigan Student Assembly, one faculty member appointed by the Faculty Senate, an one
administrator appointed by the president. MSA, the Faculty Senate, and the president will
each appoint one alternate member to the Appeals Board. The Appeals Board will recommend one of the following actions to the VPSA: confirming the decision made through the
arbitration process, altering the sanction(s), or recommending a re-arbitration. The VPSA
ma accept or modify the recommendation(s). The VPSA may not modify a sanction to
include suspension or expulsion. However, when expulsion is recommended, the VPSA may
instead suspend the student.
SANCTIONS
In keeping with this policy's stated essential values, sanctions are designed to promote
the University's educational mission. Sanctions may also serve to promote safety or to deter
students from behavior which harms, harasses, or threatens people or property. Some
behavior is so harmful to the University community or so deleterious to the educational


215




November Meeting, 1995 - Appendix


process that it may require more serious sanctions: removal from housing, removal from
specific courses or activities, suspension from the University, or expulsion. More than one
sanction may be recommended. Possible sanctions are:
A. Fo    al ep      nd.   frmal Reprimand  A formal notice that the Code has been violated
and that future violations will be dealt with more severely.
B. Disciplinary Probation. A designated period of time during which
the student is not in good standing with the University. The terms of probation
may involve restrictions of student privileges and/or set specific behavioral
expectations.
C. Restitution. Compensation for loss, damage, or injury to the appropriate party in the form of service, money, or material replacement.
D. Restriction from Employment at the University     Prohibition or
limitation on University employment.
E. Class/Workshop Attendance. Enrollment and completion of a class
or workshop that could help the student understand why her or his behavior was
inappropriate.
F. Educational Project. Completion of a project specifically designed to
help the student understand why her or his behavior was inappropriate.
G. Service. Performance of one or more tasks designed to benefit the
community and help the student understand why her or his behavior was
inappropriate.
H. University Housing Transfer or Removal. Placement in another
room or housing unit or removal from University housing.
I.  Removal from    Specific Courses or Activities. Suspension or
transfer from courses or activities at the University for a specified period of time.
J.  No Contact.    Restriction from entering specific University areas
and/or all forms of contact with certain person(s).
K. Suspension. Separation from the University for a specified period of
time or until certain conditions are met.
L. Expulsion. Permanent separation from the University.
RELATED PROCEDURES
A. Emergency Suspension. If a student's actions pose an immediate
danger to any member of the University community, the VPSA or a designee may
immediately suspend the student pending a meeting. Except in extraordinary
circumstances that meeting shall be scheduled within two academic calendar
days. At this meeting, the student will be given the opportunity to make a statement and present evidence. If the emergency suspension is continued, the
student will be offered an arbitration option within ten academic calendar days.
B. Procedural and Interpretive Questions. All procedural and interpretive questions concerning the Code will be resolved by the VPSA or designee.
At any time, the VPSA or the RC may consult the Office of the General Counsel
about a case or procedures.
C. Selection of Mediators. Student Panelists, and Resolution
Officers. University mediators will be selected by the VPSA. A list of trained
non-University mediation services will be maintained by the Office of the Vice
President for Student Affairs. The VPSA will try to identify non-University
mediators who will serve parties at no charge or on a sliding fee scale. A neutral


216




November Meeting, 1995 - Appendix


mediator will be assigned to each mediation. Each winter term 60 students will
be appointed to serve as panelists for the following academic year. The student
government of each school and college, in consultation with its dean or designee,
will appoint a number of students proportionate to its college's share of the total
University enrollment. Graduate students will be appointed through their home
school or college. It is expected that each student government will appoint a
diverse pool of students to serve as panelists. Resolution officers are recommended by the Faculty Senate and/or the VPSA. Each student resolution panel
will consist of five voting student panelists and a nonvoting resolution officer who
will oversee the proceedings.
D. Records of Resolution Actions. Records will be maintained by the
RC with regard to any and all actions taken under the Code. Accordingly, records
will be maintained by the RC of complaints, mediations, arbitrations, findings,
and sanctions. Confidentiality of records will be maintained to the extent permitted by law and the University of Michigan Student Rights and Student Records
Policy. If a student is suspended or expelled, a notation will be made on the
student's academic record. The notation of suspension will be removed at the
time the student is readmitted to the University.
E. Student Access to Records. Records and documents that will be
considered during an arbitration will be made available in advance to all parties
but may be redacted to protect the privacy rights of individuals not directly
involved in the resolution process.
F. Reports of Actions. Statistical reports of actions taken through the
Code will be published following each academic term. These data will cover the
number of complaints and the types of violations, resolutions, and sanctions.
Periodic, regular review of Code arbitrations will be made available, in confidence, to the Student Rights Commission chair of MSA. Personally identifiable
information will be removed from all records prior to any review.
G. Concurrent Legal and Code Proceedings. If an accused student is
undergoing civil or criminal action for the same behavior which forms the basis of
a complaint under this Code, the accused student may choose to delay a Code
resolution until the external proceedings come to fruition. By choosing to delay
the Code process, the accused student accepts suspension from the University and
may not enter University property without authorization from the RC.
H. Advisor Corps. MSA, with approval of the General Counsel, has the
option to develop a student peer advisor corps. These advisors will be available to
any student party involved in arbitration. All potential peer advisors in the
Advisor Corps must successfully complete training provided by the office of the
RC.
I.  Amending the Code of Student Conduct. This Code of Student
Conduct may only be amended by a majority vote of the Regents of the University
of Michigan. MSA, the Senate Assembly, or the University administration may
propose amendments to the Code.

University of Michigan, had been awarded a Marshall Scholarship. She gave


219




December Meeting, 1995


some background on the scholarship and on Mr. Novick and introduced Mr.
Novick to those in attendance. There followed a round of applause.
Retirement of Dean Ara Paul. Provost Machen announced that Ara
Paul, dean of the College of Pharmacy, would be stepping down from the
deanship on December 31, 1995, and returning to faculty status. Because of
his long and distinguished career as dean, he requested that the Board
consider naming Dean Paul to dean emeritus status.
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent McFee, the
Regents unanimously adopted the following retirement memoir for Dean
Paul and also recognized him with a round of applause.
Ara G. Paul, dean of the College of Pharmacy and professor of pharmacognosy, will retire from his deanship position on December 31, 1995, after a
remarkable, twenty-year tenure.
Dean Paul received his B.S. degree from Idaho State University in 1950
and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Connecticut in 1953
and 1956, respectively. Prior to joining the University of Michigan faculty,
Dean Paul was a consultant in plant physiology at the Argonne National
Laboratory and an assistant professor of pharmacognosy at Butler University. He was appointed assistant professor of pharmacognosy at the University of Michigan in 1957 and was promoted to associate professor in 1963 and
professor in 1969. He also held visiting faculty appointments at the University of California at Berkeley and Tokyo University.
Under Dean Paul's leadership, the College of Pharmacy rose to its
present status as a premier center of pharmaceutical education, practice, and
research. One of his earliest efforts was the orchestration of a move to establishment of the doctor of pharmacy degree as the entry-level degree, which
other colleges of pharmacy have since adopted. He worked tirelessly to help
build close working relationships with the Department of Pharmacy Services
at the UM Hospitals, thus improving the college's influence in the delivery of
clinical services and clinical research. The stage has now been set for the
college and the UM Hospitals to develop new models of pharmacy practice
for the future.
Dean Paul's vision also included an increase in the quality and size of
the faculty.  During his tenure, numerous faculty members have been
selected for the most prestigious awards for pharmaceutical research, and the
welcoming environment and the college's growing prestige have led to a
steady increase in the number and quality of student applicants. An aggressive fund-raiser, Dean Paul oversaw a rise in the college's endowment from
$500,000 to a market value of more than $16.3 million, as well as the
construction of a new research wing built with $4.5 million in private
support. There can be no doubt that Ara Paul has left an indelible mark on
the College of Pharmacy in all of the important arenas.
The Regents now salute Ara G. Paul for his many contributions to the
College of Pharmacy and the University by naming him dean emeritus.

Retirement Memoirs.           The   following   retirement memoirs were
submitted:
Frederick W. Gehring, the T.H. Hildebrandt Distinguished University Professor of Mathematics, will retire from        active faculty status on
December 31, 1995.
A native of Ann Arbor, Professor Gehring earned two B.S.E. degrees
(1946) and an M.S. degree (1949) at the University of Michigan. He earned


232




December Meeting, 1995


his Ph.D. degree from the University of Cambridge in 1952. He taught at
Harvard University from 1952-55, when he returned to the University of
Michigan as an instructor in mathematics. He was promoted to assistant
professor in 1956, associate professor in 1959, professor in 1961, and the
T.H. Hildebrandt Distinguished University Professor in 1987. Professor
Gehring served three terms as chair of the mathematics department. Among
his honors are the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award (1981), the
Henry Russel Lecturer (1990), and the Sokol Faculty Award (1994). He was
invited three times to address the International Congress of Mathematicians
(1966, 1974, 1986) and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in
1989.
A Guggenheim Fellowship brought Professor Gehring to the University
of Helsinki and the E.T.H. in Zurich in 1958-60. There he began to learn the
theory of quasiconformal mappings, which became the focus of his life's
work. He was instrumental in developing the theory and bringing it into the
mainstream of mathematical analysis. In particular, he pioneered the important extension of the theory to n-dimensional space, emphasizing new tools
such as extremal length and capacity. More recently he has brought quasiconformal mappings into a broad study of discrete transformation groups.
Throughout his career, Professor Gehring has maintained close ties with
Finnish mathematicians. He speaks fluent Finnish, has made many visits to
the country, and has received several high honors from Finland. Over the
years, he and his wife Lois have also welcomed many Finnish and other
foreign scholars to Ann Arbor. He has directed 26 Ph.D. students at the
University of Michigan, plus 2 others who obtained degrees from other institutions. As a measure of their loyalty and continuing scholarly activity, 25 of
his 28 Ph.D. students attended an international conference held in Professor
Gehring's honor in August 1995.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Frederick W.
Gehring the T. H. Hildebrandt Distinguished University Professor Emeritus
of Mathematics.
Helen M. Graves, associate professor of political science at the
University of Michigan-Dearborn, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 1995.
Professor Graves received her B.S. degree from  Southern Illinois
University in 1946, her M.A. degree from the University of Minnesota in
1949, and her Ph.D. degree from Wayne State University in 1975. She joined
the faculty of the University of Michigan-Dearborn in 1972 as a lecturer in
political science. She was promoted to associate professor in 1976 and has
distinguished herself as the director of the Political Internship Program on
the Dearborn campus.
Two major commitments, one to political internships and experiential
education, and the other to women's education, have marked Professor
Graves' academic career. The innovative internship models that she introduced have received state, national, and international recognition. Through
her efforts, the college's internship/seminar program expanded from one
course to four courses per year.   Professor Graves also initiated a


233




December Meeting, 1995


comparative political experience offered in two Canadian capitals: the first,
in the provincial legislature in Toronto, and the second, a federal experience
in the Canadian House of Commons in Ottawa.      Approximately 1,400
students have had a political internship under her direction. Professor
Graves organized the first "Women, Politics and the Law" course on the
Dearborn campus in 1974 as well as the first women's studies minor certified
by the college. She is a founding member of the University of MichiganDearborn Women's Commission.
Professor Graves' work merited a tribute read on the floor of the House
of Commons in recognition of fifteen years of work organizing the
Toronto/Ottawa Comparative Political Internship.  She was recognized
further by her appointment to a three-year term on the Fulbright Program
for Canadian awards.   Michigan Governor James Blanchard appointed
Professor Graves to the Michigan Women's Commission for two consecutive
three-year terms. Her work with internships in the Michigan House and
Senate was honored by resolutions from both houses. Among her many
awards were the Susan B. Anthony Award given by the University of
Michigan-Dearborn Women's Commission in 1980, the Sarah Goddard Power
Award given by the University's Academic Women's Caucus in 1989, and the
Outstanding Service Award (External) given by the Dearborn campus in
1993. She also served as the first woman president of the Michigan Conference of Political Science in 1970.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and innovative
member of the Dearborn faculty for her dedicated service to the University
by naming Helen M. Graves associate professor emerita of political science.
Joel Isaacson, professor of history of art in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 1995.
Professor Isaacson received his B.A. degree in design from Brooklyn
College in 1952. He studied painting at the Slade School of Fine Arts in
London from 1954-55 before earning his M.A. degree in painting with a
minor in art history from Oberlin College in 1957. Only then did he devote
his academic energies totally to the history of art, receiving his Ph.D. degree
from the University of California at Berkeley in 1967. Professor Isaacson
came to the University of Michigan in 1964 as instructor of history of art.
He was promoted to assistant professor in 1967, associate professor in 1971,
and professor in 1979.
Professor Isaacson enjoys an international reputation as a specialist in
the impressionist painters. His publications range from books on Monet
(Monet: Le dejeuner sur 'herbe, Penguin 1972; and Claude Monet: Observations and Reflections, Phaidon 1978) to major University of Michigan
Museum of Art exhibitions and catalogues of profound scholarly impact
(including Manet and Spain in 1969 and The Crisis of Impressionism in
1980.) Beyond these works of monographic scope, Professor Isaacson has
written numerous articles, reviews, and essays. His most recent article,
"Constable, Duranty, Mallarme Impressionism, Plein Air, and Forgetting,"
in The Art Bulletin (September 1994) is an eloquent excursion into the


234




December Meeting, 1995


complexities of the creative act. It also symbolizes the union of Isaacson's
love for painting as a material, intellectual, and spiritual process and his love
for the discipline of art history as rigorous engagement with that effort.
Throughout his years at Michigan, Professor Isaacson has been an
inspiring teacher to undergraduate students and to the many graduate
students who have flocked to Ann Arbor to study the impressionists with
him. He has also been a warm, generous, genuinely beloved colleague in
every way. He served as chair of the Department of History of Art from
1982-85, during which time he had oversight of the renovations and addition
to Tappan Hall. He has also been a leader within the national professional
organization of art historians and artists, the College Art Association.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Joel Isaacson professor emeritus of history of art.
Harold R. Johnson, professor of social work, former dean, School of
Social Work, and professor of health behavior and health education, School of
Public Health, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1995.
Professor Johnson received his B.A. degree from the University of
Western Ontario in 1950 and his M.S.W. degree from Wayne State University in 1957. He held leadership positions in a variety of public and voluntary social welfare agencies before joining the faculty of the University of
Michigan School of Social Work as a full professor in 1969. He received the
additional appointment in the School of Public Health in 1976.
Prior to his appointment as dean of the School of Social Work in 1981,
Professor Johnson served as head of the school's Community Practice
Program and also as the school's divisional coordinator. From 1975-81, he
was the director of the Institute of Gerontology  He served as dean until
1993, when he became special counsel to the president. In this role, he
assisted with the many issues challenging the University at that time and
provided leadership and a respected presence in the Detroit area. From July
through December 1994, Professor Johnson served as interim secretary of
the university. His wisdom, skill, and expertise in this role afforded the
University the continuity and stability needed throughout this transition
period.
Professor Johnson has a distinguished record of scholarship and publications on gerontological, organizational, and human services issues and has
consulted broadly on these matters. His impressive record of national and
state service includes leadership roles with the White House Conference on
Aging, chair of the National Institute of Mental Health Review Panel for
Geriatric Mental Health Training Grants, and consultant to the National
Institute of Mental Health/National Institute on Aging on the enhancement
of geriatric training. He has been principal investigator for a number of
research and training grants dealing with issues involving aging, the elderly,
and minorities. He was named a Gerontological Society of America Fellow in
recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of aging. Within the
University, Professor Johnson has served on many search, advisory, and
other committees and has served as chair of SACUA. In 1993, he was the
recipient of the Dreamkeeper Award in recognition of his exceptional


235




December Meeting, 1995


contributions to the University's commitment to cultural diversity. He is
widely respected for the dynamic and thoughtful leadership he brought to
the University and the School of Social Work and for his personal attributes
of fairness, tolerance, and good humor.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Harold R. Johnson professor emeritus of social work, professor emeritus of
health behavior and health education, and dean emeritus.
Robert B. Keller, associate professor of mechanical engineering in
the College of Engineering, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 1995.
Professor Keller received his B.S. degree in 1948 from the University of
Wichita and his M.S. degree in 1951 from the University of Michigan. He
worked for North American Aviation as a research engineer from 1951-54
and as engineering supervisor at the Allison Division of General Motors from
1954-59 and then returned to the University of Michigan, where he received
his Ph.D. degree in 1961. He joined the faculty of the mechanical engineering department as an assistant professor in 1961 and was promoted to associate professor in 1964.
Professor Keller's research has focused on the area of fluid mechanics,
and he has published papers on forced and self-excited oscillations in propellant lines, dynamics of two-dimensional confined jets, thermistor probe for
low velocity flow measurement, air-breathing engines in a first stage boost
vehicle, and electrical hazards posed by graphite fuses. He maintained his
ties with industry while on the faculty, consulting with numerous firms
throughout his long career. From 1985 until the present, Professor Keller
has collaborated on NASA-sponsored microgravity pool boiling research. In
this capacity, he has designed and developed successful instrumentation,
controller, and data acquisition systems for the experiments, including
pressure controller, temperature controller, and heater temperature controller. He also collaborated on similar research regarding forced convection
boiling projects.
In service to the department, Professor Keller has been a member of the
Advisory Committee, served as advisor for the student chapter of ASME and
as coordinator of the Power Faculty, and supervised the Fluid Mechanics
Laboratory. In recognition of his outstanding efforts as a teacher throughout
his career, Professor Keller received the 1992 MEAM Teaching Excellence
Award. Among his achievements as an educator are his coordination of the
Whirlpool Fellowship Program and his design and development of experiments and instrumentation for a number of laboratory courses, particularly
in the area of automatic controls.
The Regents now salute this educator and scholar for his contributions
by naming Robert B. Keller associate professor emeritus of mechanical
engineering.
Howard Schuman, professor of sociology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts and research scientist in the Survey Research Center,


236




December Meeting, 1995


Institute for Social Research, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 1995.
Professor Schuman received his A.B. degree in 1953 from Antioch
College, his M.S. degree in 1956 from Trinity University, and his Ph.D.
degree in 1961 from Harvard University. He joined the University of Michigan in 1964 as an assistant professor of sociology; he was promoted to associate professor in 1967 and professor in 1971.
Much of Professor Schuman's research has arisen out of his concerns for
peace and social justice. Other work reflects a lifelong dedication to understanding survey research and to improving the quality of survey instruments
and the information they convey. His publications include important works
on racial attitudes in the United States and the methodology of attitude
surveys. He has been a leader in the experimental implementation of survey
instruments to ascertain the effects of questions' wording and context on the
information being gathered. Professor Schuman has mentored many graduate students and has co-authored numerous journal articles with them. He
has also been a valued undergraduate instructor.
Professor Schuman has served as director of ISR's Survey Research
Center, chair of the Department of Sociology, director of the Detroit Area
Study, and has served in the Senate Assembly and on the Rackham Graduate
School's Divisional Board for the Social Sciences, including one year as board
chair. He has been on the editorial boards of numerous journals; has edited
the journals Social Psychology and Public Opinion Quarterly; and was
elected president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research
(AAPOR) in 1985-86.
Among Professor Schuman's honors are the Gordon W. Allport Prize in
1970, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1980-81, and a fellowship at the Center
for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1985-86. He received the
Annual Scholarship Award of the North Central Sociological Association for
his book, Racial Attitudes in America, in 1986 and received a Distinguished
Faculty Achievement Award from the University in 1989. He was named a
fellow of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology in 1991, and in
1993, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
In 1994, he received AAPOR's Award for Exceptionally Distinguished
Achievement in the field of public opinion and research.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming Howard Schuman professor emeritus of sociology and research scientist emeritus.
John W. Shy, professor of history, will retire from active faculty status
on December 31, 1995, after 28 years of service to the University of Michigan.
Professor Shy received his B.S. degree in 1952 from the United States
Military Academy, his M.A. degree in 1957 from the University of Vermont,
and his Ph.D. degree in 1961 from Princeton University, where he also
taught for 10 years. He came to Ann Arbor in 1967 as associate professor of
history. He was promoted to professor in 1971.


237




December Meeting, 1995


Professor Shy is the preeminent American authority on the military
aspects of the Revolutionary era. He has led the way in emancipating
military history from its traditionally narrow focus upon strategy and tactics,
making it instead an essential component of any full understanding of
humanity's past. Professor Shy's first work, Toward Lexington: The Role of
the British Army in the Coming of the Revolution, published in 1956, was
instantly recognized as a seminal contribution, and received the John H.
Dunning Prize from the American Historical Association. Since that time, he
has published extensively. A People Numerous and Armed: Reflections on
the Miitary Struggle for American Independence, published in 1976 and in a
revised edition in 1990, is widely praised because of its perceptivity and
breadth of vision.
Professor Shy's courses in military history and in the American colonial
period are models of their kind, extremely popular with students, and he has
been equally successful in teaching the survey course in American history.
He has directed the graduate work of a number of Ph.D. candidates. He has
presided over the creation of the Military Studies Group, an informal but
impressive gathering of those with such interests that is now nationally
recognized for its quality.
Within the Department of History, Professor Shy has been a frequent
member of the executive committee and served a term as associate chair. He
has been a member of the council of the Institute of Early American History,
the Department of the Army Historical Advisory Committee and, during his
entire service in Ann Arbor, the Committee of Management of the William L.
Clements Library. He is also a trustee of the Society for Military History.
He has been a visiting professor at the United States Army War College and
the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. In 1983-84, he served as
the Harmsworth Professor of American History at Oxford, the most prestigious appointment in American history in the United Kingdom. Just recently,
he received from this University both a Distinguished Faculty Achievement
Award and a Distinguished Senior Lecturer Award.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming John W. Shy
professor emeritus of history.
Ninfa S. Springer, associate professor of nursing and assistant
research scientist, School of Nursing, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 1995.
Professor Springer obtained her B.S. degree from the University of the
Philippines in 1952 and her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of
Iowa in 1957 and 1959, respectively. She joined the University of Michigan in
1969 as program director of nutrition at the Institute for the Study of Mental
Retardation and Related Disabilities (ISMRRD), where she developed and
directed training, research, and clinical programs in nutrition. Concurrently,
she was assistant professor in the School of Public Health.  She was
promoted to associate professor in 1978 and moved to the School of Nursing
in 1982 after federal support for ISMRRD was terminated.
Professor Springer was among the first School of Nursing faculty
members to utilize computer exercises in her courses. Her recent focus has


238




December Meeting, 1995


been on the continuing development of Clinical Computer Aided Simulation
Exercises (Ccase), which is a user-friendly software package that allows
faculty to develop units specific to their specialties. She has authored or
co-authored a number of specialty units for Ccase currently being used by
nursing faculty in courses taken by 300 undergraduate students each year.
Her research endeavors focused on the nutritional status of pregnant
women, infants, and children. Most recently, she served as co-investigator
on a five-year project comparing services and outcomes of pregnant women
served by certified nurse midwives or obstetricians. In addition to her
academic and research responsibilities, Professor Springer has served as
consultant for numerous agencies and institutions here and abroad. She has
also served in various professional capacities with the American Dietetic
Association at the local, state, and national levels.
Professor Springer has received numerous awards and has authored 48
journal manuscripts, books, chapters, and audiovisual and computer units.
Her many interdisciplinary collaborations resulted in publications with
co-authors from the fields of information technology, nursing, pharmacology,
psychology, social work, and special education.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Ninfa S. Springer associate professor emerita of nursing and assistant
research scientist emerita.
Memorial Statement. The death of one faculty member, Victor L.
Bernard, was reported to the Regents. Vice President Kinnear commented
on the accomplishments of Professor Bernard, who had been his colleague in
the business school.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death on November 14, 1995, of Victor L. Bernard, the Price
Waterhouse Professor of Accounting and director of the Paton Accounting
Center.
Professor Bernard was a model faculty member who was among the
most highly regarded researchers in his field as well as an outstanding
teacher. His combination of academic excellence, approachability, and an
unusual ability to communicate his knowledge effectively placed him in high
demand. He was extremely generous in sharing his considerable knowledge
and insights and never disappointed the many students, faculty, colleagues,
and others from around the world who so frequently called upon him. In one
of many acknowledgments of his extraordinary ability and character, Professor Bernard was the first recipient, in 1994, of the business school's "Leadership in Teaching Award," which recognized his contributions to students and
to the development of junior faculty members.
Professor Bernard's research was sometimes controversial and always
highly respected. His work had significant impact in academia and business
and provided his students with leading-edge knowledge. Professor Bernard
was considered an expert on the savings and loan industry; he co-authored a
book on the subject in 1989 and testified before Congress about the industry
several times. A controversial series of publications he researched and wrote
with a colleague documented a systematic inefficiency in the stock market;


239




December Meeting, 1995


this work continues to generate interest and study on Wall Street and in
academia. At the time of his death, Professor Bernard was excited about his
work in the area of fundamental analysis, a method for company valuation
on which he was breaking new ground. The recently published textbook he
co-authored, Business Analysis and Valuation, provided state-of-the-art
information on this subject.
Professor Bernard won the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants/American Accounting Association "Notable Contribution to the
Accounting Literature Award" twice, a rare achievement. Another reflection
of the esteem in which he was held was his selection as research director and
executive committee member of the American Accounting Association. He
earned his Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois in 1982 and joined the
Michigan faculty the same year. In just six years, he was promoted to
tenured full professor.
Despite enviable achievement in his work, Professor Bernard's life was
filled with other pursuits that were profoundly important to him. He valued
his work as a scout leader for his son Lewis, 11, and he was proud to serve as
a softball coach for neighborhood girls when his daughter Marie, now 14, was
younger. And he considered scaling Mount Kilimanjaro to be one of his
greatest accomplishments.
Victor Bernard left behind a powerful legacy and set high standards for
the School of Business Administration and the University. As we mourn the
loss of this great scholar, teacher, advisor, and friend, our condolences go to
his companion, Dara Faris; his former wife Maureen; his two children; his
sisters, Brenda Custis and Connie Bishop; and his parents, Glenn Lewis and
Erma S. Bernard.
Degrees. There was no action with respect to degrees this month.
Consent Agenda Approved.       On a motion by Regent Newman,
seconded by Regent Horning, the Regents unanimously approved the consent
agenda.
Presidential Retirement Security Program
Regent Varner stated that she was offering a resolution in light of the
fact that the president has decided not to take the sabbatical leave to which
he was entitled when he resigned from the presidency.
Regents' Resolution
In September 1993, the Regents approved a presidential
retirement security  program  for  President Duderstadt in
accordance with provisions that had been made for past presidents
after they ended their service as presidents. As part of that
program the Regents provided for a transitional year as follows:
'A  one year sabbatical leave    at the   presidential
compensation rate at the end of his career as president and
prior to resuming his role as a faculty member. "


240




December Meeting, 1995


President Duderstadt has now indicated to us his desire to
return immediately to the faculty and not to take the sabbatical
leave provided him. In addition to his teaching, research, and
service responsibilities, President Duderstadt has indicated his
willingness to continue to serve the University in institutional
advancement, as needed and requested. In light of his expressed
intention to forego his presidential sabbatical year, the Regents
hereby authorize the presidential sabbatical year compensation
stipulated in the September 1993 agreement to be provided to
President Duderstadt in equal fourths over a four year period,
beginning on July 1, 1996.
All other provisions of the 1993 resolution shall remain as
originally stipulated. Regent Varner is authorized to enter into a
letter agreement with President Duderstadt incorporating the
terms and conditions set forth in this resolution.
We thank President Duderstadt for his willingness to continue
to serve the University, both in institutional advancement and as a
faculty member.
Regent Varner offered the resolution as a motion; it was supported by
Regent McFee. Regent Baker observed that he had voted against the original presidential retirement security program because he had objected to
some of its structure, and his position has not changed. His negative vote
should not be construed as anything other than the view he held at that
time.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved on a vote of
seven to one, with Regent Baker opposed.
Alternative Asset Investment (OCM Opportunities Fund, L.P.)
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of $8 million of the Long Term Portfolio
to the OCM Opportunities Fund, L.P., pending favorable legal review of the
documents by the general counsel's office.

December Meeting, 1995


Stadium and Main Plaza Development
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Fred Mayer, university
planner, to describe a proposed project for improvements to the entrance
area to Michigan Stadium, at the corner of Stadium Boulevard and Main
Street.
Mr. Mayer gave a presentation describing the project and proposed
improvements, the first phase of which includes construction of new
entrance gates that will be moved further back from the intersection, repaving the area with brick, renovation and relocation of the base for the veterans memorial sculpture at the main entrance, consolidation of vendor stands
and improvement of pedestrian circulation inside the gates, and general
upgrading of the landscaping. Mr. Joe Roberson, athletic director, was also
present to respond to questions.
The total project is to be completed in phases over the next five years as
funding is identified. It was noted that the brick paving presents extraordinary opportunities for fundraising. Regent Power observed that this project
is an example of the University and the city of Ann Arbor working cooperatively together.
Following the discussion, Regent Horning moved to proceed with the
project as described in the Regents Communication. Regent Power seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
South Ferry Field Sports Service Building
Mr. Mayer gave a presentation describing the project, site, and proposed
design of a sports service building for the two South Ferry Field playing
fields that are heavily used for women's sports. The building would provide
locker rooms, rest rooms, equipment storage, two offices, and conference
space. The project also includes construction of a small press box between
the two fields.
Regent McGowan expressed equally strong enthusiasm for this project
as for the Stadium/Main renovation project and moved approval of the
project, site, design, and proceeding with the project as described. Regent
Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
East University Walkway
Mr. Mayer gave a presentation describing plans for the East University
Walkway, which is noted in the 1987 Central Campus Master Plan Update as
vital to the master plan concept for the central campus. He reviewed three
schemes that had been proposed for the walkway and described the chosen
scheme in detail. Following the presentation, Regent Power moved to
approve proceeding with the project as described. Regent McFee seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

December Meeting, 1995


North Campus Core Area Landscape Plan
Mr. Mayer observed that until now, landscape planning for the North
Campus had focused on preservation of existing trees, streams, and other
natural features which characterize the land on which North Campus was
developed. However, the development of the campus has led to a need for a
strong landscape concept for the academic core. To develop such a concept,
Mr. Mayer informed the Regents that the University had held a limited
competition under which three leading landscape architectural firms were
asked to submit entries which were judged by a jury consisting of various
University academic and business personnel. The winning scheme was
submitted by the firm of Johnson, Johnson & Roy/inc.
Mr. Mayer reviewed the winning plan in detail and the other schemes in
brief. Following his presentation, he noted that any of the schemes, including the winning scheme, would have to be refined somewhat as projects are
defined and implemented. Specific implementation projects will be brought
to the Regents as they are developed.
Regent McGowan asked whether anyone examining the scheme had
expressed concerns over safety issues. Mr. Mayer responded that officials
were comfortable that the trees and other features of the scheme would not
hinder visibility or otherwise contribute to safety concerns. Regarding the
issue of lighting, Mr. Mayer explained that the current philosophy of lighting
being implemented is to provide "overall lighting", in which every place on
campus will have a minimal level of lighting, with no dark spots. In addition,
every individual lighting and landscaping scheme is reviewed with safety
officials before being implemented.
There followed some discussion about the history of the development of
the North Campus site. Regent Baker expressed concerns that the Regents
had not been informed of the competition for the landscape design in
advance. Regents McFee and Power thanked Mr. Mayer and others involved
in the series of presentations that morning, noting that they had been very
helpful in enhancing their understanding of planning issues.
Negotiations with Mission Health
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. John Forsyth, executive
director of University Hospitals, to report on the recently concluded negotiations with the Daughters of Charity, the Sisters of Mercy, and Mission
Health Corporation. Mr. Forsyth reported that a memorandum of understanding had been agreed to seven months ago to look at the desirability and
feasibility of integrating Mission Health and the University of Michigan
Hospitals/Clinical Delivery System. It was found that this integration would
be highly desirable and would result in very significant cost savings over a
ten-year period, and that much of these savings could only take place if the
assets were merged over a short period of time.
After all parties agreed that integration was desirable, the next question
involved feasibility. The University's representatives reached the conclusion


243




December Meeting, 1995


that integration would only be feasible if there were a merger in a relatively
short period of time.   The Daughters of Charity and Sisters of Mercy
suggested at the final meeting that a separate company be set up that would
include a limited number of operations, with component parts being added
on an incremental basis. Mr. Forsyth reported that the University believed
that under that model, the previously mentioned savings could not be
achieved; they could only be achieved with a complete operational integration. Therefore, the University decided not to extend the memorandum of
understanding, and no further discussions are scheduled.
Regents Baker and Power commented on the fact that even though
these negotiations did not succeed, the University continues to be a leader in
its commitment to seeking ways to reduce health care costs.

Mr. Christenson noted that more than $18 million from this fund and $6
million in one-time state funds has been spent since the inception of this
program, cutting the deferred maintenance backlog in half. The presentation concluded with a videotape showing some of the improvements that
have been made possible through the fee program.


245




December Meeting, 1995


Renaming of East Engineering and West Engineering Buildings
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved renaming of the present East Engineering and West
Engineering Buildings as East Hall and West Hall, respectively.
Renaming of North Campus Commons in Honor of Wilbur K.
Pierpont
President Duderstadt observed that the current policy for naming buildings after an individual is that upon approval by the Board of Regents, buildings are named after a) donors who contribute more than fifty percent of the
cost of the facility, b) presidents of the University, and c) deceased members
of the University community whom it is appropriate to honor.
To name a building after Wilbur K. Pierpont, who served first as
controller (1947-50) and then as vice president and chief financial officer
(1950-77) would be an exception to this policy. However, President Duderstadt noted the extraordinary influence he had had on the University and
especially on the development of the North Campus. Dr. Pierpont had
envisioned the North Campus Commons, which was one of the original buildings on the North Campus and built during his tenure as vice president, as
the cornerstone of social and community life on the North Campus.
Because of his extraordinary service to and impact on the University,
this request is being made as an exception to the current building naming
guidelines.
Regent Baker moved to rename the North Campus Commons in honor
of Dr. Wilbur K. Pierpont. Regent Power seconded the motion. Regent
Baker noted that he had come to know Dr. Pierpont during his first eight
years on the board, and that he was a "great teacher." He noted that the
North Campus had been acquired during Dr. Pierpont's tenure and is an
indication of his foresight. Therefore, he expressed enthusiastic support for
this recommendation.
Regent Varner stated that she was also delighted with the recommendation, noting that when she first started working in administration at the
University, Dr. Pierpont had been a great mentor, a wonderful person, and
an excellent vice president.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously. It
was noted that Dr. Pierpont himself will be consulted as to what will be the
exact name of the facility.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Homing, seconded by Regent McFee, the
Regents unanimously approved the following renovation projects: Medical
Campus way finding improvements; renovation of the third level of Kellogg
Eye Center for the Department of Ophthalmology; and renovation in the


246




December Meeting, 1995


North University Building to accommodate a research laboratory in the
Herbarium.
Lease Agreement with Rubinoff, Stein, and Weiner
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved a lease agreement with Rubinoff, Stein and Weiner.
Because Drs. Rubinoff, Stein, and Weiner are also University employees, this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Dr. Rubinoff,
Dr. Weiner, and Dr. Stein (Rubinoff, Stein & Weiner).
2.  Terms of the contract: The duration of the contract is through January 15,
2001. The University will lease property located at 2100 Middlebelt Road,
Farmington, Michigan. The medical office facility is 2,600 square feet, at a
rental rate of $16.00 per square foot, $41,604 annually (for year one starting
January 15, 1996, with a 3 percent inflation cost added for each subsequent
year) plus the Tenant's pro rata share of the Landlord's operating expenses
for each calendar year during the term of the lease. The Medical Center will
place clericals, medical office assistants, nurses, and physicians to provide
necessary pediatric services to the community.
3.  Dr. Rubinoffs, Dr. Stein's, and Dr. Weiner's pecuniary interest arises from
ownership of the building. The physicians will receive revenues generated
by the leasing of the property to the University.
New Degree Program       for the UM-Dearborn School of Engineering
("Master of Science in Engineering (Automotive Engineering)")
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Newman, the
Regents unanimously approved a new degree program to be offered by the
UM-Dearborn School of Engineering:      "Master of Science in Engineering
(Automotive Engineering)."
Gift of Property (AutoWorld)
President Duderstadt stated that this is an extraordinary opportunity for
the future of the University of Michigan and the University of Michigan-Flint,
as well as for the city of Flint. Chancellor Nelms reviewed the reasons that
the gift of the AutoWorld property is important for the Flint campus: 1) the
campus is currently "landlocked," and this property would provide opportunities for growth; 2) UM-Flint will be better positioned to work in a more
collaborative fashion with the city of Flint and other entities within the city;
3) it helps to ensure University control over how this prime piece of property
is developed. He noted that the city of Flint had passed a companion resolution endorsing this action, and also that prior to completing the transaction,
the property will be cleared of all buildings and that environmental assessment and remediation will have been completed.
Regent Varner moved acceptance of the gift of the AutoWorld property,
subject to fulfillment of all conditions to the satisfaction of the executive vice
president and chief financial officer and chancellor and authorization for the


247




December Meeting, 1995


executive vice president and chief financial officer and president to execute
all necessary documents. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Regent Baker observed that acquisition of this property will be the
equivalent of Wilbur Pierpont's acquisition of the land for North Campus.
He thanked President Duderstadt, Chancellor Nelms, the Mott Foundation,
the city of Flint, and all others who had participated in the transaction,
noting that "it's just a marvelous thing that's been done."
Regent McGowan expressed her agreement with Regent Baker's
comments. Regent Power pointed out the importance of the fact that the
site will be cleared and environmental issues dealt with before the transaction is completed. For this, he wished to recognize the "consistent, supportive, far-sighted support given to the University and the Flint campus by the
Mott Foundation."
The vote was then taken and the motion was approved unanimously.
40 Acres in Burt Township, Cheboygan County, Michigan
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
approved purchase of the SE 1/4 of the SW 1/4 of Section 6, Burt Township,
Cheboygan County, Michigan at a price of $17,000, subject to satisfactory
completion of environmental due diligence, as described in the Regents
Communication.
Proposed Revision of the Bylaws of the Board of Regents Governing
Intercollegiate Athletics
President Duderstadt reported that in response to a request from the
Regents, an ad hoc committee had prepared proposed revisions to the
Regents' Bylaws governing intercollegiate athletics. The intention is to bring
the proposed revisions to the Regents and the larger University community
at this time for initial reaction and comments. He called on Vice President
Harrison, who had chaired the ad hoc committee and served as its liaison to
the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics.
Vice President Harrison stated that the goals of the committee were 1)
to bring the athletic department more in line with the way that the rest of
the University operates; 2) to make it clear that the athletic department and
the athletic director report to the president, who in turn reports to the Board
of Regents; 3) to provide that policy questions or questions affecting the
public standing of the University come to the Board of Regents; and 4) to
clarify the relationship between what is now known as the Board in Control
of Intercollegiate Athletics, the athletic direthe atetic director, the president, and the
Board of Regents.
Vice President Harrison reported that the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics ("Board in Control") had recently had a working session in
which they had reviewed the proposed revised bylaws, and that he planned to
incorporate some of their comments into a new draft for further discussion.


248




December Meeting, 1995


He anticipated that other groups, such as SACUA, MSA, and the Alumni
Association, would also desire to review and comment upon the proposal.
Regent Newman suggested that before incorporating the comments of
the Board in Control into a new document, it might be more productive to
provide the Board of Regents with the comments made by the Board in
Control. She requested that the Regents be provided with a written synopsis
of the comments of the Board in Control.
Regent Deitch observed that he had reviewed the preliminary draft of
the bylaws revisions and commended the working group for its effort. He
suggested that Section 11.212 (regarding the director and operation of the
Department of Athletics) still needs additional work, particularly the
sentence, "All matters that affect the reputation, character, or public standing of the University shall be brought before the Board." He believes that
sentence should be more "specific and definitive" in order to more clearly
state its intent. Specifically, he observed that it is clear that the Board of
Regents has authority over physical property and intangible personal
property, such as investments. He believes that the matter of regental
oversight in the area of intellectual property, such as the use of the trademarks and image of the University, ought to be more specifically defined. It
is his belief that the Board of Regents owns the University's trademarks, just
as it owns physical property and other University assets.
Regent Deitch also cited an example of a policy decision made by the
athletic department that affected the life of the University: scheduling an
early football game, which affects the move-in dates for the dormitories and
other aspects of student life. He also cited problems that have occurred in
the implementation of Title IX that perhaps should have received more
oversight by the Board. Therefore, he advised that more thought be given
toward addressing these issues so that there will be a clear understanding of
responsibility for future boards and administrators.
Regent Baker stated that he had been "dumfounded" by the proposed
revisions, which he believes are an overreaction to legitimate Regental
concerns. For instance, he believes that for the most part, the Athletic
Department has been a very positive force for the University, and that the
revisions unnecessarily remove the authority and financial control of the
Board in Control. He expressed the hope that people concerned with athletics would speak up and defend the department.
President Duderstadt reiterated that this topic would be subject to much
discussion and interaction with Board in the coming months.
Regent Newman expressed her support for Regent Deitch's remarks.
She stated that she believes strongly that the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics should be advisory, because its members are appointed rather
than elected. She noted that that board currently makes financial decisions
which do not necessarily come to the attention of the executive vice president
and chief financial officer, president, or Regents, but that the Regents are


249




December Meeting, 1995


ultimately responsible for the dissemination of those funds. She does not
believe it should be in the purview of the appointed Board in Control to
oversee the actions and the decisions of the athletic director; rather the
board should function in an advisory capacity to the athletic director.
Regent Newman suggested a change to the proposed language of Bylaw
Section 11.214(6), to the effect that the director of athletics should chair the
committee, rather than serve on the committee without vote. She believes
that since the committee should only be advisory, no voting is necessary for
anyone on it; control of the athletic department should be in the hands of the
athletic director, who has been chosen by the president and appointed by the
Board of Regents.
Regent Deitch observed that these comments should not be interpreted
as denigrating the past achievements of the Athletic Department. Rather,
they are an indication that change occurs as institutions evolve, so that it is
appropriate that the people who are held accountable also ought to have
commensurate responsibility.
President Duderstadt commented that intercollegiate athletics has
changed significantly over the past decade. The Big Ten Conference is now
incorporated, with decisions being made by the Big Ten presidents sitting as
a formal board of directors. That structure is also going to be adopted by the
Division I schools in the NCAA, and the proposed changes to the bylaws are
very appropriate in that context.
Vice President Harrison commented that public discussion of this issue
can be expected to resume at the February meeting. He also presented the
Regents with a petition from the Student Athlete Advisory Council requesting that student athletes be elected to the Athletics Advisory Committee. He
reviewed the procedure followed for changes to the Regents' Bylaws:
Proposed changes are published in the University Record for public reaction
and discussion 14 days prior to being placed on the Regents' agenda for a
vote.
President Duderstadt announced that the last order of business would
be a presentation about presidential search models. Following that, the
meeting would be adjourned and the Regents would then reconvene as a
presidential search committee to hear proposals from executive consulting
firms.
Presidential Search Models
Provost Machen noted that this presentation had been prepared in
response to a request from the Regents to conduct research about how presidential searches are being conducted at peer institutions. He introduced Ms.
Marilyn Knepp, director of Academic Planning and Analysis, to present a
report summarizing the findings of this research.
Ms. Knepp gave a slide presentation about various models for conducting presidential searches, based on information obtained from  recent


250




December Meeting, 1995


presidential searches conducted at the following institutions: University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Iowa, Michigan State University, Oakland University, The Pennsylvania State University, Central Michigan University, Ferris State University, University of California, University
of Washington, and the University of Michigan.
The Regents requested copies of the summaries of the interviews which
provided the basis for the presentation.
Adjournment
Following the presentation, the regular meeting was adjourned at 12:10
p.m. There will be no regular meeting in January 1996; the next meeting
will occur February 15 and 16, 1996. Regents' expenses for the month of
November 1995 totaled $2,924.30.

SPECIAL MEETING, JANUARY 1996


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Friday Januay 19, 1996
The Regents met at 8:55 a.m. in the Gerald R. Ford Library to consider
two business items. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker,
Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary
Palmer, Provost Machen, Executive Vice President Womack, and Vice Presidents Harrison and Hartford were also present.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Executive Vice President Womack to present the first item of business.
Easement to City of Ann Arbor for Sidewalk Placement and South
Main Street Widening Project
Executive Vice President Womack noted that the Regents had approved
a project for improvements to the area surrounding the entrance to the
football stadium. These improvements called for moving and replacement of
the current fence to provide for an additional lane of traffic at the South
Main Street/Stadium Boulevard intersection. Action on an easement request
from the city to begin this work is necessary now to comply with conditions
of a federal grant for partial funding of the project.
Regent Power moved authorization for the executive vice president and
chief financial officer to grant an easement on University land on the east
side of South Main Street to the City of Ann Arbor, as described in the
Regents Communication, and to proceed with the project as described.
Regent Horning seconded the motion.
Executive Vice President Womack stated that this action would improve
crowd flow at the corner of Stadium Boulevard and South Main Street.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously
1996 Henry Russel Lecturer
President Duderstadt commented that the Henry Russel Lectureship is
the highest award the University bestows upon a faculty member. He noted
that the recommended recipient, Professor Ludwig Koenen, is a faculty
member of international distinction.
Regent Baker moved the appointment of Ludwig Koenen, the Herbert C.
Youtie Distinguished University Professor of Papyrology, as the Henry
Russel Lecturer for 1996. Regent Varner seconded the motion. Regent
McFee commented that she had been extremely impressed by the
background material she had received about Professor Koenen. Regent
Power observed that Professor Koenen is not only an internationally


253




January 19, 1996, Specal Meeting


acclaimed scholar, but also an extraordinary personality, because of "his
extraordinary warmth and knowledge and willingness to talk to anybody
about anything."
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 9:00 a.m.
Roberta R. Palmer
Secretary of the University


254




SPECIAL MEETING, JANUARY 1996


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Friday, January 25, 1996
The Regents met at 4:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman, Power, and
Varner. Also present were Secretary Palmer, Provost Machen, Executive
Vice President Womack, and Vice Presidents Harrison and Hartford.
Regent Baker, acting as chair of the Board of Regents in the absence of
the president, noted that the Presidential Search Committee had made a
recommendation to the Board of Regents to elect Vice President Homer A.
Neal as interim president, effective July 1, 1996. Regent Newman moved
acceptance of this recommendation; Regent McGowan seconded the motion.
Regent McFee commented that it was appropriate for this decision to be
made at this time, following the adoption of a search plan and timetable. She
noted that Vice President Neal wanted it made clear that he would not
become president until President Duderstadt steps down. At the appropriate
time, Vice President Neal would start working with President Duderstadt to
accomplish a smooth transition, but until that time Vice President Neal
wished to be allowed to attend to his current responsibilities.
To accommodate the schedule of one of the Regents, Regent Newman
requested that the question be called at this point. The vote was then taken,
and the election of Homer A. Neal as interim president, effective July 1, 1996,
upon the retirement of President Duderstadt, was approved unanimously.
Regent Baker commented that he could not think of a better person to
serve in this capacity than Vice President Neal; that he is a superb choice.
Regent McGowan observed that "this is a moment of complete unanimity at
this table, in this room, and throughout this University community," and
thanked Vice President Neal for his willingness to assume this role.
Regent Power thanked Vice President Neal and his family for being
willing to serve, and stated that he is the ideal choice for this position. "I
don't know of any one person for whom every constituency in this University
has shared respect and admiration and happiness to be working with other
than Homer Neal."
Regent Deitch thanked Vice President Neal and noted that the Regents
were very lucky that he was willing to accept this responsibility.
Vice President Neal made the following comments:
"I am deeply honored to have been asked by the Board to make
myself available to be interim president, and I am also very grateful


255




January 25, 1996, Special Meeting


for the encouragement that I've received from my fellow executive
officers.
If (and you'll notice the word, if) interim leadership is required,
if it is indeed needed, which of course depends on the pace of the
search process, I believe I can say with a great deal of confidence
that my fellow executive officers and I are prepared to strive to
nurture and sustain those initiatives that Jim Duderstadt and the
Board have underway, to work to sustain the overall momentum of
the campus generally, and to work to prepare for the effective
transfer of leadership to the next president.
I am very sorry that Jim Duderstadt can't be with us today;
that's the one matter that adds a note of sadness to this event. But
Jim is traveling. I think many of you know I have a very high
degree of admiration for him and for his vision for the University.
And indeed, that was the reason I agreed a couple of years ago to
come over and work with him for the remaining period of his
presidency.
In this vein, the reason for allowing my name to stand for
consideration for the interim appointment is that I think it is a
shared responsibility that the executive officers and I have to see
that the momentum of the campus is sustained during this rather
sensitive period as the Board searches for a new president. I'd like
to echo the comment made by Regent McFee that is veryimportant
for us all to remember that Jim is and will continue to be the
president of the university, and the executive officers and I look
forward to his vigorous leadership up until the very last moment of
his term as president. The University can have only one president
at a time.
So I'd like to thank the Regents again for the confidence you've
expressed in me, and we will work very, very hard to make sure
that we deserve it.
There followed a standing ovation.
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Newman, and
unanimously approved by the Regents, the meeting was adjourned at 4:20
p.m..
Roberta R. Palmer
Secretary of the University


256




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1996


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, February 15, 1996
The Regents met at 2:50 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, McFee, Newman, Power, and
Varner. Provost Machen, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents
Harrison and Hartford, and Secretary Palmer were also present. Regents
Horning and McGowan, Vice Presidents Kinnear and Neal, and Chancellors
Nelms and Renick were absent.
Executive Session Motion
Regent McFee made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended
by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed
session on Thursday, February 15, 1996 to consider material exempt
from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information
Act [Sec. 8(h)]. Such exempt material consists of a written opinion
from the Board's legal counsel.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then resumed in executive session. The meeting ended at 5:30
p.m.
Public Comments
There were no public comments; one speaker had been scheduled but
did not attend.
Friday, February 16, 1996
The Regents met at 9:10 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, Newman,
Power, and Varner. Secretary Palmer, Provost Machen, and Executive Vice
President Womack were also present, as were Vice Presidents Harrison,
Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick. Regent
McGowan was absent.
Michigan Initiative for Women's Health
Provost Machen noted that each Regent had received a copy of the
publication, Women's Health: A Guide to Curricular Opportunities at the
University of Michigan. He introduced the three students who had compiled
this guide: Laura Katz, Mona Kumar, and Valerie Press, thanked them for


257




February Meeting, 1996


their efforts, and noted that it would be a very useful volume for people who
have an interest in taking courses involving women's health or related
issues.
Higher Education Appropriation
President Duderstadt reported that the University of Michigan was very
encouraged by the governor's "exceptionally strong" recommendation for an
increase of 5 percent in the higher education appropriation. The recommendation provides an across-the-board increase of 4 percent for all of the state's
public colleges and universities, with a minimum "floor" amount per enrolled
student that will particularly benefit the Dearborn campus. He also lauded
the governor for recognizing the missions of the state's three graduateintensive universities (University of Michigan, Michigan State University,
and Wayne State University). Finally, he noted that the governor had made
a very generous recommendation for capital outlay to assist the campuses in
meeting their most urgent needs. He commented that this was the most
optimistic budget outlook of the past decade, and that the presidents of all of
the state's universities would be working very hard with their representatives to insure its approval.
Regent Baker expressed his appreciation for the governor's budget
recommendation. President Duderstadt noted that the state's university
presidents intended to pursue a much more coordinated, cooperative
approach toward this year's budget negotiations than they did last year.
Comments from Vice President Harrison
Vice President Harrison commented on a new publication about the
University of Michigan, a copy of which had been distributed to the Regents.
Its intent was to capture the excitement of the University in graphics, as
opposed to words.
1996-97 Residence Halls and Family Housing Rates
Vice President Hartford observed that the proposed rate structures were
developed by two committees, one for family housing and the other for traditional residence halls. Both committees include students as well as staff
members. The proposals call for rate increases averaging 4.9 percent for
residence halls and 4.7 percent for family housing apartments.
Regent Power pointed out that each proposed increase included an
increment for debt service as well as general inflation. Mr. William Zeller,
director of housing, said that it is anticipated that the debt service increments, which cover renovations to Alice Lloyd and Couzens Halls and the
information infrastructure renewal project, would be in effect for next year,
with increases only for general inflation after that.
Regent Baker questioned how the housing staff had arrived at its 3.5
percent rate for general inflation for the residence halls, since most figures
indicate the rate as being under 3.0 percent. Mr. Zeller responded that


258




February Meeting, 1996


increases in telephone and insurance were calculated at 5.0 percent, equipment and supplies at 3.0 percent, utilities at 3.8 percent, and raw food at 2.9
percent. Regent Baker observed that they ought to be working toward
reducing the cost to students for housing and tuition and these figures go
against that goal.
Regent Newman inquired as to whether consideration had been given to
achieving cost savings through privatizing any of the services provided by the
housing division, particularly in the area of food service. Vice President
Hartford responded that this had been investigated, but that so far she had
not been impressed by the sustained quality of privatized food service.
Regent Newman stated that she believes that increases in the cost of
student housing ought to be reduced, especially increases that are higher
than the rate of inflation. She believes that one way to keep costs under
control would be to consider alternatives to rate increases, particularly in the
area of privatization of various housing services. Vice President Hartford
indicated that she would continue to explore this matter.
There being no further discussion, Regent Power moved approval of an
average rate increase of 4.9 percent for residence halls and 4.7 percent for
family housing apartments for 1996-97, according to the schedule provided in
the Regents Communication. Regent Varner seconded the motion, and it
was approved, with Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, Power, and
Varner in favor and Regent Newman opposed.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Secretary Palmer submitted the minutes of the December 14
ahd 15, 1995, regular meeting and the minutes from both the January 19
and January 25, 1996, special meetings.
Reports.   Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports of
investments, plant extension, litigation, personnel-labor relations, and the
report on noncompetitive purchases over $2,000 for the period October
1-December 31, 1995. He observed that this month's agenda contains notice
of a change in ownership of an investment management organization, and
that he will continue to inform the Regents about such changes in the future.
He stated that the general policy is that if an organization loses the people
responsible for managing the University's assets, the University will change
managers.
Endowment. President Duderstadt noted that in a recent annual
listing of the value of university endowments in the Chronicle of Higher
Education, the University of Michigan had ranked second in the nation
among institutions with endowments of over $1 billion in the growth of its
endowment over the past year. He praised Executive Vice President Womack
and his team for this achievement.  Executive Vice President Womack
commented that the value of the endowment reflects the value added through
gifts and performance, minus payouts.

February Meeting, 1996


Report on Noncompetitive Purchases Over $2,000 for the
Period October 1-December 31, 1995. Regent Newman inquired as to
whether the proposed increase in the amount for reportable noncompetitive
purchases to $5,000, to be considered later in this meeting, was sufficiently
high. This led to a discussion of the purchasing system. Executive Vice
President Womack noted that the University had recently introduced the use
of purchasing cards which can be used to make relatively small purchases.
Other cost-savings ideas under consideration are to reduce the University's
need for inventory storage by having contracts with vendors through which
units could order supplies directly.
Research Reports. Vice President Neal submitted reports on projects
established for the months of December 1995 and January 1996 and summaries of a selection of current research and sponsored projects.
Intellectual Properties Policy. With regard to intellectual properties policies, Vice President Neal reported that the Regents' Bylaws deal with
the University's ownership of intellectual property and do not address the
implementation policy that he has been developing. Thus, although, the new
policy will not require a bylaw change, he recommends broad dissemination
of a draft of the policy so as to obtain feedback prior to the discussion at the
March meeting. Regent Newman suggested that there be a presentation
describing proposed changes in this policy prior to the Regents being asked
to adopt it. Vice President Neal stated that he intended to follow a suggestion from Regent Power that the policy be presented for adoption by the
Board in the form of a Regents Resolution.
Wiesner Symposium. Vice President Neal informed the Regents that
the University would be convening the first annual Wiesner Symposium on
February 26, 1996. The symposium honors Jerome PO Wiesner, who received
four degrees from the University of Michigan, served as president of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and played a major role in the development of national policy in the areas of science and technology.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear submitted reports of gifts
received for the months of December 1995 and January 1996 and commented
on progress to date in the Campaign for Michigan.

CHANGE TO
TERMINATION OF REGULAR INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF
Effective December 31, 1995
Medical School
Robertson, John M., Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology, resigned (previously
reported as December 11, 1995)
Retirement Memoirs. Secretary Palmer submitted eleven faculty
retirement memoirs.
S. M. Blinder, professor of chemistry, retired from active faculty status
on December 31, 1995.
Professor Blinder received his A.B. degree from Cornell University in
1953 and his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University in 1954 and
1958, respectively. Following positions at the Johns Hopkins University
(1958-61), the Carnegie Institute of Technology (1961-62), and Harvard
University (1962-63), he joined the faculty of the University of Michigan as
professor of chemistry in 1963.
Professor Blinder has had an extraordinarily diverse career in both
teaching and research. He has been an inspiring teacher for a generation of
graduate and undergraduate students and has offered the largest number of
different courses ever taught by a member of the chemistry faculty and
probably in the College of LS&A. He has also published two texts on such
different subjects as classical thermodynamics and quantum dynamics, both
of which have received great acclaim as models of incisive scholarship and
precision and have been much imitated by other authors.
Professor Blinder's research has centered around various forms of
perturbation methods in physics and chemistry. He has had particular
success in achieving closed-form solutions of the Schrodinger equation for
some major problems, including that of the Fermi contact interaction in
terms of what is now known as the "Blinder operator." Professor Blinder was
also successful in obtaining an analytical solution for the Coulomb (hydrogen
atom) propagator which had eluded other workers for over forty years. This
was the culmination of his discovery of a new spectral variational principle
which allows optimization of the energy spectrum of an approximate propagator. These general methods also led to the resolution of an old paradox
concerning the canonical partition function for the hydrogen atom. Despite
his formal retirement, Professor Blinder intends to remain active, particularly
in the important area of nonlinear dynamics and in the search for quantum
chaos.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming S. M. Blinder
professor emeritus of chemistry.
C. William Castor, Jr., M.D., professor of internal medicine, retired
from active faculty status on November 30, 1995, after a career at the
University of Michigan that spanned more than 40 years.
A Michigan native, Dr. Castor pursued undergraduate training at the
University of Michigan in 1943-44 and 1946-47 and received his M.D. degree
from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1951. He was a house


296




February Meeting, 1996


officer in internal medicine from 1951-54, a junior clinical instructor from
1954-55, and instructor in internal medicine from  1955-57.  He was
promoted to assistant professor in 1957, associate professor in 1961, and
professor in 1967.
Dr. Castor's illustrious investigative career has resulted in the publication of approximately 100 peer-reviewed publications and multiple reviews
and book chapters. His early research was some of the first to use cell
culture methods to study the human synovium. The application of cell
culture techniques to examine the mechanisms of inflammatory activation
responsible for joint destruction in arthritis was groundbreaking and has
subsequently become central to almost all investigation of cellular mechanisms underlying arthritis inflammation.
In 1981, Dr. Castor was awarded the International Geigy Rheumatism
Prize by the International League Against Rheumatism, and in 1985, he
received the Lee Howley Prize for Arthritis Research from the Arthritis
Foundation. These are the most prestigious scientific awards in the field of
rheumatology. In 1991, he delivered the University of Michigan Distinguished Faculty Lecture in Biomedical Research. In 1992, he was honored as
a Master of the American College of Rheumatology, and in 1994, he received
the Laureate Award from the American College of Physicians. After his
retirement from active faculty status, Dr. Castor will remain active in laboratory research, patient care, and teaching.
The Regents now salute this distinguished clinical scholar for his
lengthy and dedicated service to the University of Michigan by naming C.
William Castor, Jr., professor emeritus of internal medicine.
Joseph A. Clayton, D.D.S., professor of dentistry, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 1995.
Dr. Clayton received his B.S. degree from Utah State University in 1952,
his D.D.S. degree from Washington University in 1959, and his M.S. degrees
in denture prosthesis and restorative dentistry from the University of Michigan Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies in 1966 and 1967,
respectively. He was appointed instructor in complete dentures in 1959 and
assistant professor at the Washington University School of Dentistry in 1964.
Dr. Clayton joined the faculty of the University of Michigan School of
Dentistry as an assistant professor in 1966; he was promoted to associate
professor in 1970 and professor in 1974.
Dr. Clayton is a member of Omicron Kappa Upsilon, Phi Kappa Phi, and
Sigma Chi honor societies. He has served the school and the University
through membership on a number of committees, including those governing
graduate dental education, human subjects, research, resuscitation and
emergency procedures, student affairs, and student table clinics. He directed
the graduate program in restorative dentistry (crown and bridge) for 20
years. Dr. Clayton's service has extended to membership and offices in
professional societies, including the American Association of Dental
Research, the American Academy of Crown and Bridge Prosthodontics, the
American College of Dentists, and the American Dental Association and has
served the Washtenaw District Dental Society in several capacities, including


297




February Meeting, 1996


president. He has been a diplomate of the American Board of Prosthodontics
since 1968.
Known for his dedication to teaching, Dr. Clayton has chaired the
master's theses committees of over 50 students. He has also contributed
through research, in the areas of restorative crown and bridge, occlusion, and
temporomandibular joint dysfunction. He has contributed to the scientific
literature through professional journals, as well as through chapters in
several textbooks. Dr. Clayton has also developed numerous television teaching tapes and manuals and has been a lecturer at major meetings and study
clubs, both nationally and internationally.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health sciences educator by
naming Joseph A. Clayton professor emeritus of dentistry.
Richard G. Cornell, professor of biostatistics in the School of Public
Health, retired from active faculty status on January 31, 1996, after a most
productive career.
Professor Cornell received his A.B. degree in 1952 from the University
of Rochester, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, in 1954 and 1956, respectively,
from Virginia Polytechnic Institute. From 1956-60, he worked as a statistician for the U.S. Public Health Service and for the Communicable Disease
Center. From 1960-71, he served on the faculty of Florida State University
as associate professor (1960-68) and professor (1968-71) of statistics. He
came to the University of Michigan in 1971 as professor of biostatistics and
chair of the Department of Biostatistics.
Professor Cornell served as chair for 14 years, building the department
into one of the major biostatistics departments in the country. He served
again as interim chair of the department from 1990-93. From 1993-95, he
postponed his planned retirement to serve as interim dean of the School of
Public Health. He displayed steady and wise leadership during that period of
serious controversy within the school, which included a review of the school's
activities and culminated in a major reorganization from eight to five
departments.
Through his research, Professor Cornell made important methodological
contributions to medical decision-making and to the design and analysis of
surveys and clinical trials. He has served as director of biostatistics cores for
the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center, the Michigan Multipurpose Arthritic Center, and the Michigan Cancer Center, and he also
directed the Data Coordinating Center for the Heterosexual HIV Transmission Study. As both a teacher and administrator, he has made major contributions to the training of biostatisticians for industry and academia. He has
also played an important role in teaching clinicians and other professionals
how to conduct scientific research through the non-residential master's and
Ph.D. programs offered by the Department of Biostatistics and the School of
Public Health.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his
dedicated service by naming Richard G. Cornell professor emeritus of
biostatistics.

February Meeting, 1996


Carleton H. Griffin, professor of accounting in the School of Business
Administration, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1995.
Professor Griffin received his B.B.A. degree in 1950, his M.B.A. degree
in 1953, and his J.D. degree in 1953, all from the University of Michigan.
Following completion of his J.D. degree, he joined the firm of Touche Ross
and Company, serving in various positions, including national director of
operations and chair of the board. In September 1985, he joined the faculty
of the School of Business Administration as a professor, teaching in the area
of accounting.
Professor Griffin has been an outstanding teacher and faculty advisor.
Where a normal faculty course load is three or four courses, he has consistently taught five courses every year. His teacher ratings are routinely
among the highest in his area and in the school, ranging between 4.5 and 5.0
on a 5.0 scale. He recently received the Student Award for Teaching Excellence in the B.B.A. program for 1994-95, a highly regarded, student-selected
award. Professor Griffin's presence in the classroom will be sorely missed,
both by students and by his colleagues who have relied on him as an example
of classroom excellence and leadership.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Carleton H.
Griffin professor emeritus of accounting.
Garth W. Jones, associate professor of microbiology and immunology,
retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1995, after a productive
career as an investigator, teacher, and consultant.
A native of South Wales, U.K., Professor Jones received his B.S. and
Ph.D. degrees from the University of Reading in 1969 and 1972, respectively.
He came to the University of Michigan as an assistant professor in 1975 and
was promoted to associate professor in 1982.
The main thrust of Professor Jones' research involved the adhesive
properties of bacteria and the role of adhesion in bacterial pathogenicity and
in the colonization of the body by these microorganisms. His early work on
the adhesive properties of pathogenic E. coli bacteria was a pioneering contribution that, for the first time, proved conclusively that bacterial adhesion to
the tissues of the body is an important mechanism in the development of
infectious disease. His subsequent research included studies of the role of
bacterial adhesion in cholera and in the colonization of the oral cavity by
streptococci. He made noteworthy contributions to the genetics of virulence
of salmonella typhimurium (an intestinal pathogen), the genetics of enzymes
involved in the production of adhesion molecules of streptococci, and the
ecological implications of adhesion factors. These contributions have been
documented in numerous articles in scientific journals and in many book
chapters and monographs.
Professor Jones has been an invited speaker at numerous conferences
and symposia and has been a visiting professor at universities in Europe and
Australia. He has served as consultant to a number of organizations, including the National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization, the
Veterans Administration, and various pharmaceutical companies. Throughout his career, Professor Jones has also been a mentor to doctoral candidates


299




February Meeting, 1996


and an effective teacher of undergraduate, graduate, medical, and dental
students. For these contributions, he was awarded the Kaiser Permanente
Award for Excellence in Teaching.
The Regents now salute this dedicated faculty member by naming Garth
W. Jones associate professor emeritus of microbiology and immunology.
Terry Kammash, professor of nuclear engineering and radiological
sciences and Stephen S. Attwood Professor, retired from active faculty status
on January 3, 1996.
Professor Kammash received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from Pennsylvania State University in 1952 and 1954, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as instructor in engineering mechanics and nuclear
engineering in 1955. In 1958, Professor Kammash received, from the
University of Michigan, one of the first three Ph.D. degrees in nuclear
engineering awarded in the United States and was appointed assistant
professor. He was promoted to associate professor in 1960 and professor in
1967. Professor Kammash served as acting chair of the department from
1976-77 and was named the Stephen S. Attwood Professor of Engineering in
1977. During his career, he has produced more Ph.D. recipients than any
other faculty member in the department.
Professor Kammash's primary research since the early sixties was in
magnetic fusion. He carried out some of the more comprehensive analyses of
plasma dynamics in the magnetic mirror machine and was credited with the
identification of several major plasma instabilities that have practically eliminated the mirror machine as a potential power reactor. His recent proposal
for utilization of the gasdynamic mirror as a propulsion device could open up
the solar system and beyond to human exploration. NASA has expressed
interest in this device and plans to carry out basic experiments to test his
ideas. In 1975, Professor Kammash wrote the first book on fusion reactor
physics and engineering. His unique combination of talents in fusion and
aeronautics also resulted in his co-authoring the first book on the utilization
of fusion energy in space propulsion.
Professor Kammash is a fellow of the American Physical Society, the
American Nuclear Society (ANS), and the American Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics. He has received several awards from the ANS and served
as chair of the Subcommittee on the Role of Nuclear Engineering in
Controlled Fusion Research for the President's Office of Science, and
Technology in 1972.  He has also received the College of Engineering
Research Award and the Department of Nuclear Engineering Service Award.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Terry Kammash
professor emeritus of nuclear engineering and radiological sciences and
Stephen S. Attwood professor emeritus.
Myron Levine, professor of human genetics in the Medical School,
retired from active faculty status on January 7, 1996.
Professor Levine received his B.A. degree from Brooklyn College in 1947
and his Ph.D. degree from Indiana University in 1952. He held several
positions as a researcher and biologist before joining the University of

Michigan as associate professor in 1961. He was promoted to professor in
1967.
Professor Levine was responsible for introducing the discipline of
prokaryotic molecular genetics to the Department of Human Genetics. First
introduced to the field of genetics through studies on Paramecium with the
legendary Tracy Sonneborn at Indiana University, he was influenced by the
group of researchers who had seized upon bacterial viruses (phages) as the
ideal subject with which to probe the central secrets of genetics. The nature
of the gene, its mode of action and regulation, and the concept of a genetic
code were discoveries of the Phage School that transformed modern biology.
Professor Levine's contributions to this field were made through genetic and
molecular biological analysis of bacteriophage P22, a virus of salmonella
bacteria. Beginning in the late 1950s, he and his students isolated mutants
in phage P22, established a linkage map of its genes, and initiated a brilliant
study of how this phage achieves lysogeny, the continuous maintenance of
the viral genome within an infected salmonella cell and its progeny. Professor Levine succeeded in describing the complex program of molecular events
required for lysogeny, including sequential gene activation and recombination of phage and cell DNA. He next turned his attention to herpes simplex;
for the past 20 years his laboratory has been in the forefront of the molecular
genetic analysis of this important human infection.
Among Professor Levine's former students are a Nobel laureate, as well
as others who have become nationally known geneticists and virologists. He
received the University's Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award in 1980
and the Distinguished Faculty Lectureship in Biomedical Research in 1987.
His leadership of the graduate program in cell and molecular biology for a
fifteen-year period was critical to this program's success.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Myron Levine professor emeritus of human genetics.
Joseph A. Placek, associate librarian, retired from the University
Library on December 31, 1995.
A native of Michigan, Mr. Placek earned his A.B. degree from the
University of Detroit in 1953, his M.L.S. degree from Catholic University of
America in 1956, and his M.S. degree in Russian language from Georgetown
University in 1965. He joined the staff at the University of Michigan Library
in 1967 as head of the Slavic Area Program Unit.
In the course of his 28-year career, Mr. Placek helped develop the library
collection and helped establish local and national bibliographic databases.
During his tenure as head of the Slavic Area Program Unit, Mr. Placek was
instrumental in developing the specialized collection of monographic and
serial publications through acquisition of quality material and creation of
bibliographic records for local and national databases. He established a
strong relationship with the Center for Russian and East European Studies
and closely supported the faculty and graduate students in their research
efforts. His knowledge of the Slavic collection is exceptional.
Mr. Placek made important contributions to national programs in which
the library participated. In 1981, he became the NACO liaison to the Library


301




February Meeting, 1996


of Congress, a project in which libraries participated in the building of the
national name authority file. He was named local coordinator of the
National Cooperative Cataloging Program in 1988, a program to assist the
Library of Congress in creating authoritative monographic bibliographic
records for national distribution. After joining the Serials Cataloging Unit in
1992, Mr. Placek became a key contributor to the CONSER program to
cooperatively build and maintain a national database of authoritative serial
bibliographic records.
By virtue of his dedication to professional excellence, productivity, and
broad knowledge of the library and its collections, Mr. Placek has made a
significant contribution to a generation of university scholars.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming Joseph
A. Placek associate librarian emeritus.
Om P. Sharma, South Asia librarian, retired from the University
Library, on December 31, 1995.
Dr. Sharma completed his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Panjab University in
India in 1954 and 1960, respectively. He earned certification in librarianship
at the Municipal College of Commerce, in Newcastle, England, in 1961, and
received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Chicago in 1964. He came
to the University of Michigan in 1966 as bibliographer and head of the South
Asian Unit and assumed responsibility for building nationally significant
vernacular language collections from India, Pakistan, and other countries of
South Asia.
Dr. Sharma's efforts have been enhanced by his unusually broad
command of South Asian languages, including Hindi, Urdu, Panjabi,
Sanskrit, Gujurati, Prakrit, Pali, and Marathi. This language competence,
reinforced by his scholarly study of South Asian cultures, has made Dr.
Sharma uniquely qualified to build research library collections, contribute
expert cataloging support, provide insightful reference assistance, teach
courses on South Asian bibliography, and serve as a long-standing member of
the executive committee of the Center for South and Southeast Asian
Studies.
Dr. Sharma has also been a national leader in South Asian librarianship.
He has served as a member of the board of directors of the Association of
College and Research Libraries (ACRL); chair of the Asian and African
Section of ACRL; founder and member of the executive committee of the
South Asia Microform Project; chair of the Committee on South Asian
Libraries and Documentation; member of the executive committee of the
Association for Asian Studies; and maintained active membership in the
American Oriental Society, the International Association of Oriental Librarians, and the American Library Association. He has also published scholarly
articles and book reviews on the development of press laws and academic
library systems in India. His scholarship, commitment to excellence, and
breadth of knowledge have supported several generations of scholars and
made an enduring contribution to the University of Michigan.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming Om P.
Sharma South Asia librarian emeritus.

February Meeting, 1996


Daniel J. Weintraub, professor of psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and research scientist in the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 1995.
Professor Weintraub received his A.B. degree from Dartmouth College
in 1954. Following service in the U.S. Navy, he received his M.A. (1961) and
Ph.D. (1962) degrees from the University of Illinois. He came to the University of Michigan in 1962 as assistant professor of psychology; he was
promoted to associate professor in 1966 and professor in 1970.
Professor Weintraub's research has made significant contributions to
our understanding of human visual perception. He was among the first to
use the concepts and analytical methods of the information-processing
approach to gain new insights into the classic issues in perception. His work
has covered a wide range of those issues; however, his primary work has
been on visual perception of pattern and form, with particular emphasis on
the geometric visual illusions. As one of this century's foremost contributors
to that enduring topic, he has presented ingenious and carefully crafted
dissections of many of the classic visual illusions that have revealed important aspects of the mechanisms responsible for those illusions, and for
pattern perception in general.
Throughout his career, Professor Weintraub has also contributed to the
practical application of vision research, especially in the area of aerospace
human factors. He has been a visiting scientist at the Naval Aerospace
Medical Research Laboratory in Pensacola, Florida, and at NASA's Ames
Research Center at Moffett Field, California. From 1985-95, he served as
director of the University of Michigan's interdisciplinary NASA Center of
Excellence in Man-Systems Research, a highly successful program for graduate students with research interests in aerospace human factors. He also
directed the Department of Psychology Honors Program and taught in that
program for 15 years. He received the Distinguished Service Award for
excellence in teaching and research in 1966 and the Ruth M. Sinclair Award
for excellence in honors counseling in 1979.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Daniel J. Weintraub professor emeritus of psychology and research scientist
emeritus.
Memorials. President Duderstadt noted the passing of George C.
Summerfield, professor emeritus of nuclear engineering and macromolecular
science and engineering, who had been a colleague of his in the College of
Engineering.
Death of Peg Molin. Regent Power noted that the record should also
include the loss of Peg Molin, whose memorial service had been held the
previous day. He spoke of her "intimate involvement and support for things
of the University, and the extraordinary role played by her husband, Keith,
and the sense of loss that people share."
President Duderstadt observed, "Peg was a very important member of
the Michigan team. In a sense, its a loss, but she'll always be a part of the


303




February Meeting, 1996


tradition and spirit of Michigan. One of my great memories of Peg was when
she sat on the bench as the honorary coach during the Michigan-Duke
basketball game, which we won, and afterwards in the locker room was given
the game ball by the team. A fitting tribute, indeed, and we'll miss her very
much."
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded
by Regent Newman, the Regents unanimously approved the consent agenda.
University of Michigan Hospitals Comparative Statistic Report
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. John Forsyth to present
the UM Hospitals Comparative Statistic Report, which contains financial
ratios for the fiscal year ending 1994-95 as well as the average for the last
five years. Mr. Forsyth reported that for the first six months of the current
fiscal year, activity levels have not been as high as had been anticipated and
expenses have not been as low as anticipated, resulting in a loss of $16
million in operations. It is projected that the loss on operations will total $19
million by the end of the fiscal year, but this loss will be offset by projected
interest income of $38 million, yielding a projected $19 million gain. With
regard to cash flow, Mr. Forsyth noted that the Hospitals funds $50 million
per year in depreciation for replacement of assets. He also emphasized that
the Hospitals' overall financial health is excellent. The Hospitals' challenges
are created by reductions in support for graduate medical education, the
changes occurring nationally in health care delivery systems, and the fact
that funding sources don't consider the severe nature of illnesses treated by
academic medical centers.
Mr. Forsyth reviewed statistics contained in the Regents Communication, which contain measures of profitability, liquidity, capital structure, and
patient activity for the University of Michigan's hospitals compared to other
AA rated medical centers, national averages, and other teaching hospitals.
On all of these measures, the UM Hospitals' position is favorable.
Clinical Enterprise
Regent Baker moved approval for creation of the University of Michigan
Health System and the appointment of John D. Forsyth as its president and
chief executive officer, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent
Power seconded the motion. The University of Michigan Health System will
initially be comprised of the University of Michigan Hospitals, M-Care, and
the Michigan Health Corporation.
Regent Baker commented that Mr. Forsyth and his team deserve much
credit for sustaining the financial health of the medical center in spite of the
many challenges being created by the current health care environment.
Provost Machen pointed out that the new title for Mr. Forsyth does not
change the accountability of the University's academic mission. He stated,
"The deans of the health sciences schools continue to be responsible for the
academic programs, and the Hospitals and Medical School still have a
separate identity to address the several missions of the Medical School. The


304




February Meeting, 1996


health system exists as a very important part of the partnership with the
Medical School that we must have in order to achieve our academic mission.
This is a separate entity from the academic aspects of our medical school."
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM and WFUM-TV Audited Financial Reports
for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1995 and Statements of Support,
Revenue and Expenditures (Operating Fund) for years ended June
30, 1995 and 1994
Vice President Harrison introduced Mr. Donovan Reynolds, director of
broadcasting, and asked him to comment on his initial impressions and ideas
about Michigan Radio (WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM) since assuming his
position six weeks ago. Mr. Reynolds noted that it was imperative that
Michigan Radio attract more listeners, that it take a more aggressive
approach to fundraising, and that improvements be made to the station's
physical plant. He offered some of the ideas he had for achieving these objectives, which include submission of grant proposals to secure additional
funding, making significant investments in up-to-date technology, and
considering major changes to the station's format.
Following some discussion, Regent Varner moved adoption of the
audited financial reports for WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM and WFUM-TV for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995. Regent Horning seconded the motion,
and it was approved unanimously.
The Regents also received statements of support, revenue, and expenditures (operating fund) for WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM and WFUM-TV for the
years ended June 30, 1995 and 1994.
GMO Emerging Country Debt, L.P.
Executive Vice President Womack stated that the University is proposing to withdraw up to half of its investment in the GMO Emerging Countries
Debt Fund and invest these funds in GMO Emerging Countries Debt, L.P.
He noted that the amount of the University's interest in GMO Emerging
Country Debt had grown from the $78.4 million noted in the second
paragraph of the Regents Communication in December 1995 to a current
value of $88 million, representing a return of 80.0 percent, as opposed to the
69.7 percent noted in the Regents Communication. The recommendation
before the Regents is to take up to half of the University's existing balance in
the GMO Emerging Countries Debt Fund at the time of the transaction and
invest it in GMO Emerging Countries Debt, L.P.
Regent Horning moved approval of investing up to half of the University's existing balance in the GMO Emerging Countries Debt Fund in GMO
Emerging Countries Debt, L.P., subject to favorable review of the documents
for their legal acceptability by the General Counsel's Office. Regent McFee
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

February Meeting, 1996


Reassignment Agreement between the University of Michigan and
Peter A. Ward, M.D.
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent McFee, all seven
Regents present unanimously approved a standard reassignment agreement
with Dr. Peter A. Ward, involving his invention entitled "Sulfate Hyaluronic
Acid as an Anti-Inflammatory Agent" (TMO file #1117). Because Dr. Ward
is both a party to the agreement and a University of Michigan employee, this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   The agreement includes standard terms approved by the Board of Regents
on July 16, 1987.
2.  There will be payment to the University of 15 percent of total consideration
received by Peter A. Ward. No University facilities or services will be used
without appropriate approvals.
3.  Dr. Ward's pecuniary interest arises from his right to receive royalties when
this technology is licensed; this is in lieu of participation in the sharing of
royalties received by the University in accordance with University policy.
Regent Newman inquired as to the University's policies with regard to
employees receiving remuneration from time spent consulting with outside
firms. In response, Ms. Judith Nowack, assistant vice president for research,
stated that according to University policy, faculty members are limited to
four days per month in outside consulting time. Some schools, including the
Medical School, limit this time to two days per month. Each school has its
own system for monitoring consulting time. If it appears that a faculty
member is in a conflict of commitment situation, where internal work is
suffering because of investment in outside work, the University reserves the
right to negotiate an appointment reduction for the individual.
Research Subcontract with Turn of the Century Software (TCS)
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Varner, all seven
Regents present unanimously approved a research subcontract with Turn of
the Century Software (TCS), under which TCS will provide software services
needed to carry out a grant awarded to the University of Michigan from
NASA to establish an Internet-based learning system entitled "Windows to
the Universe." Because the sole partners and employees of TCS, Terry
Weymouth and Craig Rasmussen, are also University employees, this subcontract falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Turn of the Century Software.
2.  A total subcontract of $48,000 is planned over a three-year period. The
proposed scope of work and budget are described in the subcontract. Turn
of the Century Software was approved by NASA as a subcontractor on this
project.


313




February Meeting, 1996


3.  Terry Weymouth's and Craig Rasmussen's pecuniary interests arise by
virtue of their status as sole partners and employees of Turn of the Century
Software.
Implementation of the Regents' Policy on Research Grants, Contracts,
and Agreements, FY95
Vice President Neal submitted information regarding implementation of
the Regents' Policy on Research Grants, Contracts, and Agreements for fiscal
year 1995.
733 South State Street, Ann Arbor
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that the
University had agreed to acquire the property at 733 South State Street in
Ann Arbor at the "as is" appraised value of $475,000. He noted that
purchase of this property had been approved at the July 1995 meeting at a
price of $630,000, but that for various reasons (as described in the Regents
Communication), the transaction had not taken place as originally conceived.
Regent Newman left the meeting at this point, at 11:08 a.m.
8 Acre Parcel, Dearborn
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously authorized sale of an eight-acre parcel of land on the
southeast corner of the intersection of Mercury and Hubbard Drives in
Dearborn, Michigan, at a minimum of the $1.6 million appraised value for
office development.
Henry Russel Award for 1996
Regent Power moved approval of the appointment of Dante Eric Amidei,
associate professor of physics, and Celeste Anne Brusati, associate professor
of history of art and women's studies, as Henry Russel Award recipients for
1996. Regent Varner seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:15
a.m. The next meeting will be held on March 14 and 15, 1996. Regents'
expenses recorded for the month of January 1996 totaled $1,251.00.
Roberta R. Palmer
Secretary of the University

MARCH MEETING, 1996


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, March 14, 1996
The Regents met at 1:40 p.m. in the Music Room of the Henry Ford
Estate-Fair Lane. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker,
Horning, McGowan, Newman, and Power. Provost Machen, Executive Vice
President Womack, Vice Presidents Harrison, Kinnear, and Neal, Chancellors
Nelms and Renick, and Secretary Palmer were also present. Regents Deitch,
McFee, and Varner and Vice President Hartford were absent.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and expressed appreciation to the Dearborn Campus community for hosting the meeting.
Gifts for Regent Newman
President Duderstadt announced that Regent Newman had recently
given birth to a baby boy and presented her with gifts on behalf of the
Regents and executive officers. While opening the gifts, Regent Newman
commented on the excellent care she had received at the new Women's
Hospital Birth Center.
Executive Vice President Womack
President Duderstadt noted that Executive Vice President Womack had
announced his decision to step down from his position as executive vice
president and chief financial officer at the end of the year and return to the
faculty. He observed that "the University has greatly benefited over the past
eight years from having the services of an individual who is regarded as the
best chief financial officer in higher education today." He noted that his
impact on the institution has been extraordinary, whether in the sophisticated manner in which the resources of the institution are managed, or the
financial strength of the institution, which is at an all time high and is the
envy of all of higher education, or the improvement in the quality of the
campuses' physical facilities, or the strength of the leadership team he has
built. He stated that regardless of his future role, "both Farris and Ann
Womack are part of the Michigan family and will always be part of the
Michigan family," and noted that he looks forward to continuing to work
very closely with him.
There followed a round of applause, after which Vice President Neal
expressed his gratitude to Executive Vice President Womack for his commitment to stay on during the transition period following the retirement of
President Duderstadt.
Regent Baker observed that the Investment Advisory Committee that
Executive Vice President Womack had assembled, which is a big factor in the


315




March Meeting, 1996


success of the investment portfolio, can be considered as one of his most
important accomplishments.
General Remarks from President Duderstadt
President Duderstadt commented that meetings on the regional campuses
help to highlight the unique role they play in service both to the state and the
University. He noted that Chancellors Renick and Nelms have both provided
"exceptionally able and strong leadership, leadership characterized by vision,
energy, and enthusiasm." He observed that these campuses are "terribly
important to the state and to the University of Michigan." Having the Board
meet on the two regional campuses each year provides the Board with a
sense of their impact and also gives the Regents an opportunity to see for
themselves how exciting these campuses are.
President Duderstadt observed that the University was "delighted" with
the governor's budget recommendations, which had recognized the growth of
the regional campuses by raising the per student appropriation to what would
amount to a 12.0 percent increase for the Dearborn campus and a 6.5 to 7.0
percent increase for the Flint campus. The total proposed higher education
budget amounts to a 4.6 percent increase in the higher education appropriation.
President Duderstadt noted that all institutions are slated for increases
of at least 4 percent, which will be the first above-inflation increase in many
years for a number of campuses. The budget also attempts to recognize
enrollment growth at many of the state's campuses by establishing a "floor"
amount per student. Finally, the governor has recognized the unique role
played by the state's three research universities, the University of Michigan
Ann Arbor campus, Wayne State University, and Michigan State University,
by providing specific components to the appropriation for these three institutions which recognizes their specific missions with respect to graduate
education.
As an indication of the unusual spirit of cooperation among the presidents of Michigan universities, he and the presidents of Michigan State and
Wayne State Universities had sent a letter to the governor expressing their
appreciation for his support and pledging their support of the appropriation
recommendations for each of these institutions. Thus, higher education
institutions are working together cooperatively this year, which serves the
interests of the institutions and the state. A similar letter of support has
been sent to the governor by the 15 members of the Presidents' Council.
Reappointment of Provost Simpson
Chancellor Renick presented a recommendation for the reappointment of
Robert L. Simpson as provost and vice president for academic affairs at the
University of Michigan-Dearborn. On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded
by Regent McGowan, the Regents unanimously approved the reappointment
Provost Simpson for the period July 1, 1996, through June 30, 2001.


316




March Meeting, 1996


1995 Report of Investments
Executive Vice President Womack called on Ms. Elizabeth Hokada,
director of University investments, and Mr. David Thurston and Ms. Mary
Cove, of Cambridge Associates, Inc., the University's investment advisor, to
present the 1995 Report of Investments.
Ms. Hokada noted that the Long Term Portfolio (LTP) had been initiated in 1995 as a pooled investment vehicle for the University's long-term
core assets. The University Endowment Fund was the first fund transferred
to the LTP. Additional funds from the University Investment Pool (UIP)
were added each month, with the goal of dollar-cost-averaging the long-term,
core assets of the UIP into the Long Term Portfolio over a three to five year
period. By year end, the value of the Long Term Portfolio was $1.6 billion.
She noted that 1995 had been an excellent year, with extraordinarily strong
returns from both the U.S. stock and bond markets yielding a return for the
LTP of 21.5 percent for the year.
Ms. Hokada called on Mr. Thurston and Ms. Cove to review the Long
Term Portfolio investment strategies and results for 1995. Referring to a
separately-distributed document prepared by Cambridge Associates, Mr.
Thurston and Ms. Cove reviewed the Long Term Portfolio investment strategy and reviewed changes in the University's asset allocation over the past
five years. During this period, the total allocation to domestic equities has
decreased from 57 percent to 28 percent. At the same time, global equities
have increased from 3 percent to 29 percent and alternative equities have
increased from 12 percent to 20 percent. Fixed income assets have decreased
from 28 percent of the total to 19 percent. Total assets in the Long Term
Portfolio have grown from $562.5 million to $1,606.0 billion.
Recent investment performance figures were also reviewed. Returns for
most categories of investment exceeded market benchmarks. Total fund
returns for the five-year period exceeded the mean for larger endowment
funds, but lagged the undiversified market index. During the past five years,
U.S. stocks were the best performing asset class, so diversification did not
enhance returns.
Following the review and discussion of 1995 investment performance,
Mr. Thurston introduced the notion of adding the additional asset class of
commodities to the University's portfolio. He noted that this type of asset is
used as a hedge against inflation and as a means of diversification. Discussion followed in which Executive Vice President Womack, Mr. Thurston, and
Ms. Cove responded to questions from the Regents about investment strategy, performance results, and commodities investment.
Following the presentation by Mr. Thurston and Ms. Cove, the Regents
acted on the following investment recommendations:


317




March Meeting, 1996


Global Bond Investment
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Baker, the
Regents unanimously approved the appointment of Rogge Global Partners,
PLC, as a global bond manager, pending further on-site due diligence and
pending approval of the legal and business terms of the management
agreement.
Short Duration Manager
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Horning, the
Regents unanimously approved the appointment of STW Fixed Income
Management as a short-duration bond investment manager, pending further
on-site due diligence focusing on the firm's operations and controls and
pending approval of the legal and business terms of the management agreement. The initial allocation to STW will be up to $150 million of the UIP,
with future additions or withdrawals on a tactical basis as deemed
appropriate.
GMO Emerging Markets Fund
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent McGowan, the
Regents unanimously approved investing in the Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Company's Emerging Markets Fund.
Merit Energy Partners X, L.P.
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that the University has committed an additional $17.5 million to Merit Energy Partners X,
L.P. This action was taken pursuant to a Board-approved policy (effective
May 1994) allowing a follow-on investment in a new fund sponsored by a
previously approved partnership, provided that the fund has the same investment strategy and core investment personnel as the prior fund.
Woodward School Partnership
Chancellor Renick observed that the University of Michigan-Dearborn
was engaged in a number of partnerships with other entities in the region.
One of these is the Woodward School Partnership, involving the University of
Michigan-Dearborn, The Woodward Elementary School in Detroit, and the
Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. He introduced the following
speakers, who gave a presentation describing the various elements of the
Woodward School Partnership: Harold Skramstad, president, Henry Ford
Museum and Greenfield Village; Steve Hamp, director of educational
programs, Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village; Judith Jackson,
principal, Woodward Elementary School; Janice Peterson, teacher, Woodward
Elementary School; Jane Romatowski, associate dean, School of Education,
UM-Dearborn; and John Poster, dean, School of Education, UM-Dearbornm.
Following the presentation, the presenters responded to questions from the
Regents about the program and discussed the feasibility of institutionalizing


318




March Meeting, 1996


this and other similar programs so as to spread their benefits among a
broader spectrum of the population.
Intellectual Properties Policy
President Duderstadt noted that Vice President Neal has been reviewing
the issues involved in bringing knowledge produced at the University to the
service of the broader society. He called on Vice President Neal to update
the Board on his progress to date in revising the University's intellectual
properties policy.
Vice President Neal reported that the major presentation on this issue
would most likely take place at the April meeting. He noted that to gain
input and advice on updating the 1987 policy on intellectual property,
meetings had been held with people in the business community, with representatives of the major campus schools and colleges, with the research associate deans, and with the Senate Assembly regarding various aspects of the
policy.  In addition, notification of a pending policy change has been
published in the University Record, inviting feedback from the University
community.
Vice President Neal said that among the major issues are: 1) What
consideration should govern providing incentives to faculty to engage in
transfer activities while preserving the proper focus on the University's core
academic missions? 2) What will be the effect of Value Centered Management
on revenues earned from technology transfer? 3) Should proceeds be shared
at the unit level or be retained by the central administration of the school or
college?
When the proposed policy is presented in its entirety for action by the
Board, the final policy recommendation will be presented in the form of a
Regental resolution.
President Duderstadt noted that on July 1, 1996, the University will be
adopting a new budgeting system known as Value Centered Management
(VCM). This will provide individual units with more control over their own
resources and raises the issue of who controls revenues generated by technology transfer. It may be that the switch to VCM could lead to the development of more institution-wide policies than had been the case under the
former centralized budgeting system, which by its nature provided a mechanism for leading the institution towards centrally adopted goals.
There followed a fifteen-minute recess, after which the meeting reconvened to hear Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the
topics indicated: Jacqueline Lawson, chair of UM-Dearborn Faculty Senate,
on the chancellor's reappointment process; and Scott Dexter and Mokika


319

Association (GEO), on GEO contract negotiations.

Womack, Vice Presidents Harrison, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors

deans of the School of Art and School of Information and Library Studies
were present to respond to questions regarding the first two action items.

Appointment of Auditors for 1995-96
Executive Vice President Womack observed that the recommendation to
reappoint Ernst & Young as auditors for 1995-96 would be the tenth year of
this engagement. He recommended that over the next several months, the
Board consider what action it wishes to take with regard to the appointment
of external auditors during the next cycle, because the practice has been to
have a seven to ten year rotation cycle.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the reappointment of Ernst & Young as auditors for
1995-96.

Agreement between the University of Michigan and the Society of
Radiologists in Ultrasound
Due to the lack of a two-thirds majority of the Board being present at
the meeting, this item was tabled until the next meeting.
At this point in the meeting, members of the Graduate Employees
Organization interrupted to register their concern that the Regents did not
appear to be concerned about the fact that members of GEO are considering
a job action if satisfactory progress in negotiations is not made.
President Duderstadt responded that this issue is of great concern to the
officers and Regents, and that they have discussed it at length. However, he
noted that this is not the appropriate venue for a discussion involving collective bargaining issues.

President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Executive Vice President Womack.
Nichols Arboretum Project
Executive Vice President Womack noted that at the September 1995
meeting, concerns had been raised about a proposal to relocate the historic
Burnham House to a site on University Arboretum property along Geddes
Road. The house would be used by the School of Natural Resources and
Environment to house an urban environmental education center in conjunction with the Arboretum. Because of concerns that had been raised by
residents of the Geddes Road neighborhood about the proposed location, the
Regents had requested that alternative sites be explored.
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Fred Mayer, university
planner, who made a presentation describing an alternate site and site plan
at a location next to the pedestrian entrance to the Arboretum along
Washington Heights Drive, on property owned by Forest Hills Cemetery. He
noted that this site had met with the approval of the local residents and with
the University's planning consultants, and that the cemetery had agreed to
lease the land to the University over a 50 year term for $50 per year, plus the
maintenance of the common fence between the Arboretum and the Forest
Hills Cemetery.
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the site and the project. If sufficient funding has not
been identified after the house is relocated for completion of interior renovations of the house, these will be completed as phase two.

the high quality of the students and faculty of the School of Music.
President Duderstadt congratulated Provost Machen on his success in
attracting Steven Director as dean of the College of Engineering. He noted
that Dr. Director is considered one of the leading engineering deans in the
country, and his acceptance of the appointment is a testament to Provost
Machen's recruiting skills.

Retirement Memoirs. Secretary Palmer submitted three faculty

Samuel I. Outcalt, professor of physical geography in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 1995.
Professor Outcalt received his B.A. degree in 1959 from the University
of Cincinnati, his M.A. degree in 1964 from the University of Colorado, and
his Ph.D. degree in 1970 from the University of British Columbia. From
1968-70, he was an acting assistant professor of geography at the University
of Virginia. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1970 as an
assistant professor. He was promoted to associate professor in 1974 and
professor in 1978.
Professor Outcalt's research interests focused on the climate, soils, and
surficial processes of high-latitude environments, particularly in the Arctic.
Early in his career, he became interested in the problems associated with
permafrost and the active layer above the permanently frozen ground that
melts in the summer. He conducted field work in Alaska and Canada and
traveled to the Arctic regions of the former Soviet Union with the goal of
quantifying the thermal, heat-transfer processes that determine what
happens in the active layer on time scales from diurnal to seasonal. Professor
Outcalt was one of the first researchers to be concerned about the effects of carbondioxide-induced warming on regions characterized by permafrost. He was
also one of the first to use computer simulations to study tundra soils, and he
has continued to pursue quantitative methods and modeling in the earth
sciences as a primary research interest. He has lectured widely on these and
similar topics. Professor Outcalt has served on advisory panels of the
National Academy of Sciences and acted as a consultant to the United States
Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory and to the Geological
Survey of Canada. In 1981, he was elected fellow of the Arctic Institute of
North America.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Samuel I.
Outcalt professor emeritus of physical geography.
Irwin Pollack, professor of psychology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts and research scientist in the Mental Health Research


351




April Meeting, 1996


Institute, retired from active faculty status on April 10, 1995, after a productive career as a research psychologist.
Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Professor Pollack received his B.S.
degree in 1945 from the University of Florida and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
in 1946 and 1949, respectively, from Harvard University. Following his
doctoral work, Professor Pollack was a research psychologist at the U.S.
Navy Electronics Laboratory. He then served as director and senior research
psychologist at the Air Force Operational Applications Laboratory prior to
coming to the University of Michigan. In 1963, he received a joint appointment at Michigan as professor of psychology and research scientist.
Professor Pollack is internationally known for his novel approaches to
the study of the auditory system. Over the span of his career, he was interested in the nervous system interpretation of auditory information. He
recently focused on an experimental approach that distinguished between
two general modes of processing sensory information: "within-signal" and
"between signal" sound comparison, which are necessary for auditory
discrimination tasks. The long-term goal of his research was to improve our
understanding of the human binaural system. Such understanding may well
lead to new prostheses or signal processing procedures to aid localization of
hard-of-hearing patients.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and scientist for
his dedicated service by naming Irwin Pollack professor emeritus of psychology and research scientist emeritus.
Edward M. Sayles, professor of philosophy at the University of
Michigan-Dearborn, will retire from active faculty status on April 30, 1996,
following 28 years of service.
Professor Sayles received his B.A. and Ph.D. degrees in 1948 and 1956,
respectively, from the University of California at Los Angeles. From 1955 -59, he was an instructor in philosophy at UCLA and Pierce Junior College
and then a social scientist at System Development Corporation. In 1959, he
was appointed assistant professor of philosophy at what is now California
State University at Los Angeles. While there, he was promoted to associate
professor in 1963. During the summer of 1963, he was invited to the University of Michigan-Dearborn as a visiting lecturer in philosophy. He joined the
faculty of the University of Michigan-Dearborn as an associate professor of
philosophy in 1967 and was promoted to professor in 1970.
Professor Sayles was instrumental in helping establish the philosophy
discipline at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. He developed and taught
a wide range of courses, including Philosophy of Language and Darwinism
and Philosophy. His students frequently praise his depth of knowledge, his
careful and precise explanations, his willingness to work with them outside
of class, and his wit. He has long been involved with the UM-D Philosophy
Club. Professor Sayles has also given conference presentations and contributed publications on the philosophy of language as well as other areas of
philosophy.
On the Dearborn campus, Professor Sayles served as chair of the
humanities department from 1970-73, interim director of the Honors


352




April Meeting, 1996


Program in 1980-81, and the college ombudsman from 1982-84. He served
as a member and vice-chair of the Academic Affairs Advisory Committee and
was also a member of many other faculty committees including the Honors
Convocation Committee, the Graduate Board, and the executive committees
of the humanities department and the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters.
He is highly regarded by his fellow faculty members and is well known for
his sensitive and just manner in dealing with difficult problems and
decisions.
The Regents now salute this dedicated teacher-scholar for his service to
the University by naming Edward M. Sayles professor emeritus of philosophy.

Sale of Shady Trails Camp and Camp Filibert Roth
Shady Trails Camp. Executive Vice President Womack noted that the
Regents had approved closing of the Shady Trails Camp at their April 1995
meeting, and that the estimated current market value of the property is
$1,930,000. Recognizing that continued operation of the camp is impossible,
Ms. Marie Clancy Hagerman, the daughter of the camp's founder, has
requested that funds from the sale of the camp be used to establish an
endowment fund in her parents' names for the benefit of the Communicative
Disorders Clinic.
Camp Filibert Roth. Executive Vice President Womack noted that
Camp Filibert Roth had been maintained by the School of Natural Resources
and Environment over the years, but that the University had closed this
camp in 1988.
Due to the cost involved in maintaining these properties and because
there are no potential program uses for them, it is recommended that they be
sold at the highest bids over the appraised value, with marketing for the sale
to be conducted on a national level.
Shady Trails Camp. Regent McGowan observed that a significant
service and educational purpose had been served by Shady Trails Camp, and
asked how these functions would be continued following the sale of the camp.
Provost Machen reported that it is believed that all of the Michigan residents
who would have been campers there will be accommodated through three
other opportunities being made available for them. These include a summer
program in Ann Arbor mounted by the Communicative Disorders Clinic
(CDC); a potential program sponsored by the Detroit Public Schools which
would receive on-site assistance from the CDC if it is brought forward; and a
camp in the central Michigan area run by Central Michigan University that
is similar to the Shady Trails Camp.
In response to a comment from Regent Newman about the fact that only
75 percent of the proceeds from the sale of Shady Trails Camp will be used for
a CDC endowment fund, while the remaining 25 percent will be added to a
University account for maintaining "out-state" University properties, Executive Vice President Womack pointed out that the 75 percent will be adequate
to achieve the objective of perpetuating the original mission of the Shady
Trails Camp. Regent Newman inquired whether the donor's daughter was
aware of the fact that only 75 percent of the proceeds would be designated
for the CDC endowment fund. Executive Vice President Womack responded


356




April Meeting, 1996


that it was unclear whether this was the case, and that he would obtain that
information.
Regent McFee noted that the site of Shady Trails Camp is extremely
desirable waterfront property.
Following the discussion, Regent Power moved approval for selling of
Shady Trails Camp and Camp Filibert Roth, under the terms outlined in the
Regents Communication. Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
Establishment of Department of Social Work and Change in Name

unanimously approved establishment of a Department of Social Work at the
University of Michigan-Flint and the concomitant name change of the
Department of Sociology/Anthropology/Social Work to the Department of
Sociology/Anthropology/ Criminal Justice.
1997-98 and 1998-99 Academic Calendars for the Ann Arbor Campus
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent McFee, the
Regents unanimously approved the 1997-98 and 1998-99 academic calendars
for the Ann Arbor campus.
Regents' Meeting Schedule for 1997

April Meeting, 1996


Policy on Intellectual Properties: Including their Disclosure, Commercialization, and Distribution of Revenue from Royalties and Sale of
Equity Interest
President Duderstadt observed that one of the University's responsibilities as a public institution is to transfer the knowledge developed on campus
to serve the broader society through intellectual property development. As a
step in furthering this goal, he called on Vice President Neal to introduce a
proposed revised policy on intellectual policies.
Vice President Neal, with the assistance of Assistant Vice Presidents
Judith Nowack and Marvin Parnes, gave a presentation which reviewed the
history of the intellectual property policy; illustrated the University's rankings
in various measures of intellectual property policy outcomes; described the
conflict of interest policy; described review and management processes; and
reviewed the purposes and key features of the proposed policy change.
They noted that Regents' Bylaw Section 3.10 establishes the University's policy concerning ownership of intellectual property and that the
authority to implement this bylaw is delegated to the vice president for
research. The implementation is guided by the University Policy on Intellectual Properties, which was last revised by the Regents on July 16, 1987. The
purposes of the proposed policy changes are to reflect the increased focus on
the value of technology transfer to society; to remove prohibitions on further
development of technology that has been transferred to a faculty-owned
entity; to enhance incentives to inventors and units through revenue distribution; and to clarify the process for decision-making and conflicts of interest
management.
The key features of the new policy are that it clarifies the relationship of
technology transfer to the mission of the institution; provides a choice of
commercialization options; provides for continued research involving companies in which faculty have an interest; and provides return of revenue to the
units and inventors' research activity, eliminating the central administration
share.
Vice President Neal noted that in April 1998, two years after adoption of
the revised policy, he would appoint a committee to review the policy and
outcomes. This committee would report its findings to the Board in April
1999.
Following the presentation, Vice President Neal responded to comments
and questions from the Regents about the proposed policy revision. Regent
McFee observed that the critical step is to get technology out of the laboratory and into the marketplace. To do that requires venture capital and
marketing expertise. She expressed the hope that as this policy is implemented, the development of venture capital and marketing strategies would
be encouraged.
Mr. Robert Robb, director of the Technology Management Office, responded
that his office is taking steps to both enhance the environment for the


358




April Meeting, 1996


development of venture capital and to encourage the incubation of new
businesses to extract new technology.
Regent McFee moved approval of the revised Policy on Intellectual
Properties and adoption of a Regents Resolution on Intellectual Property
Policy and Technology Transfer. Regent Horning seconded the motion.
Regent Power commented that not only does the policy represent a
significant improvement over the past policy, but that the process by which
the policy was developed represents a real step forward. He read from a note
he had received from a local citizen who had been invited to give his opinions
and input regarding the policy while it was being developed. The person
noted that his having been invited to participate in the process, which was
the first time this had ever occurred, was as significant as the process itself.
There being no further discussion, the vote was then taken, and the
motions were approved unanimously. The text of the revised Policy on Intellectual Properties is included as Appendix B to these proceedings. The
Regents' Resolution follows:
Regents' Resolution
WHEREAS, the University of Michigan is an institution of
higher learning devoted to teaching, research, and service; and,
WHEREAS, an important and valued aspect of its mission is
the application of knowledge to the solution of the complex problems
of our society;
The Regents hereby affirm that the University of Michigan
recognizes and supports a strong program of technology transfer
and intellectual property development as an integral component of
its overall mission. The Regents urge that all appropriate units of
the University endeavor to incorporate this program   as a
component of their own pursuit of the University's mission.
In light of the changing context of technology transfer, the
Regents also affirm the value of modifying, from time to time,
University policies to support the greatest possible flexibility within
a framework of the highest ethical and academic standards.
To this end, the Regents support the removal of prohibitions
on further development within the University of technologies that
have been   transferred to faculty-owned companies.  These
prohibitions are replaced by review processes contained in the
University's new policy on conflicts of interest.
The Regents, through this resolution and through the attached
revised policy, underscore the importance of using revenues from
the development of University intellectual property to provide
incentives for inventors, to direct funds to support the research of

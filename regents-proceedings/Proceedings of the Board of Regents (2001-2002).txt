JULY MEETING, 2001


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, July 19, 2001
The Regents convened at 1:35 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Vice President Feagin, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice
President Kasdin, Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Little,
Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President Rudgers, Vice
President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent Horning arrived at about 2:15 p.m.
President's Opening Remarks
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and reviewed the meeting schedule.
He commented that the requested tuition increase represents a higher percentage increase
than over the past few years, albeit still lower than most other state institutions. He
observed that 15 years ago there was a great deal of public skepticism about the cost of
higher education, but that this had dissipated with improvements in the educational and
research opportunities for undergraduate students. He noted that his administration had
pledged from the outset to keep tuition increases as low as possible, working in partnership
with the state, and that this has turned out to be a sound working relationship.
President Bollinger commented that if the recommended tuition increase is
approved, the average tuition for the past 5 years will have increased by 4 percent per
year, in contrast with the 3.7 percent average annual increase of Michigan State
University over the same period. This year's proposed tuition increase for the University
of Michigan is also the second lowest in the Big Ten.
Executive Vice President Kasdin introduced Barbara Butterfield, associate vice
president for human resources, noting that her efforts had been crucial to the recent
successful implementation of the PeopleSoft human resources application.
Introductory Comments - 2001-2002 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that the Auxiliary Activities budget for the
Ann Arbor campus shows a budget deficit for the forthcoming year, but this has to do with
the shifting of funds for accounting purposes and has no bearing on the state of the
University's finances.
He observed that the University continues to have a very strong balance sheet and to
be in excellent financial health. The three means by which this can be evaluated are to
examine whether 1) the University is able to effectively track and manage financial
performance; 2) the balance sheet is protected with respect to the relationship of current
assets to current liabilities, the mix and quality of the assets, and the size and nature of the
liabilities; and 3) the operating budget is consistent with maintaining the University's
overall financial health.




July Meeting, 2001


With respect to financial performance, Executive Vice President Kasdin reported
that the University had received an unqualified audit opinion with no management letter
comments from the auditors. Nevertheless, he said that the University is continuing to
focus on improvements in financial controls and compliance, and he described as an
example how the reimbursement process for travel and hosting has been simplified and
improved. He noted that with the M-Pathways human resources implementation, the
University has successfully completed total replacement of its management information
systems, which is the infrastructure for financial, physical, human resources, and student
business.
Executive Vice President Kasdin explained that the M-Pathways system allows the
University to analyze its "supply chain": how it procures goods and services. This
analysis has enabled the University to identify opportunities for new strategic
procurement initiatives, negotiate better pricing, monitor compliance with internal
procurement policies, and lower transaction costs. He observed that, partly due to
comments made at Regents' Meetings, the University has been very aggressive in its
efforts to reduce costs and save money.
He noted that one of the University's most visible and largest vendors is the
company that supplies pharmaceutical benefits to employees. Determining how to more
effectively manage prescription drug costs has been a major recent area of focus, and as a
result of an inclusive process that included three faculty-staff task forces, three alternative
proposals have been developed that could lead to a meaningful decrease in
pharmaceutical costs to the University.
Regent Taylor commented that he was pleased with the focus on trying to control
supply chain purchasing. Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that there is over 90%
acceptance of prime vendor contracts throughout the University, and great efforts are
being made to increase the number of these contracts.
Regent Newman asked whether these efforts apply to travel, because tremendous
savings can be realized from centralizing travel. Executive Vice President Kasdin
responded that the University has been holding discussions with major airline carriers to
address this issue.   Further discussion  followed regarding  the People Soft
implementation.
Regarding the balance sheet, Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that the
University has an excellent set of assets, including investments (60%) and physical
properties (26%). Another important asset, he pointed out, is the 30,100 faculty and staff
employed by the three campuses. Salaries and benefits for these employees constitute
59% of the operating budget, 70% excluding the Hospitals and Health Centers. He
reviewed some of the efforts that are being made to attract and retain people, including
investing in both job-specific skills development and more general professional
development courses for staff and improving the tuition support program for all
employees.
Executive Vice President Kasdin next reiterated the University's commitment to
renewal of the existing physical plant and noted that 1997 was the only year in which
more was spent on new construction than on rehabilitation of the physical plant. He
observed that the state's commitment to periodic capital outlays has been critical to the
University's ability to continue to rehabilitate the physical plant.

July Meeting, 2001


He reviewed the various means being used to aggressively manage the University's
balance sheet, including scrutinizing non-investment assets, improving collection and
disbursement practices, and focusing on reducing the volume of accounts receivable.
Finally, he commented that the University has a diverse mix of liabilities and
pointed out the strong credit rating, the consistent debt management policy, and the
aggressive interest expense management procedures. In conclusion, he reported that the
proposed budget will have a financial impact that is consistent with maintaining the
University's overall financial health.
Ann Arbor Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee
Rates
Associate Provost Paul Courant noted that the Ann Arbor General Fund operating
budget was developed by Provost Cantor and President Bollinger, with assistance from a
number of staff in the Office of the Provost, the Office of the Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, and the deans' offices. Provost Cantor commented on the
University's long-standing partnership with the state and noted the inverse relationship
between the amount of the state appropriations increase and the tuition and fees increase.
Because the state appropriations increase for 2001-02 is projected to be lower than it has
been for some time, the recommended tuition increase is going to be higher.
Regent Newman asked why universities tend to increase tuition rather than engage in
belt-tightening in the face of a slowing state economy. Associate Provost Courant
observed that the budget does incorporate a good deal of belt-tightening, even given the
tuition increase. He also noted that the higher education sector works differently from
other sectors of the economy in that demands placed on higher education are not reduced
during these periods. In fact, during downturns in the economy, people tend to return to
school in higher numbers than when the economy is growing.
Associate Provost Courant displayed a chart of the 2001-02 tuition and fee
increases at all Big Ten Universities, which indicated that the University of Michigan had
the lowest increase except for Northwestern University, a private institution. Regent
Newman commented that it would be helpful to have the actual dollar amounts of the
increases, in addition to the percentages; this was subsequently provided. Associate
Provost Courant also displayed a chart of the 2001-02 percentage increases for the other
Michigan public institutions; the University of Michigan had the lowest percentage
increase of these institutions. He pointed out that the across-the-board higher increases
than in the recent past for all of these institutions indicates that they are all facing similar
challenges financially and are responding in a similar manner by raising tuition much
more sharply than they have in recent years.
He pointed out that for 2001-02, tuition plus state appropriation revenues make up
87% of the General Fund; the remainder is largely derived from indirect cost recovery.
Tuition and state appropriation, he noted, "are derived from the payers whose welfare we
care about most" â€”the taxpayers and the students and families who pay the tuition.
Therefore, it is important to be as careful as possible in the use of these resources.
Associate Provost Courant observed that in his opinion as an economics professor,
inflation is not a good normative index of how much expenditures should grow.
Expenditures and industries in the economy grow at the rate of growth of income, which


3




July Meeting, 2001


includes both inflation and real increased output. He believes that the growth of income
is an especially appropriate benchmark for higher education, as it contributes to this
growth in two ways: through the training of the skilled labor force that produces
economic growth and higher standards of living and through the research that changes
what can be done in the world, which in turns produces economic growth. As the world
becomes more complicated and its history lengthens, he said, the University must keep
pace, which requires real growth, not just growth that is sufficient to match a price index.
In summary, the University's mission requires that it must do more than simply keep pace
with costs.
He commented that the five budgets developed under the Bollinger administration
are materially lower as a group than the budgets for the five preceding years. This
illustrates important aspects of stewardship on the part of the board and the
administration, as the innovations and improvements that have occurred during this time
have been accomplished during a period of markedly slower growth in real flexible
resources than during any comparably successful period in the institution's history. This
represents continual attention to reducing costs and reallocating resources, and it also
indicates the way in which growth in both philanthropy and sponsored research make a
critical difference in the University's ability to carry out its mission.
Associate Provost Courant described the special challenges which affect the
2001-02 budget. These are increased prices for natural gas; staff benefits, especially
prescription drug prices; and administrative information and management systems. He
noted that the University plans to address the prescription drug issue in the coming year.
Regarding natural gas prices, Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that we are
currently in a period of dramatic volatility in the price of natural gas, and as a result of
that the University has chosen to hedge its natural gas exposure for the coming year. The
new administrative information and management systems have allowed the University to
make vast improvements in academic advising, online course selection and registration,
and a host of other areas that will improve students' University experience.
Associate Provost Courant pointed to four areas in which the University needs to
maintain momentum:    the Life Sciences Initiative; improving the undergraduate
experience through a variety of programs; enhancements in information technology; and
maintaining excellence in research and scholarship. He described some of the projects
underway in each of these areas.
Associate Provost Courant observed that the process for building the budget
involves the same considerations every year; namely, determining the additional costs
that will be required to retain faculty and staff, cover benefits increases, increase
financial aid to cover tuition increases, cover library acquisition cost increases, meet the
year's special challenges, cover inflation on the rest of the expenditures, and fund any
new initiatives. He noted that the fact that tuition and state appropriation are insufficient
to cover the additional costs illustrates that the new initiatives are actually being funded
by cost reduction, reallocation, and similar measures. As examples of cost reduction, he
noted that the local telephone contract has been renegotiated; a new purchasing
arrangement has been developed for electricity; the increased use of web applications
will save money in the admissions office; procurement improvements have been achieved


4




July Meeting, 2001


as detailed earlier by Executive Vice President Kasdin; and faculty and staff have been
relocated to areas of greatest demand.
Finally, he displayed the recommended General Fund budget for FY 2002, which
totals $1,042,800,000. He pointed out that for the fifth year in a row, the growth in
academic programs will be greater than that for administrative expenditures.
Associate Provost Courant concluded that the budget consolidates the
implementation of a powerful vision of the modern research university and the roles it
can play in the education of undergraduates, the development of knowledge, service to
society, and the interactions among those activities. The return on the investment in a
college education, he noted, is at the highest level ever, and the best universities,
including the University of Michigan, return the greatest value, both economically and
more generally.
A three minute break followed, after which the meeting continued at 3:05 p.m.
Dearborn Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee
Rates
Chancellor Little observed that the University of Michigan-Dearborn is an exceptional
value for the people of the state, in that it provides a high quality education for 8,500
students at a cost of just over $69 million.
He described the values behind the budget and the process by which the budget was
developed, noting that a campus-wide budget committee had been established which was
charged with reviewing and commenting on budget issues throughout the process. He
emphasized that the Dearborn campus administration is very concerned with accessibility
and maintaining the cost of its education at an affordable level. The proposed budget
allows for the addition of new faculty to address enrollment growth, areas of strong
student interest, and new programmatic areas.
Chancellor Little commented that the Dearborn campus is even more dependent on
state appropriation and tuition than the Ann Arbor campus, leading to a recommended
tuition and fee increase for resident undergraduate lower division students of 9.4%.
Flint Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Chancellor Mestas noted that the Flint campus has a very open budget process, with
all of the information being made available to the entire campus at every phase. The basic
principle on which the budget is based is "to provide affordable access to excellent
education." As the budget is comprised of one-half state appropriation and one-half tuition
and fees, the state appropriation is a key element.  Based on an anticipated state
appropriation increase of only 1.5%, therefore, the proposed resident undergraduate tuition
and fee increase is 10.5%. Although this percentage is the highest of the University's three
campuses, he noted, the dollar amount of the increase is the lowest.
Chancellor Mestas pointed out that the University of Michigan-Flint is currently the
fourth least expensive public higher education institution in the state, and it will retain
this status for the coming fiscal year. He noted that as is the case for the other campuses,
financial aid will be adjusted to incorporate the tuition increase, and if the final state
appropriation is over 1.5%, the tuition increase will be adjusted accordingly. He


5




July Meeting, 2001


observed that the expenses driving the budget on the Flint campus are the same as those
on the other campuses, including increased costs for energy and technological
improvements. In conclusion, he said that "dollar for dollar, the UM-Flint is the best
educational deal in Michigan."
2001-02 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
Vice President Harper reported that the fee assessment recommendations of $5.69 per
student per term for Michigan Student Assembly, $5.50 per student per term for Student
Legal Services, and $1.50 per student per term for school and college governments are
unchanged from last year.
2001-02 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Harper observed that an increase of 6.0 percent ($6.70 per student, per
term) is being requested for the University Health Service fee. This figure will fund
expected increases in the costs of utilities, the costs of hiring additional clinical and
nonclinical staff to cover an increase in utilization, and increases in public health and
preventive services.
Proposed FY 2002 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers Operating
Budget
Executive Vice President Omenn introduced Larry Warren, executive director of the
Hospitals and Health Centers; Tom Biggs, chief financial officer; and Kathleen Moore,
chief budget officer.  Executive Vice President Omenn reported that both hospital
admissions and clinic visits increased significantly over the previous year. He noted that
recruitment of several categories of clinical staff, including nurses and pharmacists, is a
consistent need and a high priority so as to be able to meet the increased demand for
services.
Executive Vice President Omenn reported that the fiscal year 2001 was completed
with an $11.6 million positive operating margin, despite having received lower
reimbursements than expected. The proposal for FY 2002 projects a significant increase
in revenue, attributable both to increased volume and improved reimbursement rates.
Extensive efforts are also being made to control costs. An operating margin of 2% is
projected.
Regent White commented that she felt it was important to emphasize how important
it is that the Hospitals and Health System budget is in the black, and it is a tribute to the
work of the HHS leadership that this is the case.
FY 2002 University of Michigan Department of Athletics Operating Budgets
Mr. Bill Martin, Donald R. Shepherd Director of Intercollegiate Athletics, presented
the Athletic Department operating budget. He noted that the FY 2000-01 budget had
projected an operating deficit of $5.0 million, but the actual deficit only amounted to about
$2.0 million. More than two-thirds of the positive variance was attributable to revenue
increases in the form of licensing and annual giving, and the balance was from reducing
expenses.


6




July Meeting, 2001


Mr. Martin noted that the fiscal year 2002 budget projects a budget surplus of $1.1
million, with revenues of $50,598,000 and expenses of $49,467,000. He reviewed the
various aspects of projected revenues and expenses, the details of which are included in
the Regents Communication.
Comparing the University of Michigan's revenues to the average of those of the Big
Ten shows that almost half of the University's revenues come from gate admissions, as
opposed to 37% for the Big Ten. The University is much stronger in sponsorship
revenues than the Big Ten average; however, in contrast to the other Big Ten schools, it
receives no institutional support. The University of Michigan also lags behind the other
Big Ten institutions in annual donations.
Mr. Martin reported that in the FY 2002 budget, football ticket revenue at Michigan
represents 85% and men's basketball 8% of the total, compared to 72% and 20%,
respectively, for the Big Ten. He also compared the University of Michigan's expenses
with those of the Big Ten, with the major difference being a higher cost for financial aid
at Michigan. He noted that the University of Michigan Athletic Department has a
relatively modest amount of debt.
Mr. Martin reviewed the ten-year history of capital expenditures and noted that with
a few exceptions, only modest amounts have been invested in facilities. The major
challenges faced by the department are rebuilding the athletic campus and maintaining an
annual stable budget.
Mr. Martin addressed the issue of football ticket distribution and noted that the
fundamental issue is one of fairness and no decisions have been made yet. Regarding the
athletic department's production facility, he commented that discussions are underway as
to how to best utilize this facility.
Mr. Martin noted that a consultant had been hired to look at all of the Athletic
Department's facilities, including the football stadium, where issues include possible
expansion of the stadium and rebuilding of the press box. The interior of Crisler Arena is
also being evaluated, as the facility has never been renovated and the lighting, seating,
locker rooms, and other features are inadequate. He noted that the seating arrangements
have been changed for the upcoming basketball season to create a more exciting
environment.
Regent Newman suggested that consideration be given to improved marketing and
merchandising efforts within the football, basketball, and hockey venues.  Regent
Brandon congratulated Mr. Martin and his colleagues for achieving a significant positive
variance in the 2001 budget and a projected positive margin for the 2002 budget. Mr.
Martin noted that the president and executive officers have been very supportive of the
department's efforts.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals on the topics indicated:
Stephen L. Chen, medical resident, on residency classification guidelines; Audrey L.
Jackson, alumna, on affirmative action; and Sandra Hansen, citizen, representing the Dexter
Area Historical Society, on Gordon Hall.

Sweeney, John F., Assistant Professor of Surgery, Medical School, resigned, May 31, 2001 (previously
reported as May 25, 2001)
Retirement Memolirs.   Vice President Tedesco submitted for adoption seven
retirement memoirs.
George J. Brewer, M.D., professor of human genetics, the Morton S. and Henrietta
K. Sellner Professor of Human Genetics, and professor of internal medicine, Medical
School, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2001.
Dr. Brewer received his B.S. degree from Purdue University in 1952 and his M.D.
degree from the University of Chicago in 1956. Following his clinical training, he came
to the University of Michigan Department of Human Genetics as a postdoctoral fellow in
1963. He joined the faculty as an assistant professor of internal medicine in 1965 and
was promoted to professor in 1976. In the Department of Human Genetics, he was named
associate professor in 1967 and professor in 1970. He was named the first Morton S.
and Henrietta K. Sellner Professor of Human Genetics in 2000.
Professor Brewer has dedicated his professional life to bridging the gap between
advances in laboratory research and the problems faced in clinical medicine. In
experiments with zinc therapy for sickle cell anemia, he discovered that zinc caused
copper deficiency. He and his collaborators turned this unwanted side effect into a new
treatment for Wilson's disease, an inherited defect of copper accumulation and toxicity.
Dr. Brewer became an internationally recognized expert on Wilson's disease and cared
for and studied almost 300 patients with this condition. His persistent and rigorous
pursuit of a safe and effective therapy for Wilson's disease led to FDA approval of zinc
acetate therapy for Wilson's disease in 1997.
For 22 years, Dr. Brewer directed the University's NIH Training Grant Program in
Genetics, one of the largest such programs in the country. He was president of the
American College of Nutrition and received its highest honor, a mastership. He also
served as president of the International Society for Trace Element Research in Humans
and received its highest award, the Raulin Award, in 1998.
The Regents salute this faculty member by naming George J. Brewer professor
emeritus of human genetics and professor emeritus of internal medicine.
John G. Cross, Ph.D., professor of economics, College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts, and senior associate research scientist in the Mental Health Research Institute,
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2001.
Professor Cross received his A.B. degree from Amherst College in 1960 and his
Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1964. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an assistant professor of economics and assistant research economist in the
Mental Health Research Institute in 1965 and was promoted to associate professor and
associate research scientist in 1968 and professor in 1973. He was named senior
associate research scientist in 1997.
Professor Cross specialized in mnicroeconomic decision theory. He was a founder
of modern theories of the bargaining process and of interdependent decision-making in


16




July Meeting, 2001


general. His early book, The Economics of Bargaining, is still referenced in the
literature. He was also an early proponent of the introduction of psychological theories
into economic models. His book, Theory of Adaptive Economic Behavior, was the first
to use formal psychological models of adaptive learning to develop models of market
behavior of both producers and consumers which allowed for patterns of behavior other
than those dictated by strict rules of rationality.
In 1987, Professor Cross was appointed associate dean for academic appointments
in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. In 1991, he became the associate dean
for budget and administration â€”a position that continued until the end of 2000. Throughout
his tenure as an academic administrator, he provided exceptional service to the college
and the entire University community while continuing to teach at least one course each
year.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming John G. Cross professor
emeritus of economics and senior associate research scientist emeritus.
Syed Murtuza, Ph.D., professor of electrical and computer engineering in the
College of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan-Dearborn,
will retire from active faculty status on August 31, 2001.
Professor Murtuza received his B.E. degree from Osmania University, India, in
1958, his M.S. degree from Oklahoma State University in 1963, and his Ph.D. degree
from Purdue University in 1967. From 1967-70, he was a member of the research staff at
the Engineering Research Center, Western Electric Company. He joined the University of
Michigan-Dearborn faculty as an assistant professor in 1971 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1974 and professor in 1996. Professor Murtuza served as acting
chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from 1981-83 and in
winter 2000. He also served as associate director of the Manufacturing Systems
Engineering Program from 1990-94.
Professor Murtuza was instrumental in establishing the control systems program in
the College of Engineering and Computer Science and has taught the entire sequence of
graduate and undergraduate courses in the program. He introduced the use of computers in
control systems education long before it became a common practice. Professor Murtuza
has been a long-time consultant to local businesses, including Ford Motor Company,
Chrysler Corporation (now DaimlerChrysler), and Sensor Data Technologies. In 1995, he
and two co-authors received the Best Paper Award at the American Control Conference
for their presentation, "DC Servo-Academic and Real." Professor Murtuza holds three
patents in the areas of automotive low-speed-collision mitigation and rotational machine
balancing.
Professor Murtuza served on numerous campus committees and was active in
professional organizations. Nationally, he served on committees associated with
American Control Conference, IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, and the Society of
Manufacturing Engineers.
The Regents salute this dedicated scholar by naming Syed Murtuza professor
emeritus of electrical and computer engineering.
Harold A. Oberman, M.D., professor of pathology, retired from active faculty
status on June 30, 2001, after a long, productive career at the University of Michigan.

17




July Meeting, 2001


joined the faculty as an assistant professor of pathology in 1963 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1966 and professor in 1969. He served as co-director of the
Clinical Pathology Laboratories from 1979-81 and director from 1981-91. In addition to
obtaining board certification in anatomic and clinical pathology (1961), Dr. Oberman is
also board certified in blood banking (1973) and has served as director of the Blood
Bank/Transfusion Service in the Department of Pathology since 1964.
Nationally and internationally known for his contributions in the area of blood
banking, Dr. Oberman is also recognized for his excellence in the area of breast
pathology. He was an organizing member of the University of Michigan Breast Care
Center and was a member of the Breast Cancer Task Force and Advisory Committee for
the Michigan Department of Public Health. Dr. Oberman has received a number of
awards for his work in blood banking and breast pathology. In recognition of his
outstanding teaching skills, he received the Elizabeth Crosby Award (1966) and the
sophomore medical student class Excellence in Teaching Award (1988). Dr. Oberman
serves as a reviewer for several journals including Transfusion, the American Journal
of Surgical Pathology, Modern Pathology, and Blood. He has served as president of the
Michigan Association of Blood Banks and of the Michigan Society of Pathologists and is
active in numerous other organizations, including the International Society of Blood
Transfusion, the American Association of Pathologists, and the Academy of Clinical
Laboratory Physicians and Scientists. He has authored 140 journal articles and 20 book
chapters and continues to be in demand as an invited speaker at national and international
meetings.

by naming Harold A. Oberman professor emeritus of pathology.
James W. Richards, professor of social and administrative sciences in the College
of Pharmacy, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2001.
Professor Richards received his B.S. degree in 1955 and his M.B.A. degree in
1957, both from the University of Michigan. From 1956-62, he was a pharmacist and
then part-owner of the State Drug Company in Ann Arbor. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as a lecturer in pharmacy administration in 1958 and was promoted to
assistant professor in 1962, associate professor in 1965, and professor in 1973. He
served as assistant dean from 1970-75 and associate dean from 1975-95. Following a
six-month period as interim dean in 1996, he served as dean from 1996-98 and again as
associate dean from 1999-2000.
Professor Richards was a pioneer in the study of retail pricing of pharmaceuticals.
His other research and scholarly interests include organizational, management, legal, and
economic issues related to pharmacy practice and third-party payment and managed care
programs and their impact on access, quality, and costs in the delivery of pharmaceutical
care.  He was a chapter author for six editions of the prestigious Remington's
Pharmaceutical Sciences and has published articles in leading professional journals. He
is a member of the pharmacy honor society, Rho Chi, and has received three "Pharmacist
of the Year" awards.
Professor Richards' combined pharmacy and business education and background
made him a unique asset ID the college's teaching programs. He has had a tremendous
impact on the college's professional students and programs throughout his career and is
known as a champion for students, demonstrating his care and compassion for them as
individuals.  During his tenure, he developed an equitable evaluation system for

Turkey, Australia, Colombia, and Mexico. He was included in the listing of the "Best
Doctors in America" from 1984-99. Under his guidance, dozens of general surgery
residents and fellows have developed into leading general and endocrine surgeons.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Norman W.
Thompson professor emeritus of surgery and the Henry Ransom King Endowed Professor
Emeritus of Surgery.
Robert A. Weisbuch, Ph.D., professor of English language and literature in the College
of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on June 8, 2001.
Professor Weisbuch received his B.A. degree from Wesleyan University in 1968 and
his Ph.D. degree from Yale University in 1972. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an assistant professor in 1972 and was promoted to associate professor in 1976
and professor in 1986. He served as chair of the Department of English Language and
Literature from 1987-94. He was appointed associate vice president for research and
associate dean for faculty programs at the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies in
1994 and in 1995-96 served as interim dean and then senior advisor to the dean (Summer
1996) of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies.
Professor Weisbuch is recognized as a leading critic of 19th Century American
literature. His study, Emily Dickinson's Poetry (1975), instantly recognized as a classic
in the field, was instrumental in sparking a revival of serious interest in this vital poet,
and it continues to be read and admired today. Another volume, Atlantic Double-Cross:

July Meeting, 2001


American Literature and British Influence in the Age of Emerson (1986) was likewise
path-breaking in bringing a transatlantic framework to bear on the study of American
letters. More recently, he has collected and co-edited a volume of essays on the subject
of Dickinson and Audience (1996), in addition to authoring a number of articles on
figures such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry James.
A charismatic teacher, Professor Weisbuch communicates an infectious, irresistible
enthusiasm in the classroom Equally at home in the large lecture hall or the small
seminar setting, he has been one of the most popular instructors in the English department
over the past 25 years. He has received many awards for excellence in teaching,
including the Class of '23 Award (1975), the Amoco Award (1985), and an Arthur F.
Thurnau Professorship (1993-96).
As chair of the English department during a pivotal period in its history, he led the
effort to rethink the curriculum and to target new and emerging fields for faculty
recruitment. More generally, he helped to spearhead reforms aimed at the undergraduate
curriculum and undergraduate life in LS&A as a whole. As interim dean at the Rackham
graduate school, he played a central role in improving mentoring structures for graduate
student instructors and in overhauling the administrative structure of the graduate school
itself. He is now engaged in national leadership as president of the Woodrow Wilson
Foundation, where his programs on behalf of the humanities have, in particular, garnered
national attention.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Robert A. Weisbuch
professor emeritus of English language and literature.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 2001


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, September 20, 2001
The Regents convened at 1:40 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, McGowan, and Taylor. Also present
were Vice President Feagin, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin,
Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Little, Chancellor Mestas,
Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Provost and Vice
President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent White joined the meeting by phone at about 2:35 p.m.; Regents Maynard and
Newman were absent.
Regents Resolution in Honor of Solar Car Team
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and introduced Stephen Director, dean
of the College of Engineering. Dean Director praised the accomplishments of the
University of Michigan's solar car team and noted that the University of Michigan had
finished first in three of the six times the race has been run. He introduced the team's
faculty advisors, Professors Brian Gilchrest and Ken Coors, who discussed the benefits
derived by the more than 150 students who have participated in this competition and who
represent a wide variety of majors and interests. Team members were called to the
podium, and Nader Shwayhat, the team leader, thanked the University community and the
greater Ann Arbor community for the tremendous support they had given. He introduced all
of the team members present, after which Regent Homing read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolhtion
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate
Michigan's 2001 solar car team   on its impressive victory in the
2,300-mile  American    Solar  Challenge.     The   IS0-member
interdisciplinary team worked intensively for two years to design and
build M-Pulse, devoting an average of 200 person-hours per week
during the school year and even more during vacations.
Fueled by teamwork, attentiveness to detail, and enthusiastic
comnmunity and sponsor support, as well as by the sun, M-Pulse
successfullh scaled mountains, plains, and desert along old Route 66
from Chicago to Los Angeles. M-Pulse completed the arduous trek in
56 hours, 10 minutes, and 46 seconds - some 80 minutes fister than the
closest competitor. Rallying after a pothole-related accident nearly
destroyed M-Pulse less than a month before the final race, team
members worked around the clock to rebuild the car, finishing just in
time to qualify. They also learned from the mishap. To avert a second
major accident, M-Pulse's advance team painted white circles around
potholes along the route during the actual race. Also contributing to
M-Pulse's victory was a sophisticated weather-tracking system that
team members used to map their racing strategy.


27




September Meeting, 2001


The Regents commend the entire M-Pulse team, its advisors, and
sponsors. As the team prepares for the World Solar Challenge across
the Australian Outback in November, we ofjfr this cheer: "Hail to the
colors that float in the light; Hurrah Jbr the Yellow and Blue!"
A round of applause followed.
President's Remarks
President Bollinger commented that the horrific events of September 11 had had a
profound impact on the campus. He noted that a wide variety of gatherings and events had
been held around the campus, including a candlelight vigil on the Diag attended by 15,000
people, symposia, teach-ins, and a musical event at Hill Auditorium. The Trauma Burn
Center had shipped a supply of a temporary skin substitute to Washington to treat bum
victims. He and Jean Magnano Bollinger had hosted students at an open house at the
President's House. Additional events will be held that will make use of the expertise
available at the University on a wide range of issues related to the tragedy.
University of Michigan Hospitals Biomedical Science Research Building
President Bollinger noted that the Biomedical Science Research Building (BSRB) is
an extremely important project for the University and represented a key aspect of the
University's Life Sciences Initiative. He noted that the BSRB will be a crucial part of Ann
Arbor's cityscape and of the University's campus and will replace out-of-date research
facilities on the medical campus.
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that the matter before the board --
approval of the schematic design for the BSRB -- represents the second step of a
three-step process for approval of building projects. Given the size of this project, a
concurrent separate request is being made for approval to bid the excavation and utility
relocation that will be required before construction can begin.
Executive Vice President Omenn reiterated that the BSRB would provide
replacement space for the outdated Kresge Medical Research Buildings and incremental
space for the Medical School's involvement in the Life Sciences Initiative. The BSRB's
location is designed to stimulate collaboration among faculty in the Medical School and
other schools and colleges. He observed that both the overall architectural design and
functionality of the proposed new building are spectacular. He pointed out that the
building had been designed around scientific investigatory areas, as opposed to classical
academic departments.
Dean Lichter commented that a multitude of Medical School faculty members had
been involved in the planning of this building and that research space would be allocated
thematically and programmatically. The scientific areas of research to be incorporated
are neuroscience, organogenesis, cancer, and the cardiovascular system.
Executive Vice President Kasdin introduced Mr. Todd Schliemann of Polshek
Partnership Architects, who gave a detailed presentation describing the building's
architectural plan and schematic design. Mr. Schliemann displayed a map illustrating the
location of the proposed building and noted that it will be a transitional, highly visible
building situated between the main campus and the Medical School. A pedestrian


28




September Meeting, 2001


movement system is being planned to connect the Life Sciences Institute (LSI) with the
BSRB.
Mr. Schliemann displayed a typical floor plan for the building, which will include
research labs and offices for principal investigators that will be separated by an atrium
spanning the full height of the building. The ground floor of the atrium will include a
300-seat theatre, a small conference area, and a cafe, and there will be two elevator
banks. He noted that the exterior building materials will combine elements, such as red
brick and beige brick, seen in both the main campus and Medical School, and will
include a double glass wall made of two clear glass panels.
Mr. Schliemann displayed drawings of various views of the building and concluded
by showing a computer-generated video depicting three-dimensional views of the
exterior and interior of the building from a number of different perspectives. He also
pointed out that sustainable design is an important factor in the design of this building and
noted that the double glass wall would create a kind of thermal blanket around it.
Regent McGowan commented that the building design is spectacular and asked
about the status of the pedestrian bridge across Washtenaw Avenue connecting the Life
Sciences Institute with the BSRB. Executive Vice President Kasdin stated that the
engineers and architects are working to create the lightest, most efficient, and most
esthetically pleasing design for this overpass before bringing the project to the Regents
for approval.
Regent Deitch commented on the beautiful design and asked how heat build-up
within the building caused by the glass walls would be prevented. Mr. Schliemann
explained that heat build-up will not occur and noted that a significant amount of energy
will be saved by using this type of facade.
President Bollinger observed that this building will have very prominent placement
for both the city and the campus, and for this reason great attention has been paid to the
esthetics of the building. Regarding the notion of the interior office space being visible
from the glass facade, it was noted that the double glass wall would obscure the interior
and that from a distance the glass would be hazy. In addition, each office will have
window shades for privacy. Mr. Schliemann also pointed out that the sculptural element
of the auditorium would help lend scale to the building. He noted that the plans also
include an underground vivarium (animal facility).
Regent Deitch moved approval of the design of the Biomedical Science Research
Building as presented. Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
University of Michigan Medical School Biomedical Science Research Building Utility
Relocation and Excavation Package
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved the Biomedical Science Research Building Utility Relocation and
Excavation Project as described in the Regents Communication and authorized issuing the
project for bids and awarding construction contracts, providing that bids are within the
approved budget.
Regent White joined the meeting at this point (2:35 p.m.) via telephone.

September Meeting, 2001


Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the July
19-20, 2001 meeting.
Reports. Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted reports of Investment, Plant
Extension, and Human Resources and Affirmative Action. He reported that two members
of the University's Investment Advisory Committee, David Alger and Josh Rosenthal, had
been killed in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11.
Regarding the investment portfolio, he noted that times of economic uncertainty
highlight the importance of the endowment spending rule, under which approximately 5%
of the asset value of the portfolio is spent in support of operations, calculated under a
12-quarter lag. Thus, the effects of both large gains and large losses, as well as the
impact of recent events, are tempered and averaged over time. He also commented about
the importance of the diversified allocation strategy into assets whose values do not all
rise or fall at the same time.
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that in 1997, the last time the market was
at the current level, the University had $667 million worth of debt, compared to $666
million currently. Then, the endowment totaled $1.7 billion, as opposed to about $3.7
billion currently. This illustrates that the University is in a far stronger financial position
now than it was during the last market low point.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research  Report,  Vice President Ulaby submitted the Report of Projects
Established for July 1 - August 31, 2001.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Omenn reported
that the health system is extremely busy and is working very hard to accommodate the
needs of patients and families.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper reported that welcome week
activities had been very successful, with record numbers of students participating in the
numerous activities that were offered. In the wake of the national disaster of September
11, she commented that extensive counseling support and printed material had been made
available. She noted that numerous gatherings and memorial ceremonies had been held in
a wide variety of venues and many activities had taken place within the residence halls,
and she reported that the climate within the residence halls has been somber.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little described what the reaction
to the tragedy had been on the Dearborn campus. Because the city of Dearborn is home to
a large Middle Eastern population, a major concern was preserving a supportive climate
on campus. He noted that no incidents of harassment, violence, or friction had been
reported.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas called attention to a photograph
of the William S. White Building on the cover of a national contractors' publication. He
reported that the campus had experienced deep feelings of sadness and some amount of
anger following the World Trade Center disaster, but observed that the object of the anger is
so elusive that there is a danger of its being misdirected. He noted that there is a large


30




September Meeting, 2001


Muslim and Arabic community on the Flint campus and that the campus has taken significant
steps to create a climate of support and community. He commented that a candlelight vigil
sponsored by the student government and Muslim student association had drawn the largest
crowd he had seen since coming to the Flint campus.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Feagin reported on the 2000-01 fiscal year and
noted that total gifts had exceeded $200 million. There was an increase in outright gifts
from individuals to over $105 million, compared with a total of $98 million for the
previous year, which is very encouraging. She observed that Michigan development
officers are stationed in major cities around the country and that, despite current events,
people are still willing to discuss giving gifts to Michigan. Regarding the upcoming
campaign, she stated that the timetable is flexible and no goal has been set.
Vice President Feagin also submitted Reports of Voluntary Support for June 30,
2001, July 31, 2001, and August 31, 2001.

CANCELLATION OF REGENTS COMMUNICATION
Cahill, Thomas J., appointed Vice Chancellor for Administration, UM-Flint, June 2001
Retirement Memoirs.        Vice President Tedesco submitted for adoption four
retirement memoirs.
Gordon L. Flynn, Ph.D., professor of pharmaceutical sciences, College of
Pharmacy, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 2001.
Professor Flynn received his B.S. degree from Rutgers University in 1960 and his
Ph.D. degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1965. From 1965-72, he was a
researcher at the Upjohn Company. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as
associate professor of pharmacy in 1972 and was promoted to professor in 1977.
Professor Flynn's research has focused on drug delivery phenomena, particularly
the areas of percutaneous absorption theory and mechanisms, the enhancement of skin
permeation, and the topical and transdermal delivery of drugs. He has published


56




September Meeting, 2001


approximately 175 research manuscripts, review articles, and book chapters on the
structure-physical property relationships of organic compounds, the physicochemical
behavior of skin, percutaneous absorption and topical dosage forms, mass transfer, and
concepts in drug delivery.  His research accomplishments have been pioneering,
mechanistic, and translational in bringing basic concepts to clinical reality. He was
awarded the very prestigious Ebert Prize by the Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences of
the American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA) in 1974 and was made a fellow of the
American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) in 1987. Professor Flynn
has been a standing member of the Pharmacology Study Section of the National Institutes
of Health and has served as a consultant to industry and government agencies. Among his
many memberships, he has been particularly active in the Academy of Pharmaceutical
Sciences of the APhA and in the AAPS, serving as the first chair of the AAPS
Dermatopharmaceutics Study Group. Professor Flynn holds over 10 USA patents.
Professor Flynn has served as a mentor for more than 45 graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and visiting scientists and as an active participant in the Doctor of
Pharmacy curriculum. He served for many years as chair of the College of Pharmacy's
Space Allocation and Utilization Committee, which involved him in a variety of space
planning issues, including the oversight of several substantial renovation projects.
The Regents now salute this distinguished and dedicated educator by naming
Gordon L. Flynn professor emeritus of pharmaceutical sciences.
Donald E. Hultquist, Ph.D., professor of biological chemistry, retired from active
faculty status on August 31, 2001, following 37 years of service.
Professor Hultquist received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of
Rochester in 1952 and 1962, respectively. Following postdoctoral research at the
University of Minnesota and UCLA, he joined the faculty of the University of Michigan as
an instructor in 1964. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1965, associate
professor in 1968, and professor in 1979.
In his research laboratory, Professor Hultquist mentored nine biological chemistry
doctoral students and a large number of students in undergraduate, medical, and
interdisciplinary graduate programs. His research focused on the catalysis of
oxidation-reduction reactions in red blood cells and on the functioning of antioxidant
systems. Previously unrecognized hemeproteins, copper proteins, reductases, and
proteases were isolated, chemically characterized, and studied with regard to biological
function and medical significance. He gained particular recognition for the elucidation of
the methemoglobin reduction system and the system by which riboflavin prevents
oxidative damage in tissues.
Professor Hultquist developed highly successful curricular innovations. He taught
the first undergraduate biochemistry course on campus and coupled this with a
research-based enrichment seminar. For second-year Inteflex students, he designed and
taught a medical biochemistry course which stressed active student participation. For
medical students, he incorporated successful aspects of the Inteflex course, developed
and taught a pre-matriculation summer course, and set up a clinical correlation program
in which fourth-year medical students taught first-year students. He designed individual
programs for M.D./Ph.D. students and then encouraged the school to apply for funding for
a combined M.D./Ph.D. program. For his efforts in teaching, he was awarded the
University's Outstanding Teaching Award.


57




September Meeting, 2001


Professor Hultquist served for one year as the acting director of the Graduate
Program in Cell and Molecular Biology and for thirteen years as director of the medical
biochemistry and molecular and cell biology courses. From 1996-2000, he was associate
chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry and administrator of its graduate program.
The Regents now recognize this faculty member for his distinguished service by
naming Donald E. Hultquist professor emeritus of biological chemistry.
Arnold P. Morawa, Ph.D., assistant dean for alumni relations and continuing
education and associate professor of dentistry, Department of Orthodontics and Pediatric
Dentistry, in the School of Dentistry, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2001.
Dr. Morawa received his D.D.S. degree (1964), two M.S. degrees (1964 and
1966), and his Ph.D. degree (1973), all from the University of Michigan. He joined the
faculty of the School of Dentistry as an assistant professor in 1973 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1976. He held an appointment as an attending staff member in the
University Hospitals from 1977-93 and was appointed assistant dean for alumni relations
and continuing education in 1990.
Dr. Morawa was an important contributor to the School of Dentistry. One of his key
contributions was his oversight of the two-year Kellogg Building expansion and
renovation project, completed in the fall of 2000. He also played a significant role during
the school's most successful five-year capital campaign. Dr. Morawa has been active in
numerous professional organizations, including the Michigan Dental Association, the
American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, the Michigan Academy of Pedodontics, and
the Washtenaw District Dental Society. He was on the Council on American Dental
Association sessions and international relations committee from 1988-92 and was
program director for the American Dental Association's annual meeting in 1991. In
1990, he served on the continuing dental education committee for the State Board of
Dentistry. In 1995, Dr. Morawa helped organize a program commemorating fifty years of
water fluoridation in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as part of the International Fluoridation
Symposium. In January 2000, he was instrumental in organizing the program, "Scientific
Frontiers in Clinical Dentistry," hosted by the School of Dentistry and sponsored by the
Delta Dental Fund and the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research. Dr.
Morawa is a member of Sigma Xi and Omicron Kappa Upsilon honorary societies. In
2000, Dr. Morawa received the Distinguished Service Award from the Alumni Society
Board of Governors.
The Regents salute this distinguished health sciences educator by naming Arnold P.
Morawa associate professor emeritus of dentistry.
Marc H. Ross, Ph.D., professor of physics in the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2001.

Economic Status of the Faculty 2000-2001 Annual Report to the Regents.
Vice President for Research
President Bollinger noted that the change in the reporting relationship of the vice
president for research several years ago from the president to the provost had not worked
out as well as had been expected, so he was now requesting that the reporting relationship
be changed back to reporting to the president.
Regent McGowan moved that the reporting relationship of the vice president for
research be changed from reporting to the provost and executive vice president for
academic affairs to reporting to the president. Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it
was approved unanimously.
Motion to Meet in Informal Session
Regent Deitch moved that the Regents adjourn this formal session of the Board of
Regents and begin a nonformal session. Regent Taylor seconded the motion, and it was

credit. He noted that later on MSA was planning to sponsor a ballot initiative to raise the
MSA student fee so that it could meet the increased demand for funding from student
groups. Mr. Nolan reported that MSA was in support of those urging the University not to
support the United Way because of its support of the Boy Scouts of America. Finally, Mr.
Nolan reported that there had been a great deal of unity among the student body in showing

SPECIAL MEETING, SEPTEMBER 2001


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, September 28, 2001
A special meeting of the Board of Regents convened at 9:00 a.m. in the Regents'
Room. Present by means of a conference phone call were President Bollinger and
Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Taylor, and White. Also
present were Executive Vice President Kasdin, Interim Provost and Vice President and
Secretary Tedesco, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Newman was absent.
Sale of Real Property
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and announced that the issue before the
board is the sale of up to 55 acres of land located on the University's North Campus to
Pfizer, Inc. He noted that this land has been identified by Pfizer as very important to the
company's plans for significant expansion of its Ann Arbor facility. From the University's
point of view, the proposal provides the means for important academic
collaborations â€”with students, with the Medical School, the College of Engineering, the
College of Pharmacy, and the health system â€”that the University desires to develop with
Pfizer. Thus both parties have strong reasons for proceeding with this initiative. He noted
that Executive Vice President Kasdin and Vice President Wilbanks had put forth a
tremendous effort to bring the transaction to fruition.
Executive Vice President Kasdin clarified that the board is being requested to
approve the sale of up to 55 acres of land located east of Huron Parkway to Pfizer's
subsidiary, Parke-Davis, at a price of $27.6 million, adjusted depending on the variance
in the size of the parcel from 55 acres. He noted that the purchase agreement includes a
restriction on use of the land to be consistent with its current use of property in Ann
Arbor. The agreement also contains a "right of first opportunity," so that if in the future
Pfizer decides that it no longer wants to own the land or any part of it, the land will be
appraised and the University will be given an opportunity to purchase the land from
Pfizer.
Vice President Wilbanks reported that discussions regarding this property have been
held with the city of Ann Arbor, and discussions will continue between Pfizer and the city
about the treatment of this property. The recent discussions with the city regarding
infrastructure needs have been very productive, and the partnership that exists among the
city, the University, and Pfizer has been evident.
Regent Brandon moved approval of the sale of up to 55 acres of North Campus
property to Parke-Davis, acknowledgement of the authority of the executive vice
president and chief financial officer to execute the purchase agreement, and authorization
for the executive vice president and chief financial officer to take the actions required
under the purchase agreement and such other actions as may be necessary to consummate
the sale. Regent Horning seconded the motion.


67




3pecial Meeting, Septem  er 201


Regent Taylor inquired whether there has been any significant opposition to this
proposal. Executive Vice President Kasdin responded that the University is not aware of
any opposition, and that it is now Pfizer's obligation to work with the city and the
community in determining how the land will be developed. The University's remaining
involvement will occur in its role as owner of the abutting land.
Regent McGowan inquired about the remaining conditions pertaining to the sale.
Executive Vice President Kasdin reported that there is a condition to the closing that
Pfizer obtain certain government approvals. Vice President Wilbanks commented that
future discussions will revolve around requests that Pfizer is anticipated to make of the
city, such as for a tax abatement or a tax financing district. It is expected that the state
will also be involved in creating a package of inducements that is typical when additional
job creation activities occur.
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously in a roll call
vote.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 9:08 a.m.

Vice President and Secretary oj the University

OCTOBER MEETING, 2001


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, October 18, 2001
The Regents convened at 1:50 p.m. in the Michigan Rooms on the campus of the
University of Michigan-Flint. Present were President Bollinger and Regents Brandon,
Homing, Maynard, Newman, and Taylor. Also present were Vice President Feagin, Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Chancellor Little, Chancellor Mestas,
Vice President Rudgers, Interim Provost and Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice
President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Deitch, Regent McGowan, Vice
President and General Counsel Krislov, and Executive Vice President Omenn were absent.
Regent White participated in the meeting by phone.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and observed that working with the
Flint campus had been a great pleasure during his tenure as president. He noted that he
had especially enjoyed his interactions with members of the campus community during the
chancellor search that led to the appointment of Chancellor Mestas.  He thanked
Chancellor Mestas and the Flint community for all of their contributions to the University
of Michigan.
Annual Report of Investments
Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that the goal of the annual investment report is
to provide a context for evaluating the decisions that the Board of Regents will confront
during the coming year. He noted that the year ended June 30, 2001, had been a difficult
one, but that the University had managed to limit the loss of capital during the economic
downturn. Executive Vice President Kasdin emphasized that the Board of Regents retains
all authority with respect to the investment portfolio, including asset allocation and the
hiring of investment managers, and it consults with the Investment Advisory Committee
semi-annually. He called on Erik Lundberg, the University's chief investment officer.
Mr. Lundberg gave a presentation about the University's investment policies and
portfolio. He noted that investment activities are governed by a set of guiding principles
set forth by the Regents. These principles include a reliance on external investment
management; a long term horizon and equity orientation; a commitment to alternative
assets; a spending rule that insulates the operating funds from the markets; and relying on
total return without regard to source of income.
As of June 30, 2001, the University's assets totaled $5.4 billion, divided into
endowment funds ($3.614 billion); the University Investment Pool ($1.364 billion);
Veritas (reserves of the University's wholly-owned insurance company) ($156.5
million); and M-Care ($125.9 million). Mr. Lundberg displayed a slide illustrating the
growth of the endowment funds from $0.1 billion to $3.6 billion over the past 20 years.
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that about half of the endowment is in the
health system and that the endowment is distributed unequally among the University's
schools and colleges.


69




October Meeting, 2001


Mr. Lundberg reviewed the various features of the endowment portfolio, beginning
with the asset allocation of the $3.6 billion Long Term Portfolio, which consists of
alternative assets (26%), domestic equities (24%), fixed income securities (21%),
international equities (14%), absolute return investments (14%), and cash equivalents
(1%). Within the alternative assets category, he reviewed the asset allocation (real
estate, private equity, venture capital, energy, and distressed debt). He also compared a
model portfolio of an ideal asset allocation mix with the University's actual asset
allocation portfolio.
Mr. Lundberg then compared the portfolio's returns for Fiscal Year 2000-2001
(-5.5%) with various benchmarks. He noted that the University's returns outperformed
all of the benchmarks, and he commented on the specific performance and benchmark
comparisons for each asset class. He pointed out that the University's broad
diversification across all asset classes helped to limit the extent of its negative returns
compared with the benchmarks and noted that marketable securities had performed well
compared to the rest of the portfolio.
Over the long run, he noted, the University's investment portfolio has produced very
strong returns of 15.6% over the past 5 years. This exceeds the performance of the top
quartile of Cambridge Associates survey of about 200 endowments.
Mr. Lundberg then reviewed the performance of the University Investment Pool
(UIP), which consists of the fixed income investments of the University's construction
funds and working capital that will be used for designated purposes over the next 3 to 5
years and is valued at $1.4 billion. He noted that the UIP had underperformed the
benchmark by a small margin for one year and for three years. He then reviewed the
performance of Veritas and of M-Care.
In conclusion, Mr. Lundberg commented that the outlook for the future is for difficult
and volatile markets for the near term, but over the longer term, more normal conditions
will return and investors will be rewarded for prudent risk-taking. The University's
approach in this environment will be to continue to pursue a coherent and diversified
investment strategy, to focus on the long term, and to seek to generate positive relative
and absolute returns.
In response to a question from Regent Newman, Executive Vice President Kasdin
said that compared to other universities during the past year, the University was in the
third quartile. The goal is to be in the second quartile over the long term.
Consent Agenda
Minutes.  Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the
September 20, 2001 regular meeting and the September 28, 2001 special meeting.
Reports. Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted reports of Plant Extension,
Human Resources and Affirmative Action, and the Regents Report on Non-competitive
Purchases over $5,000 from Single Sources, June 21, 2001-September 21, 2001.
Regarding the Plant Extension Report, he noted that the Burton Tower renovation has
been completed in a spectacular fashion.
Litigation Report. The Regents received the Litigation Report.

Established for September 1-September 30, 2001. He noted that research expenditures
for the first quarter of the year are 12.8% higher than for the same period the previous
year and research awards are up 65%, resulting in $120 million more during the first
quarter of this year than the first quarter a year ago. The awards are distributed broadly

five-year plan for the campus. He also described a collaborative grant recently received
by his campus in the area of organ transplantation.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas commented that the Regents and
president had received gifts of CD recordings of the Flint Chamber Singers and the Flint
Gospel Choir.
MSA Report. MSA president Matt Nolan referred to the monthly MSA report in
the agenda and noted that MSA has planned a ballot initiative seeking approval to
increase the student fee by $1.00, to $6.63 per student. If approved, the additional
income of $73,000 will be earmarked specifically for funding of student groups. He also
commented that a major focus of his presidency will be gaining approval of creating a
"fall study break" by replacing classes on the Monday and Tuesday of the third week of
October with study days. To partially compensate for the reduction in class time, the
proposal also includes starting classes on the Tuesday after Labor Day instead of the
Wednesday after Labor Day. Finally, he noted that students have a strong desire to
participate in a significant way in the presidential search.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted for adoption three
retirement memoirs.
Charles J. Krause, M.D., professor of otorhinolaryngology, retired from active
faculty status on June 30, 2001, after a highly productive career.
A native   of Iowa, Dr. Krause earned his B.A. and M.D. degrees from the State
University of Iowa in 1959 and 1962, respectively. He was an intern at Philadelphia
General Hospital from 1962-63, and from 1963-65 he served at the 3510th USAF
Hospital at Randolph Air Force Base. He then undertook residency training at the
University of Iowa from 1965-69, and from 1969-77 Dr. Krause was a faculty member in
the Department of Otolaryngology and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University of Iowa.
He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1977 as professor of otorhinolaryngology
and chair of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology and served as chair until 1992. In


82




October Meeting, 2001


1986 Dr. Krause was named assistant dean for clinical affairs at the Medical School and
chief of clinical affairs at the University of Michigan Hospitals. He was appointed senior
associate dean for clinical affairs at the Medical School in 1992. He served as senior
associate hospital director for medical affairs from 1995-96 and returned to clinical
practice in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology in 1996.
Dr. Krause served with distinction as a clinician, faculty member, and senior
hospital administrator. He was regularly listed as one of the best doctors in America and
was widely sought after nationally and internationally as a speaker. His clinical expertise
focused on head and neck cancer and facial plastic reconstructive surgery. He served as
president of the American Board of Otolaryngology, the American Academy of
Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, the American Academy of Facial Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery, and the American Society for Head and Neck Surgery.
In addition to his clinical work, Dr. Krause was extremely active in education in the
humanities. He established the Barbara and Charles Krause Lectureship in Humanities in
Medicine in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology prior to his retirement. Dr. Krause
was a staunch supporter of cultural diversity.  In 1992 he established the first
departmental diversity committee and in 1999 was awarded the Harold R. Johnson
Diversity Award for his contributions to the promotion of cultural diversity in the
medical center.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated service
by naming Charles J. Krause professor emeritus of otorhinolaryngology.
Lee H. Somers, Ph.D., lecturer and associate research scientist in the Department of
Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences, College of Engineering, assistant professor of
kinesiology, Division of Kinesiology, and diving safety coordinator in the Department of
Occupational Safety and Environmental Health, retired from active faculty status on
August 31, 2001.
Professor Somers received his B.S. (1961) and M.S. (1965) degrees from the
University of Illinois and his Ph.D. degree in 1969 from the University of Michigan. He
joined the faculty of the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences as a
lecturer and associate research scientist in 1969.
Professor Somers is an internationally recognized expert in underwater technology
education and research, diving accident management and analysis, and scientific diving
education and research methods. He is the author of numerous publications on diving,
and his work in the area of mixed gas diving, especially the use of enriched air nitrox, has
been a major contribution to the diving community.
A hallmark of Professor Somer's activities has always been the active involvement
of students. He has also maintained an ongoing service program to provide information
to citizens, diving instructors, and law enforcement agencies on diving issues. Professor
Somers has served on numerous national and international boards and committees.
The Regents now salute this dedicated researcher and educator for his many years of
service by naming Lee H. Somers associate research scientist emeritus and assistant
professor emeritus of kinesiology.
John W. Thomas, Ph.D., professor of health management and policy, retired from
active faculty status on May 31, 2001, after a productive career as teacher and
researcher.


83




ct ber Meeting, 20I1


Professor Thomas earned his B.M.E. degree from Georgia Institute of Technology in
1965 and his M.B.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in 1971 and
1977, respectively. He joined the faculty of the School of Public Health as an assistant
professor in 1977 and was promoted to associate professor in 1984 and professor in
1993.
Professor Thomas' most important contributions to the field of health policy and
management have been in the area of risk-adjustment. In a 1983 paper, he and his
colleagues argued that capitation payments for the then new Medicare HMO program
could lead to serious problems both with overpayment and denial of access unless the
payments were risk-adjusted for patients' health status. Within two years, major funding
was being provided for research that would define appropriate methods for determining
health status risk-adjustments for HMO capitation payments. In the mid-1980s Professor
Thomas conducted two comparative evaluations of methodologies for measuring the
effects of patients' differing severity levels on hospital care costs. His much-cited results
provided the first objective information on the relative value of the various commercial
risk-adjustment options then available.
In the early 1990s, quality of medical care emerged as a major policy issue. In a
1993 paper, Professor Thomas was one of the first researchers to warn that risk-adjusted
measures of hospital outcomes might not be yielding valid information on hospital
performance. Then, in a series of papers in the mid-1990s, he provided definitive
evidence that one commonly-cited measure, risk-adjusted readmission rate, was
completely useless as an indicator of hospital quality. A 1999 publication showed that
risk-adjusted mortality rates lacked the inherent sensitivity and specificity needed to
serve as indicators of hospital quality.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming John W. Thomas professor
emeritus of health management and policy.
Memorials. Vice President Tedesco submitted a memorial statement for Harold K.
Jacobson, the Jesse Siddal Reeves Professor of Political Science in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts and senior research scientist in the Center for Political
Studies.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness the
death on August 13, 2001, of Harold K Jacobson, the Jesse Siddal Reeves Professor of
Political Science in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and senior research
scientist in the Center for Political Studies. Professor Jacobson was a man of many parts. He
was an accomplished and skilled administrator who had been chair of the Department of
Political Science, director of the Center for Political Studies, acting director of the Institute
for Social Research, and interim associate vice president for international affairs.
His extraordinary service record extended well beyond the confines of the University.
In 1995, he received the Award for International Science Cooperation of the American
Association for Advancement of Science. He was a beloved teacher at all levels, a fact
recognized by his receipt of the University's Amoco Good Teaching Award and the
Excellence in Education Award. He supervised scores of dissertations and prepared graduate
students superbly for the time when, as young faculty members, they would be doing research
without a mentor. For years, he taught the core proseminar in world politics. In addition to
undergraduate courses in international organization, he taught thousands of undergraduates
over the years in the introductory course in world politics, Political Science 160.


84




October Meeting, I201


Professor Jacobson was also a prolific scholar. He authored, edited, or co-edited a
dozen books on American foreign policy, international organization and law, and global
environmental policy. His first monograph concerning Soviet behavior in the economic and
social organs of the United Nations was a standard source on Soviet behavior in international
organizations. His textbooks in American foreign policy were widely adopted. His book on
the nuclear test ban treaty, co-authored with Eric Stein of the University of Michigan Law
School, received the University of Michigan Press award for the best book the UM Press had
published in the year the book came out. He and his former colleague, Michel Oksenberg,
produced an important study of China's growing involvement in the world economy. His last
book was a major volume co-edited with Edith Brown Weiss titled Engaging Countries:
Strengthening Compliance with International Environmental Accords. When Professor
Jacobson died, he and Charlotte Ku of the American Society of International Law were on the
verge of completing a project that addressed the crucial issue of the democratic accountability
of interventions under the auspices of international organizations.
Professor Jacobson's death has left a huge hole in all of our lives. He will be
remembered, of course, for his professional accomplishments, but mostly, he will be
remembered for who he was and how he did what he did. We all will miss him enormously.
Degrees. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the final degree lists for
the May and August 2001 commencements and changes to previously approved degree
lists.
Approval of Consent Agenda. On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by
Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that officers from the Department of
Public Safety have been experiencing extraordinary stresses during the past several
weeks, and urged members of the University community to offer their support.

Executive Vice President Kasdin informed the Regents of the sale of 840 acres of
vacant land in Harris Township, Menominee County, Michigan, from the estate of Helen F.
Weber. The sale price of $300,000 was above the appraised value.
UMHHC Cardiology Procedures Unit Replacement Project
Executive Vice President Kasdin informed the Regents that a certificate of need
application had been submitted to the Michigan Department of Consumer and Industry
Services for replacement of a catheterization laboratory in conjunction with the UMHHC
Cardiology Procedures Unit Replacement Project.

approved two license agreements with DermaCo to practice and commercialize inventions
developed by University of Michigan faculty members John J. Voorhees, Gary J. Fisher,
and Sewon Kang for research sponsored in whole or part by Johnson & Johnson (J&J).
Because Drs. Voorhees, Fisher, and Kang are also partial owners of and consultants to
DermaCo Inc., these agreements fall under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.
The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:


86




October Meeting, 2001


1.   Parties to the agreements are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
DermaCo Inc.
2.   Licensing terms include:

Murphy, citizen, on student housing for the Flint Campus and community outreach in the City
of Flint.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Audit Report and Discussion
Executive Vice President Kasdin introduced University of Michigan staff members
who had assisted in preparation of the audit report. He also commented on the upcoming
retirement of Fred White following 26 years of service and acknowledged his many
contributions over the years. A round of applause followed.
Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that he has asked the auditors to examine
two auxiliary activities each year in an attempt to ensure that all facets of the University
move towards best practices; this year's studies were done on the University of Michigan
Press and Student Publications. Comments and responses on these audits will be
reported next month; they have no impact on the University's overall financial health.
The following PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) personnel introduced themselves:
Jack McCarthy, the executive partner in charge of the firm's University of Michigan
engagement and leader of the firm's higher education practice; Darrell Burks, the overall
engagement partner; and George Johnson of George Johnson and Co., joint venture
partner. A handout was distributed as a companion to the presentation.
Mr. McCarthy stated that PWC had issued an unqualified opinion on the financial
statements and on each of the units that make up the University, which include the Board
in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, the Hospitals and Health Centers, Veritas
Insurance Corporation, and the Michigan Health Corporation. Separate reports were
issued for the Alumni Association, the William Davidson Institute, and the University
Musical Society; the report for M-Care will be submitted in February following the close
of its fiscal year in December. He reported that no material misstatements or illegal acts
were noted and that the audits did not disclose any material deficiencies in the
University's internal control structure.
He noted that the University had adopted several new standards promulgated by the
Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) in advance of the required date, which
was a significant undertaking and demonstrated the University's leadership in this area.
He reported that as a result of the audit procedures performed, there are no matters which
came to PWC's attention that would require further communication or action by the
University's management.


88




Octo ber Meeting,  I1


Mr. McCarthy reviewed each of the required communications to the institution's
governing board that are mandated per generally accepted auditing standards. He noted

October Meeting, 2001


Interim President
Regent Deitch commented that President Bollinger had been offered and had accepted
the presidency of Columbia University. He said that "working with you has been a great
pleasure and a great honor. You have done a wonderful job. We wish you were staying,
and we wish you good luck and Godspeed in your new position."
He observed that now it was time to move on and build on the accomplishments of
President Bollinger and the executive officers, deans, and faculty and work "with speed
and thoughtfulness" to elect a new president. The first order of business in that process is
to choose an interim president. Regent Deitch nominated B. Joseph White as interim
president, effective January 1, 2002. He noted that Professor White is the former dean of
the School of Business Administration, Wilbur K. Pierpont Collegiate Professor of
Leadership in Management Education, and Professor of Business Administration. Regent
Newman seconded the motion.
Statement by Regent McGowan
Regent McGowan made the following statement:
"I greatly regret the loss to this University represented by Lee
Bollinger's departure. As president, he has certainly led, putting in place both
people and programs that illuminate our values. The new leadership will be
asked to commit to advancing those decisions that he and we have made over
the past several years. It's been a pure pleasure for me to serve on this board
with Lee as president. Over the course of my own professional life I have
worked with a few wise and great leaders who are also thoughtful and kind
people. This man ranks high among them.
But we as a University and as a board must today begin the processes of
selecting an interim president and designing a search process for a new and
excellent president. I am pleased and not surprised that we have in Joe White
an individual on this campus who is clearly well-prepared to step in and serve
as our interim president. We have many distinguished academic leaders among
our current and past deans, and he is certainly among them. His contributions
as dean of the School of Business Administration over two five-year terms
extended well beyond the responsibilities of that office. He is greatly respected
among the other deans and members of the faculty, and many speak of his
commitment to this University, to his pragmatic wisdom, and to his ability to
motivate thoughtful discussion. These abilities in an interim president will
serve Michigan well.
What concerns me deeply, however, is the proposal to depart from our
long-standing established precedent of selecting as interim president someone
who had no intention of seeking to become president beyond the interim period.
Professor White would like to reserve into the future his decision on whether or
not to become a candidate, and to me this raises two important issues. First of
all, over the next several months, the interim president must be fully engaged
with the responsibilities and tough decisions that we expect of a chief
executive. Real progress at Michigan must be made. Decisions should be
made forthrightly and courageously, and they must be universally understood


90




"ctqober Meetinitg, 200I1I


to advance the lofty goals of a great university. Second, this proposal could
seriously compromise the credibility of our selection process. The design of
our search process must be fully credible to the University community, and this
can occur only if we create the largest possible pool of excellent candidates.
We have been advised that in any presidential selection process, the
best candidates are not volunteers, and our effort must be 95% recruitment and
5% selection. As we have seen from search processes across the country,
academic officers at one university actively seeking to leave another university
expose themselves to considerable risks.  Their loyalties to their existing
institutions can be called into question, and their candidacies may destabilize
their positions of leadership on their own campuses. Likewise, potential
candidates from within the University must have the maximum incentive to
apply.
We must do nothing to limit the candidate pool when we should be
drawing from the very best and brightest both outside and within the
University. The next president of this university must emerge from a process
that is credible to all concerned: faculty, staff students, alumni. And in the
first instance, that is possible only if it is credible to the potential candidates
themselves. I believe the presence of an interim president who is also a
candidate for the permanent position will have a chilling effect on the entry of
many outstanding candidates.
The selection process that we went through five years ago was not only
exhaustive, but it was exhausting. It took some personal toll on all of us who
went through it. I would hope it could be shorter this time around. But an
open, nation-wide search for the best possible president did, I am convinced,
produce the best possible president. I am proud to have played a part in that
success; the University of Michigan deserves no less.
For these reasons I will vote against the proposal to select as interim
president someone who has not ruled out the possibility of seeking the
presidency itself I hope my fellow Regents, Professor White, and the rest of
the University community will understand that my position is based on
conviction but not on any concern about his abilities to do this job."
Statement by Regent Maynard
Regent Maynard made the following statement:
"This will not be the last time I will have a chance to thank Lee for his
five years of presidency. I just want to say that you've given this University
leadership and vision, and you will be very missed.
My no vote today will not be a reflection of my opinion of Dean White. I
have the highest respect for him and know that he has the skills and talents to
ably serve the University. And I have had the opportunity during the last few
years to serve with him as a member of the Ginsberg Center Board, and I have
been very impressed with the work you've done on that board. My no vote is
rather a belief that our presidential search would be a better one if our interim


91




October Meeting, 2001


president might not be a candidate for the interim position, and Dean White
has not yet decided whether he will or will not seek the permanent job.
I experienced the search on the Flint campus and believe that there was a
negative impact on that campus when the interim head sought also the
permanent appointment. I have also listened to those much more experienced
in searches than I who say that our ability to attract the best candidates can be
influenced negatively by our having an interim inside candidate. I know that
Dean White and my colleagues, as I, all support the most open and most
inclusive process in seeking a new president. My no vote reflects my wish that
there could be just one more element in that search process. Thank you."
Comments by Regent Deitch
Regent Deitch commented:
"The good news is that all eight of us recognize Dean White's enormous
talent and commitment to this institution and his ability to run it well.
Reasonable people can differ about the best way to accomplish a goal.
Replacing you, Lee, won't be easy, because you've been a wonderful president.
But the thing is, you've been the president of the greatest university in America,
which helps anyone who sits in that position. And I believe there is zero
empirical evidence that we will not be able to attract a good candidate pool
because we have elected an interim president who has not yet decided whether
he will be a candidate for the permanent position.
Everyone needs to remember that this is the University of Michigan, and
the privilege and the opportunity of sitting in the presidency of this university I
believe is such a compelling opportunity that there must be three or five women
or men in America, in the world, who would be willing to throw their hats in the
ring for this position.
Second, we live in a world where people are very glib. My interactions
with Joe White have shown that he is not a glib man. We talked about this
question of whether he would decide and declare that he would not be a
candidate for the permanent position, and he said, 'Mary and I simply haven't
decided.' He went on to say, 'We are people who make commitments carefully
and keep them faithfully.' And the meaning of that is this: It would have been
easy for Dean White to say he didn't want the position and then to have
lightening strike afew months later and have him change his mind.
What we are doing is starting this position with a 'what you see is what
you get' level of integrity and the future will take care of itself. We have said
we are committed to an inclusive, national search to seek out the best person to
replace Lee Bollinger, and we will do that.
In selecting Joe White, we are picking somebody who is perfectly
positioned to pick up Lee Bollinger's mantle. Joe White served as dean of one
of our important schools, one of our large schools, for ten years, with
enormous credibility and success. He had just now given up those duties and
was in the process of going back to teaching that he loved very much. So here
was a person who knows the University, who knows the players, who is


92




dcober Meeting, 200


committed to the goals, and who has the time and is willing to make the
commitment, and this is going to best keep the train running on time and
progress going forward. "
Regent Brandon stated, "I would like to completely and emphatically associate
myself with Regent Deitch. I think Joe White will do a fabulous job, and I think his
honesty and straightforward approach in the way he's dealt with this issue gives me a
great sense of comfort. And I also do not believe that the University of Michigan will
have difficulties finding highly qualified and interested candidates for the job of
president."
Regent Taylor said that "I join David in wanting to associate myself with the
remarks of Larry. And in addition, we're looking at an interim that will probably serve
for a period of six months or possibly longer. I believe that if at all possible, we should
have an interim president who has all of the characteristics â€”the background, the
education, the experience â€”to be the permanent president. And if you are lucky enough to
have such a person available, I just cannot understand why you would want to disqualify
that person from subsequent consideration. For all of those reasons, I think Joe White is
the right person, and I am happy that he is not making any decisions at this time."
Regent Newman associated herself with the remarks of Regents Deitch, Brandon,
and Taylor. She commented, "We set out to find the best possible interim president, and I
think we did that. Because of that, I agree with Regent Taylor. I would ask that Joe and
Mary make that decision in their own time. If and when they do, whatever they decide,
we will go through whichever process fits that decision. I look forward to working with
Joe. Joe, I'm thrilled that you agreed to do this, and we're very lucky that you had the
time to do it. We appreciate your giving up your sabbatical year and your preparation for
teaching to take the time off and interrupt this position."
Regent Deitch called the question. The vote was taken, and the motion to appoint B.
Joseph White as interim president was approved, with Regents Brandon, Deitch,
Horning, Newman, Taylor, and White voting in favor, and Regents Maynard and
McGowan opposed.
Regent McGowan moved that the appointment of Professor White as interim
president be considered unanimous. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was
approved.
Comments from President Bollinger
President Bollinger thanked the University and the Regents for permitting him to serve
as president during the past nearly five years. He noted that he had been a professor at the
University of Michigan for 26 years, and for 12 of those years had served in administration
as dean and then as president. He continued,
"What distinguishes this great public university from virtually all others
is the shared commitment among the faculty to be part of the highest
intellectual and artistic traditions and to bring that commitment to the
classroom and to the broader public. This is a truly remarkable achievement in
a democratic society, and it is a standing refutation of those... who have
argued that the highest culture could only survive in an aristocratic society.


93




October Meeting, 2001


This special commitment, however, is forever fragile and must be
continually nurtured over time. To be sure, not everyone can be expected to
perform at the highest level of intellectual and artistic creativity. Just like not
every student can be in the top half of the class. But it is critical that there be
a clear-sighted appreciation of quality, a yearning for it, an evident respect for
those in our midst who do achieve it, and a joy in being associated with it. It is
my most fervent hope for the University of Michigan that it will continue to
embrace and symbolize these characteristics, and I will leave with full
confidence that it will."
President Bollinger then recognized the contributions of the colleagues who have
served with him, especially "the extraordinary group of vice presidents and chancellors
who have come to serve this institution." He commented briefly on the contributions of
each of the vice presidents that has served during his tenure. He also thanked his wife,
Jean Magnano Bollinger, for her service to her contributions to the University and the
community.
Finally, President Bollinger noted that he had known Joe White for over a decade
and had served with him as a dean. "I know him as a loyal, knowledgeable, imaginative
administrator and member of this community. He likes high standards, he sets high
standards for himself, and he sets out in a determined way to meet them." He noted that
he had also come to know Joe and his wife, Mary, through their daughters, and through
that, he knows "that both he and Mary are very good people." He said he would do
everything he could to make the transition seamless, and that he was sure the University
would be exceptionally well-served by Dean White.
Comments by Joe White
A standing ovation followed and Professor White made the following comments:
"Thank you, Lee, for those kind remarks. This is a very memorable
moment for me and Mary. When we grew up in Kalamazoo the University of
Michigan seemed 10,000 miles away. It was a place where only the very best
had the opportunity to get the great education. Great health care was offered
to the comfort of so many people in our area. Great athletics that excited us
all. And it's fair to say that I accept and we accept this invitation from you
with a great sense of gratitude and with a measure of awe also.
I want to thank the Regents for your confidence. I also want to thank you
for your public commitment to conducting an open, thorough, inclusive search
for the next president of the University, because it's crucial to insure the very
best leadership for the institution that we love going forward. I want to thank
you, Lee, and Jean, for all you've done for our University. I simply couldn't
imagine a betterfive-year presidential term than you've provided. We're going
to miss you deeply, and you know that. Among your many accomplishments,
you've set a wonderful tone on campus: a tone of inclusion, a tone of
intellectual inquiry, a tone of arts appreciation, a tone of innovation. And I
publicly want to thank you so much and wish you the best in the years to come.
My responsibilities as interim president are very clear. To work with the
Regents, the executive officers, the other leaders of the university during a time


94




October Meeting, 2001


of transition to insure the continued excellence of our institution in all its
dimensions and also to demonstrate rock-solid commitment to the vital
initiatives that have been set in motion during Lee's presidency. Among these
are the life sciences, arts and culture, affirmative action and diversity, and the
upcoming fundraising campaign about which I have a great deal of enthusiasm.
I think we're going to do very well. Those are institutional commitments, and
our job working together will be to insure that we make measurable progress
on allfronts."
Dean White stated that he intends to dedicate his period of service as interim
president to the alumni of the University who died in the atrocities on September 11,
2001. He named the several victims he knew personally. He noted that "each of us has
sought since September 11 to find a way to serve our country during these difficult and
troubling times. The Regents have presented me with my way, and that is, to honor these
alums, all who were lost on September 11, by doing the very best job that I can to serve
the University that we and all of these alumni have loved so much over the years."
A round of applause followed.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at about 10:30 a.m. The
next meeting will take place November 15-16, 2001.

NOVEMBER MEETING, 2001


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, Novemb' er 15, 2001
The Regents convened at 1:40 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and
Taylor. Also present were Vice President Feagin, Vice President Harper, Executive
Vice President Kasdin, Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Mestas,
Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Provost and Vice
President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Chancellor Little was absent; Provost Simpson attended in his place. Regent White
participated in the meeting by phone.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and noted that the first item of
business would be the Annual Operating Requests to the state.
Annual Operating Request to the State for the Ann Arbor Campus for FY 2003
Interim Provost Tedesco expressed the University's gratitude to the governor, the
chairs of the appropriations committees, and the legislature for exempting education from
the recisions in the executive order announced last week. She said that the University
recognizes that the next two years will be difficult ones for the state and it is helpful to be
able to have an orderly planning process to prepare for them.
Interim Provost Tedesco observed that the key message and organizing principle of
the FY 2003 request is the same as it was for the 2002 request â€”consolidation and
continuing progress on the University's highest priorities. Resources will be focused on
the University's core missions and on a few vital initiatives, with the goal being to
weather the economic downturn without giving up excellence and minimizing any damage
that might occur.
Interim Provost Tedesco observed that Associate Provost Paul Courant has played
an important role in budgeting modeling and in the wide array of other concerns of the
provost's office, and that he would be addressing the board as well. She noted that the
requested 4% increase is the most modest from among the last five budget years. It
includes no funding for any special new initiatives and carries forward innovations in
undergraduate education, continued expansion and improvements in information
technology, and the Life Sciences Initiative.
She noted that the University is not being called upon to decrease its efforts on
behalf of teaching, research, or community service and outreach. The cost to the
University of performing its core missions does not decrease, she noted, and the
requested increase is far less than is needed to maintain momentum and to continue to
retain necessary faculty and support services. To maintain and enhance quality, it will be
necessary to redeploy existing resources from lower priority activities to those of higher
priority, as has been a regular practice in past years.
Interim Provost Tedesco noted that it is against these thematic budget parameters
that deans, directors, and other unit leaders are preparing their program directions, budget


103




November Meeting, 2()01


priorities, and reductions for next year. The provost and administration are working with
the academic leadership to ensure that regardless of the state budget, the budget process
for this year will position the University to be strong in the future, while serving students,
parents, taxpayers, and other stakeholders.
Interim Provost Tedesco emphasized that major academic projects, and the new
construction and renovation projects that support them, will proceed. There will be no
reduction in the budgetary commitments to the Life Sciences Initiative, and undergraduate
education and information technology will have ample resources for growth and
innovation. She introduced Associate Provost Paul Courant.
Associate Provost Courant again expressed the University's gratitude to the state for
exempting education from the recent set of budget cutbacks. He enumerated a number of
steps the University has taken to reduce costs, including renegotiating the contract with
Ameritech for local phone service (a savings of $1 million); purchasing electricity from
Engage Energy ($1.3 million savings); using prime vendor contracts to reduce the
purchase price on a wide variety of items ($3 million savings); and improving
management of accounts receivables and credit card business (more than $1.7 million in
immediate payments).
In the academic units, many schools and colleges are reducing their faculty strength
and all of them are redeploying faculty towards areas of increasing enrollment and away
from areas of declining enrollment, thereby increasing the number of students being taught
per faculty member. They are also eliminating or consolidating staff positions and are
improving their purchasing and management practices and providing incentives for
working more efficiently.
Associate Provost Courant noted that more specific examples of cost cutting
measures are detailed in the letter to the state, and due to the decentralized nature of the
institution, even more, less visible activities are occurring in the individual units due to
incentives from central administration.
Associate Provost Courant observed that cuts will have to be made in the FY 2003
budget. The key consideration will be in making sure that expenditures are reduced in
areas where the University is ready and able to continue to be effective with less being
done. That means being explicit about the valuable activities that are being cut back so
that activities of even greater value can be maintained and enhanced. He noted that in the
coming months the provost would be reporting to the board in some detail about progress
in these areas and will be seeking the advice of the board on how best to proceed.
Associate Provost Courant observed that it had been a pleasure working with
Interim Provost and Vice President Tedesco during the past several months, and he
looked forward to working with her in the future.
Annual Operating Request to the State, University of Michigan-Dearborn
Speaking on behalf of the University of Michigan-Dearborn campus, Provost Simpson
commented that the Dearborn budget is built on a set of strategic initiatives identified as
being important for the long-term growth of the University of Michigan-Dearborn and its
relationships with the community. There are four components to these initiatives: 1)
Extending and strengthening undergraduate education; 2) expanding graduate education; 3)


104




November Meeting, 2001


furthering the incorporation of technology into the curriculum; and 4) building new and
stronger relationships with the community.
The campus's request has two major components: the strategic addition of faculty
and strengthening the technology base.  The overall request is for an additional
$1,361,900, an increase of about 4%.
Annual Operating Request to the State, University of Michigan-Flint
Chancellor Mestas thanked the governor and legislative leaders for their support of
education in difficult economic times. He noted that the budget request contains a particular
emphasis on technology, in concert with the need to upgrade the technological infrastructure
of the campus, and to facilitate the offering of more online courses and degree programs.
Another budget emphasis is for operating expenses and programmatic expenses associated
with the opening of the new William S. White Building. The support of academic
initiatives and programs and enhancing outreachinitiatives are other areas of emphasis. He
noted the critical role that the University of Michigan-Flint plays with the city of Flint.
Regarding cost-cutting gmeasures, Chancellor Mestas noted that the campus continues
to undertake managerial efficiencies. In addition he has asked campus leaders to examine
the offerings of each unit and to identify areas in which resources can be reallocated. The
Flint campus is also attempting to raise funds from sources other than state appropriation
in an effort to expand its funding base.
Comments fro   President Bollinger
President Bollinger noted that two faculty members had recently received prestigious
awards:  Professor Bright Sheng (MacArthur Foundation Fellowship), and Sabine
MacCormack (the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's new Distinguished Achievement
Award for scholars in the humanities) and commented on other noteworthy achievements by
University faculty members and recent newsworthy events involving the University of
Michigan.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the October
18-19, 2001 meeting.
RFeports, Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted reports of Investment, Plant
Extension, and Human Resources and Affirmative Action.
Iitigationl Report. The Regents received the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the Report of Projects
Established for October 1 - October 31, 2001. He noted that research expenditures for
the first four months of the year are about 14% higher than for the same period the
previous year. Regarding research awards, he noted that the number of awards is up 6%,
but the dollar amount has increased by 88%, resulting in $192 million more than during
the same period a year ago.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Omenn reported
that the Health System had just undergone an exhaustive accreditation visit from the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCO), and the Health System


105




November Meeting, 2001


had passed with an excellent score. He noted that hospital volumes are on budget, that
emergency room volumes continue to increase, and that strategic planning is moving
forward. He further commented on developments in the research and technology transfer
arenas.
Division of Student Affairs. No report was submitted.
University of Michigan-Dearborn.    Provost Simpson commented on recent
developments surrounding the Environmental Interpretive Center, and he reported on
several other items of interest. He noted that the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters
Building dedication would be held on December 6, 2001.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas reported that he had recently
addressed the Flint campus community about a number of issues, including the desire of
the University to move toward having student residences. He noted that two conditions
would have to be met in order to establish student residences: they would have to pay for
themselves with no subsidies from the University, and downtown area businesses would
have to cooperate by creating a "college town" atmosphere around the University
residences. He commented that an RFP had been issued for conducting a feasibility study
for the concept of building student residences.
MSA Report. MSA president Matt Nolan noted that students were in the midst of
an election for MSA representatives, which also includes a ballot initiative on whether to
increase student fees for funding student organizations. The other issue MSA has been
involved with is establishing a change in the academic calendar to provide a two-day,
Monday-Tuesday, fall break. He noted that MSA had done a great deal of research on
this issue and that he had been discussing it with members of the University
administration. Mr. Nolan reviewed the issues involved in the creation of a fall break
and stated that he expects to present an action request for consideration at the next
Regents' Meeting.
In response to questions, he noted that the reason for the desire to institute a fall
break was to alleviate stress levels among students during the time of midterm exams. He
noted that every Ivy League institution, and 19 of the top 25 universities nationwide, have
fall breaks, and that MSA believes a fall break would improve overall academic quality.
Regent White suggested that discussions be held with the Athletic Department
regarding the scheduling of athletic events and/or practices during the fall break. Mr.
Nolan agreed, and also noted that SACUA and the deans have all been consulted.

Depression Center will enhance the University's clinical and health services research to
compliment the laboratory research activities of the Mental Health Research Institute. This
will be the first such center of its kind.
Regent McGowan moved approval of the establishment of the University of
Michigan Depression Center. Regent Maynard seconded the motion.
Regent Deitch commented that establishment of the Depression Center is "a very big
deal," and predicted that in the years to come, it will be an entity that the Regents will be
extremely proud of.
Regent Newman expressed agreement with Regent Deitch' s comments, and pointed
out that the proposal is extremely timely and very necessary.

DECEMBER MEETING, 2001


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, December 13, 2001
The Regents convened at 1:40 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Bollinger and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Homing, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and
Taylor. Also present were Vice President Feagin, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice
President Kasdin, Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Little,
Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President Rudgers, Interim
Provost and Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent White participated in the meeting by phone.
President Bollinger called the meeting to order and called on Regent Horning.
Resolution in Honor of Field Hockey Team
Regent Homing called members and coaches of the field hockey team to the podium.
All were introduced, and Regent Horning presented them with the following resolution:
RegentZets sResolu08tio
The Regents of the University of Michigan applaud the field hockey
team for winning the national championship, becoming Michigan's first
women is team to achieve that honor.
The team's 2-0 victory over the top-ranked Maiyland Terrapins at the
National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) finals on November 18 capped
a season in which players and coaches worked together to overcome adversity
and injuries. During the regular season, the team had held opponents to just
six shots per game while posting an 18-5 record. Michigan's victory in the
NCAA finals was the result of outstanding goaltending and an all-around
defensive efbirt. With the win, the Wolverines became the first team to record a
shutout in the championship game since 1996, the first Big Ten conference
team to win the title since 1986, and only the second midwestern school to win
the title since the beginning of the championship more than 25 years ago.
The Regents salute Michigan's national championship women's field
hockey team, Coach Marcia Pankratz, and assistants Nancy Cox, Ashley
Reichenbach, and Tracey Fuchs for their inspiring and history-making season.
Hail to the victors valiant!
A standing ovation followed, after which Ms. Reichenbach thanked the Regents and
said the team was "thrilled" to be "bringing the 51st national championship home for
Michigan."
Resolution in Honor of President Bollinger
President Bollinger called on Regent Maynard. Regent Maynard commented about
President Bollinger's passion for excellence in higher education and the "wonderful, great


123




December Meeting, 2001


energy he had in pursuing that excellence." She noted that four resolutions had recently
been introduced and approved by state and federal legislative bodies, and she requested
that these be made part of the Regents Proceedings (See Appendix, 151). These are from
the U.S. Senate (Senator Carl Levin), the U.S. House of Representatives (Representative
Lynn Rivers), the Michigan State Senate (Senator John Schwarz), and the Michigan House
of Representatives (Representative Christopher Kolb). Regent Maynard then read the
following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend and express
their gratitude to President Lee C. Bollinger fobr his inspiring
leadership, which has engaged both faculty and students and has
brought the Universitv to a position of enviable strength and vitality.
President Bollinger, who served as the University's twelfth
president from 1997 to 2001, has sharpened Michigan's academic focus
and worked to improve the educational experience fior all students,
particularly undergraduates. The ambitious Life Sciences Initiative,
launched early in his presidency, is expanding research opportunities
for students and positioning Michigan to contribute in significant wa2ys
to this extraordinary scientific revolution.  President Bollinger,
architect of the University's legal defense of its admissions policies,
has led the national debate regarding the role of affirmative action in
higher education.
His ejforts to promote the role of public universities in the arts
and humanities have generated exciting new partnerships, most notablv
Micigan's collaboratiotn with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and
plans for the Walgreen Drama Center and the Arthur Miller Theatre.
The Regents also gratejully acknowledge many other milestones during
his presidency, including a new campus master plan, renewed interest
in the University's history, extraordinary growth in research funding,
increased voluntary financial support, establishment of the Gerald R.
Ford School of Public Policy, andfour national intercollegiate athletic
championships.
With appreciation and admiration, the Regents congratulate and
extend best wishes to Lee C. Bollinger in his new role as president of
Columbia Universi:.
A standing ovation followed. President Bollinger noted that there had been ample
opportunities already for him to thank his wife, Jean, the executive officers, the people
who work in central administration, the Regents, faculty, staff, and students. So he chose
not to diminish his previous comments, and to just say "Thank you."
President Bollinger called on Regent Deitch.


124




December Meeting, 2001


Meeting of Presidential Search Committee
Regent Deitch moved that the Board of Regents convene as a committee of the whole
for the purpose of serving as a Presidential Search Committee. Regent Newman seconded
the motion, and it was passed unanimously.
Appointment of Presidential Search Advisory Committee. Regent Deitch stated
that the purpose of meeting as a Presidential Search Committee was to put forth the names
of 15 "terrific University citizens" to serve under the leadership of Dean Earl Lewis as
the Presidential Search Advisory Committee (PSAC). He noted that the more than 200
people considered for membership on the PSAC came from a number of sources on all
three campuses and that self-nominations were also considered. As a group, he noted
that the faculty members chosen are broadly representative of the academic community
and the important academic initiatives underway. He thanked Dean Lewis, chair of the
PSAC, and Vice President Tedesco, for their work in putting together the committee.
Regent Deitch observed that the committee is intellectually diverse, occupationally
diverse, and culturally diverse, and as such, is a perfect group from which to draw advice
as the Regents pursue their constitutional duty to "fill the very big shoes" left by President
Bollinger. He moved that the following individuals be appointed to the Presidential
Search Advisory Committee:
Susan E. Alcock, Arthur F. Thurnau Professor in the College of Literature, Science,

Comments from President Bollinger
President Bollinger commented on several items related to construction of campus
buildings and maintenance of facilities. He noted that over time, the University has, with
the full support of the Board of Regents, made sure that it does not fall behind in caring for
the campus. He observed that during his administration, approximately $700 million has
been invested in the maintenance of existing physical properties, two of the most prominent
of these being the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies Building and Hill
Auditorium.
President Bollinger noted that it has been recognized for a long time that extensive
renovation is needed at Hill Auditorium, and although much effort was put into
fundraising to accomplish this, a good deal of the funding will come from University
sources.
President Bollinger pointed out other renovation efforts that had been accomplished
during the past few years: Burton Tower, the Dana Building, the Perry Building, Lane
Hall, the School of Dentistry, West Hall, Mason and Haven Halls (including the
"Fishbowl"), and the LSA Building.
New construction projects initiated over the past 5 years include the Bioengineering
Building, the UM-Dearborn CASL Building, the UM-Flint William S. White Building, the
Life Sciences Institute and other life sciences buildings, and the Biomedical Sciences
Research Building. He noted that the proposed Ford School of Public Policy Building
will be the realization of a long-standing dream for this school.
President Bollinger noted that the Walgreen Drama Center, which includes the
Arthur Miller Theatre, is a complicated project for which significant funding has been
raised. However, a number of decisions still need to be made regarding the design of the
theater, related to the kind of presentations that it will be used for. Other decisions
revolve around the facilities needs for the Drama Department, which is currently housed


126




December Meeting, 2001


in the Frieze Building. He noted that the creation of a complex of theaters in the vicinity
of the Power Center is the right thing to do, because it provides density for arts venues.
Estimates of funding needs have been done, and these need to be evaluated in light of
conflicting priorities.
He noted that the School of Public Health has long needed new facilities and has
held the highest priority in the University's capital outlay request. However, it appears
that there will be no capital outlay in the near future, so decisions will need to be made
about alternative means to address these needs.
Comments from Executive Vice President Kasdin
Governmental Accounting Standards Board. Executive Vice President Kasdin
called attention to a letter from the chairman of the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board, stating that the board was impressed by the University's ability to meet the new
reporting standards earlier than most universities in the country and in such an outstanding
fashion. He pointed out that this lends support to the high quality work of the University
staff who work in financial operations.
Supply Chain lManagement. Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that the
University has made great strides in the past few years in supply chain management,
including the identification of partnerships to continue these efforts. He noted that the
University has joined a Big Ten consortium for purchasing to help the Big Ten in reducing
its purchasing costs. He called attention to a letter distributed at the meeting describing a
new purchasing consortium that has emerged from the Life Sciences Corridor, in
conjunction with Michigan State University, the Van Andel Institute, and Wayne State
University to try to identify areas in which costs can be reduced by purchasing jointly.
The type of goods being purchased through this consortium are ones that none of the
institutions on their own would require in sufficient volume to receive a volume discount.
But developing the consortium has yielded a way to reduce costs.
Environmental Stewarsahip. Executive Vice President Kasdin explained that the
University has deliberately chosen to use the term  "stewardship," rather than
"sustainability," because the latter term has developed politically-laden connotations.
Doing such a presentation on an annual basis allows the University to focus both on its
past progress and on upcoming challenges in these areas, which are very important to the
University. He pointed out that the biggest challenge is changing behavior. This
presentation focuses the University community on the need to work together to save
energy, recycle, and reduce pollution levels.
He introduced Mr. Terrance Alexander, director of the University's Office of
Occupational Safety and Environmental Health, who gave a presentation on the
University's environmental stewardship efforts. Mr. Alexander noted that although many
of the University's programs were started to ensure regulatory compliance, today these
programs go well beyond compliance and are considered the right way to do business,
often a means of saving money, and part of people's jobs. He provided an update on the
University's conservation measures, pollution prevention, recycling activities,
sustainable design, and salt/sand reduction programs.
He noted that implementation of the Energy Star building upgrades is ahead of
schedule and that these programs save the University about 25 million kilowatt hours


127




December Meeting 2001


annually. Buildings use 20%-30% less energy after the upgrades, and there is typically a
three-to-five-year payback period.
An initiative has been developed for 2001-2002 energy conservation efforts aimed
at modifying behavior, titled "Making a Greener Maize and Blue." It's objective is to
raise the level of awareness of energy reduction strategies campus-wide to reduce energy
consumption. Reducing utility usage by just one percent could save the University
$400,000-$600,000 per year; and additional savings would be possible if participation
rates can be improved. Mr. Alexander also described the University's initiatives in
recycling of materials from lighting ballasts and fluorescent light bulbs, both of which are
more cost effective than disposal.
Mr. Alexander then described environmental stewardship efforts on the medical
campus. These include a successful chemical redistribution program through which
excess chemicals are collected from researchers and reused, reducing both the cost of
new materials and waste disposal; and replacement of the old incinerator with a new
steam sterilization system to manage the medical waste stream.
Other waste reduction processes throughout campus involve the use of micro-liter
quantities of chemicals in laboratories. Mr. Alexander also noted that the University has
been reducing mercury use on campus for a number of years and has recently
implemented a campus-wide campaign with the goal of becoming a "mercury-free
campus." To date, thousands of mercury-containing pieces of equipment have been
eliminated and more than 1,500 pounds of elemental mercury has been sent off-site to be
recycled.
Mr. Alexander described the University's efforts to reduce fertilizer, herbicide, and
insecticide use throughout campus in order to help protect the Huron River and to reduce
the use of salt and sand for de-icing. He also described recycling programs both on
central campus and within Michigan Stadium which have resulted in a 30% reduction of
the waste stream. He noted that 4.6 million pounds of paper and cardboard were
recycled last year alone.
He noted that Purchasing Services is promoting the use of "green" products and that
the University incorporates green features and storm water management systems into
building designs and during construction.
Mr. Alexander commented that the next challenge for the University in
environmental stewardship is to increase participation in existing conservation programs.
This will entail creative efforts for communicating to and engaging the community, and a
number of initiatives are underway, aimed at various segments of the campus.
President Bollinger observed that environmental concerns have been a high priority
for his administration, even though they have not received a lot of publicity. He said that
it is important that the staff who work in these areas are recognized for their efforts.
Following a three-minute break, President Bollinger turned to the next item on the
agenda.
Hill Auditorium Renewal Update
Executive Vice President Kasdin noted that the Regents had previously approved the
Hill Auditorium Renewal Project and the schematic design of the renovation. Given the


128




December Meeting, 2001


importance of this facility to the University and the community, it was decided to brief the
Regents about what the interior of the building will look like after it is completed. He
introduced Mike Quinn of Quinn Evans Architects.
Mr. Quinn observed that the general design of the renovation has moved ahead in
keeping with what was presented in June. He noted that the design goals are two-fold:
careful restoration of an important national, regional, and University landmark, and
complete upgrade of building systems while trying not to change the appearance of the
building. He reviewed the design, which includes exterior restoration and complete
reconstruction of the front plaza, new electrical system upgrades and replication of the
original lighting scheme. There will be a new heating and air conditioning system, and
Mr. Quinn noted that the design of this system had undergone extensive scrutiny by an
acoustical consultant so as to meet very specific acoustical standards. The building will
receive comprehensive life safety upgrades and will include many improvements
designed to serve the needs of the disabled community. There will also be a series of
patron amenity and comfort improvements, including new seating in the orchestra level,
improved circulation, and more than doubling of existing restroom facilities.
Mr. Quinn noted that every effort has been made to preserve and maintain the
renowned acoustic quality of Hill Auditorium and described improvements that will be
made to control noise within the facility. He then turned to illustrations of what the
building interior will look like when it is completed, including the lower lobby area, for
which funding has been provided since the last presentation in June. He noted that
extensive research had been done in an effort to recapture the original interior arts and
crafts color scheme and displayed samples of the color pallet that will be used.
Renditions of the completed interior from several different vantage points were also
displayed.
Regent Deitch commented that the plans are "fantastic." Executive Vice President
Kasdin thanked Julie Truettner, a staff member with an interest in historical preservation,
who has provided helpful guidance as the interior design process was undertaken.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved the Hill Auditorium Renewal revised budget of $38.6 million, and
authorized receiving bids and awarding construction contracts, providing that bids are
within the revised project budget.
Establishment of a Fall Study Break and Approval of Changes to Academic
Calendars for 2002-2003 and 2003-2004
Interim Provost Tedesco commented that MSA President Matt Nolan had given a
thorough explanation of this proposal at the last meeting and had continued to provide
information about its benefits since then. She noted that deans, associate deans, student
services administrators, and program planners had been consulted on the proposed changes,
and all agreed with MSA's analysis that the benefits â€”a reduction in student stress and
improvement in the quality of work â€”would far outweigh the necessary scheduling
adjustments. Senior Vice Provost Monts had also carefully reviewed the proposal, she
noted, and it had received enthusiastic endorsement from him and his staff. She reiterated
Vice President Harper's observations that the change would greatly facilitate first-year


129




December Meeting, 2001


students' transition to college life and would also increase the overall well-being for all
students.
Interim Provost Tedesco reported that at other institutions with fall study breaks
students usually travel home or stay on campus to study during this break period and she
cited statistics indicating that alcohol-related problems drop during fall break periods.
Approval of the fall study break would require changes in the already approved academic
calendars for 2002-2003 and 2003-2004. Finally, she noted that the average number of
fall term class days will actually increase following establishment of the fall break.
Regent McGowan moved establishment of a two-day fall study break and approval
of corresponding changes to the academic calendars for 2002-2003 and 2003-2004.
Regent Maynard seconded the motion and complimented Mr. Nolan on his thoroughness
and advocacy efforts. There being no further discussion, the vote was taken, and the
motion was approved unanimously.
Annual Report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA)
Professor Mojitaba Navvab was called to the podium to present the annual SACUA
report. He pointed out that in addition to the report, he had distributed memoranda to the
board stating SACUA's position on the proposed bylaw regarding the Life Sciences
Institute and on the proposed changes to the bylaws concerning the Board in Control of
Intercollegiate Athletics.
He gave a status report of SACUA's activities on the following issues: prescription
drug benefit changes; copyright policy clarification; electronic privacy; and teaching
principles and tenure guidelines. He also highlighted SACUA's concerns regarding
proposed bylaws changes pertaining to the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics
and the new bylaw regarding the Life Sciences Institute, and he requested that the votes
on these issues be delayed to a later date.
Professor Navvab commented that SACUA has begun preliminary discussions on
the issues of grade alteration policies; grievance procedure changes; faculty
composition/non-tenure track increases; procedures for handling allegations of faculty
misconduct; tuition reimbursement; and child care.
He thanked President Bollinger and Interim Provost and Vice President and
Secretary Tedesco for their support and attention to faculty concerns and noted that
SACUA looks forward to working with Interim President White and Interim Provost
Courant.

December Meeting, 2001


University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Omenn reported
that the expansion of primary care group practice sites has been very successful and that
the hospital is on track financially, although there are increasing stresses on nursing staff
due to staffing shortages and increased staffing demands. He noted that Dr. Michael
Mulholland has been recommended for appointment as chair of the Department of
Surgery.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper announced that the division
had been awarded a four-year, $280,000 "Child Care Access Means Parents in School"
(CCAMPIS) grant from the U.S. Department of Education. This grant will allow the
University to expand the pool of qualified child care providers near campus and in
student areas, especially those who serve infants and toddlers, providing additional hours
of care during times of peak demand.  It will also provide increased support to
undergraduate students from low income households. She noted that the grant is a
collaborative effort with the Department of Human Resources and Affirmative Action, the
Center for the Continuing Education of Women, and the Division of Student Affairs, and it
allows the University to continue to address the child care needs of the community.
Vice President Harper also praised the work of MSA's leadership team of Matt
Nolan and Jessica Cash, noting in particular their actions following the tragedy of
September 11, achieving funding for expanded evening hours in the recreation buildings,
and the successful fall study break proposal.
She also commented that the leaders of the Greek system have provided aggressive
leadership around issues of scholarship, safety, and service, and they have made many
changes to try to strengthen the Greek system.
Regent Maynard encouraged Vice President Harper and her colleagues to begin
thinking about how to provide for replacement of the grant funding once the grant has
ended.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little commented on the recent
dedication of the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters (CASL) Building and noted that it
was a "stupendous" event. He also read a statement from members of the University of
Michigan-Dearborn community on President Bollinger's leadership.
iniversity of o [ichigaln-Fint. Chancellor Mestas expressed holiday greetings from
the Flint campus.
MSA Report. MSA president Matt Nolan thanked President Bollinger for his
service as president and noted that he would be sorely missed. Mr. Nolan also expressed
thanks to the Regents for approving the fall break and for appointing him to the
Presidential Search Advisory Committee.  He thanked the University staff and
administrators who had provided invaluable assistance and guidance in pursuing the
establishment of the fall break.
Mr. Nolan commented that the $1.00 per term fee increase for the funding of student
organizations had been approved. He noted that MSA had recently passed resolutions
supporting environmental sustainability and urging the Regents to delay consideration of
proposed changes to the bylaws regarding the Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics. He distributed copies of the Michigan Student Assembly Semiannual Report
and introduced MSA Vice President Jessica Cash.


131




December Meeting, 2001


Ms. Cash expressed gratitude on behalf of the student body for establishment of the
fall study break. She commented that she hoped the publication of the semiannual report
would help alleviate the perennial problem of the short institutional memory of the
student government and enable future student leaders to understand and build upon past
achievements.

December Meeting, 2001


Memorials. Vice President Tedesco submitted a memorial statement for Patrick
Malloy, associate professor of kinesiology.
Bernard Patrick Maloy, associate professor of kinesiology in the Division of
Kinesiology, passed away peacefully on November 28, 2001, after a courageous battle
with cancer.
Professor Maloy received his B.A. degree in history from Wheeling College, his J.D.
degree from the University of Notre Dame, and his M.S. degree in sports administration from
The Ohio State University. He was a member of Alpha Sigma Nu (National Jesuit Honor
Society) and the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society.
His career began with a law practice in North Judson, Indiana, from 1972-83, where he
was the sole legal practitioner in a small, rural town. He concentrated in the areas of public
sector labor relations, secondary education law, and civil litigation. He has worked with the
Indiana School Board Association and the Indiana High School Athletic Association. He is
co-author of the Master Commissioners Bill enacted by the Indiana Legislature in 1978. A
career change enabled Professor Maloy to integrate his legal skills with his keen interest in
sports and athletics. After graduate studies, he worked in corporate management for MDS
Qantel, a computer company serving many teams of both the National Football League and
National Basketball Association as well as the athletic departments of major universities.
In 1986, Professor Maloy received an appointment at the University of Michigan in the
Division of Kinesiology, Department of Sports Management and Communication as an
assistant professor. In 1993, he was promoted to associate professor. He taught courses in the
legal aspects and management of sport and facility management. Clearly, Professor Maloy's
tenure at the University was the most stimulating and satisfying of his career. He loved
teaching and promoting excellence in analytic and writing skills to his students. He was known
as a caring professor, but one who highly challenged his students and took great care in
evaluating their work. According to Professor Maloy, the students were more challenging than
any jury he ever faced, but he obviously won their respect. The proof lies in his outstanding
teaching evaluations-a consistent median of 4.8 out of a possible 5.0. While at the University,
he received numerous honors including a State of Michigan Teaching Excellence Award and
an Academic Leadership Fellowship to the Committee on Institutional Cooperation.
His research interests included legal and public policy issues of sports and management
and liability issues of stadiums and arenas. He has published both as a sole author and in
collaboration with others. He has written three books, contributed several book chapters, and
published numerous articles in his field of expertise. He was affiliated with over fifteen
associations, and he served as a member of multiple editorial boards.
Most recently Professor Maloy served as a Faculty Mentor for the University of
Michigan Mentorship Program, as a member of the Ombuds Training Task Force, and as a
member of the Kinesiology Executive Committee. He previously served as a member of the
Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs, the University Residency Appeals
Committee, the Advisory Committee to the University of Michigan Safety and Security
Committee, the Seminar on Teaching Committee, the University of Michigan Experiential
Education Committee, and as an Ombuds for the Division of Kinesiology. He was a long-time
marshal at the commencement activities, and for many years he has actively helped the
Department of Athletics in their student recruitment activities.
Professor Maloy is survived by his wife of 32 years, Nora Alton Maloy, 2 sons, Michael
and Barney and their spouses Carolina and Jill; 2 brothers, Mark and John; 3 sisters, Tessie
Steffens, Mary Walker and Maggie McCullough and 13 nieces and nephews.

License Agreement between the University of Michigan and Attenuon, LLC
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved a license agreement between the University of Michigan and
Attenuon, LLC. Because Drs. Sofia Merajver, George Brewer, and Dimitri Coucouvanis
and Mr. Robert Dick are all University of Michigan employees and will hold an equity
interest in Attenuon, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Attenuon,
LLC.
2.   Licensing terms:
Field of Use: All fields.
Grant: Exclusive world-wide license, with a right to grant sublicenses. Term of the
agreement is for the life of the patents.
Maintenance Fees: $10,000 per year initially and stepped up through 2006 to
$50,000, creditable against royalty due.
Patent Costs: All current and future patent costs will be paid by Attenuon.
Equity: Attenuon grants the University 323,231 shares (2.2%) of Attenuon stock
once the entity is converted into a corporation. Attenuon has two years to convert

additional 484,847 shares total of Attenuon, Inc. stock will be granted as milestone
payments, subject to dilution corresponding to that of the founders.
Royalties: 3% of Net Sales of Therapeutic Products by Attenuon, sublicensees and
affiliates. 2% of Net Sales of other Products by Attenuon, Sublicensees and

employees is obligated under this license agreement although a funded research
agreement is also being proposed and will be described in a later Regental Action.
3.   The pecuniary interests of Drs. Merajver, Brewer, and Coucouvanis and Mr. Dick
arise from their ownership in Attenuon, LLC. As inventors, Drs. Merajver, Brewer,

received by the University from the company. (Mr. Dick is not an inventor and
therefore is not entitled to participate in revenue distribution through the University.)
Subcontract Agreement from the University of Michigan to Vanderbilt University
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Homing, the Regents
unanimously approved a subcontract agreement from the University of Michigan to
Vanderbilt University, involving the collaboration of Dr. Robert Macdonald of Vanderbilt.

this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Vanderbilt University.
2.   Under the project, a total subcontract of $350,000 is anticipated to cover the period

December Meeting, 2001


Undergraduate Science Instruction Center
Executive Vice President Kasdin reported that a number of programmatic decisions
had been made recently that affect the Undergraduate Science Instruction Center ("L-Shaped
Building"). These include the decision to locate the undergraduate biology instructional
program in this building instead of the Drama Department and the decision to carefully
evaluate the scope of the Walgreen Drama Center. These decisions complete the transition
of the L-Shaped Building into a a facility that is laboratory-intensive and also raise
engineering and structural issues related to the changed assumptions of the type of structure
that is to be located atop the Palmer Street Parking Structure. Because the architect
originally retained for this project was a specialist in theater design, it was decided to
request appointment of Venturi Scott Brown & Associates, Inc., to join SmithGroup, Inc., as
architects for their expertise in design and construction of laboratory and classroom
facilities. He also noted that a decision has been made to add a fourth story to this building.
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved the following with respect to the Undergraduate Science
Instruction Center:  expanded scope, a revised budget of $56,000,000, and
commissioning of the architectural team of Venturi Scott Brown & Associates, Inc., and
the SmithGroup, Inc.
Regental Bylaws on Athletics Governance
President Bollinger described the proposed revisions to the Regents' Bylaws on
athletics governance. He noted that the basic issue is where ultimate responsibility for
intercollegiate athletics and the Athletic Department rests, and his strong belief is that this
responsibility should reside with the president, as it does for every other segment of the
University. He noted that this practice is consistent with that of other institutions across the
country and with Big Ten policy, and he believes it is critical that the bylaws be amended
to clarify this.
President Bollinger noted that the normal channels had been followed for proposing
this bylaw change, and his intentions have been known to SACUA for some time. In fact,
parts of the proposal had been changed to reflect some of the concerns expressed by
SACUA. Although academic eligibility matters would be delegated to the advisory
board, he noted, non-academic matters must remain within the prerogatives of the
president. He noted that this issue has been under consideration for many years without
resolution, and that it would be unfair to a future president not to settle it at this point.
Regent Taylor moved approval of the proposed amendments of Regents' Bylaws
11.21-11.218, as detailed in the Regents Communication. Regent Newman seconded the
motion.
Regent White moved to table the motion and postpone the vote on this issue until the
next meeting. This motion was defeated for lack of a second.
Regent Deitch observed that he had some concerns initially but that President
Bollinger had made a compelling case and he intended to support it. Regent Maynard
commented that she appreciated the positive nature of the discussion about this issue.

University of Michigan established the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy;
and
WHEREAS, President Bollinger appointed the Commission on the
Undergraduate Experience in May 2000 to examine how undergraduates are
engaged at the University of Michigan. He also meets regularly with students, and
on at least two occasions, has opened his home to students; the first time following
a University of Michigan victory over Penn State in 1997 on the way to the
Wolverines' nationalfootball championship. More recently, he and his wife, Jean
Magnano Bollinger, invited students to the President's house to give students
support to bring a sense of normalcy to campus following the terrorist attacks; and
WHEREAS, President Bollinger has strengthened the International
Institute by elevating its profile within the University and by supporting such
events as the "Globalization's Intellectual Challenge" symposium featuring Czech

RESOLVED BY THE SENATE, That sincere praise be hereby accorded to
Lee C. Bollingerfor his tireless efforts to further higher education in the state of
Michigan. We honor him for his dedication and vision, which will benefit the
University of Michigan for years to come. May he and his wife Jean, son Lee, and
daughter Carey know of our deep appreciation and best wishes for continued
success in allfuture endeavors; and be itfurther
RESOLVED, That a copy of this resolution be presented to President Lee C.
Bollinger in a special ceremony as an expression of our admiration and best
wishes for the future.
Resolution from the U.S. Senate, introduced by Senator Carl Levin:
In Recognition of Lee Bollinger's Service as President of the
University of Michigan
Mr. LEVIN: Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to a
dynamic and visionary leader in my home State of Michigan, Mr. Lee
Bollinger.
For nearly 5 years, Lee Bollinger has served as the president of
one of the world's premier institutions of higher learning, the
University of Michigan. During the Bollinger administration, the
University of Michigan has experienced a period of dynamic growth
and change.
At a time when it is essential to keep higher education
affordable for all Americans, it is imperative that universities do all
they can to provide a quality education at an affordable price. Lee
Bollinger has worked hard to place the University of Michigan in a
healthy financial position so that it can meet its financial obligations.
The University has operated its fiscal affairs astutely under Lee's
leadership. U of M's endowment is now the fourth largest among public
universities.
In recent years, some have suggested that university presidents
are chosen more for their ability to raise money than for their academic


154




"ecemxber Mreeting, 20001 - Apprendix A


prowess or vision for the modern research university. Despite his
success at managing the University's fiscal affairs, Lee Bollinger was
not such a university president. He is truly a Renaissance man whose
vision of the University as a tool for academic and social progress
permeated all that he did while in Ann Arbor.
Lee Bollinger's vision for the University has reinforced
Michigan's role as a leader in the arts and sciences. He was
instrumental in the construction of the Walgreen Drama Center, which
houses the 450-seat theater named in honor of the most famous living
American playwright and an alumnus of the University of Michigan,
Arthur Miller. In addition, he made it possible to bring the Royal
Shakespeare Company to campus.
The sciences have also flourished under Lee's tenure. He has
worked to develop the University's Life Sciences Initiative, which will
soon house hundreds of researchers who will probe the human genome
and will work to discover new treatments for a variety of diseases. This
initiative has the potential to make both the University and the State of
Michigan leaders in the emerging field of biotechnology.
My admiration for Lee has also been shaped by his unwavering
support of the University's affirmative action policy in admissions.
Under his stewardship, the University has made inclusion and diversity
its bywords. Lee has steadfastly led the defense of the University's
policies in two separate lawsuits that are currently being heard in
Federal court, and which may ultimately be heard before the Supreme
Court. I thank him for his tremendous commitment to making sure that
the University of Michigan continues to provide a diverse learning
environment for all of its students. I know the University will continue
to fight for these issues even after Lee moves on to his new position as
President of Columbia University.
Just last month, Lee was recognized by the Association of
Academic Health Centers with the Herbert W. Nickens Award in honor
of his strong advocacy for diversity at the University and in our Nation.
It is an award that is well deserved.
As Lee Bollinger leaves Ann Arbor for New York City, I want to
take this opportunity to wish him and his wife, Jean, all the best. During
his tenure as President, Lee Bollinger enhanced the University of
Michigan's stature as one of the premier institutions of learning in the
world. I know that my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating
Lee Bollinger on his tenure as President of the University of Michigan.
I trust that the Columbia University community will soon come to
admire him as much as we have in Michigan.
Resolution from the U.S. House of Representatives, introduced by Representative
Lynn Rivers:


155




"ecemxber Mreeting, 20001 - Apprendix A


Ms. RIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Lee C.
Bollinger, who will be leaving as president of the University of
Michigan at the end of this month to become president of Columbia
University in July.
For nearly 5 years, Mr. Bollinger has been a transforming
leader at the University of Michigan, whose Ann Arbor campus is in my
congressional district. During that time he has achieved a number of
major accomplishments.
One of those efforts is the Life Sciences Initiative, which was
launched in 1999. With a commitment of $100 million in campus funds,
a $130 million endowment and additional revenues, the University will
become a major source of research on human genomics, chemical and
structural biology, and bioinformatics. A new six-story Life Sciences
Institute is now under construction on the Ann Arbor campus. The
university will also benefit from the state's Life Science Corridor, a
20-year program to develop new technologies in the life sciences
statewide.
Mr. Bollinger has also overseen the most successfulfund-raising
campaign in history, raising nearly $1 billion since 1997. In three of
those four years, Michigan raised more money from alumni than any
other public university. Research expenditures also reached record
levels under his stewardship to stand among the highest in the nation.
By far, one of his most significant contributions has been his
ardent and effective defense of affirmative action in admissions. Mr.
Bollinger has been a strong supporter of the need for diversity in higher
education, and his willingness to fight several lawsuits on that issue
underscore his strong commitment to that principle. I know of no
president who has been so closely tied to students and who has related
as well to the thousands of young men and women at the university.
From bringing the Royal Shakespeare Company to Ann Arbor to
dedicating the new Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, Lee
Bollinger has been a man of vision â€”a leader of compassion â€”and a
strong advocate for the principles that he and the University embody.
I know he has mixed feelings about leaving behind the Michigan
family as he moves on to Columbia next year. But those of us who have
seen the progress and growth of the university under his tutelage can
only say "thank you" to Lee for his outstanding service to the
University, to the people of Michigan and to the nation.
I call upon all my colleagues to thank him for his legacy of
service, and to join me in wishing him and his wife Jean well in their
future endeavors.

JANUARY MEETING, 2002


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, Januayv 17, 2002
The Regents convened at 1:45 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were Interim
President White and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
and Taylor. Also present were Interim Provost Courant, Vice President Feagin, Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Vice President and General Counsel
Krislov, Chancellor Little, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice
President Rudgers, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and
Vice President Wilbanks. Regent White participated in the meeting by phone.
Interim President White called the meeting to order.  He noted that he had
previously stated he would dedicate his service as interim president to the memories of
the University of Michigan alumni who died in the attacks of September 11, 2001, and he
read the names of the 17 alumni and two other individuals: David Alger (MBA 1968),
Yeneney Betru (MD 1995), Brian Dale (JD 1991), Paul Friedman (MSE 1983), James
Gartenberg (LSA 1987), Steven Goldstein (LSA 1988), Darya Lin (BSE, MSE 1991),
Todd Ouida (LSA 1998), Laurence Polatsch (LSA 1990), Stephen Emanuel Poulos
(BMUS 1977, MMUS 1978), Gregory Richards (LSA 1992), Josh Rosenthal (LSA
1979), Christina Ryook (LSA 1998), Meta Fuller Waller (BGS, UM-Dearborn, 1973),
Scott Weingard (BBS 1993), Meredith Whalen (BBA 2000), and Marc Zeplin (LSA 1990
and MBA 1993). He also noted the deaths of Ted Adderley, son of Business School
graduate and visiting committee member Terrence Adderley, and Brad Hoorn, son of
Kathy and Denny Hoorn of Richland, Michigan. On behalf of the University of Michigan
Board of Regents, Interim President White extended "our heartfelt sympathy and the love
of our community to the loved ones of these alumni and friends."
As an example of how individuals are coping with their losses, Interim President
White displayed a book sent to him by Kathy Hoorn, a third grade teacher in Richland,
Michigan and mother of Brad Hoorn, comprised of letters written by her students to
President Bush expressing their feelings about the events of September 11th.
Interim President White noted that he had received hundreds of emails in response
to his University-wide email welcoming people back to campus following the winter
break. He read passages from two of the emails, one from an undergraduate student
describing how much she is benefiting from her University of Michigan experience and
commending the University for its efforts in the life sciences, and another from a faculty
member offering his view of what is important about the University of Michigan. He
recommended that leaders should "keep [their] eye on the long-term, always the
long-term. Remember our grandchildren." Interim President White offered this advice as
a theme for the Regents' Meeting.
Resolution in Honor of Lisa A. Tedesco
Interim President White called on Regent McGowan, who called Vice President
Tedesco to the podium. Regent McGowan observed that during her tenure as an executive
officer, Lisa Tedesco has "exhibited all the passion and accomplishment of a scholar, the


157




January Meeting, 2002


professionalism of an executive, and the sense of humor so necessary in an intense and
significant institution." Regents' Resolutions, she noted, are reserved for individuals who
have made "an utterly unique contribution to the people of the University, or in her case, the
world," through her academic work as a psychologist in the School of Dentistry. She then
read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the Universi't of Michigan commend and express
their gratitude to Lisa A. Tedesco for her leadership as interim provost
and executive vice president for academic affairs.
As the University's chief acadeic and budgetary officer, she
skillfully applied her extensive knowledge of the University and
excellent judgment to the broad range of responsibilities that come
under the purview of the provost.
Dr. Tedesco worked with the deans to advance important
academic initiatives, including the final report of the President's
Commission on the Undergraduate Experience; continued support for
the Lifj Sciences, Values, and Society Program; and departmental and
curricular improvements in the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts. She also was instrumental in advising students on their campaign
for the addition of a frill study break to the academic calendar.
Following the September 1 l terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, members of the Universi7t communint
benefited greatly froin Dr. Tedesco's compassion, sensitivity, and
insight.
Dr.   Tedesco  enthusiastically  embraced  the  additional
responsibilities of interim provost while simultaneously performing her
duties cs vice president and secretary of the University, including
assisting the Regents with the presidential search.
With admiration and affection, the Regents thank Dr. Lisa A.
Tedesco for her service as interim provost and executive vice president
for academic affairs and look forward to continuing to benefit from her
wisdom and leadership.
A round of applause followed. Vice President Tedesco commented that a Regents
Resolution is the highest honor the University can bestow. She thanked the Regents and
noted that she looks forward to continuing her service on behalf of the University.
Appointment of Interim Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the appointment of Paul N. Courant as interim provost and executive
vice president for academic affairs.
Interim President White also noted the appointment of Lester Monts, senior vice
provost for academic affairs, as senior counselor for the arts, diversity, and
undergraduate affairs to the interim president.


158




January Meeting, 20)02


Annual Report on Research
Vice President Ulaby first presented a video titled "The Impact of Research on
Society," which examined how the research training provided to University of Michigan
students provides the foundation that may lead to great discoveries and innovative
applications of technology; what basic research is and the fundamental knowledge it seeks
to discover; how knowledge is used in the service of society through applied research; and
what steps can be taken to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and discoveries into the
private sector (i.e., technology transfer). The video presented a number of University of
Michigan graduates who had gone on to illustrious careers, described the work of several
current faculty members, and gave examples of companies that had been formed as a result
of the University's technology transfer initiatives.
Next, Vice President Ulaby presented details about research funding, including an
overview of research expenditures and awards, academic units with large research
programs, answers to the question of why the University of Michigan's research program
is so successful, and the costs and obligations of a successful research program. He
noted that for 2001, research expenditures totaled $591.7 million, an increase of 8.5%
over the prior year. For the first five months of FY 2002, expenditures are up 10.4%
over FY 2001. After accounting for inflation, the University's research expenditures are
increasing at an annual rate of about 5%.
In FY 2001, federal sources accounted for 68.6% of research expenditures and
University funds accounted for 16.6%. The remainder of funding was provided from a
variety of other sources, including industry, foundations, and trade and professional
associations.
Vice President Ulaby reviewed the research expenditures of the academic units with
large research programs, including the Medical School, the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, and the College of Engineering. He also highlighted the academic
units experiencing exceptional growth in research expenditures from external sources in
2001, which include the Institute for Social Research (13.2% increase); the School of
Public Health (16.5% increase); and the School of Education (30.5% increase).
Vice President Ulaby explored the question of why the University's research
program is so successful, and noted that four factors contribute to this success: the
University's interdisciplinary culture, infrastructure support and development,
responsiveness to federal initiatives on the part of staff in Ann Arbor and Washington,
and OVPR's organizational role in nurturing new research areas.
Vice President Ulaby concluded that sustaining such a comprehensive research
program requires a significant amount of support from the institution, in the form of
administrative support, facilities, and infrastructure.
Interim President White noted that he had recently visited the Kellogg Eye Center,
and was impressed that it contained, under one roof, the highest quality of patient care,
teaching, and leading-edge research laboratories.
Board of Regents Governance Structure
Regent Brandon commented that recently there had been informal discussion among
the Regents regarding the structure of the board and its overall governance practices. The


159




January Meeting, 2002


objective is to explore use of time-tested practices that might improve the Regents' overall
effectiveness. He noted that the Regents have done research on how other institutions
operate, including other Michigan universities, other Big Ten institutions, and other peer
institutions across the country. Possibilities that are being explored, which are in place at
the majority of other institutions, include the creation of a chair and vice chair who would
be elected by the Board, and the implementation of a committee structure. He stated that
although the details still need to be worked out, "it would be my hope and expectation that
at our February meeting we may be able to bring more specifics in the form of amendments
to our bylaws" which would be necessary to implement the desired changes. He noted that
the Regents would like to receive input on these notions from any interested individuals.
Regent McGowan commented that while she agrees that it is time for the Board to
discuss how it might organize to improve the efficacy of its efforts, two commitments
have been made over the interim period: the continuity of the University and the
enormous effort required by the presidential search. She stated that although she supports
beginning an exploration of this idea, she believes that because of the number of different
proposals that have been suggested, she believes that a more appropriate time to consider
them would be after a new president has assumed the presidency, given that some of the
proposals would greatly impact the role of the president and the executive officers. She
emphasized that changing the bylaws should be carefully considered and done at the
appropriate time, after the selection of the new president.
Regent Deitch thanked Regent Brandon for taking a leadership role on this issue. He
commented that Regent Brandon had brought to the board a talent for leadership and an
understanding of process and how effective organizations work. Given that the Regents
need to work as effectively as possible, he believes adding some structure to the process
will be efficacious. He observed that the Regents are an anomaly in the corporate and
non-profit worlds and in the world of University governing boards by not having the
committee and leadership structures being proposed by Regent Brandon.
Presidential Search
Regent Deitch reported that the Presidential Search Committee (PSC) had met with the
Presidential Search Advisory Committee (PSAC) earlier today to present a charge to the
PSAC and to establish Presidential Selection Criteria (See Appendix A, 185), and as chair
of the PSC he was now submitting these documents to be made part of the Regents
Proceedings. He commented about the high quality of the search committee membership
and noted that they are a thoughtful group of individuals who are excited about having the
opportunity to serve in this capacity.
Regent Horning thanked Regent Deitch for his efforts on behalf of the presidential
search during the past several months.
President's House
Regent Deitch noted that the President's House serves as a focal point for campus life,
and the presidential transition period seems to be an appropriate time to do a survey of the
physical condition of the President's House. He requested that Executive Vice President
Kasdin conduct an evaluation of the house and provide the Regents with a description of the
scope and budget for the work that needs to be done to keep it fresh and important in the life
of the campus.

January Meeting, 20)02


Rudi Ansbacher, M.D., professor of obstetrics and gynecology, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 2001, after a most productive career as a teacher, mentor,
and clinician.
Dr. Ansbacher graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1950 and then went on
to receive his B.A. degree from Virginia Military Institute in 1955, his M.D. degree from
the University of Virginia School of Medicine in 1959, and his M.S. degree from the
University of Michigan in 1970. Between 1959 and 1966, he completed an internship at
the University of Virginia Hospital and residencies at Womack Army Hospital in Fort
Bragg, North Carolina, and at Letterman General Hospital in San Francisco, California.
From 1966-69, he served as a staff physician at the U.S. Army hospital in Okinawa and
completed a postgraduate course at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in
Washington, D.C. From 1969-71, while earning his M.S. degree, he was also a research
fellow at the University of Michigan Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. From
1971-77, he was on the medical staff at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston,
Texas, and was also a clinical associate professor at the University of Texas Health
Science Center and Baylor College of Medicine. From 1977-80, he served as chief of
obstetrics and gynecology at Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco and
clinical associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1980 as professor of obstetrics and gynecology.
During Dr. Ansbacher's tenure at the University of Michigan he has served as
acting and interim chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He has played
an active role in the residency training program and has been a mentor to numerous junior
faculty members. He has over 200 publications in the areas of andrology, infertility, and
climacteric endocrinology, and has been active in numerous professional organizations. In
recognition of his outstanding teaching, Dr. Ansbacher was selected four times by the
graduating resident physicians to receive the Silver Speculum Award: in 1988, 1991,
1996, and 2000.
The Regents salute this faculty member by naming Rudi Ansbacher professor
emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology.
Csaba L. Martonyi, associate professor of medical and biological illustration in the
Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, retired from active faculty status on
August 31, 2000.
Professor Martonyi joined the University of Michigan as a photographer in 1967 and
was appointed director of ophthalmic photography in 1971. He was promoted to instructor
of medical and biological illustration in 1975, assistant professor in 1980, and associate
professor in 1983.
During his career as an ophthalmic photographer, Professor Martonyi used his
intellect, his considerable creative talents, and his technical expertise to help physicians
and patients, to teach residents and fellows, and to create a formal national organization to
train and certify ophthalmic photographers. For many years he taught an annual 40-hour
course on ophthalmic photography to students in the medical and biological illustration
program. He founded the department's Ophthalmic Photography Unit and led it as an
academic and service program of great importance.
Professor Martonyi achieved national prominence as a founding member of the
Ophthalmic Photographers' Society. He helped organize and conduct the first certification
program in retinal angiography and was instrumental in establishing ophthalmic


179




January Meeting, 2002


photography as an integral academic program in departments of ophthalmology around the
country. His efforts as a teacher were tireless, and he influenced countless numbers of
ophthalmic photographers. Within the Ophthalmic Photographers' Society, he served as
member and chair of the Program Committee, Certification Committee, and Education
Committee. He chaired the Board of Certification for six years and was chief examiner for
four; chaired the Society's Continuing Education Program for five years, and organized the
society's first international meeting. During this time, he maintained a full teaching
schedule within the department and co-authored several papers. Over the course of his
career, Professor Martonyi's work has won numerous national honors, and he has received
countless accolades for both his organizational and artistic achievements.
The Regents salute this faculty member by naming Csaba L. Martonyi associate
professor emeritus of medical and biological illustration.

APPENDIX A
Charge to the Presidential Search Advisory Committee
The Presidential Search Committee charges the Presidential Search Advisory Committee with
the following responsibilities:
The Presidential Search Advisory Committee shall provide information and
advice to the Presidential Search Committee and develop and recommend for
consideration a pool of candidates to be considered for the presidency.
The Presidential Search Advisory Committee (PSAC) serves in a preliminary and advisory
capacity for the Presidential Search Committee (PSC). As an advisory body, the Presidential
Search Advisory Committee with the assistance of Ms. Shelly Weiss Storbeck, of A. T.
Kearney, shall recruit candidates for the position.
Recruiting includes placing advertisements in relevant publications, inviting nominations from
members of the University community and others, accepting applications, and examining these
applications and nominations. Since experience indicates that most individuals who will be
serious candidates for the position will not apply directly, much of this process will consist of
the search consultant (Ms. Storbeck) and the committee conducting a wide prospect search,
contacting prospects, discussing the opportunity with them, and attempting to interest them in
the position.
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Presidential Search Advisory Committee shall be guided
by the presidential selection criteria approved by the Presidential Search Committee on
January 17, 2002.
The PSAC shall conduct a vigorous search for outstanding candidates. The PSAC shall review
applications and nominations, meet with prospects if necessary, and develop a pool of
recommended prospective candidates.
The PSAC shall conduct the recruiting and initial reviewing in such a manner to ensure that
confidentiality is strictly observed in accordance with Michigan law. The PSAC shall comply
with the University policies on equal opportunity and affirmative action.
The chair of the PSAC will keep the PSC informed of the progress of the search through a
series of periodic reports. The PSAC and PSC may meet periodically as needed.
The PSAC shall present the PSC with candidates to be considered for the presidency with
supporting documentation and comments provided for all candidates. Any member of the PSC
at any time may add names of individuals to the pool of candidates.

THE UNIVERSITY
Founded in 1817, the University of Michigan has been the national model for the large public
university for more than a century. The University's mission is to serve the people of
Michigan, the United States, and the world through preeminent teaching, research, and public
service, and by developing leaders and citizens who challenge the present and enrich the future.
Recognized as one of the world's premiere research universities, the University is a leader in
undergraduate and graduate education, offering challenging academic programs and diverse
cultural and social opportunities in a stimulating intellectual environment.
Some facts about the University:
~  With a diverse campus population of more than 53,000 students and 5,200 faculty, it has
nineteen schools, colleges, and divisions in Ann Arbor, four in Dearborn, and four in Flint.
In addition to students and faculty, the University has 22,000 non-instructional staff.
*   With 424,000 living degree holders, the U-M has the largest alumni body of any college or
university. The largest concentrations of alumni are in Michigan, California, Illinois. New
York, Ohio, and Florida.
*   Eight regents elected at large in biennial state elections and the president, who serves as an
ex officio member of the Board, govern the University. The regents serve without
compensation for overlapping terms of eight years.  According to the Michigan
Constitution, the regents have "general supervision" of the institution, including election
of the president, and "the control and direction of all expenditures from the institution's
funds." The regents meet once a month in a public session.
*   The following senior officers report to the president: provost and executive vice president
for academic affairs, executive vice president and chief financial officer, executive vice
president for medical affairs, vice president for communications, vice president for
development, vice president and general counsel, vice president for government relations,
vice president for research, vice president and secretary of the University, vice president
for student affairs, and chancellors of the Flint and Dearborn regional campuses.
e   The total 2001-2002 operating budget for all three campuses is $3.8 billion. This includes
the General Fund (teaching, research, library services, student aid, and the operation of the
physical plant), the U-M Health System, and all other specialized funds. The state of
Michigan provides approximately 11 percent of the University's total operating budget and
36 percent of the General Fund.
*   Research expenditures  more than $545 million in fiscal year 2000  are the highest
among public universities in the United States.  Annually, an estimated 2,000 U-M
undergraduates enhance their studies through research partnerships with faculty mentors.
The U-M is committed to conducting research for public benefit. In fiscal year 2001,
U-M faculty and staff disclosed 182 new inventions, filed 128 patent applications and had
65 patents issued. The University licensed 64 technologies to companies, including 12
new start-ups.
e   The University operates the U-M Health System, one of the largest health care complexes
in the world devoted to the training of health professionals, to medical research, and to
health care delivery. The Health System, comprised of the U-M Medical School, three
hospitals, community health centers, 120 outpatient clinics, M-CARE HMO, and the
Michigan Health Corp., consistently ranks among the best health care institutions in the
nation.
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The president, as the chief executive of the University, is expected to enhance the University's
existing strengths, help develop new ones, and chart its future course in consultation with
various University stakeholders and with the approval of the Board of Regents.


186




January M/eeting, 200(2 - Appendix A


Strengths to be built upon include:
*   Comprehensive Diversity. The University is committed to policies and practices aimed at
a comprehensive campus diversity, of which racial and ethnic diversity is an important part.
With such diversity, the University is able to achieve its mission of educating students to
participate fully in our heterogeneous democracy and our global economy.
e   Undergraduate Education. Eighty-two percent of undergraduate students on the Ann Arbor
campus graduate within six years -the highest graduation rate in the state of Michigan.
The U-M has been recognized by the Association of American Colleges and Universities
for visionary campuswide innovations in undergraduate education and is reviewing
recommendations resulting from the deliberations of the Commission on the
Undergraduate Experience, which released its report in fall 2001.
*   The Life Sciences Initiative.  Launched in 1999, the Life Sciences Initiative is a
campuswide effort to coordinate and expand research and teaching in such rapidly
advancing fields as genomics, chemical and structural biology, cognitive neuroscience, and
bioinformatics. A new six-story Life Sciences Institute, the cornerstone of the Initiative,
will serve as a hub for cross-disciplinary research and teaching in the life sciences. The
230,000-square-foot facility is scheduled to open in spring 2003.
*   Information Technology. The President's Information Revolution Commission report
issued in April 2001 calls for dramatically upgrading infrastructure over the next five
years, implementing an "across-the-curriculum" approach to educate students for life in an
information technology-intensive world, developing a strongly interdisciplinary approach
to information technology research, and experimenting aggressively with online learning.
*   Arts and Humanities Initiatives. The University's partnership with the Royal Shakespeare
Company, as well as plans to build the Walgreen Drama Center and Arthur Miller Theatre
and renovate major performance venues reflect the University's ongoing commitment to
the arts and humanities.
e   Public Goods. The Ann Arbor campus alone has a dozen galleries and museums; several
nature areas, including the 123-acre Nichols Arboretum; and 24 libraries containing more
than 7.3 million volumes. The U-M is committed to sharing these cultural resources with
the public.
As the University's principal spokesperson, the president communicates directly with each of
its external constituencies, including government, education interest groups, the media, and the
general public.
The president:
*   Leads the University community in the development and articulation of values and mission,
and develops effective strategies for pursuing that mission;
e   Accepts ultimate responsibility for the quality of the educational and research programs;
*   Serves as a spokesperson for higher education, nationally and internationally;
*   Enhances public funding and private fundraising;
*   Represents the University to state governing authorities and other audiences.  The
University's significant stakeholders, in addition to students, faculty, and staff, include the
people of Michigan and the state government, as well as the federal government, which
provides major research funding, and the private/business sector;
*   Oversees the operations of the U-M Health System and planning for its future in a rapidly
changing health care environment;
*   Oversees the University's athletic program;


187




January Meeting, 2002 - Appendix A


*   Supports the University's historical commitment to be a national and world academic
leader linking academic excellence and diversity.
*   Works with the provost and other appropriate University officers and faculty committees
to prepare and implement multi-year academic and financial plans and insure that the
institution is managed efficiently;
*   Keeps the Board of Regents, the University's policy-making body, closely apprised of
developments within the University, and carries out the Board's policies within the context
of the University's tradition of collegial governance.
PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS
The president must have a distinguished record of accomplishment in higher education and/or
other fields of professional endeavor, and must have demonstrated significant leadership skills.
The president also must have significant academic and administrative experience, preferably at
a senior management level in a research university or comparable institution in business or
government, and an appreciation of the values and objectives of a large, public research
university dedicated to quality teaching and scholarship. A proven ability to work successfully
with the internal and external constituencies of a large, complex organization such as the
University is essential. A doctorate or terminal professional degree is preferable; candidates
must have strong academic credentials to validate their understanding of academic values.
A successful candidate for the presidency must be committed to undergraduate, graduate, and
professional education, and to shared academic governance and be able to:
~   Identify, recruit, and motivate executive leaders of the University;
*   Work effectively with diverse populations, including faculty, staff, students, alumni, and
regents, and share a strong commitment to diversity and affirmative action.
*   Lead major fundraising activities.
PERSONAL QUALIFICATIONS
A successful candidate for the Presidency also should possess the highest degree of personal
integrity and be able to:
*   Communicate within and outside the University community, listen and respond in a
thoughtful and considerate manner, and relate effectively to many different people;
*   Formulate and communicate a clear academic and organizational vision for the University
and its many programs;
*   Take measured risks to ensure the achievement of academic excellence and make difficult
and timely decisions;
e   Listen to and motivate others, trust in the ability of others, and delegate authority;

FEBRUARY MEETING, 2002


The Universir, of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, Februaty 14, 2002
The Regents convened at 1:35 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were Interim
President White and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Homing, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Interim Provost Courant, Vice President Feagin,
Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kasdin, Vice President and General
Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Little, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President Omenn,
Vice President Rudgers, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and
Vice President Wilbanks.
President's Opening Remarks
Interim President White called the meeting to order, and commented on the
accomplishments and awards of a number of University faculty, staff, and alumni. He noted
that Regent White has been recommended for tenure in her position at Wayne State
University, that Vice President Wilbanks would be receiving two awards from community
groups, and that Vice President Tedesco had received the Sarah Goddard Power Award
from the University's Academic Women's Caucus.
Interim President White also called attention to the recent deaths of two University
staff members and Regent White commented on the recent death of Professor Emeritus
Murray Jackson.
Regents' Resolution in Honor of Vice President Feagin
Regent Newman called Vice President Feagin to the podium and read the following
resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate and
exp     thr       ciaion o       ress their appreciation to Vie President  r Development Susan
Kay Feagin as she leaves the University on Februar7 28, 2002, to return
to Columbia University, her alma mater, to become vice president for
development and alumni relations.
One   of  the  nation's foremost   academic  development
professionals, Vice President Feagin enjoys the respect of donors and
of her colleagues at Michigan and throughout the country.  7he
University has benefited enormously from the almost twentv-five years
of experience Vice President Feagin brought to Michigan when she
joined the University in May 1998.
The Regents are gratefl for Vice President Feagin's strong
leadership and her commitment to enhancing Michigan's nationally
recognized development program. Under her direction, the University
enjoyed its most successfu.l levels of fundraising, raising a record


195




February leeting 202


$230.6 million in 2000 c; d $218 miillion in 2001. She also recruited a
talented team of fundraising professionals to work with the schools and
colleges om the Universityls next capital campai g;.
With admiration and appreciation the Regents congratulate and
extend best wishes to Vice President Susan Kay Feagin as she leaves to
become vice president for development and alumni relations at
Columbia University.
A round of applause followed.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the January
17, 2002 meeting.
Reports. Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted reports of Investment, Plant
Extension, and Human Resources and Affirmative Action. With respect to the latter, he
noted that the report should have included the fact that the University has been in
negotiations with the Graduate Employees Union (GEO) since October 2001 and that the
contract is now under continuation.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Reksearch Report. Vice President Ulaby submitted the Report of Projects
Established for January 1-31, 2002.
Report on state budget situation Interim President White called on Vice
President Wilbanks to comment on the state budget situation. Vice President Wilbanks
observed that the University had been fortunate to escape any budget cuts in the fall of
2001, but is now preparing for possible recommendations concerning the 2003 budget.
She noted that the governor had indicated that he would be receptive to recommending a
continuation budget for 2003 and that the universities, in recognition of that budget, have
voluntarily agreed to limit tuition increases for 2002-03 to 8.5% or $425, whichever is
higher. It is anticipated that the whole process could possibly be completed and a higher
education budget in place by the end of March.
Interim Provost Courant observed that the University is grateful to the governor and
legislature for continuing to spare higher education from cuts during this difficult period
and to Vice President Wilbanks for her efforts on the University's behalf. He noted that
the overall inflation rate in the state is predicted to be about 2.9%, that medical care costs
are rising substantially, and these facts, combined with a 0% increase from the state,
create significant challenges for the University. At the same time, he pointed out that the
University has an obligation to students, their parents, and taxpayers to keep tuition as
low as possible and the University expects to restrain tuition increases to below the 8.5%
mentioned by Vice President Wilbanks. He pointed out, however, that the likelihood
remains that the state may be forced by fiscal exigency to make cuts or recisions in its
appropriation to the University. These realities will require the University to engage in
even more cost reduction and reallocation than it would in a normal year. For this
reason, he has asked the deans, executive officers, and major directors to indicate how
they would absorb a 2.5% cut in General Fund expenditures.


196




Felbruary Mleeting, 2002


Interim Provost Courant commented that it is incumbent upon the University to meet
the expectations of students and taxpayers, and he is confident that the current budgeting
strategy will enable it to do so. He also observed that based on past history, the
University should not expect to regain its most recent level of state funding of 37% of the
General Fund after the state emerges from its current period of fiscal constraints. This
would increase the importance of other sources of revenue, such as tuition and
philanthropy.
University of Michigan  ealth System. Executive Vice President Omenn reported
on items of interest with respect to the health system. He noted that negotiations continue
with the House Officers Association, and that the health system is reviewing ambulatory
care operations in order to improve efficiencies and enhance patients' experiences.
Finally, he noted that increasing health insurance costs for the health system of about $5
million for the coming year would add additional budgetary pressures.
Regent Newman requested that the board receive a presentation on health system
financial matters, and it was agreed this would be scheduled for an upcoming Regents'
Meeting.
Vice President Wilbanks noted that the Medicaid budget would also be flat for the
coming year, and the future for that budget account is even more acute since some of its
funding will be derived from "one-time" sources of revenue.
Division of Student Affirs. Vice President Harper called attention to a briefing
document on residence hall safety and security that had been distributed at the meeting.
She noted that student safety was the highest priority in the day-to-day management of the
residence hall communities. Achieving the high degree of safety and security is done in a
variety of ways, including the presence of a professionally-trained, full-time housing
security staff that is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Safety,
complimented by full-time housing staff. A wide range of communications is provided
about residence hall safety, including publications, informal meetings, and security alerts.
She said that the Office of the Vice President for Student affairs will continue to explore
additional approaches for providing security in the residence halls. She also called
attention to the listing of specific measures taken in response to a recent incident that had
occurred in East Quad.
Regent Newman requested that the Regents be updated on residence hall security
issues, including the analysis that is done to reach the conclusion that the residence halls
are secure. She requested that the opinions of any outside consultants that have been
hired also be shared with the Regents. Interim President White responded that a report on
residence hall security would be presented at the next month's meeting, including an
analysis of the next set of steps that might be taken to improve the situation.
University of llihigan -Dearbon. Chancellor Little reported on a gospel music
event, produced by a University of Michigan-Dearborn faculty member, that had recently
been produced at the Detroit Opera House. He also called attention to awards that had
been received by pre-service teachers in the Dearborn campus' School of Education.
Interim President White noted that Chancellor Little had convened a very successful
evening event in Dearborn with leaders of the Arab-American community and of the
University of Michigan.


197




February Meeting, 2002


University of Michigan-Flint. There was no report from the Flint campus.
MSA Report. MSA president Matt Nolan commented that students would view the
Regents' establishment of a committee structure as a positive move, as it would create
more channels for communication with the Regents.
Mr. Nolan also raised concerns about a report that student football ticket sales
would be capped at 20,000 for the coming season. He noted that for the three years
previous to the past season more than 22,000 student tickets had been sold and a shortage
of student tickets would be seen as a big problem by the student body.
Mr. Nolan also noted that MSA had recently hosted the Big Ten Students
Conference and that he and MSA Vice President Jessica Cash are in charge of organizing
next year's conference.
Regent White asked for further information about the situation regarding student
football tickets for fall 2002. She stated she would be opposed to a cap like the one
described by Mr. Nolan.

this period.
In the fall of 1969, Mr. Aupperle joined Merit Computer Network as project leader
to oversee the technical implementation of a computer network linking the academic
computer systems of Michigan State University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne
State University. Merit's initial network was activated in stages and formally dedicated
in May 1973. This network, now known as MichNet, has evolved ever since and, today,
is the most extensive and advanced Internet infrastructure in Michigan. Mr. Aupperle
was appointed director of Merit in 1974 and president in 1988, a position he held until
July 2001. His leadership of Merit was highlighted by the implementation of the National
Science Foundation's nationwide NSFNET from 1987-95 in partnership with IBM and

University in 1969. He joined the School of Social Work as an associate professor in
1968 and was promoted to professor of social work in 1973.
His research interests were in fundraising and resource allocation in the nonprofit
sector; community self-help; the Jewish ethic in Jewish communal services; and ethnic
identity as a source of social activism. These have taken him to both Israel and Russia,
where he worked with colleagues on the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee
(JDC) and at the Brookdale Institute on evaluating the relationships among volunteerism,
community, and reemergence of Jewish identity in the former Soviet Union. Other areas
of scholarly interest are management and human services. During his career, Professor

2001.
A native of Michigan, Professor Marquardt received his A.B. degree from the
University of Michigan-Flint in 1966, his M.B.A. degree from Western Michigan
University in 1967, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana in
1975. From 1972-75, he was an assistant professor at Michigan State University and
from 1975-80 he taught at the University of Central Florida. He joined the faculty of the
University of Michigan-Flint as an associate professor in 1980.
Professor Marquardt was active in developing the Certified Internal Auditor
Examination for the Institute of Internal Auditors. His research has focused on the
educational and examination programs of professional groups, notably the Institute of
Internal Auditors' C.I.A. programs. He also studied the auditing of an organization's
training function and the attitudes conveyed by internal auditors, which included analysis
of the cost/benefit relationship of training activities and the productive ways to improve
that relationship.
Professor Marquardt has contributed broadly to the School of Management through
his committee, administrative, and professional services.  His community service
includes projects with Dupuis & Ryden and Volunteer Income Tax Assistance through
Beta Alpha Psi, the honorary accounting association. This program has provided support

associate professor emeritus of accounting.
James B. Martin, Ph.D., associate professor of health management and policy in
the School of Public Health, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2001.
Professor Martin earned his B.S. degree in 1968, his M.S. degree in 1970, and his
Ph.D. degree in 1974, all in industrial and operations engineering and all from the
University of Michigan. He joined the faculty of the School of Public Health in 1974 as
an assistant research scientist in the Department of Hospital Administration. He was
promoted to assistant professor in 1975 and associate professor in 1979.
Early in his career, Professor Martin's research focused on cost containment,
improving operational efficiencies and increasing the use of information systems in
healthcare organizations. He and his colleagues used large-scale computer simulation
models to predict the operation of healthcare organizations when various operating
characteristics were changed. The objectives of these models included controlling
variance in census levels, balancing the demand for hospital beds and operating room
capacity, and predicting the need for acute care beds in a single hospital or a region.
These models were used in the late 1970s to help the University of Michigan determine
the correct size for its replacement hospital.
Professor Martin's research demonstrated how to design, build, implement, and
operate integrated information systems that improved the effectiveness, efficiency, and
quality of healthcare operations. Under a research grant from Henry Ford Hospital during
the 1980s, he developed an integrated set of medical records, utilization review, surgical
suite, and decision support systems. During the 1990s, his focus shifted to information
systems within healthcare organizations. He developed a new approach to healthcare
information systems called the Component Alignment Model, applied this model in 15
healthcare systems worldwide, and taught extensively in continuing education venues
about healthcare information technology strategic planning.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming James B. Martin associate
professor emeritus of health management and policy.
Carolyn M. Mawby, associate professor of music in the College of Arts and
Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on May 31,

University Chorale and Chamber Singers. Under her direction, the Chamber Singers
appeared as the invited performing group at several American Choral Directors
Association conventions in the Midwest.
Professor Mawby's contributions to the community are a model for art educators in
higher education. In 1983, she founded and directed the enormously successful Junior
and Senior Summer Academies of Music, choral music day camps for promising young


215




February Meeting, 2002


musicians. Their primary objectives were identifying a child's proclivity in music and
developing and nurturing it in a summer day camp setting. Hundreds of students in the
greater Flint area have participated in these academies, and nationally respected leaders
in the field of choral music education served as conductors. In 1999-2000, the Michigan
Music Educators recognized Professor Mawby as "Administrator of the Year" for her
work with the summer music academies.
Professor Mawby founded the Alumni Choir, which consisted initially of former
members of the UM-Flint Chamber Singers but has since expanded to include others
interested in choral performance. Professor Mawby's dedication to the art of choral
music demonstrates a commitment to the highest standards of music-making for all.
The Regents salute this faculty member by naming Carolyn M. Mawby associate
professor emerita of music.

Professor Meisels' research interests include assessments in early childhood
programs and elementary schools and policy issues in the implementation of early
intervention programs. Through his extensive research and publications he has had a
national impact on early childhood assessments and instructional reform. Professor
Meisels' "Work Sampling System"f' is widely used as a tool for student assessment,
professional development, and instructional reform. He has served as an evaluator and
consultant both here and abroad and has worked with such entities as the U.S. Department
of Education, the National Academy of Sciences, Head Start, and the National
Association of State Boards of Education. A popular teacher and mentor, Professor
Meisels taught undergraduate and graduate classes in assessment in early childhood, high
risk infancy, special education, and educational assessment of disabled children. He

University in 1964 and 1965, respectively, and her Ph.D. degree from Northwestern
University in 1969. From 1969-90, she served on the faculty of the Northern Illinois


216




February Meeting, 2002


University School of Nursing. She joined the faculty at the University of Michigan
School of Nursing in 1990 as professor and director of the Center for Nursing Research.
Professor Pender served as director of the University's Child and Adolescent
Health Behavior Center from 1991-2000 and as associate dean for academic affairs and
associate dean for research in the School of Nursing from 1994-98. After assisting the
dean in restructuring the school and streamlining the Office of Academic Affairs, she

John R. Wiseman, Ph.D., professor of chemistry in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2001.
Professor Wiseman received his B.S. degree from the University of Colorado in
1957 and his Ph.D. degree from Stanford University in 1965. From 1957-60, he was a
commissioned officer in U.S. Public Health Service. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor of chemistry in 1966. He was promoted to
associate professor in 1970 and professor in 1976.
Professor Wiseman is an internationally-respected teacher, scientist, and scholar.
His research focused on an insightful and unique recognition that a well-accepted and
long-standing proposal, known as Bredt's rule, was in fact incorrect. The structural basis
for Bredt' s rule was that double bonds could not exist at the bridgehead of bicyclic
systems and this seemed evident from the simple examination of models and the practical
experience that no molecule having such architectural elements had been prepared.
Professor Wiseman proposed a totally new way of looking at these systems and showed
that it was correct by the synthesis of a framework that had previously been believed
impossible. Professor Wiseman and his research group then went on to characterize
almost all of the various "violations of Bredt's rule" compounds. These groundbreaking
studies stand as a monumental accomplishment in physical and synthetic organic
chemistry, and created an avalanche of new directions for organic chemistry.
Professor Wiseman has taught virtually every laboratory graduate and undergraduate
course offered by the organic chemistry division at the University. In the beginning
organic courses, he was distinguished for his continued s  asttention to
students. He served for many years as an undergraduate counselor within the Department
of Chemistry, and his thoughtful and skillful mentorship extended to graduate students and
associates as well.

and high-impact contributions to fluid flow and heat transfer of rotating machineries. His
research efforts in bioheat and mass transfer include original visualization of transport
phenomena in plants and hyperthermia, pulmonary, and cardiovascular biomechanics. He
has also made original contributions to the dynamics of nucleate boiling and droplet
evaporation. Over the years, he taught many undergraduate and graduate students and
supervised a number of Ph.D. students, many of whom have risen to prominent positions.
Professor Yang has left his mark in all the continents of the world. He is recognized
by various academies and societies in Italy, Germany, Japan, China, and the United
States. He was one of the founders of the Pacific Rim (and International) Transport
Phenomena Symposia. Professional recognition of his work includes the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Heat Transfer Memorial Award, the Strouhal
Award in Flow Visualization, a Fulbright Lectureship Award, and election as an
Honorary Member of the Heat Transfer Society of Japan. He is the author or co-author of
a number of books and more than 600 articles and has been the senior editor of several
international journals. Professor Yang is a humble individual with high ethical standards
who has represented the University of Michigan around the world in a most distinguished
manner.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Wen-Jei Yang professor
emeritus of mechanical engineering and professor emeritus of biomedical engineering.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported to the Regents this
month.
Degrees. Interim Provost Courant submitted final degree lists for the December
2001 commencements and changes for previously approved degree lists.
Approval of Consent Agenda. On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by
Regent White, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
Proposed Changes in Regents' Bylaws Sections 1.01, 1.04, 1.06, 1.07, and 1.09
Regent Brandon commented that at the last meeting he had invited community input on
his proposed amendments to the Regents' Bylaws, which called for a board chair to be
elected by the board, serving two-year terms coinciding with the academic year. The chair
would preside at meetings when the president cannot attend; would consult with the
president in the preparation of meeting agendas; and would make committee assignments
and appoint committee chairs. The proposed bylaw amendments also established the


218




February Meeting, 2002


position of vice chair of the board, which would be an elected position serving a two-year
term coincidental with the chair. The vice chair would complete the term of chair if the
chair was removed, resigned, or was not re-elected to the board.
Regent Brandon also noted that he had proposed the creation of two committees: a
finance, audit, and investment committee, as well as a compensation and personnel
committee. The president would be an ex-officio member of each committee. There
would be three Regents on each committee, and the chair of the board would appoint the
chair of each of these standing committees. The terms of the committees would coincide
with the term of the chair, and the Regents would have the prerogative to add additional
committees as they deem     appropriate.  Other proposed changes include deleting
references to the term "senior Regent," as well as minor revisions relating to updates in
methods of communication.
In the interim, Regent Brandon commented that Regent Maynard had made some
suggestions to his original proposal, and he has changed his original proposal to reflect
three of these suggestions. These dealt with the methods by which the Regents call a
special meeting, the way a deadlock would be broken in the event of a tie vote for
election of the chair, and the method by which the meeting agenda would be prepared.
Regent Brandon noted that since the last meeting he had received comments from
four individuals, including a former Regent, about the proposed bylaw changes, and all
were supportive. There was one letter from a faculty member who was against the
proposal. He noted that nobody had signed up to address the board at Public Comments
about this issue, and recommended adoption of his proposed Bylaws revisions.
Regent Taylor moved adoption of Regent Brandon's proposed bylaw amendments;
Regent White seconded the motion. (Additions are in italics; deletions are crossed out.)

220




Fe ebruary M/eeting, 20)02


There shall be two standing committees of the Board of Regents, each composed of three
members of the Board selected by the chair. These committees shall advise the Board of
Regents on matters pertaining to their subject areas and shall present periodic reports and
recommendations, but shall not have the power to bind the Board of Regents on any matter.
These committees shall determine the frequency, time and place of their meetings, in
consultation with other members of the Board.
1. The Finance, Audit and Investment Committee
This committee shall provide assistance to the Board in fulfilling its
responsibilities relating to the adequacy and effectiveness of the University's
internal controls and financial reporting and investment policies and practices.
This committee shall review, at its discretion, matters that may include the annual
audit, financial statements and reporting, investments, and compliance with
applicable laws and regulations.

have not had such notice may be considered and acted upon by the Board. At any time any
Regent may propose any subject or subjects for consideration and action.
The program announcement shall also include a printed copy of the minutes of the previous
meeting.
Regent Taylor commented that he had been shocked to discover when he joined the
board that it operated as a committee of the whole, without committees or subcommittees.
There had been much talk about this over the years among the Regents, he noted, and he
believes this is a "good governance" move. He pointed out that the proposed governance
system is the norm among governing boards, while the University's current system is an
anomaly. Regarding the notion that a reorganization of the Board's governing structure
might shift the current balance of power or authority, he said he does not believe this
proposal would shift power or authority to or from the president or the Regents. He
believes it will make the president's job easier and will facilitate the lines of
communication between the president and the Regents. He also said he believes that the
proposed structure would assist the Regents in carrying out their fiduciary responsibility,
and would not result in micromanaging of University affairs by the Regents. He urged
adoption of the proposal.
Regent Maynard moved a substitute set of bylaws revisions, as noted below.
Regent McGowan seconded the motion.
Sec. 1.01. Meetings of the Board

February Mleeting, 2002


have not had such notice may be considered and acted upon by the Board. At any time any
Regent may propose any subject or subjects for consideration and action.
The program announcement shall also include a printed copy of the minutes of the previous
meeting.
Regent Maynard noted that during an informal session, the Regents had discussed the
proposed Regents' bylaws changes in depth, and had been unable to come to consensus.
She expressed her view that the best course would be to delay any bylaws amendments
until the new president is in place, although she was aware that the majority did not share
this view. Due to her concerns about the detrimental nature of the changes offered by
Regent Brandon to the best interests of the University, she had decided to proffer her own
bylaws amendments. She commented that her proposals would keep the quorum
requirement of five board members being physically present at a meeting in order for
official business to be conducted. Only after that would others be allowed to participate
by teleconference or other means. She proposes election of the board chair and vice
chair on a nonpolitical rotation, to occur in the January following each biennial election,
as is the practice at Michigan State University. The Board would be permitted to
establish committees "as and when needed," and the Board would be encouraged to
thoroughly research the charge to any committees that would be established. The
president would continue to have the responsibility to prepare the agenda.
Regent Maynard described the discrepancies between her proposal and that of
Regent Brandon. First, the issue of a quorum, in which Regent Brandon proposes that a
quorum consist of five members of the Board who need not be present to participate. She
pointed out the appearance that would be presented by the current discussion taking place
by telephone, with members of the public present to observe the meeting and no board
members physically present. She stated that "teleconferencing by five or more on a
regular basis keeps the public from participating in and observing meetings." The public
meeting notice implies that it is the obligation of at least five members of the Board to be
physically present.
Regarding the chair and vice chair, Regent Maynard commented that Regent
Brandon's proposal "seems to anticipate the formation of a political agenda for the
election of the chair and the vice chair" of the Board. It provides for the removal of the
chair and vice chair from office, and includes specific provisions in the event the
nominee is unable to win majority support. Yet, she noted, "this University has achieved
its unique and outstanding reputation without any chairs. The history of the Regents has
been their ability to place the University first on their agendas, without any place for
politics. My proposal seeks to provide predictability without individual political
agendas, and to preserve the foremost position of the president." She noted that it is part
of the president's job description to "establish a good working relationship with all eight
of the Regents."
Regarding committees, Regent Maynard questioned why the decision on what
committees are needed should rest with the chair, and also, why the chair should have the
power to appoint committees. She commented, "This is not a private corporation. This
is a public institution where the power to run the University and its board meetings is
granted to the president." She said that she agrees that committees are necessary, but that
"their need, function, duties, and composition should be arrived at and recommended by
the president in consultation with the chair, and only after full consideration by all of the


223




February Meeting, 2002


Regents." Finally, she urged that all committees be advisory to the board and report
periodically to the full board, in recognition of the fact that the board does not operate in
secret. "Not to do so," she stated, "would be to violate our responsibility as a public
university." For these reasons, she explained, her revisions would give the board the
power to establish advisory committees as appropriate, and to actually form the
committees at a later time, after input and discussion.
Regent Maynard concluded: "For the University to continue to change and grow in
its vision, we do not need a Board of Regents focused on its own control and power. We
need a board that works with the president to address the many challenges we face as a
leader in higher education."
Regent McGowan made the following comments:
"This morning the members of the Board discussed two very different proposed
revisions to the Regents' bylaws. The first proposal, authored by Regent
Brandon, would significantly change the way we do business. This plan would,
for the first time in the University's history, have the Regents elect a chair and
vice chair of the Board. Both would be electedfor two-year terms, but could be
re-elected for an unlimited number of terms. Election would be by simple
majority, but once elected, the chair or vice chair could only be removed by a
supermajority vote. The role of these new officers are not fully specified â€”but
clearly the positions are designed to confer power and administrative authority
on their incumbents â€”and in the process create a new, diminished relationship
between each of the other Regents and the president and other members of the
University community.
Regent Brandon's proposal would immediately create standing committees
composed of less than a quorum of the Board, which Regent Brandon assures
us are not intended to operate in closed sessions out of the public view. That
assurance brings one measure of comfort â€”but too little is understood at this
junction on how they will operate. I believe the devil remains in the details. I
have concerns that the activity of the committees will certainly restrict the
amount of information which is shared generally among all the Regents
currently and with the public.
Additionally, this proposal will permit the Board to conduct its regular monthly
meetings with every member participating by telephone or video-conferencing,
thereby diminishing the interpersonal dynamics of the meetings themselves â€”as
well as limiting public access to Board members.
The other plan, authored by Regent Maynard, offers more gradual change, and
change which is intended to avoid political skirmishing over the way the Board
itself is organized and operates. Regent Maynard's proposal offers more
opportunity for input from the person who will be Michigan's next president,
as well as the University's executive officers. This plan would call for a chair
and vice chair who rotate annually based on seniority â€”so that each Regent
would serve as chair for one year during their eight-year term. This is the
system which Michigan State University has worked out, and it seems to work
well.


224




Felbruary Mleeting, 2002


Regent Maynard calls for the creation of standing committees, but suggests
that their creation shouldfollow a period of time during which the Regents and
the new president can discuss their role and method of operation. Her plan
permits attendance at Regents' meetings to be by telephone or videoconference,
but only if a quorum already is present in person. A quorum, after all, is only 5
of our 8 publicly elected members.
As you know, I believe the Board is getting ahead of itself by acting now to
revise its relationship with the University's president. We should wait until we
have selected a new president so we can hear his or her voice. But it is clear to
me that a majority of the Board has decided that it will act immediately.
Therefore, I will support Regent Maynard's well considered plan. It has much
to recommend it. First, it takes politics out of the choice of who will serve as
chair and vice chair.  We have more than enough to handle doing the
University's business without adding a new layer of Regental politics.
Creating a rotating chair will help assure that the voice of each of the 8
Regents is heard with equal clarity by the administration and the larger
University community.
The utility, role, and method of operation of Board committees will be the
subject of careful consideration by the Regents â€”and meaningful inputfrom the
new president.  This is vitally important if we are to discharge, but not
overstep, our proper role, which is to determine policy and provide oversight,
but not to dip in and try to manage certain aspects of the University's daily
activities.
And finally, Regent Maynard's proposal has a theme of openness and
accessibility in the way we hold our meetings and conduct our business. We
are the publicly elected members of the governing board of a great public
university. It is a large, highly complex institution with many constituencies.
To build and maintain trust we need the public and our many other
stakeholders to know how and why we make decisions â€”and indeed just to see
that we are on the job and doing the business of the University.
For these reasons, I will support Regent Maynard's proposed revision of the
Bylaws and I urge each of you to join me in doing so. "
Regent Deitch commented that the Board's internal organization has been discussed
informally for years. He thanked Regent Brandon for bringing the proposal forward and
Regent Maynard for offering interesting alternatives to that proposal and stated that he
supports Regent Brandon's proposal. With respect to the issues raised by Regent
Maynard, he noted that of the other two Michigan public universities with elected,
constitutionally autonomous boards, Michigan State follows the rotational model of
selecting its chair and Wayne State follows the model proposed by Regent Brandon.
Regarding the notion of taking politics out of an organization, he suggested that the term
"politics" means the relationships built by people who work together.  For an
organization to function together, he noted, "people have to build trust and to work
collaboratively." This, he commented, has been the tradition of this board, and will
continue to be its tradition. He said that Regent Brandon's proposal brings continuity and
emphasizes collaboration among the Regents.


225




February Meeting, 2002


Regent Deitch commented that the committees proposed by Regents Brandon and
Taylor make sense, and that to be functioning in 2002 without an audit committee and
without oversight of the University's investment policies is, "flat out," a breach of the
Board's fiduciary responsibilities and one of the responsibilities of governance. With
respect to compensation, he commented that "this needs to be constantly thought about,
monitored, and worked on collaboratively."
Regarding whether these changes should be made to the bylaws before or after a
new president is on board, Regent Deitch commented that "this is a matter of internal
organization, and the time to do it is now." The new president will come into office
understanding the structure, which, he pointed out, is similar to that of most other similar
boards.
Regent Deitch noted that Interim President White has a Ph.D. in organizational
behavior with an academic specialty in corporate governance, and this provides a unique
opportunity for the Board to receive guidance from an academic expert in these matters.
He said he would therefore support the Taylor/Brandon/White proposal.
The vote was then taken on Regent Maynard's substitute amendment, and it was
defeated on a vote of 6 to 2, with Regents Maynard and McGowan in favor, and the other
Regents opposed.
The vote was then taken on Regent Taylor's original motion, and it was approved by
a vote of 6 to 2, with Regents Maynard and McGowan opposed.
Regent Taylor moved the election of Regent Deitch as chair of the Board of Regents.
He suggested that the position of vice chair be left open for the time being, to give Regent
Deitch an opportunity to consult with the rest of the board on their individual interests
with respect to the vice chair position and committee service. Regent Horning seconded
the motion, and it was approved, with Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, Newman,
Taylor, and White in favor and Regents Maynard and McGowan abstaining.
Regent Deitch thanked the other Regents for the vote of confidence, and expressed
the deep affection he has felt for the University for the past 37 years. He pointed out
factors that speak to the uniqueness and greatness of the University of Michigan as a
public university, especially its constitutional autonomy, and noted that each Regent is
independent and has equal power and status. The job of chair, he noted, is "to facilitate,
collaborate, consult, and move the business of the University forward in partnership with
the president and his or her colleagues in a way that enhances the greatness of this leading
institution."
Interim President White thanked the Regents for their thoughtful, conscientious work
on this issue.

Michigan to Michigan Critical Care Consultants, Inc. ("Company"), under which research
will be performed at the University of Michigan Department of Surgery under the
Company's grant. Because Robert Bartlett, M.D. is both part owner of the Company and a

Michigan employee who is principal investigator for the project, this agreement falls under
the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Michigan Critical Care
Consultants, Inc.
2.   Under the project a total subcontract of $1,606,717 is anticipated to cover the period

Michigan
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, all six Regents present
unanimously approved a subcontract research agreement from Xeotron Corporation
("Company") to the University of Michigan that will allow research to be conducted at the
University under a grant received by the Company. Because Erdogan Gulari is both part
owner of the Company and a University of Michigan employee, this agreement falls under

federal rates. Dr. Gulari will not participate in the project in his capacity as an owner
of the Company.

712 Oakland Avenue
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously
approved acquisition of the property at 712 Oakland Avenue at the negotiated price of
$1,235,000, subject to the University satisfying itself with the site's environmental conditions.
President's Residence Infrastructure Renovation Project
Executive Vice President Kasdin commented that the infrastructure renovation project
is being submitted in response to a request from Regent Deitch at the last meeting. He noted
that the President's House is one of the most historically significant buildings on campus,
and it is also the focal point of important University functions for students, faculty, staff, and
guests. Three separate renovation projects are included in the action request: internal
infrastructure, external infrastructure, and internal elements.
Regent Deitch moved authorization for the internal and exterior infrastructure
improvements ("mechanical and electrical and exterior elements") as denoted in the
Regents Communication. He recommended reserving a decision on interior renovations
until a permanent president has been selected. Regent Deitch noted the importance of the
house as the last-standing original building on the Ann Arbor campus, and as a visible
symbol of the leadership of the University. He believes the University needs to do what
is necessary to "keep this jewel polished." Regent White seconded the motion and it was
approved unanimously.
Motion to Meet in Informal Session
Regent Maynard moved that the Regents adjourn this formal session of the Regents
and begin a nonformal session to consult with their attorney regarding potential litigation.
Regent Brandon seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. Following a
ten-minute recess, the meeting continued in informal session from 3:05 to 4:00 p.m.
Public Comments
The Regents reconvened in formal session at 4:00 p.m., and heard comments from the
following individuals on the topics indicated: James Wilson, student, on political bias at
the University; James D'Amour, Northeast Area Plan Citizens Committee, Parma Yarkin,
citizen, Mike Garfield, Urban Environment Alliance, and Ray Detter, member of Citizens
Committee for the Downtown Development Authority, all on the Lower Town Plan; Cedric
de Leon, president of the Graduate Employees Union, on the status of GEO negotiations;
Kenneth Reiter, student, on residency classification and marital status; Kermit Schlansker,
citizen, on sustainability; Rabbi Jonathan Brown, citizen, Rev. Dr. Nile Harper, citizen, and
Jessica Barber, student, on the University's participation in United Way; and Alex Bates,
student, on child care.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 5:00 p.m. The next
meeting will take place March 14-15, 2002.

MARCH MEETING, 2002


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, March 14, 2002
The Regents convened at 1:30 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were Interim
President White and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, McGowan, Newman, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Interim Provost Courant, Vice President Harper, Executive
Vice President Kasdin, Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Little,
Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President Rudgers, Vice
President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent Maynard was absent.
President's Opening Remarks
Interim President White called the meeting to order. He announced that he and Vice
President Wilbanks would be meeting the next day with the mayor of Detroit to discuss the
relationship between the University and the city of Detroit. He commented on the
accomplishments and awards of a number of University students, faculty, staff, and alumni
and highlighted some upcoming campus events. He also announced the deaths of Professor
Lemuel Johnson and of philanthropist Elizabeth Kennedy. He then turned to the Consent
Agenda.
Consent Agenda
/Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the February
14, 2002 meeting.
Reports. Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted reports of Investment, Plant
Extension, and Human Resources and Affirmative Action. He announced that a settlement
had been reached and a contract signed with the International Union of Operating
Engineers (IUOE).
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report. He
also announced that Associate Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Elizabeth
Barry would be taking a new position as managing director of the Life Sciences Institute.
He acknowledged her accomplishments at the University and within the Office of the
General Counsel. A round of applause followed.
Research Report.    Vice President Ulaby submitted the Report of Projects
Established for February 1 - February 28, 2002.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Omenn said he
would reserve his comments until his scheduled report later in the meeting.
Diision    of Student Affairs.  Vice President Harper called attention to the
appointment of Dr. Robert Winfield as director of the University Health Service.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little introduced Urana Gray,
president of the University of Michigan-Dearborn student government. Ms. Gray spoke to
the Regents about the nature of the student body and campus community at the University


231




March Meeting 2002


of Michigan-Dearborn. In response to a question from Interim President White, she stated
that the number one issue for students on the Dearborn campus is the cost of education and
the desire to keep tuition at a reasonable level.
Univelrsity of Michigan-Flin. Chancellor Mestas noted that a financial feasibility
study for student housing is being conducted and results will be available at the end of the
summer. He also reported that the William S. White Building has been completed and
move-in is underway. A dedication ceremony will be held in June.
Chancellor Mestas also reported that the mayor of Flint had been recalled and a
special election had been scheduled to choose his replacement, and he commented on the
deep-seated financial difficulties facing the city. Because the UM-Flint is a healthy
institution in sound financial shape, it has been called upon to help with the solution of the
city's problems, without losing sight of the fact that the University's most important
contribution to the city and the region is to provide education for its citizens.
MSA Report. Interim President White noted that this would be the last time MSA
president Matt Nolan would be attending a Regents' Meeting in his role as president of
MSA.
Mr. Nolan noted that since he last addressed the board, a decision had been made
not to place a cap on student season football tickets. This has been viewed very
favorably by the student body. He reported that the biggest issue for students on the Ann
Arbor campus is access, in the sense of offices and services being open more hours and
more resources being available on line. He said that among the accomplishments of his
administration had been the "amazing" working relationships that had been established
within the University. He thanked the Regents and administration for all of their support
during his tenure.
Regent Deitch commented that Matt Nolan stands out along with other past MSA
presidents who have been spectacular leaders and have gone on to further distinguish
themselves as University of Michigan alumni. A round of applause followed for Mr.
Nolan.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for five retiring
faculty members.
Ruth Barnard, R.N., Ph.D., associate professor of nursing, retired from active
faculty status on December 31, 2001, following 26 years of service to the University of
Michigan.
Professor Barnard received her B.S.N. degree from Johns Hopkins University in
1959, her MS. degree from Boston University in 1965, and her Ph.D. degree from New
York University in 1973. From 1971-75, she was director of nursing research at Mount
Sinai Hospital in New York. She joined the University of Michigan School of Nursing as
an associate professor in 1975.
Professor Barnard taught undergraduate and graduate courses and served as chair
for medical surgical nursing and director of the graduate program in medical surgical
nursing until 1988. She also served the School of Nursing as an academic information
specialist. She was a major force, both formally and informally, in the school's
information technology initiative, supporting worldwide web and computer usage, UMTV
evolution, and videotaping of a variety of school activities. Her vision for the school's
moving into the next millennium included using information technology to enhance nursing
education.  Her leadership is evident through production of a video for student
recruitment and development of a proposal for new state-of-the-art equipment. Recently,
Professor Barnard was the clinical coordinator for a major undergraduate capstone
course (N446), providing leadership and support for clinical faculty in this course and
also assuming a major teaching role in her division (acute, critical and long-term care
program).
Within the University of Michigan, Professor Barnard served on a number of
committees and was assistant chief university marshal. She was an active member of the
Michigan Nurses Association, the Midwest Nursing Research Society, and the
Information Technology Advisory Panel of the Midwest Alliance in Nursing. Professor
Barnard is also active in various nursing association committees at the district and state
levels in Michigan. She provided leadership in the development of the Midwest Nursing
Research Society and in the research activities of Sigma Theta Tau, Inc. (STTI).
Professor Barnard is credited with initiating and developing the STTI Inventory of Nurse
Researchers, a widely used document in the profession.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Ruth Barnard associate
professor emerita of nursing.
Minor J. Coon, Ph.D., Victor C. Vaughan Distinguished University Professor of
Biological Chemistry and professor of biological chemistry in the Medical School,
retired from active faculty status on January 31, 2002.
Professor Coon received his B.A. degree from the University of Colorado in 1943
and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois in 1946. From 1947-55, he was a


242




March Meeting, 2002


faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty as professor of biological chemistry in 1955.
Professor Coon chaired the Department of Biological Chemistry for 20 years,
beginning in 1970.  In this capacity, he emphasized the importance of teaching,
strengthened the graduate program, and recruited outstanding faculty members. For more
than 30 years his laboratory has been internationally known for its pioneering research on
the mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are centrally involved in the
metabolism of drugs and other foreign compounds, the biosynthesis of steroid hormones,
and the activation of environmental carcinogens. His discoveries have led to many
honors, including election to the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine,
and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has received the Michigan Scientist
of the Year Award, the Bernard B. Brodie Award in Drug Metabolism of the American
Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, and the first William C. Rose
Award in Biochemistry of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology. He has also received some of the University's highest honors, including the
Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award, the Distinguished Faculty Lectureship Award
in Biomedical Research, the Henry Russel Lectureship, and the Medical Center Alumni
Society's Distinguished Achievement Award. In connection with the Medical School's
recent Sesquicentennial Celebration, a lecture hall was named in his honor.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and scientist for his dedicated
service by naming Minor J. Coon the Victor C. Vaughan Distinguished University
Professor Emeritus of Biological Chemistry and professor emeritus of biological
chemistry.
Jorge J. Gumucio, M.D., professor of internal medicine, retired from active faculty
status on August 31, 2001, after a most productive career as an educator, researcher, and
clinician.
A native of Chile, Dr. Gumucio completed his B.A. and M.D. degrees, in 1958 and
1962, respectively, at the Catholic University of Chile in Santiago. From 1962-65, he
undertook residency training at the Catholic University of Chile Hospital. From 1965-68,
he was a research assistant, an NIH post-doctoral fellow and then research associate at
the University of Michigan Medical Center. In 1968, Dr. Gumucio returned to the
Catholic University of Chile where he served for two years as physician in charge of the
GI Unit at the Sotero del Rio Hospital and was then appointed assistant professor of
internal medicine. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan as an assistant
professor of internal medicine in 1973 and was promoted to associate professor in 1979
and professor in 1991.
Through diligent research efforts investigating liver cell heterogeneity, Dr. Gumucio
received considerable grant funding which supported a well-run laboratory. He is a
recipient of the Jerome W. Conn Award, which recognizes excellence in research among
internal medicine faculty. In addition to being known for his productivity as a researcher,
Dr. Gumucio was a respected educator and clinician. Among GI fellows he was known
as a premier teacher who was sought out for his depth of knowledge and ability to
translate complicated concepts into clear ideas. Intensely committed to academia, Dr.
Gumucio was highly respected as a stringent and articulate defender of the ideals of what
an academic medical center should be.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scientist and health educator for his
dedicated service by naming Jorge J. Gumucio professor emeritus of internal medicine.

March M~eeting 2002


James Arthur Teeri, Ph.D., professor of ecology and evolutionary biology,
director of the Botanical Gardens, and director of the Biological Station, retired from
active faculty status on February 28, 2002, after a most productive career as a teacher,
researcher, and administrator.
A native of New Hampshire, Professor Teeri received his B.S. (1966) and M.S.
(1968) degrees from the University of New Hampshire and his Ph.D. degree (1972) from
Duke University. He served on the faculty of the University of Chicago from 1972-86,
where he rose through the ranks from assistant professor to professor and also was
director of the environmental genetics program from 1975-86, chair of the committee on
evolutionary biology from 1979-85, chair of the Department of Biology from 1984-86,
and associate dean of the college from 1982-85. He joined the faculty of the University
of Michigan in 1987 as professor of biology and director of the Biological Station. From
1992-97, Professor Teeri also served as director of the University of Michigan Project
for the Integrated Study of Global Change. He was appointed director of the Matthaei
Botanical Gardens in 1994 and joined the newly created Department of Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology in 2001.
During Professor Teeri' s tenure as director of the Biological Station, a large number
of grants were obtained to fund facilities improvements and research projects, greatly
expanding its stature as both an outstanding educational field station and a leader in
ecological research. Professor Teeri maintained an active research program and also
coordinated a large number of research teams addressing the response of ecological
communities to changes in global climate. He has been a most effective spokesman for
raising the public's awareness of the ramifications of the greenhouse effect caused by
human activities.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator, scientist, and administrator for
his dedicated service by naming James Arthur Teeri professor emeritus of ecology and
evolutionary biology.
William J. Williams, Ph.D., professor of electrical engineering and computer
science, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2001.
Professor Williams received his B.E.E. degree from The Ohio State University in
1958, his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Iowa in
1961 and 1963, respectively, and his M.S. degree in physiology from the University of
Michigan in 1966. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1965 as an assistant
professor and was promoted to associate professor in 1969 and to professor in 1973.
Professor Williams' research crossed the traditional boundaries between the
scientific, engineering, and biomedical communities. From his earliest years at the
University, he worked to develop an academic and research program in bioelectrical
systems and sciences which had a significant impact on the development of the
bioengineering program in the College of Engineering. He also had close relationships
with the University's neurology and the psychiatry departments. Professor Williams has
more than 180 publications to his credit.
Professor Williams is widely recognized for his seminal contributions to the theory
and practice of time-frequency signal analysis. He has several patents, the most recent
awarded in 2001, all in the area of signal processing. He is internationally recognized
for his contributions in the development and application of signal processing in
biomedical engineering and biology. His methods and algorithms have been used to study
such diverse phenomena as whale sounds, epileptic seizures, gear noise, and machine


244




March Meeting, 2002


tool chatter in manufacturing operations. His awards include the 1938E Distinguished
Service Award (1970), the EECS Research Award (1994), and a College of Engineering
Research Award (1996). He was named a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2001 for his contributions to time-varying spectral

University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers Financial Update
Interim President White noted that a major presentation on the University of Michigan
Health System (UMHS) would be presented at the April meeting. In preparation for that, he
had requested that Executive Vice President Omenn prepare a brief presentation, focusing
mostly on financial matters for this current meeting, in order to identify issues for further
discussion. The next presentation would also focus on operational and quality matters.
Executive Vice President Omenn noted that Larry Warren, executive director of
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC), and Douglas Strong,
associate vice icpresident for finance and strategy and interim chief financial officer of the
hospitals, were present. He distributed a handout outlining the issues to be discussed.
Executive Vice President Omenn noted that the research, education, and patient care
missions of the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) are highly integrated. The
patient care activities have to balance three aims: quality, cost containment, and access.
The UMHS generates a total of $2 billion in revenue from the hospitals, professional
fees, Medical School tuition, sponsored research, and M-Care. He displayed a chart of
"Historical Margin Performance" for the HHC from 1996-2001 and noted that in each of
the years, beginning with 1997, total operating revenues have exceeded total operating
expenses. He noted that the figures do not include physician salaries, which are reflected
in the Medical School's financial statements. It was requested that a balance sheet be
included in the April presentation.
Executive Vice President Omenn pointed out that the UMHHC makes substantial
annual equity transfers to UMHS units and made a very significant contribution to the Life
Sciences Institute.


250




Nlarch Mleeting, 2002


He then turned to a chart illustrating "patient activity trends" in areas such as
inpatient admissions, discharges, patient days, surgeries, emergency room visits, and
other outpatient visits. Regent McGowan observed that these figures do not show
whether the growth is occurring in areas that are most profitable or have favorable
reimbursement rates. For the upcoming discussion, she requested that trends be shown in
such areas as cardiac surgery, cancer, and liver transplants, to illustrate what the growth
areas would be if the case mix were different. Executive Vice President Omenn pointed
out that there has been significant growth in newborn services, which are important in
building community support, but that these are low-margin activities. It was decided that
an upcoming discussion would focus on the five or six areas most important to the future.
Executive Vice President Omenn displayed a chart illustrating the gap in revenue
from the amount of reimbursement that would have been received since 1996 under the
reimbursement policies then in effect, compared to what has actually been received, a
difference of almost $200 million.  During the same period, expenditures were
constrained by a total of $224 million compared to what volume-adjusted expenditures
would otherwise have grown to be. That relative expense decrease was achieved almost
entirely (95%) by a combination of net cost reductions (52.3%) and spreading fixed costs
over more volume (42.7%). It was requested that there be a chart illustrating the increase
in full-time equivalent employees as well as the effect of productivity increases and
technology improvements at the next presentation.
The discussion then turned to a comparison of the UMHHC with 13 other institutions
cited in 2001 as "Honor Roll Hospitals" by U.S. News & World Report, with respect to
operating margin, total margin, total cash flow margin, days cash on hand, and debt to
capital. The University is first in the latter three categories, and is sixth in the "operating
margin" category. A discussion followed about the differences between UMHHC and the
institutions that are leading in operating margin. Regent Deitch commented that there is
no reason UMHHC should not have as its goal to be number one in this category as well.
Executive Vice President Omenn described some of the pressures that impact these
figures, such as the necessity for paying competitive salaries and to provide adequate
staffing.  Interim President White suggested that next month's report address the
implications of striving to be number one in the operating margin category.
Executive Vice President Omenn then reviewed FY 2002 operating performance to
date. Four of the five indicators are favorable to budget, with the exception being "total
expenses compared to volume-adjusted budget." Next he discussed "Budget challenges
for the rest of FY 02 and FY 03." These include managing costs, specifically in view of
labor shortages and wage settlements, pharmaceutical advances and patient demand, and
continuing cost reductions. Regarding the issue of labor shortages, it was noted that
elimination of the shortage of nursing staff would save about $5 million, due to the
reduction of overtime.
Regent Newman requested that the next presentation address sources of funding.
Executive Vice President Omenn pointed out that pharmaceutical costs have the
greatest impact on inpatient services, as specific drugs purchased by and administered at
the hospital are costs that have to be absorbed within fixed reimbursement rates. The


251




March Meeting, 2002


costs of outpatient prescriptions, however, are the responsibility of patients and their
insurers, if fee for service; however, those costs are largely absorbed by the Health
System for capitated patients, primarily M-Care and Medicaid.
Executive Vice President Omenn noted that the other budget challenge is increasing
revenues and margins, from the perspective of providing increased capacity for inpatient
and outpatient activity and negotiating from strength with payers.
Discussion then turned to which of the U.S. News & World Report "honor roll"
institutions are part of the university with which they are affiliated, as opposed to having
been "spun off' to become independent institutions or being independent for a long period
of time. Regent Deitch noted that the University had made a conscious decision in the late
1990s to retain ownership of the health system. He commented it is timely for the
Regents to focus on this issue because the margins are so thin and the amount of money
involved is so large. Even though historically, it has been a "fantastic benefit" to the
University to have the linkage with the health system, the risks for the University are
equally great, he noted.
Interim President White stated that in keeping with Regent Deitch's comments, and
due to the fact that the UMHHC budget accounts for more than half of the total University
budget, and because it is so important to maintain the quality of the Health System, he
wanted to proceed in a manner that allows the Regents to feel "comfortable, confident,
and contributing" in their stewardship of the UMHS. For this reason, he said it would
probably be necessary to spend time on Health System issues at nearly every meeting. To
do this, a plan will be developed to guide these discussions covering a number of months
into the future.
The April meeting will consist of a follow-up to the current meeting, with responses
given to the financial questions raised. It will include a spreadsheet with relevant data on
peer medical centers. Future discussions will focus on managing costs; increasing
revenues and margins, including a focus on capacity constraints and how they can be
eased; and quality, including data ranging from patient outcomes to patient satisfaction.
He said he would provide a proposed outline for future discussions to Regent Deitch
before the next meeting.
Regent Deitch observed that the effort made by the Board in 1996, focusing on
issues then facing the Health System, was an important experience in the tenure of
Regents then serving. Subsequently, the Board has had a good deal of confidence in the
management of the health system. Regent Newman commented that the Board has no
cause for concern; the reason for the current focus is that people are much more conscious
now of the cost of health care, and, as part of the Board's fiduciary responsibility, it
needs to keep on top of the situation before it becomes an issue. She also expressed her
concern about another important area of focus, namely not losing sight of customers and
simplifying access to the health system.
Regent Deitch noted that the perception of UMHHC in general is one of superlative
care. But for individual patients and their families, the notion of quality is also affected


252




March Mleeting, 2002


by such details as telephone access, cleanliness, ease of making appointments,
helpfulness of staff, and similar factors.
Executive Vice President Kasdin pointed out that audited year-end financial
statements for the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers are made public
every year. He also cautioned that mid-year data could reflect month-to-month volatility,
and trends for the entire year should not necessarily be drawn from such data. Interim
President White stated that in response to requests by Regents McGowan and Brandon,
respectively, balance sheet data, cash flow statements, and capital expenditure data
would be included in future discussions. He emphasized that the renewed focus on these
issues is occurring as a result of pride and confidence in the health system, recognition of
its importance to the University of Michigan, and a desire for it to stay that way.
Video Presentation: "And You Can Quote Me On That"
Interim President White commented that he had seen the video, "And You Can Quote
Me On That," about the experience of students with disabilities at the University of
Michigan, some time ago, and had found it arresting due to its candor, the fact that it
consists of students speaking directly to the viewer, and the broader than usual definition of
disability that is encompassed by the film. The video was then presented.
Following the video presentation, there was a discussion with Mr. Jack Bernard,
chair of the University's Council for Disabilities Concerns and member of the steering
committee of "UMINDS," the initiative to develop a disabilities studies program at the
University of Michigan. He is also legally blind. He commented that the University is
generally doing very well in providing services for students with disabilities through the
use of adaptive technology and tremendous growth in other services, enabling more and
more such students are able to take advantage of more aspects of life at the University.
Current issues for students with disabilities include the desire for even more access
and opportunities to become involved in programs such as internships, research, and
study abroad that have previously been unavailable to these students. It was noted that
although insensitivity on the part of faculty and staff is sometimes an issue, it has also
become easier to respond to such instances as they occur. Mr. Bernard introduced Mr.
Sam Goodin, director of the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities, noting that
he has done an outstanding job in improving the situation for these students.
Mr. Bernard commented that broadening the definition of disability to include
mental illness has been a positive step although it does not prevent the issues that emerge
in people with hidden disabilities. It was noted that it is often difficult to know how to
assist a person with a mental disability, so it is important to educate the non-disabled
population on such issues.
Interim President White commented that the first priority of the University's new
Depression Center will be to reduce the stigma of depression. It was also noted that
efforts need to be made to engage the student body in exploring their feelings toward
people with disabilities and to allow people to gain new perspectives by learning from
others' experiences. Vice President Harper observed that a mental health task team has


253




March Meeting, 2002


been formed to explore ways to deal with these issues. She offered to update the Regents
about the array of programs and services currently in place that focus on these issues.
Interim President White expressed the gratitude of the University community to Mr.
Bernard, Mr. Goodin, and colleagues for their efforts in making the environment as
hospitable as possible.
Residence Hall Safety and Security
Interim President White stated that Vice President Harper and Mr. Bill Bess, director
of the Department of Public Safety, would update the Regents about the current situation
with regard to residence hall safety and security. Vice President Harper commented that
although many steps have been taken to ensure safety in the residence halls, there is still
more that can be done. She pointed out the paradox in the fact that a good deal of time is
spent with new students in talking about a sense of community and encouraging them to be
being open and receptive to others, while on the other hand, encouraging them to be careful.
Residence halls are laid out in such a way as to encourage interaction and community
building, which presents challenges for improving security. She also pointed out that most
first-year students come to a communal residence hall living situation from a home
environment where parents are responsible for their physical safety. The expectations of a
community that values and expects openness, ease of transportation, freedom, and
congeniality, while at the same time expecting a high level of personal safety, create a
tension between the two sets of values. The goal has been to convey the understanding
among students that personal safety is both an institutional responsibility and a personal
responsibility.
Mr. Bess enumerated the unlawful activities that have recently occurred in some
residence halls, noting that this is unacceptable behavior and pledging that the
perpetrators would be apprehended. He described measures that have been taken to
confront this situation and to prevent further incidents from occurring, including
increasing patrols, holding town hall safety meetings, and forming a multi-division task
force. He said that incidents have been aggressively investigated, and 21 cases have
been cleared through arrests. The Department of Public Safety, he noted, takes this
situation very seriously, and it will not be tolerated.
Regent Newman commented that residence hall safety is one of her primary
concerns, and she is interested in learning about additional measures that can be
undertaken to protect students. Executive Vice President Kasdin observed that security
measures were immediately increased when the increased illegal activity occurred. He
reiterated the difficulty of maintaining a balance between doing what is required to stop
the activity without destroying the sense of community.
Regent Deitch concurred and stated that he has "a great deal of confidence in the
people who are working on this," and that it is the responsibility of everyone to think
through how best to confront these issues.
Regent McGowan noted that during the summer there are middle school and high
school aged children housed in the residence halls for summer camps, and inquired about


254




March Meeting, 2002


plans for addressing safety and security issues for these children. Vice President Harper
responded that a safety review committee was formed some time ago to look at safety
issues in summer camps. She noted that a different approach is taken in this situation that
involves under-age children during the summer months since the University is expected to
take care of these students and ensure their safety. She said that there is a higher ratio of
adults to students and more of an adult presence in the residence halls for the summer
programs.
Mr. Bill Zeller, director of University Housing, commented that there is close
collaboration with the athletic department in dealing with safety and security concerns
over the summer.  Coaches also spend evenings in the halls.  The safety review
committee is continuing to meet, he noted, and is discussing, among other issues, how the
24-hour controlled access policy will be handled over the summer.
It was noted that this issue will be revisited in the next couple of months.
A five-minute break followed, after which the Regents reconvened to hear Public
Comments at 4:10 p.m.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals on the topics indicated:
Jeffrey D. Harold, staff member and president of the Association of Black Professionals,
Administrators, Faculty, and Staff, on the University's commitment to affirmative action;
Debra Hamann, alumna and Reach Out! coordinator, Stephanie Steele, student and Reach
Out! coordinator, Robert Galardi, citizen, and David Coleman, student and Reach Out!
site coordinator, on Reach Out! funding; Misty Fewel, student, on her residency
classification status; and Stephen Rassi, student, Rev. John S. Nieman, citizen, Rev. Dr.
Diane Christopherson, United Church of Christ, Rev. Thomas Firestone, St. Mary's
Student Parish, and Rabbi Robert Dobrusin, citizen, on United Way solicitation at the
University.
Interim President White stated that further information would be provided to the
Regents regarding the Reach Out! funding situation and that Ms. Fewel would receive
written correspondence about her residency status by the time of the April board meeting.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 5:00 p.m. The next
meeting will take place April 18-19, 2002.

APRIL MEETING, 2002


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, April 18, 2002
The Regents convened at 1:30 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were Interim
President White and Regents Deitch, Homing, McGowan, Maynard, and Newman. Also
present were Interim Provost Courant, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President
Kasdin, Vice President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Little, Chancellor
Mestas, Executive Vice President Omenn, Vice President Rudgers, Vice President and
Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent White
participated by telephone; Regents Brandon and Taylor were absent.
President's Opening Remarks
Interim President White called the meeting to order. He welcomed Sarah Boot,
newly-elected president of Michigan Student Assembly, to her first Regents' Meeting. He
commented on several items of interest with respect to students, faculty, alumni, and staff,
and noted the deaths of several emeritus faculty members.
Regents' Resolution in Honor of Robert Kasdin
Interim President White called on Regent McGowan, who made the following
comments:
"This is a story which speaks to the values of Robert and his staff of
skilled professionals. Picture, if you will, a meeting of some time past between
Robert and members of his staff and Jack Dixon on the very difficult issues
surrounding the construction of the Life Sciences complex. A meeting which
the participants describe as a partnership meeting.  At the meeting's
conclusion, members of the CFO's staff were heard telling each other, "You
know, the meaning of this project is clear. We are going to work night and day
to make it work." The buildings we now see rising on the Washtenaw Curve
are a magnificent example of how the academic people of this university have
come to look at the men and women of the primary business and finance office
as their partners rather than as the obstacles to their mission. That is good
business; it also affirms that we have in place a group of people, assembled
and led by Robert, who are motivated by the sense that what they are doing is
fundamental to the advancement of the goals of a world-class public university.
That fact, I believe, has been Robert's proudest achievement."
Regent McGowan called Executive Vice President Kasdin to the podium and read
the following resolution:
Regents Resolution
The Regents of the Universit of Michigan commend and express
their gratitude to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Robert Kasdin as he leaves the University April 30 to become Columbia
Universitv's senior executive vice president.


263




April Meeting, 2002


Keenly aware, aesthetically sensitive, and a person of great
integri t, Mr. Kasdin has closely aligned the University's business and
financial operations with its academic mission. In 2000, Moody's
Investors Service upgraded the University's bond rating to Aaa,
recognizing the University's prudent use of debt, successful supply
chain management, aggressive cost containment, and strong financial
performance overall. Today, Michigan is one of o nl three public
universities in the nation to attain Moody's highest rating.
The Utniversity also has earned top-tier investment returns
during his tenure. The endowment, which has grown from $2.1 billion
in 1997 to $3.5 billion, is the fourth largest endowment among public
universities.
Mr. Kasdin has contributed sigEnficantly to the Universit 's
built environment, from overseeing the development of a new campus
master plan and restoration of Burton Tower, Hill Auditorium, and the
Perry and Rackham buildings to high-qualit architecture in new
projects, most notably, the buildings rising on Palmer and Zina Pitcher
drives.  His interest and appreciation bfr art and aesthetics has
attracted some of the world's most outstanding architects to University
projects.  The University has made great gains in environmental
stewardship, including a nationally recognized recycling program. Mr.
Kasdin also played a leadership role in negotiating the sale of
University land to Pfizer, an important step in development of the
state's LifJ Sciences Corridor.
With admiration and deep gratitude for his dedication to the
University's fiscal and physical well-being, the Regents congratulate
and offer their best wishes to Robert Kasdin.
Executive Vice President Kasdin thanked the Regents and observed that "the stakes
in Ann Arbor are incredibly high, and there is a real question whether a public university
can continue to be a great research university and a center of education and learning." He
noted that the University of Michigan is a world class university and needs to remain so.
He thanked the Regents for the faith they have shown in his judgment during his tenure and
expressed his gratitude. A round of applause followed.
Regents Newman, Deitch, and Maynard complimented Executive Vice President
Kasdin on his accomplishments.
Undergraduate Science Instruction Center
Executive Vice President Kasdin commented that the Undergraduate Science
Instruction Center is the final segment of the Palmer Drive development. He introduced Mr.
Robert Venturi of Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates and Victor Cardona from
SmithGroup architects to present the programmatic functions and layout of the site plan and
the schematic design. Mr. Venturi described the site plan and the exterior of the structure
from several angles, especially in relation to the site and surrounding buildings. He
commented that the design is in the tradition of the Albert Kahn generic loft buildings found
elsewhere on campus and that the facade is similar to that of the Life Sciences Institute and
the Commons Building except the north elevation would be metal. It was noted that there


264




April Meeting, 2002


are a lot of "incidental seating" areas to encourage interaction among students and faculty
using the building.
Mr. Cardona reviewed schematic designs for each of the four floors that make up the
interior of the building. He pointed out that the laboratory space is flexible and
reconfigurable. It was noted that a new parking deck with 1,000 spaces was under
construction to accommodate the increased parking needs associated with this and other
buildings on the Palmer Drive site.
Regent McGowan asked whether construction of this building would result in fewer
options for other building construction in this area in the future. Executive Vice President
Kasdin responded that nothing being done on this site precludes use of the site of the Plant
Services Building for future construction.
Mr. Venturi commented on what a pleasure it had been to work with Executive Vice
President Kasdin on the University's projects.
Executive Vice President Kasdin thanked Associate Provost Pamela Raymond for
her efforts in helping to identify future programmatic and instructional needs for
undergraduates in conjunction with this building. He also noted that the latest budget
estimate for this project is $61.0 million, as opposed to $59.5 million noted in the
Regents Communication. He commented that during his tenure, he has been working to
enhance financial controls over building projects and as part of this effort all of the
Palmer Drive projects are being tracked as one bundle.
Regent McGowan moved approval of the schematic design for the Undergraduate
Science Instruction Center project as presented, at a budget of $61.0 million. Regent
Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
It was decided that the conflict of interest items would be considered next, followed
by the consent agenda and the remainder of the action agenda, and concluding with the
hospitals and health system discussion.

Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the March
14, 2002 meeting.
Reports. Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted reports of Investment, Plant
Extension, and Human Resources and Affirmative Action, and the Regents' Report on
Non-Competitive Purchases over $5,000 from Single Sources, December 15,
2001-March 15, 2002.
Biomedical Sciences Research Building. Executive Vice President Kasdin noted
some corrections to previously presented communications regarding the Biomedical
Sciences Research Building (BSRB). In September 2001, the preliminary budget for the
BSRB was estimated to be $220 million, and it was noted that inflation was not being
taken into account because predicting inflation over a sustained period was not practical.
In December 2001, the BSRB project was submitted for final approval at the $220
million budget, with the wording indicating that this $220 million would be "allowing for
inflation." The communication should have stated that the budget would be $220 million
not allowing for inflation. He apologized for the error.
Palmrer Drive Parking Struccture/l~PUn dergradu ate Science Instruction Center.
Executive Vice President Kasdin further pointed out some changes to the Plant Extension
Report. The Palmer Drive Parking Structure, the budget for which is currently listed as

Retireent Memoirs. Vice President Tedesco submitted memoirs for four retiring
faculty members.
Holde H. Borcherts, senior associate librarian, retired from active faculty status on
February 28, 2002, after nearly 32 years of distinguished service.
A native of Germany, Ms. Borcherts received her A.B. degree in 1961, her A.M.
degree in 1968, and her A.M.L.S. degree in 1970, all from the University of Michigan.
She joined the University Library staff as a librarian in 1970, and was promoted to
assistant librarian in 1972, associate librarian in 1974, and senior associate librarian in
1980. She served as a subject cataloguer from 1970-1973 and as a serials cataloguer
from 1973-1976. In 1976, Ms. Borcherts joined the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library
Reference Department. In this role, from 1976 to 2002, she has had a distinguished
career as the Germanic Studies Librarian.
Ms. Borcherts has been described by the many faculty colleagues with whom she
has worked over the years as an exceptionally gifted librarian who used her vast
knowledge of German language, history, literature, and culture, along with her
extraordinary knowledge of German book production, to build a comprehensive and
outstanding research collection in Germanic studies and Scandinavian studies at the
University of Michigan. Her untiring efforts were instrumental in helping scholars,
graduate students, and undergraduates find and use scholarly resources to complete their
research successfully.
In 1987 Ms. Borcherts used her extensive knowledge of the University Library and
the University of Michigan campus to initiate a highly regarded service providing
in-depth research assistance to University administrators. The breadth and depth of her
knowledge of scholarly research methods and resources have made her an invaluable
resource to her colleagues in the library and across campus. Ms. Borcherts will be
deeply missed for her intelligence, passion for scholarship, and generosity of spirit, and
her contributions will benefit the University of Michigan for many years to come.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian and colleague by naming Holde
H. Borcherts senior associate librarian emerita.
Rhetaugh G. Dumas, Ph.D., Lucille Cole Professor of Nursing, professor of
nursing, dean emerita in the School of Nursing, and vice provost emerita, retired from
active faculty status on December, 2001, after 20 years of service to the University of
Michigan.


280




April Meeting, 2002


Professor Dumas obtained her B.S.N. degree from the Division of Nursing at
Dillard University in 1951, her M.S. degree from Yale University in 1961, and her Ph.D.
degree from Union Graduate School #1 (Antioch College Campus) in 1975. From
1957-61, she was an instructor at Dillard University. In 1962 she joined the faculty of
Yale University, where she rose through the ranks to associate professor and chair of
psychiatric nursing in the School of Nursing. From 1972-81, she held several leadership
positions at the National Institute of Mental Health in Rockville, Maryland. She joined
the University of Michigan faculty in 1981 as professor of nursing and dean of the School
of Nursing. She remained dean until 1994, when she was named vice provost for health
affairs and the Lucille Cole Professor of Nursing.
As dean of the School of Nursing, Professor Dumas was an ardent advocate of
excellence in nursing research and scholarship as a means of advancing the discipline of
nursing. She provided a powerful vision of nursing and demonstrated considerable
personal and professional influence in many spheres.  A renowned national and
international scholar in the area of psychiatric nursing, Professor Dumas has conducted
extensive externally-funded research on clinical experiences in nursing practice and has
authored many journal articles and book chapters. She has served on a number of national
boards and committees, and for the past several years has served on the President's
National Bioethics Advisory Commission.
Professor Dumas has received honorary doctoral degrees from Yale University,
Simmons College, the University of Cincinnati, Dillard University, and the University of
San Diego. She was the first woman,                to serve as deputy director of
the National Institute of Mental Health, and she was the first African American woman to
serve as dean at the University of Michigan. She was one of 36 distinguished nurses who
were Charter Fellows of the American Academy of Nursing when it was established in
1973, and she served as the academy's president from 1987-89.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Rhetaugh G. Dumas Lucille
Cole Professor Emerita of Nursing and professor emerita of nursing.
Kotoku Kurachi, Ph.D., professor of human genetics, retired from active faculty
status on March 31, 2002, after a most productive career as a teacher and researcher.
Professor Kurachi received his B.S. (1965), M.S. (1967), and Ph.D. (1970) degrees
from Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan. Following postdoctoral training in Japan and
at the University of Washington, he served as a faculty member at the University of
Washington from 1978-86. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan as
associate professor of human genetics in 1986 and was promoted to professor in 1990.
He has been on leave of absence since April 2001 to serve as founding director of the
Gene Discovery Research Center of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science
and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan.
Professor Kurachi has been a highly productive, internationally respected, and
well-funded investigator, who has made major contributions to our understanding of
blood coagulation and its regulation. At the University of Michigan, his major focus has
been on understanding the regulation of factor IX, a critical blood coagulation factor
whose deficiency is the cause of hemophilia B. Professor Kurachi characterized the
regulatory elements of the IX gene, and demonstrated the basis for the developmental
regulations of this gene and its abnormalities in Factor IX Leyden. His laboratory then
focused on improved approaches to gene therapy of hemophilia B. Most recently, he has
published an important study on the genetic mechanisms underlying age-related changes in


281




April Meeting, 2002


human blood coagulation factors. Alterations in these factors with aging may play a
major role in the increasing risk of heart disease and stroke in older individuals.
Professor Kurachi is the author of more than 130 publications and holds 5 U.S.
patents. He received the International Prize of the French Association for Hemophiliacs
and an Excellence in Research Award from the Hemophilia Foundation of Michigan.
Professor Kurachi taught several graduate courses and recently established a research
ethics course in the cell and molecular biology program.
The Regents now salute this researcher and faculty member by naming Kotoku
Kurachi professor emeritus of human genetics.
J. David Singer, Ph.D., professor of political science, will retire from active
faculty status on April 30, 2002.
Born in New York, Professor Singer earned his A.B. degree from Duke University
in 1946 and his Ph.D. degree from New York University in 1956. From 1955-58 he held
visiting positions at Vassar College and Harvard University. He joined the University of
Michigan Department of Political Science in 1958 as a visiting assistant professor. He
left in 1960 to become a consultant at the U.S. Naval War College, but returned to the
University of Michigan in 1962 as an associate research political scientist. He was
promoted to research political scientist and associate professor in 1964, and to professor
in 1965. He received tenure in 1969.
From 1961-82, Professor Singer chaired the Societal Sciences Group of the Mental
Health Research Institute, and from 1969-75 and again from 1982-91 he was the
coordinator of the World Politics Program within the Department of Political Science. In
1964 he founded the Correlates of War Project, the most prominent world politics data
collection and analysis project, and served as its director until 2000. Professor Singer
was elected president of the Peace Research Society (International) in 1972 and of the
International Studies Association in 1985. In 1990 he was the inaugural winner of the
American Political Science Association's Lifetime Achievement Award within the
Conflict Processes Section. This past fall he was awarded the inaugural Founders Medal
by the Peace Science Society.
Professor Singer has made major contributions to the study of virtually every aspect
of world politics, including arms control, deterrence, international organization funding,
the causes of war and other types of conflict, research design issues, and the policy
implications of research in these areas. He has published 19 books and over 100 journal
articles, many of which are among the most widely-cited works in the field, and is
considered to be one of the founders of the quantitative study of world politics. Along the
way, he taught a generation of graduate students who have become leaders of the
profession.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar, teacher, and colleague by naming
J. David Singer professor emeritus of political science.
Memorials. Vice President Tedesco submitted a memorial statement for Lemuel A.
Johnson, professor of English language and literature.  Interim  Provost Courant
commented on Professor Johnson and noted he stood out among faculty members.
Associate Provost Lester Monts commented that Professor Johnson would be receiving
the Johnson Diversity in Service Award posthumously and described the
accomplishments that led to Professor Johnson being selected for this award. Interim
Provost Courant also introduced Professor Johnson's wife, Marian Johnson.


282




April Meeting, 2002


A round of applause followed.
Lemuel A. Johnson, Ph.D., professor of English language and literature, died at
home on March 12, 2002, at the age of 60 after an extended illness.
A native of Sierra Leone, West Africa, in 1960 Professor Johnson earned the highest
marks in all of West Africa on the Cambridge University Higher School Certificate
examinations. He received an A.B. degree from Oberlin College in 1965, an M.A.
degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1966, and a Ph.D. degree from the
University of Michigan in 1968. He joined the faculty as assistant professor of English
that same year and rose rapidly to the rank of professor.
Professor Johnson held visiting appointments at the Colegio de Mexico, Mexico
City, and at the University of Sierra Leone, the Salzberg Seminar, and Oberlin College.
He was elected president of the African Literature Association (1977-78) and vice
president of the Association of Caribbean Studies (1983-85), and served on the Social
Science Research Council's Africa Committee (1985-1990). From 1985-91, he directed
the University's Center for Afroamerican and African Studies. His honors included a
Steelcase Research Professorship at the Institute for the Humanities, a Faculty
Recognition Award, a Recognition Award from the Center for Afroamerican and African
Studies, and a Certificate of Distinction for Outstanding Teaching.
As a leading scholar of the African Diaspora, Professor Johnson was especially
interested in American, Latin American, Caribbean, and African literature. He authored
numerous articles and published two books of scholarly criticism, The Devil, the
Gargoyle, & the Buffoon: The Negro as Metaphor in Western Literatures (1970) and
Shakespeare in Africa & Other Venues: Import and the Appropriation of Culture
(1998), and a translation into English from the Spanish of Rafael Alberti's play, Night &
War in the Prado Museum (1969). He was also the author of the much-acclaimed Sierra
Leone Trilogy (1995), which comprised three volumes of poetry. At the time of his
death, he had essentially completed a seventh book, to be titled Private Parts & Public
Bodies: The Experience of Sexuality in African Literature.  Professor Johnson's
scholarly interests ranged over the globe, and he was fluent in Spanish, Portuguese,
French, Italian, and German, as well as Krio, his national language, and Yoruba, Hausa,
and Igbo.
Professor Johnson was an advocate for human liberty and human dignity for all
people. A scrupulous and sophisticated scholar, an elegant and passionate poet, a
generous and much-loved colleague, in thought, imagination, and practice he was, in the
most charming and persuasive ways, an enemy to all bigotries and a discountenancer of
little minds.
Lemuel Johnson is survived by his wife, Marian Yankson Johnson, as well as his
daughter, Yma Johnson; his son, Yshelu Johnson; his granddaughter, Shekinah Johnson
Cornelio, all of Ann Arbor; and one sister, Gloria Lock, of England.
Degrees. Interim President White submitted a recommendation for the award of
honorary degrees to Stephen K. Hamp (Doctor of Laws) and William A. McClain
(Doctor of Laws).
Interim Provost Courant submitted for approval the April 26, 2002 Doctoral Degree
List and changes to previously approved degree lists and noted that the lists are on file in
the Office of the Vice President and Secretary of the University.

April Meeting, 2002


Approval of Consent Agenda.      On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent
Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
Financial Statements and Reports Pursuant to Federal Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular A-133
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted financial statements and reports as
required by the Federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133.
Regents Serving     as Trustee    of Charitable    Remainder Trusts with       Multiple
Charitable Remainder Beneficiaries
Executive Vice President Kasdin submitted information regarding a change in the
University's guidelines so that they will now permit the irrevocable grant of a trust to the
benefit of the University provided that at least 51% of the assets go to the University, as
described in the Regents Communication. The acceptance criteria follow:
CHARITABLE REMAINDER TRUSTS
WITH MULTIPLE CHARITABLE REMAINDER BENEFICIAR IES
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
For gifts of charitable remainder trusts in which the University of Michigan is asked to
serve as trustee and in which the donor has expressed a desire to name other charitable
organizations as charitable remainder beneficiaries in addition to the University of
Michigan, the following acceptance criteria will apply:
The University of Michigan must be the beneficiary of a minimum of 51
percent of the remainder of the trust. The University's remainder designation
must be irrevocable.
* The donor may name other, multiple charitable organizations as charitable
remainder beneficiaries for the rest of the remainder interest. The donor may
retain the right to change the other charities' remainder interest as the law
allows.
T he donor may designate any organization described in section 170(c) of the
Internal Revenue Code as a remainder beneficiary, including a donor's private
foundation. However, the purposes of any other beneficiary of the trust must
not be inconsistent with the objects and purposes of the University, as
determined by the University's Vice President for Development. Further, no
beneficiary should have as its primary purpose the influencing of legislation or
the support of political candidates or ballot propositions.
T The initial trust funding amount allocated for the University of Michigan must
be $100,000 or more. Additional charitable beneficiaries may be named
under the terms of the trust, resulting in a proportionately larger total amount
required for the initial trust funding. As an example, if a donor wishes to name
the University as a two-thirds remainder beneficiary with another charity as a
one-third remainder beneficiary, the minimum amount required for the initial
trust funding would be $150,000.
* Minimum age of income beneficiaries is 50 years or older at the time the trust
is established.
* The University may charge fair and reasonable management fees for charitable
remainder trusts having multiple remainder beneficiaries. A fee schedule will
be developed. It will be shared with donors prior to completion of their trusts.


284




April Meeting, 2002


* The charitable remainder trust document should clearly specify the
distribution arrangements for charitable remainder beneficiaries as well as the
triggering events for such distributions.
* In addition to the information and accountings provided to noncharitable
beneficiaries, the University will provide annual accountings and a copy of the
charitable remainder trust document to the charitable organizations that have
been named as revocable or irrevocable beneficiaries.  However, the
University will not provide information or accountings to a charitable
organization named as a revocable beneficiary, if the donor so directs in
writing.
* The University will not require donors to notify other charitable organizations
named by the donors as designated remainder beneficiaries before the trusts
are completed.

She commented that the briefing materials that had been presented to the Regents earlier had
been well done and had convinced her of the necessity of the increases. Regent Horning
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Establishment of Thirty Additional Unendowed School/College Professorships
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Homing, the Regents
unanimously approved the establishment of thirty additional unendowed school/college
professorships.
Residency Classification Guidelines
Regent McGowan pointed out that Regent Taylor had been outspoken about his
concerns with the residency classification guidelines and suggested that since he was not
present, the discussion might be delayed until the following month.
Interim Provost Courant commented that he had discussed the changes with Regent
Taylor at length and had received his verbal assurance that he was comfortable with
having the issue go forward at this meeting. Interim President White stated that Regent
Taylor had also told him he was comfortable with the matter proceeding in his absence.
It was pointed out that a number of the changes involve liberalizing of the rules and that
students whose cases would benefit from the liberalized rules are on hold awaiting a
decision. Interim President White reiterated that Regent Taylor expects the board to take
up the issue at this meeting.
Interim Provost Courant observed that the guidelines had been under consideration
for a number of months. He noted that there are two aspects of the proposed revisions:
clarification of existing policy so as to make it more friendly, transparent, and
understandable and liberalization of some segments of the existing guidelines. He
commented that the underlying principle of the guidelines is that residency decisions are
based on clear and convincing evidence that an applicant intends to reside in the state
indefinitely. One of the important clarifications is to state this and to note that all
information possible is used to make this judgment; another clarification is the
incorporation of explicit wording that applicants claiming residency based on the
applicant's own employment or that of a family member or partner must establish that
employment is the primary reason for the family's presence in the state.
Substantive changes include changing the penalty for missing the filing deadline to a
late fee rather than an entire semester of nonresident tuition if residency is established.
Another change involves increasing from one year to three years the allowable period of
absence from the state for residents who engage in activities that would contribute to their
further studies. The third substantive change allows active duty military personnel who


288




April Meeting, 2002


are on assignment in Michigan, and their family members, to be eligible for in-state
tuition rates.
Interim Provost Courant noted that no staff from the Residency Classification Office
are members of the Residency Appeals Committee, which enables it to provide a totally
fresh, unbiased review of each case to determine applicants' intent to reside in the state
indefinitely.
Regent Horning moved approval of the amended Residency Classification
Guidelines, effective Spring Term 2002. Regent Deitch seconded the motion.
Regent Deitch commented that although Regent Taylor had been the driving force
behind initiating revisions to the guidelines, the established processes in place at the
University for this type of review worked. During the review of the guidelines, it
emerged that the system as currently administered is administered fairly. He noted that
"these are well thought out and narrowly tailored improvements, clarifications, and
revisions that will make the system work better." Regent Newman pointed out that one of
the improvements in the new guidelines is the fact that they clarify explicitly some issues
that had caused confusion among people applying for residency, such as the employment
of a spouse.
The vote was then taken, and the revised Residency Classification Guidelines were
approved unanimously (See Appendix, 295). Interim President White thanked Regent
Taylor for the leadership role he played in the revision process.
Change in Name of Master of Arts in Adult Instruction Performance Technology
Program at University of Michigan-Dearborn
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved changing the name of the "Master of Arts in Adult Instruction
Performance Technology" program at University of Michigan-Dearborn to "Master of Arts
in Performance Improvement and Design."
Public Comments Suggestion
Regent Newman suggested that for one-day meetings, Public Comments be held prior
to consideration of the regular agenda to give people an opportunity to comment on agenda
action items before they are voted on. Regent Maynard expressed concern that changing the
public comment time to earlier in the day might be a deterrent to student participation due to
class schedules.
Vice President Tedesco commented that the deadline for signing up for Public
Comments is 4:00 p.m. on the Wednesday before the meeting. If someone signs up to
speak on an agenda-related topic, the president would be asked to delay the vote on that
item until after that person has spoken.
Regent Homing left the meeting at this point.
Following a three-minute break, the meeting reconvened at 3:25 p.m.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers Financial Performance
Executive Vice President Omenn reviewed the data in the Regents Communication
that had been presented at the previous meeting as well as charts indicating sources of


289




Apri Nleeting, 2002


revenue, balance sheets, and cash flow for the entire University of Michigan Health System
(UMHS), which includes the Medical School and M-Care. He noted that additional
information was being provided about the 14 U.S. News and World Report top-ranked
hospitals, including whether the facility is university owned, university affiliated, or
independent. With respect to operating margin, he stated that the University of Michigan
was ranked sixth at 0.6% for FY2000. For FY2001, the University's operating margin of
1.3% would be ranked third if the others remained about the same as in 2000. In any case,
the University of Michigan ranks in the upper half in the category of operating margin.
It was noted that the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers
(UMHHC) has an extremely strong balance street and that the challenge is in the annual
operating margin. Regarding the operating margin, it was noted that a positive operating
margin is desirable for providing capital for upgrades and growth and for maintaining the
outstanding bond ratings. It also reinforces financial security and long-term stability as
well as resources for transfers to the academic and research programs. Certain important
responsibilities of the Health System put downward pressure on the operating margin:
maintaining a broad array of patients for education and research; accepting patients from
the poorest payers, especially Medicaid; accepting patients from payers who do not
include payments for graduate medical education, including M-Care; and investing in
efforts to enhance quality, safety, patient satisfaction, and staff and faculty satisfaction.
Among the steps that have been taken to increase the operating margin are being
more selective about the payer mix and being proactive about payment rates. Executive
Vice President Omenn commented that a lot of negotiation takes place between UMHHS
personnel and third party payers about reimbursement issues.
Regent Newman observed that, according to the chart on page one, both revenues
and expenses have been increasing each year, and she asked what is being done to control
expenses. Executive Vice President Omenn responded that expenses have been contained
very substantially by net cost reductions and by spreading fixed costs over more volume.
The question was raised as to whether inpatient capacity needs to be increased in order
to increase volume, and if so, what areas should be targeted for growth.
Regent Newman observed that so far the hospital has done well, but that almost
everything possible has already been done to decrease expenses and increase volume,
leaving the situation stagnant. Thus, the issue is how the institution can continue to
increase revenue in the future while maintaining current assets. She commented that the
areas that produce the most revenue are those in which there is no more capacity for
growth, and unless this is addressed now, it will be difficult to grow in the future.
Regent McGowan called attention to the "Patient Activity Trends" chart and noted
that there are a number of areas, including adult cardiovascular, cancer care, and organ
transplants, in which lack of growth is a concern. She noted that the issue of expanding
facilities for cardiovascular care has been on the table for years but never seems to move
beyond the discussion stage. She expressed frustration at the complications that appear to
stymie building projects necessary for expansion of revenue-producing clinical facilities
such as cardiovascular care and cancer care.
Interim President White responded that these issues of expanding capacity are
currently under discussion by the UMHHC Executive Board. Regents Newman and
McGowan pointed out that such discussions have been underway for a number of years


290




April Meeting, 2002


but don't seem to get resolved, and now is the time to plan for future growth if deficits are
to be avoided.
Regarding the Cardiovascular Center, Regent McGowan asked whether a timetable
has been set for bringing this proposal to the board and urged that it be planned as a
clinical facility without associated research and office space. Executive Vice President
Omenn responded that the Cardiovascular Center's proposal for a clinical facility has
been developed with a number of departments to be the equivalent of a "heart hospital."
It is to be located at the "Old Main" site and would connect to the Cancer Center and the
Main Hospital and have 216,000 square feet devoted to clinical services.
Interim President White proposed that the previous plan for discussion of health
system financial issues be revised and that at the May meeting the Regents could be
presented with the current plans for new clinical facilities. It was noted that issues
involving faculty office space and laboratory space have slowed progress somewhat on
advancing these plans. Regent McGowan suggested that office space and laboratory
space be considered on a different track from clinical facilities so that development of the
revenue-producing aspect â€”the clinical facilities â€”can be accelerated.
Regent Deitch agreed that if the market analysis shows that construction of such a
facility will be a profitable venture, then it should proceed. He pointed out, however,
that as a teaching and research institution, the University of Michigan also needs to be
concerned with the entire spectrum of diseases, some of which may not be profitable.
Regent Newman reiterated that the concern is that planning for the future is critical to
ensuring that the hospital remains in a healthy financial position.
Discussion then followed about how the Certificate of Need process affects
facilities planning. It was noted that Michigan is one of 15 states that require every
additional hospital bed, procedure room, operating room, imaging facility, etc., to be
approved at the state level. Although there has been discussion about eliminating this
process, it has been improved in recent years and does have positive aspects.
Executive Vice President Omenn commented that the core model of the health
system has historically been to integrate clinical, research, and patient care activities.
Nevertheless, the most recent thinking about the Cardiovascular Center building is that
serious consideration needs to be given to construction of two separate facilities, one for
clinical use and one for non-clinical needs. This approach would enable the clinical
facility to get underway much sooner.
Regent McGowan commented that the Regents' concerns stem from past discussions
of these issues with UMHS officials, so that they are now convinced that the
revenue-producing clinical facilities are essential for maintaining the health of the
institution. Regent Newman suggested that there be an examination of trends to establish
possible future directions for the hospital and continued review of efforts being made to
control costs.
Regent Newman raised the issue of how the University's liability for health benefits
for retirees impacts the hospitals and asked whether that has been factored in to future
expense calculations. It was noted that this liability is about $650 million and is
nonfunded.  Executive Vice President Kasdin pointed out that national accounting
standards may require that this liability be funded in the future.


291




April Meeting, 2002


Regent Newman asked whether the funding for retirement benefits of new employees
should be raised as an item for discussion.
Regent Deitch observed that the reason that no university that has a hospital
associated with it would ever receive a AAA bond rating from S&P is because these are
large institutions with slim margins and a lot of risk. He noted that the sense of urgency in
this discussion is based not on the current healthy financial situation, but on the desire to
remain ahead of the curve and plan for the future. The operating margin is important
because it creates reserves and financial strength, and he agreed that it is important to
move forward from the current position of strength. He noted that this was central to the
reasoning behind creating the position of executive vice president and chief financial
officer six years ago. The issue of ensuring that the hospital retains its ability to
contribute to the Medical School was also raised.
Executive Vice President Kasdin reiterated that the University of Michigan
Hospitals and Health Centers have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet and recurring,
although admittedly thin, positive operating margins, thanks to the leadership of Executive
Vice President Omenn and his staff, and it is important to view this discussion in that
context.
For future discussions, Regent Maynard said it will be important to spend time
considering the five most important areas confronting the UMHHC, as originally
proposed, because there may be other issues beyond those raised today that deserve
consideration.
Executive Vice President Omenn commented that additional beds have been opened
in the past five years and the hospital is actually licensed for more beds than are staffed.
There was discussion of what is being done to solve the nursing shortage; the Regents
expressed an interest in learning more about that issue.
Executive Vice President Omenn noted that existing inpatient and outpatient services
have been expanding. Additional beds have been opened in the Emergency Room, and
inpatient-related medical services have been expanded. In the area of cancer treatment,
he explained that the reason that the number of discharges is flat is because there has been
an enormous increase in cancer care done on an outpatient basis. He pointed out that
$120 million per year is being spent on capital investment.
Regent McGowan inquired about the array of services offered for cardiac care.
Executive Vice President Omenn responded that there is a preventive cardiology program
in place. However, the vast majority of the outpatients have serious congestive heart
failure, previous myocardial infarction, high-risk-factor cardiovascular disease, or are
undergoing  procedures  such  as  echocardiography,  electrocardiography,  and
electrophysiology. A very significant amount of cardiac surgery is also being performed,
including the most complex referral cases. He pointed out that the market share for
cardiac care and cardiac surgery care is very diffused in the state of Michigan; there is
likely to be a gradual concentration of procedures over the next several years as people
recognize that the centers with the most volume and best outcomes are the most desirable
places to choose to receive care, which will favor the planned expansion of the current
Cardiovascular Center programs.


292




Apri Nleeting, 2002


Regarding transplants, he noted that, although they result in a positive margin, there
is a shortage of donors. In addition, they involve more than just surgical cases, as many
very ill patients with complex diseases must be taken care of for every one that becomes
a transplant recipient. Thus, the contribution to margin provided by transplants needs to
be considered against the base of all of the potential transplant patient population. The
health system has analyzed the transplant issue and has concluded that, even though it is
less profitable than generally believed, it is still desirable to undertake because of the
cutting edge procedures involved.
Regarding cancer treatment, Executive Vice President Omenn stated that the margin
is currently quite attractive for many procedures, but this fact has also been recognized by
the payers, who are now attempting to sharply reduce reimbursement rates.
In summary, he pointed out that the Health System has done advance planning on the
Cardiovascular Center, psychiatry consolidation and the Depression Research Center,
expansion of the Kellogg Eye Center, and a replacement facility for the Children's and
Women's Hospitals.
In response to a question about poor payment rates for the care of children, he
responded that the University's Center for Women's Health is nationally prominent and
the obstetric service has been greatly enhanced and expanded in recent years, yet these
services provide little or no margin. However, over the long term they are important for
building the University's reputation with families for future health care needs. Women
are the key decision-makers, he said. In general, primary care is a money-losing
proposition. The theory is that a well-run, highly efficient, patient-friendly, primary care
service cannot be expected to cover all of its cost, but the system gets benefits
downstream from ancillary services and from complex conditions that lead to specialty
services that are better reimbursed. He pointed out that hospital officials themselves are
asking the same questions as the Regents: how do we manage to meet all of these needs
and all of these complexities while ensuring that all is being done to justify the higher
paying services without neglecting the other areas?
Executive Vice President Kasdin pointed out that the integrated structure among
UMHS officials and central administration, along with oversight by the Board of Regents,
is important to the rating agencies.
Regent McGowan reiterated that the message that should be taken to UMHHS
officials from today's discussion should be that "whatever it is we're choosing, let's get
going on it, let's figure out how we're going to do it, and let's remove the ancillary,
non-revenue-related items from the discussion," so they don't get in the way of making
progress.
Interim President White thanked the Regents and Executive Vice President Omenn
for the thoughtful discussion and said that plans for the future will be presented at the next
session scheduled for these matters.

APRIL MEETING, 2002
APPENDIX - RESIDENCY CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES
The University of Michigan enrolls students from 50 states and more than 120 countries. Residency
Classification Guidelines have been developed to ensure that decisions about whether a student pays
in-state or out-of-state tuition are fair and equitable and that all applicants for admission or enrolled
students, even those who believe they are Michigan residents, understand they may be asked to
complete an Application for Resident Classification and provide additional information to document
their residency status. We realize at the outcome of a residency determinate of ion is a critical factor for
many students in their enrollment dcision. Please read thessse guidelines carefully so you understand
how a residency determination is made and how to verify your eligibility for resident classification.
YOU MAY STILL NEED TO FILE A RESIDENCY AlPLICATIO
If you believe you are a Michigan resident and any of the following circumstances apply, you
must file an Application for Resident Classification and be approved to qualify for in-state
tuition:
*   you currently live outside the state of Michigan for any purpose, including, but not limited to,
education, volunteer activities, military service, travel, employment.
*   you have attended or graduated from a college outside the state of Michigan.
*   you have been employed or domiciled outside the state of Michigan within the last three years.
*   you are not a U.S. citizen or Permanent Resident Alien (if you're a Permanent Resident Alien,
you must have a Permanent Resident Alien card).
*   your spouse, partner, or parent is in Michigan as a nonresident student, medical resident,
fellow, or for military assignment or other temporary employment.
*   you are 24 years of age or younger and a parent lives outside the state of Michigan.
*   you are 24 years of age or younger and have attended or graduated from a high school outside
the state of Michigan.
*   you have attended or graduated from an out-of-state high school and have been involved in
educational pursuits for the majority of time since high school graduation.
*   you previously attended any U-M campus (Ann Arbor, Dearborn, or Flint) as a nonresident.
Other circumstances may also require you to file a residency application.
IHOW AND WHERE.t DO I FILE A RESIDENCY AP3PLICATION?
Residency applications and in-person assistance are available at the Residency Classification Office,
1514 LSA Bldg., 500 South State Street, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1382, phone
(734) 764-1400. Business hours are 8 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays.
FILING DEADLINES
September 30 for Fall Term
January 31 for Winter Term
July 31 for Spring, Spring/Summer, and Summer Terms
Applications must be received in the Residency Classification Office by 5 p.m. on the deadline date.
If the deadline falls on a weekend, it will be extended to the next business day. The deadline date is


295




April Meeting, 2002 - Appendix A - Residency Classification Guidelines


always after the first day of classes of the term in which you are enrolling and seeking residency.
These deadlines apply to all U-M schools, colleges, and campuses. For the On-Job/On-Campus
program only, filing deadlines are 30 calendar days after the first scheduled day of classes of the term
applied for. You may apply for resident classification for any term in which you are enrolled or intend
to enroll.
Late applications will be assessed a nonrefundable $300 late fee and will be accepted up to the last
published day of classes of the term for which you are applying. Late applications received after the
last day of classes will be processed for the following term. In all cases, decisions will be based only
on those facts that are in place by the original filing deadline for the term under consideration.
WHAlT D3     MENTSDO 1301 NEED TO FILE FOR RESIDENT CLASSIFCATlION?
Along with the completed Application for Resident Classification form, you must provide the
following:
*  for all applicants: copies of your driver's license and the license(s) of the person or persons
upon whom you are basing your claim to resident eligibility.
*  for all applicants: copies of the front and signature pages of the most recent year's federal
and state income tax returns and W2 forms for you and the person or persons upon whom you
are basing your claim to resident eligibility.
*  for applicants born outside the U.S.: verification of U.S. citizenship or visa status.
*  for applicants who are dependents (see Residency Classification Guideline B-l below):
copies of the front and signature pages of your parents' most recent year's federal and state
income tax returns with accompanying W2 forms.
*  for applicants whose claim to eligibility for resident classification is based on permanent,
full-time employment for themselves, a spouse, partner, or parent: a letter from the
employer, written on letterhead (including phone number), stating the position, status, and dates
of employment. In addition to the letter, provide a copy of the most recent pay stub showing
Michigan taxes being withheld.
* for all applicants: any other documentation that supports your claim to resident eligibility.
The Residency Classification Office may request additional documentation. All information will be
kept confidential to the extent permitted by law.
In making residency determinations, the University considers all information provided in or with an
application. Decisions to approve a residency application are made when the applicant has presented
clear and convincing evidence that a permanent domicile in the state of Michigan has been established.
Because each of Michigan's public universities has autonomous authority to establish residency
guidelines for admission and tuition purposes, guidelines vary by school and are independent of
regulations used by other state authorities to determine iesidency for such purposes as income and
property tax liability, driving, and voting.  The University of Michigan's current Residency
Classification Guidelines were approved by its Board of Regents to take effect Spring Term 2002 and to
apply to students at all campuses.
The Board of Regents has authorized the Residency Classification Office in the Office of the Registrar
on the Ann Arbor campus to administer the University's residency guidelines. If your activities and
circumstances as documented to the Residency Classification Office demonstrate establishment of a
permanent domicile in Michigan, you will be classified as a resident once your eligibility has been


296




April Meeting, 2002 - Appendix A - Residency Classification Guidelines


confirmed. If your presence in the state is based on activities or circumstances that are determined to
be temporary or indeterminate, you will be classified as a nonresident.
Our Residency Classification Guidelines explain how you can document establishment of a permanent
domicile in Michigan. To overcome a presumption of nonresident status, you must file a residency
application and document that a Michigan domicile has been established. Eligibility criteria are
explained in more detail in sections A and B of this document. Meeting the criteria to be placed in an
"eligible" category doesn't guarantee that you will automatically be classified a resident. If you have had
any out-of-state activities or ties, or if the University otherwise questions your residency status, you
will need to confirm your eligibility to be classified as a resident by filing an Application for Resident
Classification in a timely manner and by providing clear and convincing evidence that you are eligible
for resident classification under the following Guidelines.
A. GENERAL GUIDELINES
1. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAYDEMONSTRATE PERMANENT DOMICILE
The following circumstances and activities, though not conclusive or exhaustive, may lend support to a
claim to eligibility for resident classification if other applicable Guidelines (see section B) are met:
*  both parents (in the case of divorce, one parent) permanently domiciled in Michigan as
demonstrated by permanent employment, establishment of a household, and severance of
out-of-state ties.
*   applicant employed in Michigan in a full-time, permanent position, provided that the applicant's
employment is the primary purpose for his or her presence in the state and that out-of-state ties
have been severed. If the applicant is married or has a partner, the employment must be the
primary purpose for the family's presence in Michigan.
*   spouse or partner employed in Michigan in a full-time, permanent position, provided that the
employment of the spouse or partner is the primary purpose for the family's presence in the
state, and that out-of-state ties have been severed.
2. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DO NOT DEMONSTRATE PERMANENT DOMICILE
The circumstances and activities listed below are temporary or indeterminate and do not demonstrate
permanent domicile:
*   enrollment in high school, community college, or university.
*  participation in a medical residency program, fellowship, or internship.
*   employment that is temporary or short-term or of the type usually considered an internship or
apprenticeship.
*   employment of the spouse or partner of an individual who is in Michigan for temporary
pursuits.
*   employment in a position normally held by a student.
*   military assignment in Michigan for the applicant or the applicant's spouse, partner, or parent
(see section C for special military provision).
*  payment of Michigan income tax and/or filing of Michigan resident income tax returns.
*  presence of relatives (other than parents).
* ownership of property or payment of Michigan property taxes.
*  possession of a Michigan driver's license.


297




April Meeting, 2002 - Appendix A - Residency Classification Guidelines


*  voter registration in Michigan.
*  possession of a Permanent Resident Alien visa.
*  continuous physical presence for one year or more.
*   statement of intent to be domiciled in Michigan.
B. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR RESIDENCY
Even if one or more of the following circumstances applies to you, you may still need to file an
application for resident classification. If you have had any out-of-state activity or have any out-of-state
ties, you must submit an Application for Resident Classification by the filing deadline to request
resident classification and confirm your eligibility. You must document that you meet all of the
following applicable criteria to be eligible for resident classification and payment of in-state tuition.
1. DEPENDENT STUDENTS
For U-M residency classification purposes, you are presumed to be a dependent of your parents if you
are 24 years of age or younger and (1) have been primarily involved in educational pursuits, or (2) have
not been financially self-supporting through employment.
a. Residents
i. Dependent Student - Parents in Michigan If your parents are domiciled in Michigan as
defined by University Residency Classification Guidelines, you are presumed to be eligible for
resident classification as long as you have not taken steps to establish a domicile outside of
Michigan or any other action inconsistent with maintaining a domicile in Michigan.
ii. Dependent Student of Divorced Parents - One Parent in Michigan If your parents are
divorced, you are presumed to be eligible for resident classification if one parent is domiciled
in Michigan as defined by University Residency Classification Guidelines, and if you have not
taken steps to establish an independent domicile outside of Michigan or any other action
inconsistent with maintaining a domicile in Michigan.
iii. Dependent Resident Student Whose Parents Leave Michigan. If you are a student living
in Michigan and permanently domiciled in the state as defined by University Residency
Classification Guidelines, you are presumed to retain resident status eligibility if your parents
leave the state provided: (1) you have completed at least your junior year of high school prior
to your parents' departure, (2) you remain in Michigan, enrolled full-time in high school or an
institution of higher education, and (3) you have not taken steps to establish a domicile outside
Michigan or any other action inconsistent with maintaining a domicile in Michigan.
b. Nonresidents
The University presumes you are a nonresident if you are a dependent student and your parents are
domiciled outside the state of Michigan.
2. MICHIGAN RESIDENTS AND ABSENCES FROM THE STATE
You may be able to retain your eligibility for resident classification under the conditions listed below if
you are domiciled in Michigan as defined by University Residency Classification Guidelines and leave
the state for certain types of activities. However, if you have been absent from the state, you must file
an Application for Resident Classification by the appropriate filing deadline to request resident
classification and demonstrate your eligibility.
a. Absence for Active Duty Military Service (U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast
Guard, Officers in the Public Health Service), Non-Administrative Missionary Work, Peace
Corps, AmeriCorps, or Similar Philanthropic Work


298




April Meeting, 2002 - Appendix A - Residency Classification Guidelines


If you are domiciled in Michigan at the time of entry into active military duty, missionary work,
Peace Corps, or similar service, you are presumed to retain your eligibility for resident
classification as long as you are on continuous active duty or in continuous service and
continuously claim Michigan as the state of legal residence for income tax purposes. If you are a
dependent child of such an individual, you are presumed to be eligible for resident classification
provided: (1) you are coming to the U-M directly from high school or have been continuously
enrolled in college since graduating from high school, and (2) you have not claimed residency for
tuition purposes elsewhere.
b. Absence for Education or Training
If you are domiciled in Michigan immediately preceding an absence from the state for full-time
enrollment at a college or university or for a formal, full-time medical residency program, medical
internship or fellowship, you are presumed to retain your eligibility for resident classification
provided: (1) you have maintained significant ties to the state during your absence (e.g., your
parents remain domiciled in Michigan, you continue to maintain for personal family use the home
that was previously your principal residence in Michigan, etc.), (2) you sever out-of-state ties upon
returning to Michigan, and (3) you have not claimed residency for tuition purposes elsewhere.
c. Absence for Employment and Personal Development to Enhance Qualifications for a
Degree Program
The University recognizes the vital role of nonacademic and work experience in your education, and
many graduate programs require or recommend that you have up to three years of relevant work
experience before applying. If you were domiciled in Michigan immediately preceding an absence
from the state of three years or less, and the absence was for employment or personal development
activities undertaken for the purpose of enhancing qualifications for a degree program, you may
return to the University as a resident for admission and tuition purposes provided: (1) you have
maintained significant ties to the state during your absence (e.g., your parents remain domiciled in
Michigan, you continue to maintain for personal family use the home that was previously your
principal residence in Michigan, etc.), (2) you sever out-of-state ties upon returning to Michigan,
and (3) you have not claimed residency for tuition purposes elsewhere.
d. Temporary Absence of Less Than One Year
If you have been domiciled in Michigan immediately preceding other absences from the state and
you return within one year, you are presumed to retain eligibility for resident classification
provided: (1) you have maintained significant ties to the state during your absence (e.g., your
parents remain domiciled in Michigan, you continue to maintain for personal family use the home
that was previously your principal residence in Michigan, etc.), (2) you sever out-of-state ties upon
returning to Michigan, and (3) you have not claimed residency for tuition purposes elsewhere.
3. IMMIGRANTS AND ALIENS
You must be entitled to reside permanently in the United States to be eligible for resident classification
at the University. However, like U.S. citizens, you must also show you have established a Michigan
domicile as defined in these Guidelines. The Residency Classification Office will review Applications
for Resident Classification if you are in one of the following immigrant categories:
*  Permanent Resident Aliens (Must be fully processed and possess Permanent Resident Alien
card or stamp in a passport verifying final approval by filing deadline for applicable term.)
*   Refugees (1-94 card must designate "Refugee.")
*  A, E (primary), G and I visa holders (Based upon current law, these nonimmigrant visa
classifications are the only ones that permit the visa holder to establish a domicile in the
United States.)
4. ONE YEAR CONTINUOUS PHYSICAL PRESENCE


299




April Meeting, 2002 - Appendix A - Residency Classification Guidelines


If you are unable to demonstrate establishment of a domicile in Michigan as defined by the University's
Guidelines, you will be required to document one year of continuous physical presence in the state as
part of your efforts to demonstrate eligibility for resident classification in any subsequent application.
The year to be documented will be the year immediately preceding the first day of classes of the term
for which residency is sought.
The year of continuous physical presence in the state is never the only criterion for determining
eligibility for resident classification and, in itself, will not qualify you for resident status (see sections
A 1 and B 1, 2, and 3 for additional eligibility criteria).
If there is a significant change in the circumstances regarding your presence in Michigan and you can
clearly demonstrate that you have established a permanent Michigan domicile, you may be eligible for
resident classification prior to the passage of one year of physical presence in the state and are
encouraged to submit an Application for Resident Classification for any subsequent term in accordance
with the applicable filing deadline.
To demonstrate the year of continuous presence in Michigan, you will need to document actual physical
presence through enrollment, employment, in-person financial transactions, etc.
Having a lease or a permanent address in the state does not, in itself, qualify as physical presence. Short
absences (summer vacation of 21 days or less, spring break, and the break between fall and winter term)
nature will e assessed to determine whether it is contrary to an intent to be domiciled in Michigan. If
you are absent from the state for periods of time other than those mentioned above or fail to document
your presence at the beginning and end of the year, you will not meet the criteria for the one-year
continuous physical presence requirement.
C SPECIAL PROVISION FOR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL
ASSIGNED TO MICHIGAN
Active duty military personnel who are on assignment in Michigan, as well as their accompanying
spouses and dependent children, will be allowed to pay in-state tuition while they attend the University
of Michigan, even though they will not be eligible to be classified as residents under the Residency
Classification Guidelines. This provision applies to persons in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines
and Coast Guard, and to officers in the Public Health Service. In order to request this special
consideration, the student must submit a residency application by the applicable filing deadline and
provide documentation demonstrating eligibility.
D. HOW CAN I APPEAL?
If you filed an Application for Resident Classification and were denied by the Residency
Classification Office, you have recourse to an appeal process by filing a written appeal within
30 calendar days of the denial.
The Board of Regents established the Residency Appeal Committee to review decisions made by the
Residency Classification Office. The Appeal Committee is chaired by the Vice President and Secretary
of the University and includes two other University administrators, a faculty member, and a student. The
Residency Coordinator and other staff members in the Residency Classification Office are not part of
the Appeal Committee.
Appeals, which must be in writing, should be submitted to the Residency Classification Office.
Please note that the written appeal must be received by the Residency Classification Office
within 30 calendar days of the date on the denial letter.
If the deadline falls on a weekend or University holiday, it will be extended to the next business day. If
there is additional information you would like the Residency Appeal Committee to consider beyond the


300




April Meeting, 2002 - Appendix A - Residency Classification Guidelines


materials you already have submitted, you should submit that additional information, in writing, with
appropriate supporting documentation, when you submit your written appeal. Your request and any
additional information and documentation you provide will be forwarded to the Residency Appeal
Committee with your original file.
All communications to the Residency Appeal Committee must be in writing. Personal contact with a
member of the Committee could disqualify the member from participating in the decision regarding
your residency. The Residency Appeal Committee does not meet in person with students, and
appearances on behalf of students are not permitted at appeal meetings.
After the Appeal Committee has completed its deliberations, you will receive the Committee's final
decision in writing. This will conclude the appeal process for the term covered by the application. The
University will not conduct any further review of the decision.
Warning: Misrepresentation or Falsification of Information Can be Costly
Individuals who provide false or misleading information or omit relevant information
in an application for admission or for resident classification, or any other document
related to residency eligibility, may be subject to legal or disciplinary measures.
Students who are improperly classified as residents based on such information will
have their residency classification changed and may be retroactively charged
nonresident tuition for the period of time they were improperly classified. The
University also reserves the right to audit prospective or enrolled students at any time
regarding eligibility for resident classification and to reclassify students who are
classified incorrectly.

MAY MEETING, 2002


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, May 16. 2002
The Regents convened at 2:45 p.m. in the Professional Education Center on the
campus of the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Present were Interim President White
and Regents Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and Taylor. Also present
were Interim Provost Courant, Vice President Harper, Vice President and General
Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Little, Chancellor Mestas, Interim Chief Financial Officer
Slottow, Vice President and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regents Brandon and White were absent, as were Executive Vice
President Omenn and Vice President Rudgers.
President's Opening Remarks
Interim President White called the meeting to order. He thanked Chancellor Little and
members of the Dearborn campus community for hosting the meeting.
Interim President White commented on the recent decision by the U.S. 6th Circuit
Court of Appeals upholding the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action
admissions policy. He noted that the court had upheld the University's research-based
findings of the vital importance of a diverse student body in achieving educational
excellence for all students. He pointed out that more than 100 organizations had
supported the University's policy in the case, including corporations, other educational
institutions, unions, and non-profit organizations. He thanked everyone at the University
who had contributed to the University's efforts on this case.
Interim President White commented on notable events and achievements of
University faculty, staff, and students from the Ann Arbor and Dearborn campuses during
the past month.
Interim President White reported that prior to the start of the meeting, the Regents
had toured the Ford Training and Development Center, located proximal to the Dearborn
Campus, and that discussions have taken place regarding the possible acquisition of the
facility by the University of Michigan-Dearborn. He called on Regent Deitch.
Regent Deitch observed that the facility was very impressive but also very large and
would be a major addition to the campus. He noted that all of the ramifications of its
possible acquisition would need to be considered before any decisions can be made. He
requested that the administration undertake further study and analysis of the proposition,
and then consult with the Board of Regents.
Regent Deitch further commented that the Regents had established a new internal
governance structure several months ago that included a chair, a vice chair, and two
committees. He stated that he would be proposing suggestions for vice chair and
committee memberships at the next meeting. Once the committees have been named, each
will develop a suggested charter, function, and structure in conjunction with the
administration. He observed that a major project such as acquisition of the Ford facility


303




May Meeting, 2002


is just the type of proposition that would be suitable for study by such a Regental
committee.
Interim President White said that extensive due diligence is being performed in
conjunction with the Ford facility, and that all understand that the Regents are the sole
final authority on all property matters involving the University of Michigan.
University of Michigan-Dearborn School of Education Initiatives
John Poster, dean of the University of Michigan-Dearborn School of Education,
described the school's Master of Arts in Teaching program, which is designed for
individuals who have a bachelor's degree and are employed in a field other than teaching.
As part of this program, students can serve as full-time substitute teachers to satisfy the
student teaching requirement. He called on Professor Gail Luera, who gave a presentation
on the capstone course to integrate science and sustain professional development in
elementary science education, and Professor Mesut Duran, who presented information
about the Michigan Teachers' Technology Education Network (MITTEN), which prepares
educators to integrate information technology in their professional practice.
Annual Recommendations for Promotion to the Ranks of Professor and Associate
Professor
Am Arbor Camp. Interim Provost Courant reviewed the process for faculty
promotion and tenure at the University and noted that it is an extremely thorough, arduous,
and comprehensive process that is done as carefully and seriously as possible because of
its impact on the current and future intellectual quality of the University. As an example of
the range and breadth of the faculty, he highlighted the accomplishments of several faculty
members recommended for promotion: Meigan Aronson, associate professor of physics;
Scott J. Hollister, associate professor of biomedical engineering, without tenure, associate
professor of mechanical engineering and applied mechanics, without tenure, and associate
professor of surgery, with tenure; John E. Kuhn, assistant professor of surgery; Howard
Markel, associate professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases, with tenure and
associate professor of history, without tenure; Erle S. Robertson, assistant professor of
microbiology and immunology; Mieko Yoshihama, assistant professor of social work; and
Alford A. Young, Jr., assistant professor of sociology and assistant professor of
Afroamerican and African Studies.
Flint Capus. Chancellor Mestas observed that much is expected of faculty at the
University of Michigan-Flint. Although the mission emphasizes teaching, research is not
neglected, and there is a high expectation of service on the part of the Flint community.
He highlighted the dossier of Carolyn M. Gillespie, associate professor of theatre.
Dearborn Camlpus.    Chancellor Little reported that the tenure review  and
evaluation process is rigorous at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. He highlighted
the cases of Stephane Spoiden, assistant professor of French; and Mary Donegan,
assistant professor of education.
On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent Horning, the Regents
unanimously approved the annual promotions to the ranks of professor and associate
professor.


304




May Meeting, 2002


Report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF) - Ann Arbor
Campus
Interim President White called on Professor Fred Askari, chair of the CESF on the
Ann Arbor campus. Referring to the CESF report in the agenda book, Professor Askari
noted that the report is based on published data that has not previously been aggregated.
The data were obtained with the cooperation of the provost's office. The goal is to have
salary information available for policy decisions, not to provide conclusions or policy
recommendations.
Among the results of the study are that there are differences between aggregate
salaries by gender and that the use of unpublished salary supplements is common in most
units, with the magnitude of unpublished salary rates greatest in the Medical School.
Some of the key issues resulting from the report are whether serving for a long time in the
same position subjects individuals to a "loyalty tax;" whether pay is transparent; issues of
incentive pay, optimal pay, and equitable pay; and whether previously endorsed
compensation guidelines are being implemented.
Professor Askari commented that CESF is soliciting feedback for future objectives
and has requested data for nontenured faculty and unpublished salary data. It will be
important to see whether trends in faculty compensation over time change or remain the
same.
Regent Maynard suggested that the Ann Arbor CESF work in conjunction with the
parallel committees on the Dearborn and Flint campuses so that the data they present will
use the same methodology. This approach would allow the Regents to make comparisons
across all three campuses. Interim President White concurred that it would be useful for
data to be displayed in the same format for all three campuses.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Tedesco submitted for approval the minutes of the April 18,
2002 meeting.
Reports. Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow submitted reports of Investment
and Plant Extension. Interim Provost Courant submitted the Human Resources and
Affirmative Action Report and noted that AFSCME had recently voted to approve its
contract.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the Report of Projects
Established for the period of March 28 - April 3, 2002.
University of Michigan Health System. Interim President White reported, in the
absence of Executive Vice President Omenn, that through April 30, the operating margin
is $10.4 million (1.3%), which is slightly under the $11.2 million budget. He also
reported that in July the Health System would be presenting a budget with a 2% operating
margin. He commented that the ongoing discussions of the Health System issues would
resume at the June meeting with presentation of plans for the cardiovascular center
facility; an analysis of margin by service line; and quality, access, and satisfaction data.
The FY 03 operating budget will be presented in July, along with plans for the psychiatry


305




May Meeting, 2002


and depression center facility and the ophthalmology/Kellogg Eye Center and early
planning for the replacement children's and women's hospitals.
Regent Maynard noted that Executive Vice President Omenn had previously stated
that there are five major issues confronting the Health System, and she would like those to
be included in the discussion.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper had no additional report.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little gave a presentation about the
Rouge Gateway Greenways Project, which will provide access to the campus for
nonmotorized traffic. The project will serve as the first link in a network of Southeast
Michigan greenways and will continue the campus's tradition of environmental
leadership.  The Community Foundation for Southeastern Michigan created the
Greenways Initiative and in 2001 awarded $381,750 to the University in support of the
project. He noted that the total projected cost of the project is $1.35 million; no
University funds will be used. The project will be submitted for action by the Board of
Regents at the June or July meeting.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas noted that the dedication of the
William S. White Building will take place on Wednesday, June 5.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. MSA president Sarah Boot commented that
MSA was "thrilled" at the outcome of the Law School affirmative action court case and
noted that "MSA has long held a commitment to the valuable learning experience that our
diverse student body provides." She thanked the Regents and administration, on behalf
of MSA, for making the commitment to preserve the diversity of the campus.
Ms. Boot noted that the MSA report includes a list of upcoming projects from each
of MSA's five committees and 13 commissions, which represents the first step in creating
a vision for the future of MSA. The assembly has developed three broad themes to guide
its work for the coming year: maximizing efficiency by developing action plans for
achievement of goals; making campus improvements such as advocating for installation of
wireless web access in all schools and colleges; and building and improving
relationships among the student body. MSA will hold a retreat in the fall during which it
will prioritize its main goals and define standards of success.

databases were rapidly expanding, she successfully planned and implemented their
integration into the department. During this time, her contributions to the research
collection included selection of material in the areas of education and European history.
In 1986, Ms. Davidge assumed the role of head of serial services (formerly serial
services and records). She managed a service desk that provided access to current
periodicals and newspapers and check-in of serials. Ms. Davidge displayed a deep
sense of responsibility for maintaining the accurate and detailed holdings required of
records in serial services.
Through her dedication to professional excellence, her broad knowledge of the
library and its collections, her reference and selection roles, and her management of a
significant serial collection, holding, and records, Lyn Davidge contributed significantly
to the University Library and to the campus.
The Regents salute this distinguished librarian by naming Gwendolyn E. Davidge
associate librarian emerita.

professor in 1979. When the Department of Geography was discontinued in 1982,
Professor Deskins joined the Department of Sociology as professor of urban geography
and sociology. He served as associate chair (1973), acting chair (1974), and chair
(1975-79) of the geography department and as associate dean of the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies (1979-86). From 1988-92 he was director of the graduate
studies program for the sociology department.
In his highly productive career, Professor Deskins made important scholarly
contributions to our understanding of racial dynamics in American society. His research
spans such diverse topics as residential segregation, the construction of urban space,
racial factors in site location and employment patterns, economic restructuring and teen
pregnancy, and changing higher educational opportunities for minority graduate students.
In addition, Professor Deskins produced numerous reports on community and economic
development commissioned by the National Academy of Sciences and state and local
governments.
A demanding but compassionate mentor, Professor Deskins guided countless
doctoral students, many from historically under-represented backgrounds, to the
successful completion of their degrees. Furthermore, he continually injects the drama of
the human experience into his classroom. His undergraduate course on sports and
society, infused with his own life stories as an athlete, remains one of the sociology


324




May Meeting, 2002


department's most popular offerings. For his superior accomplishments, Professor
Deskins received numerous University and national awards and honors.
The Regents now salute this distinguished and multi-talented scholar, teacher, and
colleague by naming Donald R. Deskins professor emeritus of urban geography and
sociology.
Jay S. Finch, M.D., professor of anesthesiology in the Medical School, retired from
active faculty status on January 31, 2002.
Dr. Finch attended the University of Michigan as an undergraduate from 1954-57, at
which point he entered the University of Michigan Medical School, where he received
his M.D. degree in 1961. He served his internship and residency in general surgery at St.
Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor from 1961-63 and his residency in anesthesiology
at the University of Michigan Hospital from 1963-65. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty in 1965 as an instructor in anesthesiology. He was promoted to assistant

Dr. Finch's research focused primarily on the areas of pulmonary physiology and
mechanical ventilation.  In 1982, he developed a medical student laboratory in
respiratory physiology to provide medical students with practical experience in
pulmonary and cardiovascular physiology during their rotation on the anesthesiology
service.   He  also  developed  anesthesiology  self-instructional slide-tape  and
videocassette programs for medical students to use during their anesthesia clinical
clerkship. Dr. Finch created and directed the respiratory therapy unit within the
University of Michigan's anesthesiology department and was instrumental in establishing
the first respiratory care fellowship, which became the current Critical Care Medicine
Fellowship.
Dr. Finch's expertise in the art of respiratory therapy was recognized nationally by
appointments to the editorial board of Respiratory Therapy and as a consultant panel
member of the National Board of Respiratory Care. He served on numerous Medical
School and hospital committees and chaired many involved in respiratory care issues. Dr.
Finch was instrumental in starting the School of Respiratory Therapy at Washtenaw
Community College and served as its assistant medical director and medical director.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health care educator by naming Jay S.
Finch professor emeritus of anesthesiology.
Walter S. Gray, Ph.D., associate professor of physics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2002.

was appointed instructor in 1965. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1966 and
associate professor in 1970.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Professor Gray, together with Professors Tickle,
Bardwick and Parkinson, developed a high-resolution magnetic spectrometer for use with
the University of Michigan's 82-inch cyclotron using the so-called "dispersion-matching"
technique. This cyclotron was one of the few in the world capable of high-resolution
nuclear spectroscopy. Professor Gray and his students made a major improvement to the
spectrometer by developing a position-sensitive, silicon-diode, focal-plane detector array,


325




May Meeting, 2002


which permitted electronic acquisition and analysis. Several University of Michigan
doctoral students used this array to study in detail the characteristics of deformed nuclei,
verifying the "collective model" of nuclei proposed by Benjamin Mottelson and Aage Bohr.
Professor Gray served on the Rackham Divisional Board for the Physical Sciences
(1973-74) and the executive committee of the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility
users' group (1980-82). In 1978, he received a University of Michigan Rackham Faculty
Grant, and he was awarded the Literature, Science, and the Arts Ruth Sinclair Award for
Freshman-Sophomore Counseling in 1988. Most notably, he received the Literature,

Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, and appeared in numerous
summer festivals including Meadowbrook, Tanglewood, Cincinnati, Aldenburgh, and
Edinburgh. She also sang with the Handel Society in Washington, D.C., with Music of the
Baroque in Chicago, and she was soprano soloist with the Bach Aria Group for two years.
Professor Haywood performed with many major opera companies in the U.S. and in
Europe, including the Chicago Lyric Opera, the Dallas Civic Opera, the Royal Opera
House, and the English National Opera. Regarded as a leading interpreter of the operas of
Leos Janacek, she has sung this repertory around the globe.  Her recordings include
Wagner's Die Feen with the B.B.C. Symphony Orchestra, Mozart's Requiem with Amor
Atris, Paul Paray's Grammy-nominated Joan of Arc Mass with the Royal Scottish National
Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, and the Grammy-winning performance of Benjamin
Britten's War Requiem with Robert Shaw.
Professor Haywood has been conscientious, hard working, loyal, and dedicated to
making the University of Michigan a special place in which to study and learn, and she is
considered one of the leading vocal teachers here and abroad. Her students, colleagues,
and audiences have revered her with good cause.

David 0. Ross, Jr., Ph.D., professor of Greek and Latin in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2002.
Professor Ross received his B.A. degree from Yale University in 1958 and his M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard in 1962 and 1966, respectively. His career began as
assistant professor in the department of classics at Yale in 1966, and in 1971 he was
promoted to associate professor. Professor Ross joined the University of Michigan's
department of classical studies as a visiting associate professor of Greek and Latin in
1974. The following year he started his appointment as associate professor at the
University of Michigan, and he was promoted to professor in 1980.
Professor Ross's scholarly interests were mainly in the area of Latin poetry,
especially of the period from the end of the Roman Republic to the early years of the
Empire. This was an exciting period in which Roman poets revolutionized verse by
introducing sophisticated, often introspective motifs drawn from Greek Hellenistic
poetry, while simultaneously drawing on one another for inspiration. Through his precise
analysis of surviving texts, Professor Ross firmly established the main lines of this poetic
revolution. His two major books concern the poetry of Catullus in relation to his
predecessors and the instrumental role of the poet Gallus in the development of Roman
elegy as a major literary form.
From 1964-66 Professor Ross was a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome,
and in 1970-71 he held the Morse Fellowship at Yale University. He also lectured
frequently at other institutions, including the University of Rome. By touching the lives of

Professor Weiss received his Staatsexamen in German and English from the
University of Bonn in 1963 and his Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1968. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1968 and was
promoted to associate professor in 1975 and professor in 1982.
As a scholar, Professor Weiss has long enjoyed international visibility and
recognition stemming from his book that documents and interprets much previously
unknown material on H. Von Kleist and that will unquestionably remain a cornerstone of
research on this much admired and timely writer. Professor Weiss is equally well known
for his definitive editions of letters written by A. Von Arnim and of von Arnim's critical
writings. Professor Weiss's renown rests as well on the quantity, patent quality, and
remarkable diversity of his 77 shorter publications, which were interdisciplinary in their
approach long before that method became popular. These shorter publications include a
considerable number of papers on Novalis, which are based on extensive archival
research.
Professor Weiss continually taught demanding courses on advanced German
stylistics with outstanding success and excellent student evaluations, and he was no less
popular in his advanced literature courses on romanticism and leading authors of the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In addition to teaching and research, Professor
Weiss also served as the book review editor of Michigan Germanic Studies from
1991-2001 and markedly increased the journal's prestige and authority.

College. Professor Young joined the faculty at the University of Michigan as an associate
professor in 1968. He was promoted to professor in 1974. Professor Young served as
associate chair of the history department from 1993-95, and he was appointed the
Richard Hudson Professor of History in 1998. From 1998 to 2000, Professor Young
served as the director of the Center for Chinese Studies.
As a historian of Chinese history, Professor Young published numerous articles on
nationalism, reform, and revolution in early twentieth century China. This focus was
exemplified in his book published by the University of Michigan Press, The Presidency
of Yuan Shih-k'ai: Liberalism and Dictatorship in Early Republican China. More
recently, Professor Young began exploring Catholicism in nineteenth and twentieth
century China through an examination of an institution-the French Religious
Protectorate. This project elucidates how the French Religious Protectorate operated in
China and analyzes the protectorates role in shaping Sino-foreign relations at state and
local levels during this period.

SPECIAL MEETING, MAY 2002


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, May 29, 2002
The Regents convened at 9:10 a.m. in the Kuenzel Room at the Michigan Union.
Present were Interim President White and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, McGowan,
Newman, Taylor, and White. Regent Maynard participated by telephone.
Interim President White called the meeting to order, and announced that the purpose
of the meeting was to elect the University's 13th president. He welcomed special guests
who were seated in the audience and turned the proceedings over to Regent Deitch, chair
of the Board of Regents.
Regent Deitch made the following comments:
"As chair of the Presidential Search Committee and the Board of Regents,
I am pleased to announce that we have completed the search process, have
identified one finalist, and I am prepared, in a few minutes, to nominate that
finalist for election as the 13th president of the University of Michigan.
However, before I do that, I would like to go over the chronology of events that
has led us to this day and offer my appreciation to a number of people who
have contributed to the success of this process.
On October 8, 2001, Lee Bollinger was appointed president of Columbia
University. On October 19, 2001, the Regents appointed B. Joseph White as
interim president of the University, effective January 1, 2002. On November 15,
2001, we outlined the search process for the community. I was elected chair of
the Presidential Search Committee; Regent Dan Horning was elected vice
chair. We created a 16 person Presidential Search Advisory Committee. Its
function was to review nominations and develop a pool of candidates for
consideration by the Regents sitting as the Presidential Search Committee. The
advisory committee was conceived of as a broad based group of committed and
wise University citizens...and that it was. Including its chair, 10 of its 16
members are faculty in Ann Arbor, Flint, and Dearborn. The other members
represent students, staff, and alumni. Also, on November 15, the Regents named
Dr. Earl Lewis, dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, as
chair of the advisory committee. On November 30, 2001, the Presidential
Search Committee selected Shelly Weiss Storbeck of A. T. Kearney as our search
consultant. On December 13, 2001, the Regents announced the members of the
advisory committee.
They are, in addition to Dean Lewis, Patricia Gurin, Nicholas del Banco,
William Roush, Susan Alcock, Larry Root, John Greden, Tressa Pollock,
Paulette Cebulski, Rashmi Luthra, Lisa Jackson, Matt Nolan, Ted Spencer,
Anocha Cornell, Saul Green, and Michael Jandernoa.

SP ecial Meeting May 2002


On January 9, 2002, the advisory committee held its first meeting. On
January 17, 2002, the advisory committee met with the Regents to receive its
charge. In the ensuing 5 months, the advisory committee met formally 15 times
and put in countless additional hours of research and study... a truly
extraordinary commitment by 16 people with very busy lives. Dean Lewis met
individually with the Regents on 4 occasions. Dean Lewis and I had
innumerable telephone conversations. In fact, it's fair to say that we were in
constant contact. The Regents, sitting as the Presidential Search Committee,
also had many meetings and devoted many additional hours of study to this
task.
We believe that our search was focused, thorough and thoughtful. The
work was, in my judgment, done in a professional and dispassionate way. The
pool of candidates was superb. In my judgment, that fact is reflective of both
Michigan's unique place in higher education and the efficient and highly
confidential process which we put in place. I can, today, confidently assert,
based on empirical evidence, that every person involved was motivated by only
one goal: namely, to find and recruit the very best person available to lead this
great University. Each of the Regents will, I hope, speak individually. Speaking
as one person, I can tell you that we took this enormous responsibility as
seriously as one can undertake any endeavor. By the Michigan Constitution,
the job of electing the president ultimately belongs to the Regents alone. Bar
none, this is the Regents' most important responsibility. I say that because the
University is owned by the people of Michigan and we 8 elected Regents are
their proxy. Given that fact, this is the one moment when we most definitively
act on our commitment to be good stewards for the University's future. As you
will see shortly, I am very proud to say that we 8 very diverse people acted
cohesively and well in making this choice.
Now, before I nominate our next president, some thank yous are in order,
as I said at the beginning of my remarks.
First and foremost, I want to thank the University's interim president, Joe
White. I also want to thank Joe's spouse, Mary D. White. Both Joe and Mary
are great citizens of this University and esteemed longtime members of the Ann
Arbor community. From the date that we asked Joe to assume the presidency on
an interim basis, he and Mary have poured their hearts and souls into the
myriad responsibilities that are the president's job. Joe not only kept the
University running but enabled it to move forward with impressive momentum.
He has been a wise counselor to me as the Board's first chair and I am grateful
for that. For the rest of my life, when I think of Joe White, I will think of the old
expression "You can never go wrong by doing the right thing." Joe's instincts
have always been to do the right thing for the University. Joe dedicated his
service as interim president to the 17 Michigan alumni who died at the World
Trade Center on September 11. Joe, you did them proud. We are in your debt.
[Standing Ovation] Prior to the completion of his tenure, we will offer more
formal recognition to Joe and Mary White.
I also want to thank Earl Lewis and the advisory committee. Earl is a
notably effective leader. Calm. Thoughtful. Strategic. Unflappable. The Regents


340




Special Meeting, May 2002


knew that we wanted a dean to chair the advisory committee. As we all know,
we as a university benefit from wise and competent decanal leadership across
the board and picking that one leader from a group of extraordinary people
was difficult. The advisory committee's performance was excellent and proved
that we made both a wise and fortuitous choice. Thank you, Dr. Lewis.
I also want to thank the various members of the advisory committee.
Around here, people often glibly speak of their "love" for the institution. These
16 men and women proved it by their self-sacrifice and dispassionate,
thoughtful, wise counsel. Similar thanks go to our talented and dedicated staff
without whom we could not have completed our work in such exemplary
fashion. First among these people is Barbara Wagner. Thank you, Barbara.
Now, with that prelude complete, I have the honor of informing you that
Dr. Mary Sue Coleman is the finalist in the Presidential Search Committee's
search to appoint the next president of the University of Michigan.
Currently, Dr. Coleman is president, professor of biochemistry and
professor of biological sciences at the University of Iowa. She has served with
distinction as president of that great public research university since 1995. We
believe she will prove to be one of the great leaders in Michigan's history. She
was quite simply the best candidate in an extraordinary field and we will be
fortunate to have her. We are very impressed with her breadth of experience
and superb credentials and trust that the community will be, as well.
Dr. Coleman is a distinguished scientist. As a cancer researcher, her work
focused on the immune system and malignancies. Her laboratories were
continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health for over 20 years. Dr.
Coleman is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of
Sciences, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
She is a national leader in higher education. Please allow me to give you
just a few examples:
* She co-chairs the Institute of Medicine's Committee on the Consequences
of Uninsurance
* She serves on the board of trustees of the Universities Research
Association, as well as on:
^ the American Counsel on Education Board of Directors, Task Force on
Teacher Education and the Commission on Minorities in Higher
Education;
* the board of trustees of Grinnell College;
e the Association of American Universities Executive Committee and the
Task Force on Research Accountability;
* the President's Leadership Group of the Higher Education Center for
Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention; and
* the NCAA board of directors. Previously, she served on the Knight
Commission.


341




Special Meeting, May 2002


After earning her bachelor's degree in chemistry from Grinnell College
and her Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of North Carolina, she
conducted postdoctoral work at North Carolina and at the University of Texas,
Austin. She is married to Dr. Kenneth Coleman, a political scientist
specializing in Latin America. They have one son, Jonathan, who is a portfolio
manager for the Janus Capital Corporation in Denver, Colorado. Ken and
Jonathan are here with us today to join in this happy occasion. Unfortunately,
Jonathan's new wife, of a little over 2 weeks, couldn't be with us today. We
welcome the entire Coleman family to our extended University of Michigan
family.
I could go on and on. However, my friend, Regent Taylor, will want me to
stop now. Therefore, it is my privilege to offer the following resolution:
Nomination of President
I present the finalist and hereby nominate, Dr. Mary Sue
Coleman, for the position of thirteenth president of the University of
Michigan.
I propose that Dr. Coleman be appointed br a term of five years
efJfctive August 1, 2002.   She will assume all the duties and
responsibilities of the presidency and will receive all the usual and
custom ay benefits associated with the office.  I further propose that
her salary be $475,000for the upcoming academic year. In addition, I
propose that she be provided with deferred compensation of $75,000
per year fiull vesting at the end of five years and a retention bonus of
$500,000 if she is still president of the Universit of Michigan at the
end of her initialfive-year term.
We have discussed these terms preliminarily with Dr. Coleman
and I now seek the Board's approval of this formal offer to her. Subject
to the Board's approval at the June Regents' meeting, we will finalize a
complete contract with Dr. Coleman.
Regent Newman seconded the motion.
Regent McGowan made the following comments:
"So many people who cherish this university have helped it -- and us --
over these many months.
For members of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee, theirs, too,
was a labor of love. But they had the responsibility of providing the Board of
Regents with a thorough and frank assessment of the University's options.
Their efforts in fulfilling this responsibility were truly magnificent. They
brought representative democracy, together with their collective sagacity, to
show a full understanding of how the University of Michigan graces public
higher education morally, intellectually, and through its leadership.  The
contributions of the people of this committee will be reflected in our every
success ahead.
Our own conversations with President-designate Coleman have been
exciting, forward-looking and yet, somehow, reassuringly familiar. She will


342




S ecial Meeting May 2002


talk to you, too, about why it is critical that one of the great research
universities be a public university, about what defines an educated person. She
will express her commitment to building diverse intellectual communities as
one practiced in the effort, convinced of its rightness, and proud, as president
of another Big Ten university, of this University's strong defense of its
admissions policies. And shortly, she 'll speak for herself. She will be a strong,
creative, experienced, thoughtful and successful president of the University of
Michigan. The job of this Board now becomes one of supporting her as she
leads in extending the University's reach through advancements in many fields
of knowledge.
And let it be said again and again! -- Girls can do math and science!
We all look forward to welcoming the Colemans to Ann Arbor, to
Michigan, and to this University on August 1.
Joe and Mary White stepped nimbly into the interim leadership of this
community on January 1; Joe's able leadership enabled each of us to be free to
pursue our own responsibilities at Michigan during what could have been an
awkward period. I admire them greatly for how they have met the challenges of
leadership."
Regent Horning stated that he associated himself with Regent Deitch's and Regent
McGowan's comments and said to Interim President White, "Joe, I can't thank you
enough for the way you've handled the leadership and stewardship of this university these
past few months. You and Mary have been and will always be integral parts of the
Michigan family and the Michigan puzzle, and from the bottom of my heart, I can't thank
you enough." To the Coleman family, he said, "Welcome to Ann Arbor. It is a
remarkable, special place â€”the world's greatest public institution â€”and I can only think
that your arrival here today will make it greater." He also thanked the search advisory
committee, commenting, "It worked. People said it couldn't be done and it was done."
Regent Taylor thanked Joe and Mary White, noting that being an interim president
"is no easy job." "You did a magnificent job, Joe," he stated, "and to you and Mary we
will always be indebted." Regarding the search advisory committee, he commented that
they had done an amazing job, putting in many hours of work. He observed that Dean
Lewis had said that the advisory committee' s job was "to make our job hard, and they did
that." He also expressed the University's gratitude for the advisory committee's efforts.
Regent Taylor observed that the search process had been "fun" and "exciting," and
that the Regents had met "a whole host of magnificent people." "In President Coleman,"
he concluded, "I think we've hit a home run." He congratulated her and her family and
said he looked forward to their moving to Ann Arbor.
Regent Brandon thanked everyone involved in the process and observed that he had
learned a lot. "I need to say today," he commented, "that the only job that may be more
challenging than that of president of the University of Michigan is to be interim president
of the University of Michigan. Joe did a fantastic job, and I am personally grateful for all
that you did." He said he was excited by Dr. Coleman's imminent arrival and welcomed
her and her family. "You are the best of the best," he noted, "and we're pleased that
you're here."


343




Special Meeting, May 2002


Regent Brandon also commented out that the whole process had been well run,
effective, and efficient, and that the confidentiality that was so important to attracting a
terrific group of candidates had been maintained. He thanked Regent Deitch for his
efforts and commitment to advancing the process and seeing that it concluded ahead of
schedule.
Regent Maynard commented that "we can all be proud of the Presidential Search
Advisory Committee and of the Regents acting as the Presidential Search Committee."
She thanked Regents Deitch and Horning for the extra time and effort they had expended
on the search effort.
She commented, "It is with great enthusiasm that I support the election of Dr. Mary
Sue Coleman to the presidency of the University of Michigan. She will bring wise and
energetic leadership to this great public institution, and I look forward to serving as a
Regent during her presidency." Regent Maynard also thanked Interim President Joe
White and his wife, Mary, "for their outstanding contributions to the University over the
past six months, noting that "Joe's commitment and his dedication to Michigan has
inspired all of us. So now I join with all of you as we commit ourselves to moving the
University of Michigan to its next step of greatness."
Regent White recognized "the extraordinary commitment President White and Mary
White have had to the University over the years," and thanked them for their devoted
service. She also thanked Dean Lewis and the search advisory committee for having
come up with such "phenomenal" candidates for the Regents' consideration. Finally, she
welcomed Dr. Coleman and her family to the University of Michigan. She noted how
fortunate the University is to have her here and said that she looked forward very much to
working with her.
Regent Newman associated herself with the other Regents' remarks, thanked Joe and
Mary White for their service, and welcomed the Coleman family to Michigan.
The vote was then taken on Regent Deitch's motion nominating Mary Sue Coleman
as president, and it was approved unanimously. Regent Deitch then introduced Dr.
Coleman to the assembly, and there was a standing ovation.
Dr. Coleman observed that "this is the thrill of a lifetime." She noted that her
88-year-old mother, who had cried when she learned the news, had understood what it
meant to be named president of the University of Michigan -- "one of the very greatest
public universities in the country."
Dr. Coleman thanked Interim President White for his offer of help and counsel
during the transition period. She thanked Dean Lewis and the Presidential Search
Advisory Committee, observing what an exciting experience it had been to meet with
such an "intellectually challenging and alive group" with whom she felt immediately at
home.
Dr. Coleman commented that her first meeting with the Board of Regents had also
been exciting because they were "a group of very intellectually combative people" who
don't always agree on everything. But she noted that they were unanimous in their love of
Michigan, and commented that "it warms the heart of a potential president to know that
the Regents are there to defend the University of Michigan over all else. I'll tell you, it
means everything. And it particularly means everything in a great public university. I'm


344




S ecial Meeting May 2002


passionate about public university education, and that's why it is such a great thrill for me
to be at the best public university in the country."
Dr. Coleman displayed some gifts she had been given to illustrate cultural and
corporate icons associated with the state of Michigan, including Sanders dessert topping,
a toy automobile, Vernors soda, a Motown CD, and a novel by Detroit native Elmore
Leonard. She again stated how thrilled she was. "This is going to be the experience of a
lifetime. It is going to be a wonderful journey, and I'm going to need all of you at the
University to help us make the University better. I look forward to your wise counsel and
your advice, and I'm thrilled as can be to be part of this wonderful community. Thank
you very much."
A standing ovation followed.
Regent Deitch thanked Vice President Tedesco for her counsel and assistance during
the search process. "I think what is called for as I call to adjourn the meeting now are
hugs, congratulations, more happiness and laughter, as we go forward into the future with
our new president. Thank you all for being here."
The meeting was adjourned at 9:40 p.m. A press conference ensued from 10:15 -
11:15 a.m.

JUNE MEETING, 2002


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thu rsday, June 20. 2002
The Regents convened at 1:30 p.m. in the Regents' Room Present were Interim
President White and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Horning, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
and White. Also present were Interim Provost Courant, Vice President Harper, Vice
President and General Counsel Krislov, Chancellor Mestas, Executive Vice President
Omenn, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Chief Financial Officer Slottow, Vice President
and Secretary Tedesco, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent
Taylor was absent, as was Chancellor Little.
President's Opening Remarks
Interim President White called the meeting to order. He commented on notable events
and achievements of University faculty, staff, and students during the past month, and he
called attention to the recent deaths of emeritus and active faculty members.
Comments from Regent Deitch
Board Organization and Structure. Regent Deitch noted that it had been announced
at the May meeting that the structural organization of the Board would be completed at this
meeting. He said that within the next several months the Regents would work with
President-Elect Coleman and Vice President Tedesco to determine charters and scope of
activity for board committees.
Regent Deitch nominated Regent Andrea Fischer Newman as vice chair of the
Board. Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regent Deitch announced the appointment of Regents Brandon, McGowan, and
Taylor to the Finance Committee, with Regent Brandon serving as chair. He appointed
Regents Maynard, Horning, and White to the Personnel Committee, with Regent Maynard
as chair.
Contract for President-Elect Coleman. Regent Deitch stated that the contract for
President Elect Coleman was not quite finalized yet. He noted that the parties are in
fundamental agreement on everything; there are technical issues related to deferred
compensation that need to be resolved. He stated he had recently spoken with President
Elect Coleman, and she was comfortable with the contract being finalized within the next
couple of weeks.
Residence Hall Safety and Security
Vice President Harper observed that there had been a series of incidents of home
evasion and "peeping toms" in the residence halls during the past academic year which had
led to a renewed scrutiny of the Housing Division's security protocol, staffing patterns,
structure, and equipment. This was done while attempting to balance the desire to ensure
the highest safety possible for students while making sure that the residence hall experience
would encourage openness and interaction among the residents.


347




June Meeting, 2002


Vice President Harper enumerated the steps that had been taken in conjunction with
the Department of Public Safety (DPS), including institution of 24-hour controlled access
to all residence halls, expanding daytime patrols and coverage in selected halls, and
stepping up educational efforts aimed at students. She introduced Bill Bess, director of
DPS.
Mr. Bess described efforts that are being taken to enhance general security in the
residence halls and to specifically address personal and property security in all halls so
as to reduce opportunities for home invasions, thefts, peeping tom cases, and other
intrusions by uninvited persons. The major focus of the current efforts is on changing
student behavior since previous crime prevention efforts had failed to do so. This can be
explained by the fact that 95% of students feel safe or very safe in residence halls.
Mr. Bess listed some of the steps that have already been implemented for residence
halls:  extra patrols and police visibility; 24-hour controlled access at hall entrances;
weekly meetings for summer camping program personnel to make sure that safety and
security issues are addressed; and expansion of the crime prevention program (more
posters, floor meetings, written communications). In addition, automatic door-locking
devices that will require the use of student ID cards to activate will be installed in all
residence hall rooms.
Mr. Bess noted that cameras will be used at the main access entrances of the halls.
These will not be actively monitored all of the time but will be used primarily for
investigative purposes. DPS has worked with the new student orientation program to
improve its presentations at these sessions. In addition, security has been tightened at the
summer camps that utilize residence halls. DPS has also sponsored a "crime prevention
through environmental design" program, which will train staff to become more familiar
with things that can be done in the design process to reduce the opportunities for the
commission of crime.
In summary, Mr. Bess stated that the department is very pleased with the progress
that has been made so far in all of the targeted areas. A discussion then followed in
which Mr. Bess and Vice President Harper responded to questions and suggestions from
the Regents about specific aspects of the residence hall safety program.
Interim President White praised Mr. Bess for the highly professional, sensitive
manner in which he carries out his duties.
University of Michigan Health System Topics
Executive Vice President Omenn gave a presentation continuing previous discussions
on issues related to the University of Michigan Health System. He observed that the
overriding challenge facing the Health System is to provide world-class medical care
while educating the next generation of physicians, contributing substantially to the advance
of medical knowledge, technologies, and care models, and remaining financially sound.
The five key elements of this challenge for the Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) are
quality, faculty development, operating margin, productivity, and supply chain management.
Quality: Executive Vice President Omenn stated that the Health System's goal is to
stay at the leading edge in technology development, implementation of innovations in
care, and improvement of service quality. The institution believes that "there is a
business case for quality."


348




June Meeting, 2002


Faculty Development:  The Health System's goal in this area is to work
continuously to enhance recruitment, retention, and multi-stage career development of
outstanding faculty in a wide variety of fields, with similar efforts for staff.
Operating Margin (Financial Performance): The Health System desires to continue
to grow, increasing volumes and revenues, and achieving a 2% operating margin while
managing capacity constraints. He noted that the 2% margin is a substantial challenge and
a worthy goal and aiming for a larger margin would lead to problems in meeting the other
elements of the institution's mission. Regarding capacity constraints, he commented that
over the past few years, many specific actions have been initiated that taken together have
enhanced the use of existing physical assets and created additional assets. These include
converting general care beds to cardiac monitoring beds; re-opening certain closed
inpatient units in such areas as cardiology and cardiac surgery; addition of operating
rooms; substantial expansion of the emergency department; and development of new
outpatient clinical facilities. Year-to-date for FY 2002, he reported, the operating margin
is $11.6 million (1.3 percent). Figures for revenues, expenses, clinic visits, and hospital
admissions are all very close to budget for FY 2002.
Productivity: In this area, the Health System emphasizes work redesign, training,
benchmarking, capital investment, and building positive attitudes. He observed that
engaging people in the design of their work gives people a sense of pride and improves
productivity.
Executive Vice President Omenn responded to a question from Regent McGowan
about the effect that new guidelines limiting the number of work hours per week for
medical residents will have on their education and on hospital finances, capacity, and
operation. He noted that there is debate about how the 80 hours per week work schedule
maximum is to be calculated, how emergencies are to be handled, and other matters, such
as the fact that residents may moonlight at other hospitals. Executive Vice President
Omenn commented that, in certain major specialty areas, the guidelines are close to being
met already and the guidelines do not present a material financial problem.
Educationally, this is a challenging, sensitive issue with respect to ensuring that residents
are exposed to sufficient numbers of cases in their field.
Supply chain management: Executive Vice President Omenn observed that great
strides have been made in inventory management, but persuading physicians to
standardize their practices with respect to prescription medication and utilization of
supplies is a challenge.
Regent Brandon observed that the target operating margin is 2%, but currently the
health system is achieving 1.3%. He asked whether any peer institutions are doing better
than the UM Health System in terms of operating margin. Executive Vice President
Omenn responded that the University's performance with respect to operating margin is
on a par with that of top performing academic centers, and that small differences
year-to-year in volume can make a big difference in margin. He said that the FY 2003
budget calls for capturing certain reimbursable costs that have not been captured in the
past, and this should contribute to the operating margin. Conversely, certain expenses
have been classified as operating expense, rather than equity transfer, which reduces the
operating margin.


349




June Meeting, 2002


Interim President White commented that for the near term, the focus of the Health
System needs to be on controlling costs and noted that costs have been continuing to grow
despite aggressive cost management efforts.
Nursing shortage: Executive Vice President Omenn then turned to efforts being
made to overcome the nursing shortage by focusing on recruitment and retention. He
described some of the initiatives undertaken in these areas and noted the result was 204
new hires in the first five months of 2002 compared to 118 during the same period the
previous year. It was noted that the most frequent reason cited for why nurses quit their
jobs is personal. He also pointed out that these jobs require high skill levels and are
physically demanding. Both factors contribute to difficulties in recruitment and retention.
Regent Deitch observed that the major factor affecting quality in the minds of the
patient is nursing care. Executive Vice President Omenn noted that the Health System is
very competitive on such factors as salaries, benefits, child care options, etc. He
explained that nursing staffing difficulties are due more to the burden of the work than
salary and benefits concerns, and steps are being taken to alleviate this by increasing the
number of hours of nursing care per patient, which would add additional nurses to care
for the same number of patients. This should also lead to improvements in quality.
Regent Maynard raised the issue of the shortage of qualified faculty to teach in
nursing schools. It was noted that this is a recognized problem nationwide and innovative
solutions are being pursued.
Executive Vice President Omenn commented that workplace redesign has been
focusing on garnering respect for and empowering nurses by creating nurse-physician
dyads in every unit. The goals of the dyads are to recognize and empower physician and
nurse leaders, foster communication and partnerships, and jointly redesign work
processes and manage budgets. This innovation has had positive results.
Executive Vice President Omenn then turned to statistics that serve as measures of
quality care, which include ratings of patient access to ambulatory care (time it takes to
get an appointment and clinic waiting time) and satisfaction rating on care received;
physician referral services; patient self-referral services; emergency department access
and satisfaction; and willingness of patients to recommend Health System services.
Executive Vice President Omenn then reviewed "dashboard indicators" that
represent measures of clinical performance, which include rate of births by Cesarean
section; rate of compliance with advance directive procedure; rate of bloodstream
infection; rate of delinquent medical records; mortality rate for coronary artery bypass
surgery; pediatric mortality rate; employee satisfaction; and lost workday injury-illness
rate among employees.
Regarding M-Care, Executive Vice President Omenn noted that past problems and
deficits have largely been alleviated, and it is being very well run with a current
operating margin of $1.0 million.
Regent Brandon raised the issue of the anxiety experienced by patients during the
time lag between when a patient is told that a problem is suspected and when laboratory
test results are disclosed, and he asked whether these measures are tracked. He noted
that even though test results are often actually available shortly after the test is conducted,

June Meeting, 2002


patients are often told that results will not be revealed for up to seven days. The Regents
urged that this concern be addressed.
Executive Vice President Omenn summarized that overall, prospects are bright for
the UM Health System due to its outstanding and rising reputation; substantial investments
in people, buildings, clinical research, infrastructure, and clinical expansions; and
progressive commitment across the Health System units (Medical School, Hospitals and
Health Centers, and M-Care) to the health system concept.
Regent Deitch thanked Executive Vice President Omenn, commenting that "we all
take great pride in the Medical Center and its people," and that discussions such as just
occurred are pursued only to maintain the focus on making it better. He observed that
when he concludes his service as Regent, he will look back on the decision made by the
Board to create the position of executive vice president for medical affairs as the correct
decision, and he praised Dr. Omenn's performance as the first person to hold that
position.
A five-minute break followed, from 3:10 to 3:15 p.m.
Interim President White recognized Francis Blouin, director of the Bentley
Historical Library, who was present in the audience. He also announced that Vice
President Rudgers had recently raised money for a nonprofit organization for children
affected by AIDS, Camp Greenbear, by completing a half-marathon race.
Report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty - Dearborn Campus
Interim President White called on Professor Marlene Gordon, chair of the Dearborn
Campus Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF). Professor Gordon
reported that the committee had reviewed changes in revenue and expenditures from
1992-2001. There were modest increases in some categories and significant funding
increases in other categories.  Comparisons were also made with other Class IIA
universities. She noted that during the past year, the administration had made a significant
effort to address the issue of salary parity for tenure-track and tenured faculty. Committee
recommendations include continuing current steps to increase salaries for adjunct
professors; continuing the commitment to raise faculty salaries overall; raising the salaries
of underpaid faculty; and including non-instructional faculty in all comparisons.
Professor Gordon noted that in the fall the committee would be meeting with its
counterparts on the Ann Arbor and Flint campuses to coordinate reporting data.
Report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty - Flint Campus
Professor Steve Myers presented the CESF report for the Flint campus. The primary
focus of the committee has been the affect of inflation on UM-Flint faculty salaries; whether
there is significant salary compression within faculty ranks; and how UM-Flint faculty
salaries compare to peer institutions. The committee found that there had been substantial
loss in faculty buying power relative to the early 1970s, but in more recent years, the
University has mostly kept pace with inflation. It also found substantial salary compression
at the assistant and associate professor levels and at the lecturer and full professor levels.
In addition, the committee also concluded that UM-Flint has maintained its average ranking
among peers, with some modest improvement with respect to average assistant professor
salaries.

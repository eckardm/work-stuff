To THE HONORABLE, THE1 BOARD OF REGENTS, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIG\AN:
Genitlemlent: I have much pleasure in reporting to you that the Library
of the University has received, as a gift from the Hon. D. M. Ferry,
cf Detroit, two large and valuable works on the history of early
Christian art. The first of these is the Roma Sotterranea, by the famous
De Rossi, and the second is the Storia dell' Arte Christiana, by Raffaele
(; arrucci.
In regard to the importance of the work first mentioned.  a better
statement can hardly be given than. that in Lowrie's -Handbook of
Christian Archxology, which has just been published, page i8: "It was
through. the work of Giovanni Battista de Rossi that Christian arclhaology first assumed its modern forml and importance; it was he who
first made it a science."
De Rossi was a voluminous writer, but the Roma Sotterranea was
the most important of his works, that in which he laid the foundations
of his science. The number of copies printed was very limited, and
the work for many years has been out of the market. This copy has an
additional interest from the autograph and dedication of De Rossi himself, which will be found, with his portrait, on the fly leaf of the
fourth and last volume containing the plates.
The history of Christian art by Garrucci consists of six large volumes of plates, with explanatory text. Of this work Mr. Lowrie says,
page 422:
'This great work, which covers the entire field of early Christian
pictorial art, is the product of learning, as well as of labor. On account
of its illustrations it must remain quite indispensable to the student of

this subject, till the same ground has been covered with equal complete
ness by photographic reproductions."
The addition of these works to the Library, in a department which
is now attracting so much attention, is a matter of no ordinary interest.
Respectfully submitted,
FRANCIS W. KELLSEY.

paid from  the first income from the publication.
Regent Lawtton submitted the following resolution, which
was adopted on a call vote:
Resolved, That the Regents, having listened to the remarks
of Professor l:utchins, Dean of the Law Department, regarding
the proposition to publish a journal by the Law Department of
the University, we do hereby declare that such a proposition
meets with our approval, and that we shall be ready to lend
our assistance to the undertaking in the manner and to the
extent that he requests, that is, to the extent of not exceeding eight hundred dollars, to be considered as a loan, and

require. and to be returned to the Treasurer of the University
from the first funds that shall be received from the enterprise.

HONORABLE HERMANN KIEFER, DETROIT, MICH.,
Dear Sir: I am requested by the Medical Faculty to present the
following to the Honorable Board of Regents:
First: We ask that Dr. E. M. Houghton be appointed special
lecturer on the Manufacture and Preparation of Medicines, without
other pay than his actual expenses. Dr. Houghton has an important
position with Messrs. Parke, Davis & Co. He is a graduate of the
Medical Department, and will give our students some valuable lectures
upon the preparation of medicines.
Second: Inasmuch as the medical students are compelled, in passing
from one ward of the hospital to the other, to go around the north end
of the nurses' ward, we ask your Honorable Body to provide for a light
on the outside and at the north end of the nurses' home. There are
steep places at this place, and these are often covered more or less with
snow and ice, and the descent in the dark is somewhat dangerous. We
ask this in order to prevent serious accident.
Respectfully,
V. C. VAUGHAN.

Regent Kiefer presented and read the following communication from Dr. A. B. Prescott, Director of the Chemical
Laboratory, and the recommendations therein contained were
approved by the Board on a call vote:
ANN ARBOR, MICH., Dec. I9, I9OI.
To THE HONORABLE, THE BOARD OF REGENTS:
Gentlem7zen: Mr. Perry F. Trowbridge presents herewith his resignation as Accountant and Instructor in the Chemical Laboratory, to
take effect on January i, 1902, with the provision that if desired he
will continue his service as instructor for one day each week from
Christmas vacation to the end of the semester, February 7. With this
provision, I recommend the acceptance of the resignation. Mr. Trowbridge resigns in order to accept a responsible position in the beet-sugar
industry, to the chemistry of which he has for some time devoted his
investigations. While I regret the loss of his services in this laboratory,
I have confidence in the work he will carry out in this important Michigan industry.
I recommend the appointment of Mr. Edward Lucas as Dispensing
Accountant in the Chemical Laboratory, at the rate of nine hundred
dollars per year, to begin January i, 1902. Also the employment of
Mr. Robert J. Colgrove as dispensing helper in the Chemical Laboratory
at the rate of three hundred dollars per calendar year, from January i
to June 30, 1902. With these employees it will be undertaken to carry
the chemical supplies, but this will not be without increased labor
on the part of the director and his colleagues until the experience of
the new supply agent shall be found sufficient.
To fill the vacancy in the teaching force in the second semester, so
far as the elective studies which have been in Mr. Trowbridge's hands
cannot be distributed and deferred, I recommend that Walter H. Blome,
Ph.C., now assistant in pharmacy with duties largely in first semester,
be employed in the second semester, with $200 additional compensation, his work to be fully in charge of Assistant Professor A. B. Stevens.
In 1902-03 the work of the sugar chemistry will be provided for in
the branch of chemical technology.
Very respectfully submitted,
A. B. PRESCOTT.

Regent Farr presented and read the following communication fromn Margaret E. Hunt, formerly of Detroit, but now
residing in Ann Arbor:
ANN ARBOR, MICH., Feb. 26, I902.
To THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, ANN ARBOR, MICH.
Dear Sirs: The tract of land which I herewith offer to the Regents
of the University,-in trust for the endowment of scholarships, is situated
in Humboldt County, in the State of California. It is about fifty miles
south of Eureka, the county seat, on the line of the projected railroad
from San Francisco to Eureka, now in process of construction. I understand this road will be finished to a point I70 miles north of San
Francisco the coming year. There is a road from Eureka to the Pacific
Lumber Co.'s mill, about forty miles south, leaving a gap of perhaps a
hundred miles to be built to complete the connection between San Francisco and Eureka.
The topography of the country will bring this road through this
land on one side or the other of the south fork of the Eel River, which
passes through the tract. The river here is wide and deep enough for
all purposes of lumbering. The Pacific Lumber Co.'s mill is a short
distance below, on the Eel River.
There are from sixteen to twenty million feet of lumber on the
land, and. a part of it is of the thickest growth. On the next claim
below, where the timber is of the same character, the owner manufactured one million feet sawn lumber from two measured acres of
ground. As soon as the railroad is completed, this timber will be worth




22


FEBRUARY MEETING,.1902.


from five to eight dollars per thousand feet stumpage, as it will cut
about eighty per cent clear lumber.
It is my intention to pay the taxes on these lands as long as they
remain in the possession of the University; but if by any chance the
University should be called upon to pay the taxes, there is provision
made in the deed to refund any such payments from the first receipts
of the income.
In this transaction I am endeavoring to benefit my family in what
I conceive to be the best manner, by providing them with a permanent
income during their lives, and insuring to their children the means of
fitting themselves for useful and honorable lives. I have reserved a
part of the principal for myself, if the sale is made in my lifetime, in
order to provide for my family if they should need it, or to reinvest in
timber lands, thus increasing the amount for a future endowment.
I have named one of the scholarships the James B. Hunt Scholarship, in memory of my husband's father, who was a prominent man in
the early days of the State. He was the Acting Commissioner of Internal Improvement, who constructed the central railroad from Detroit
to Ann Arbor, and other internal improvements. He was afterward
the Representative in Congress for the Third District of Michigan.
Ever since I purchased this land I have intended to give it to the
University for the endowment of scholarships, and when at one time
I seemingly faced the inevitable end, I rejoiced that I had made the
proper provisions in my will for this purpose. It is the fulfillment of
the purpose of a lifetime.
With my best wishes for the success of our University, and for the
prosperity of each of you,
I remain, yours sincerely,
MARGARET E. HUNT.
The following is the deed of the lands referred to in the
foregoing communication:
THIS INDENTURE, made this twenty-sixth day of February, in
the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and two, between

ANN ARBOR, MICH., Feb. 26, I902.
HONORABLE CHARLES D. LAWTON, CHAIRMAN OF THE MEDICAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS:
Dear Sir: I am requested by the Medical Faculty to ask the Honorable Board to consider the following:
I. The Faculty requests that Dr. Guy M. Winslow, of Boston, be
appointed Instructor in Anatomy in place of Dr. Bourland, who will
resign at the end of this year, at the same salary. Dr. Winslow's
work, if he be appointed, will begin at the beginning of the next




PFEBRUARY MEETING, 1902.


2'7


session, and his appointment should date from   October i, 1902.
The object in asking that the appointment be made at this time
is that Dr. Winslow may have definite information, and may arrange
his matters accordingly. Dr. Winslow has been teaching Anatomy for
some years in Tufts College. He has written several original articles,
and is recommended highly both on account of his thorough learning
and as a teacher.
2. The Medical Faculty desires that the honorable Board of Regents
should at the proper time fit up what is now known as the Anatomical
Laboratory, for the teaching of Electrotherapeutics.  Dr. Herdman,
who has charge of Electrotherapeutics, will be glad to furnish the Board,
whenever it is desired, a statement concerning the changes which will
be necessary in order to convert this building into a suitable laboratory.
3. It gives me pleasure to inform the Board that the woman in
Denver who has been impersonating Dr. Emma W. Mooers, of Boston,
has been tried, convicted, and sentenced. I have recovered the certificate given this woman by Mr. Wade. I hope that this ends very satisfactorily to the University a matter which has given us no little annoyance.  The Medical Faculty has extended to the Secretary of the State
Board of Medical Examiners, of Colorado, and to the Assisting Prosecuting Attorney, at Denver, its thanks for the energy with which they have
prosecuted this suit. The Faculty has also thanked Dr. Henry Sewall,
of Denver, who held a chair in our school at the time when the real
Dr. Mooers was a student here, and whose testimony aided in the conviction of the fraudulent woman. I have turned over to Secretary Wade
a bill of expenses in this case.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
V. C. VAUGHAN, Dean.

appointed Instructor in Anatomy for the year I902-1903, salary

APuRIL MEETING, 1902.


On motion, the Board requested the President to transmit
their cordial thanks to the President and Fellows of Yale University, and to Mr. William J.- Howard, of Toronto, Canada, for
their valuable gifts to the Library of this University.
The following communication from Professor Gabriel Campbell, of Dartmouth College, was presented and read to the
Board:
DARTMOUTH COLLEGE, HANOVER, N. H., April 12, 1902.
HON. JAMES H. WADE, SECRETARY OF BOARD OF REGENTS, UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN:
Dear Sir: Accompanying this letter I forward to you, by express,
the well-worn family Bible of Chancellor Tappan, the first President
of Michigan University.
During my student life in Germany, above thirty years ago, I conferred with President Tappan, who was then a resident of Frankfurt
on the Main, in regard to the purchase of his private library for the
University of Minnesota, where at that time I held the chair of Philosophy. Subsequently, as result of correspondence with Dr. Tappan, and
with Judge Beakes, of Ann Arbor, his financial agent, the governing
Board of Minnesota University requested me to proceed to Ann Arhor,
and examine the books.
President Tappan's library of nearly 3,000 volumes had been carefully stored in one of the business houses on Main Street. Mr. Vance,
the obliging custodian, opened the boxes and afforded every facility to
ascertain the character of the collection, which proved to be made up
of choice editions, evidencing scholarly taste and wide learning in the
selection.
The offer for the library made by the Minnesota Regents was accepted. The books arrived in due time, and became the " Tappan Collection" in the Minnesota State University library. This was perhaps
a natural sequence of the opening of the Minnesota University in 1867,
when, following the recommendation of our Michigan President, which
Minnesota had requested, two Michigan graduates were appointed to organize the University in that State.
Finding that the Tappan family Bible contained the record of marriage and of the birth and death of his children, together with scripture and poetic quotations, in President Tappan's own handwriting, I
secured the volume for my personal possession; and it has been preserved as one of my most precious treasures.
I am assured, however, that the other Alumni and friends of my
Alma Mater would prize highly this sacred memorial. It is therefore
a deep and genuine pleasure to forego my own personal claim, and to
entrust through you to the Governing Board of the University this center, divinely inspired, of the, home life of one of the noblest of men,
who won for himself the profound admiration, the worshipful affection
of a host of youthful hearts; and it proves to be an undiminishing love.
You will pardon me then, if I entreat the honorable members of
the Regents' Board, and as well those who in the coming years shall pre

side in their places, to conserve with a thoughtful care this hallowed
representative of the early days.
To the youth of the generations yet to be, even the broken binding
may testify eloquently of the unbroken devotion to God's eternal truth
of him who led our beloved Michigan Alma Mater to her recognized
place, foremost among the State Universities.
Please present to President Angell and the other gentlemen of the
Board of Regents, assurances of my high esteem. And may a gracious
Heaven continue to bless my Alma Mater.
Very sincerely yours,
GABRIEL CAMPBELL, '65.
Professor of Philosophy.
Regent Farr moved that the President be requested to convey
to Professor Campbell the grateful acknowledgments of the
Board for his gift of the family Bible of that great and good
man, Chancellor Tappan, and that the book be placed in the
General Library for safe-keeping. It was so ordered.
Aldermen Hamilton and Coon addressed the Board in relation to the paving of State Street. They stated that the city
would pave all street crossings, and pay twenty per cent of all
paving between streets, and that the total cost to the University would not exceed $5000.00 for asphalt blocks.
The Board voted unanimously to direct the Secretary to sign
the petition for the Board, asking the City Council to do the
work.

purpose of printing special announcements in the Literary Department. It was so ordered by a full vote.

Medicine and Surgery, to cover a bill of goods of equal amount
which was received too late to be paid from the budget of last
year, and a corresponding amount from last year's budget was
turned back into the general fund.
On motion of Regent Lawton, the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery was conferred upon Frederick Aloysius Gill, in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty of the College of Dental Surgery.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, the Secretary was directed to

At the last meeting of the Board it was voted that the University offer par for $35,000 Van Buren County 4-per-cent
bonds, as an investment for a part of the gift funds of the
University. Regent Farr reported that the bid was accepted,
and the University was in possession of $35,000 of said bonds.
The Board voted to request Regent Farr to go to Omaha,
Nebraska, and look over the property of the University in that
city, with power to make such repairs as in his judgment may
seem wise.

ANN ARBOR, MICH., July i6, I902.
PROF. HARRY B. HUTCHINS, DEAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LAW, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN:
Dear Sir: I take pleasure in announcing thaf the children of the
late Judge Thomas M. Cooley have been pleased to present to the University of Michigan, for its Law Library, the list of volumes hereto
appended. I think it the hope on the part of the donors that these
books may be kept as a collection which may serve as a memorial
of their father and his relation to the Department of Law. We have
no conveniences now for shelving them separately from the general
collection of books in the Library.  The donors of this collection
have indicated to me that upon the return, by Professor Rogers, of Yale,
of the manuscripts of Judge Cooley, they would be glad to make a
selection from  these to add to this collection.  Professor Rogers is
using them temporarily in writing a biography of Judge Cooley. When
these are received, if a case suitable for holding them could be
placed somewhere in the Library, I am sure it would meet the wishes
of those who have so generously remembered the Department.
Yours sincerely,
V. H. LANE,
Law Librarit(ln.

OCTOBER MEETING.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
ANN ARBOR, October Io, 1902.
The Board assembled in the Regents' room at o1 o'clock
A. M.
Present-Regents Butterfield, Farr, Lawton, Dean, Hill,
Barbour, Fletcher, and Carey.
The Secretary read the minutes of the last meeting, which
were, on motion of Regent Lawton, approved and ordered
printed.
Communications which had reached the President were
placed in the hands of the standing commnittees of the Board
for consideration.
On motion of Regent Barbour, the Treasurer was instructed
to take no further action with the Auditor General, in relation
to the burglary at University Hospital, unless further instructed
by the Board.
The President stated that his annual report had been prepared, and was held subject to the wishes of the Board. It
was the desire of the Board that the report be read by the
President, which was done after calling Regent Barbour to
the chair.
THE PRESIDENT'S REPORT.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
I have the honor to present to you my Report for the year
ending June 30, I902.
No important changes have been made in the scope or
methods of work during the past twelve months, but the year
has been characterized by quiet, orderly, and successful labor.
While it is recognized by the public that this University has
always been ready, unhampered as it is by too many obstruc

tive traditions, to try with courage and enterprise promising
experiments in education, yet it has tried to be wise and conservative enough not to introduce innovations rashly, merely
for the sake of being thought progressive. There must be a
certain degree of steadiness in the policy of an institution like
this, if it is to command the confidence of serious men and to
secure the best results for its students. If, therefore, its record
for the year presents little that is exceptional or eventful, we
are not to draw an unfavorable inference, but rather to conclude
that the fact is one for congratulation, and that steady and
undisturbed work has earned its legitimate harvest.
The completion of the General Catalogue has enabled us
to gather some interesting facts. The following may be noted
here.  Degrees have been conferred in the several departments,
down to 19go, as follows:
Department of Literature, Science, and  the  Arts........................... 4,553
Department of Engineering......................................................  786
Department of Medicine  and  Surgery.......................................... 3,523
D epartm ent  of  Law................................................................  6,657
School of  Pharm acy................................................................  8 840
Homceopathic  Medical  College.................................................  372
College  of  Dental  Surgery........................................................,005
Honorary Degrees.........................................  151
17,887
Deducting 703, the number of persons who have received
degrees in more than one department, we have the total number of persons who have received degrees, namely, 17,I84.
Of these, 1,835 were women.
The number of deaths recorded in our books being 2,186,
the number of graduates supposed to be living at the date of
this report is 14,998.
The number of graduates for each of the last five years has
been: 1898, 708; 1899, 722; 1900, 777; I901, 766; 1902, 823.
The number of persons, matriculated prior to the beginning of the year I897-98,,who have pursued studies in some
department, but have not graduated, is 12,623, of whom 2,I45
are known to be deceased.
It thus appears that the General Catalogue contains the
names of 29,728 persons (excluding recipients of honorary
degrees), who had, for a longer or shorter time, been enrolled

in the University.  Of these, it is probable that about 25,000
are now living.
These simple figures must impress one deeply with the
extent of the work which the University has accomplished in
its comparatively brief life.  Its children are found engaged
in honorable and useful pursuits in all parts of the earth.
It has made the name of Michigan known and respected
throughout the civilized world. Yet the total cost to the State
of its support of the University has been less than the cost to
the nation of a first-class battleship.
Owing to our increased requirements for admission and for
graduation, there was a slight falling off in attendance on the
Schools of Medicine, Law, and Dentistry last year. On the
other hand, there was a slight increase (31) in the Literary
Department, and a large increase (130) in the Engineering
Department. The total attendance, exclusive of that in the
Summer Session, was 3,508, a gain of 26 over that of the preceding year.  Including the Summer Session, the aggregate
attendance was 3,709. The year previous it was 3,7I2.
The students from Michigan numbered 2,I56, or I2 more
than in the preceding year.  The numbers from other States
still continue large; for example, from Illinois, 326; Ohio,
246; Indiana, 144; New York, 144; Pennsylvania, I02; Iowa,
84; Missouri, 58. Every State, save Delaware and Louisiana,
and our new possessions, the Hawaiian Islands, Porto Rico and
the Philippines, and every Territory, except Alaska, are represented.   So, also, are Ontario, Quebec, Bristish Columbia,
South Africa, Jamaica, Japan, Turkey, England, Bulgaria,
China, Egypt, and Mexico. The cosmopolitan feature, which
has so long characterized our student population, is thus still
conspicuous.
The attendance of women (not counting that in the Summer School) was as follows:
Department of Literature, Science, and  the Arts.............................. 668
Department of  Medicine  and  Surgery...........................................  35
Department of Law...........................................................  5
School  of  Pharm acy..................................................................  3
H omceopathic  M edical College.....................................................  7
College  of  D ental  Surgery...........................................................  7
725




92


OCTOBER MEETING, r90o.


In the year preceding, the number was 720. There has,
therefore, been no appreciable change in the relative number
of women and of men. The women form twenty per cent of
the total attendance, and forty-seven and seven-tenths of the
attendance in the Literary Department.
Last year we allowed the first year students in the Literary
Department a larger liberty of election of studies than had
been permitted before. They were required to take three hours
of English in each semester, and were asked to choose the
remaining studies from a list of nine specified branches. The
elections were scrutinized by a committee of the Faculty, which
was charged with the duty of seeing that the rule was complied
with, but which had the power to grant some modifications of
the rule in certain cases, and also of advising the students in
making their elections.
On the whole, the elections seem to have been wisely made.
There was less deviation from the elections made under our
previous requirements than was generally expected.  The
largest losses were sustained, as was anticipated, by Greek (about
45 per cent), Latin (33 per cent), and Mathematics (about 55
per cent). The largest gains were in German and History.
The Languages, History, and Mathematics mainly absorbed
the attention of the class.
The increase in the number of students in the Engineering
Department is making heavy demands on us. It has compelled us to enter on the erection of a large building. The
call for our engineering graduates is greater than we can meet.
Our best men speedily gain important and remunerative positions. Some of our most important industrial establishments
have filed with us requests to send them at any time the names
of our most promising graduates, whom they desire to put in
the path to highly responsible' positions. Our provisions for
instruction in the construction of vessels are attracting much
attention. We have deemed it wise to establish the degree of
Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering.
So large training in the sciences and their application is
now needed to fit men for conspicuous service in the various
departments of engineering, that we have found the four years'




OCTOBER MEETING, I902.


93


curriculum scarcely adequate to furnish it. We have, therefore,
decided that the engineering students must give six weeks of the
summer at the end of the third year of their course to special
work: the students in' civil engineering to surveying and field
work; in mechanical engineering to a course in dynamo-electrical machinery and in designs of boilers and engines; in
electrical engineering to foundry work and the designing of
boilers and engines; and in chemical engineering to a course
in dynamo-electrical machinery. We furnish the instruction
without additional cost to the students.
It may be questioned whether there has been greater improvement in any department of education during the last
twenty years than in medical education. To no department
have recent scientific discoveries been more directly useful. In
the methods of instruction in none have they compelled greater
changes. The laboratory methods have, to a great extent,
superseded the communication of knowledge by lecturing.
This fact has called for the large additional expense in the provisions made by all the strong medical schools. Our school,
which was one of the first in the country to be furnished with
a chemical laboratory for medical students, has long been conspicuous for its laboratory work in other sciences than chemistry. The completion of our new and spacious building for
medical laboratories adds greatly to our facilities for such
instruction. We have every reason to expect that the Department of Medicine and Surgery will continue to maintain the
high rank it has so long held among the leading medical schools
of the country. The scientific researches of members of its
Faculty have given it a position which is recognized abroad as
well as in our own land.
Although law schools of good standing are multiplying in
the West, our school still continues to lead all others in the
country in the number of its students. The demands made
upon them by the course of instruction grow more exacting
every year. We have not deemed it necessary or wise to
require a collegiate training as the condition precedent to
entering upon the study of law, though we encourage those
who can procure such training to avail themselves of their




94


OCTOBER MEETING, Io02.


opportunity to do so. We are glad to observe that the proportion of those who bring college diplomas at their entrance
is increasing.
The Law Faculty have given a signal proof of their devotion to the interests of the school by establishing a law journal, which most creditably represents the Department.
Although heavily burdened by their regular work as teachers,
they have undertaken this task without any compensation.
The proceeds of the Journal are to be appropriated to the
increase of the Law Library. It is to be hoped that our Law
Alumni will heartily co-operate with them in the maintenance
of this magazine.
The Homceopathic Medical College is pursuing the even
tenor of its way, and receiving as large share of patronage as
can perhaps be expected for a school which holds higher standards of attainment for admission and graduation than most of
the Homceopathic schools in the country. Its students reap
the advantages of instruction in most of the scientific laboratories of the Department of Medicine and Surgery.
The School of Pharmacy shows no tendency to growth in
numbers, but meets an increasing demand for advanced instruction for a limited number of students.
The Dental School, having led the way in lengthening its
course to four years, fell off somewhat in numbers, as was
anticipated. But we do not regret that fact. Other strong
schools are finding themselves compelled to follow our example. We have no solicitude about the attendance, if we can
only see our way clear to the erection of a suitable building for
the accommodation of the School.
The attendance of students in the Summer Session of six
weeks of 1902 was as follows:
Department of Literature, Science, and  the Arts.............................. 349
Department of  Medicine  and  Surgery.........................................  70
Department of Law...............................................  44
Total.......................................................................  463
Of these, 189 were regularly connected with some department. The number of new students was, therefore, 274.




OCTOBER MEETING, I902.


95


Though the Summer Session causes us some expense, the usefulness of it, especially to teachers, is so great that it seems to
be our duty to continue it.
The hospitals still have their capacity tested by applicants
for medical and surgical attention. In the University Hospital, 2,307 patients were treated, and in the Homceopathic
Hospital, I857. About one-fourth of the patients were farmers or farmers' wives. Representatives from seventy-six counties were received and cared for, and not a few persons who
were supported at the public expense were restored to health,
and thus enabled to earn their own living.
From the Librarian's Report it appears that we had, on
June 30, I902, in all the libraries, 65,ooo00 volumes. The number added during the year is 9,539. The periodicals regularly
received number I,000. The recorded circulation of books,
estimated not to exceed one-half of the actual use, was 167,949 volumes.
We have for some years had reason to suspect that diplomas,
especially our medical diplomas, had occasionally been fraudulently obtained. It happens, of course, that now and then a
diploma is either lost in the transportation of baggage or
destroyed by fire. For some years we issued a duplicate diploma
on the simple request by letter of the holder of the original.
Of late years we have required the applicant to send us an
affidavit, swearing to the loss of the diploma and to the circumstances of the loss. We write the word " duplicate" in red
ink on the new diploma. But even these precautions do not
furnish an absolute safeguard against fraud. This very year
we found that a woman, who had an undesirable reputation as
a practitioner, was exhibiting one of our diplomas bearing the
name of one of our graduates, which she had assumed. She
had procured the diploma by writing to our offices under this
assumed name, and asking for it on the ground that her old
one had been destroyed. We have deemed it our duty to protect our genuine diplomas by bringing her into court and
securing her punishment. Fortunately, we were able to secure
the presence in court of the woman whose name she had borrowed.




96


OCTOBER MEETING, I902.


The services of the Faculty Committee of Appointment,
which aids students in finding suitable positions as teachers,
are proving of greater and greater value, both to students and
to schools. The school boards who are in quest of competent
teachers in many cases come directly to our Committee, who
strive to make the best selections to meet the particular conditions in each school. The labor and responsibility thrown upon
the Committee are very considerable.
I take pleasure in recognizing the great value of the services rendered by the Students' Christian Association, the
Young Men's Christian Association, and the Women's League
in aiding new students in finding suitable homes and also
employment, by which they can earn something toward their
support. The great body of our students have very limited
means, and many of them are glad of the opportunity to gain
something by honorable toil, however menial.
In accordance with thewise policy recently adopted of
purchasing, when our means were adequate, some desirable
pieces of land adjacent to our campus, the Regents embraced
the opportunity presented to them to buy the school building
and grounds opposite the University, on State Street. That is
a good site for a fine building, which may be erected when
needed. Meantime, the school building can at once be made
available for relieving the overcrowded state of the rooms in
University Hall. We have given to the building the name of
West Hall, and classes in English, in the Modern Languages,
and in Forestry have already been assigned quarters there.
We have had in hand an unprecedented amount of work in
repairs and construction, much of which is still unfinished.
The continued growth of the University for years has been
making these demands for reconstruction and enlargement.
But not until now have we had the means to meet the demands.
Happily, the recent addition to our income has enabled us to
attempt to erect some, though not all, of the buildings we
greatly need.
i. We have completed the Barbour Gymnasium for Women,
an act which was not only desirable in itself, but which was




OCTOBER MEETING, I902.


97


necessary to comply with the conditions of some of the private
subscriptions through which the building was erected.
2. We have constructed a new floor in the Reading Room
and in the Librarian's rooms in the General Library, and have
so arranged the seating of the Reading Room as to accommodate a half more students than before. We have also improved
the ventilation of those rooms. These steps were of pressing
necessity for the comfort and even for the health of the readers.
3. We have begun the construction of a new boiler house
and laundry for the University Hospital. We shall remove the
boilers from the basement of the Nurses' Home, where an
explosion would have caused great loss of property and life.
This change is costly, but deemed absolutely necessary.
4. We have erected a building for the accommodation of
the following laboratories of the Department of Medicine and
Surgery: Hygiene, Physiological Chemistry, Anatomy, Bacteriology, and Pathology. The accommodations for these in
our old buildings were inadequate, and the space they occupied
was, for the most part, urgently needed for other purposes.
For instance, the laboratories of Hygiene and Bacteriology
were in the upper story of the Physical Laboratory, every inch
of which was needed by the Department of Physics.
5. The Palmer Ward, built primarily for the care of children in the University Hospital, we owe to the generous bequest
of Mrs. Love M. Palmer, who gave it and an endowment fund
as a monument to her husband, the late Professor Palmer. It
will soon be ready for occupancy.
6. The Psychopathic Ward, now in process of erection, is
built by a special appropriation of the Legislature, to care for
patients suffering from nervous ailments akin to insanity. It
is hoped that great benefits may accrue to them from the treatment here, and that thus the pressure upon our asylums for the
insane may be somewhat relieved.
7. The Engineering Building will be the most costly of our
new structures. The growth of the Engineering Department
for the last few years has been so extraordinary that we were




98


OCTOBER MEET[ING, 1902.


compelled to provide larger and better accommodations for it.
We deemed it wise to make our new building large enough to
meet our needs for some few years to come, though the demand
for thoroughly trained engineers is so great that it will not be
surprising if before many years still ampler room will be
needed.
It will be remembered that Mr. Charles J. Hunt (A.B., 1846)
and his wife, Margaret E. Hunt, have already deeded to us a
large tract of valuable timber land in California. Mrs. Hunt has
now deeded to the Regents in trust another large tract of timber
land, situated in Humboldt County, California, for the endowment, after the termination of certain life interests, of scholarships in the Literary Department. One of them is to be named
for her husband's father, James B. Hunt, who was formerly a
representative in Congress from this State.
Our thanks are again due to the Hon. D. M. Ferry, Parke,
Davis & Co., Frederick Stearns & Co., Nelson, Baker & Co.
and Mr. Theodore Buhl, of Detroit, Hon. Peter White, of Marquette, and the Michigan Gas Association, for the continuance
of graduate fellowships which they have been supporting for
the last few years; and to the Rockefeller Research Fund for
two new fellowships in Bacteriology. We are still looking with
hope for the permanent endowment of at least a few fellowships for graduates.
We have also to thank Hon. D. M. Ferry for presenting us
with a tract of land, some seventeen acres, adjacent to our athletic field. This furnishes a spacious field, in which not only
the ball teams can have their practice, but in which the great
body of students can simultaneously have outdoor exercise.
No gift could be more acceptable or more useful to the students
generally. Previously the advantages of the field were for the
most part limited to the comparatively small number of students who composed the teams. Our well-equipped gymnasiums and the large field, embracing nearly thirty acres, now
afford every facility for physical training.
Notwithstanding the welcome addition which has been
made to our buildings, certain of the pressing wants mentioned
in my last Report are still unprovided for; namely, an enlarge



OCTOBER 1MEETING, i9o2.


99


ment of the Library Building, furnishing seminary rooms for
advanced students and more book room; a suitable building
for the Dental School, which is now badly housed; an enlargement of the Physical Laboratory; and the erection of a laboratory building for the work in Zoology and Botany, and perhaps
of Psychology.  An endowment for a certain number of
fellowships for graduate students is also greatly needed. These
should yield an income of four hundred or five hundred dollars
a year for each fellowship.
If our present income is not curtailed, we hope, by careful
economy, to be able in due time to supply most of these lacking buildings, although most of the larger universities in the
country, even those which have fewer students than we, are
conducted at an expense from fifty to sixty per cent greater
than this institution, while Harvard annually expends just about
double our income. We are constantly threatened with the
loss of some of our ablest professors, because our scale of salaries is below that of several other universities.  We have
indeed suffered some such losses. It is owing to the loyalty
and devotion to us of some of our best men that alluring temptations to go elsewhere have been resisted by them. We enter
upon the work of another year with the confident hope that the
people of the State, for whose welfare the University was
founded and is conducted, will continue to cherish pride in its
success and to furnish it their hearty support.

LIBRARIAN'S REPORT.
JULY I, I90 —JUNE 30, 1902.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regenls.:
GENTLEMEN:-In accordance with the By-Law of the University requiring the librarian to make an annual report on




100


OCTOBER MEETING, 1902.


the growth and condition of the library, I have the honor to
submit the following as my report for the year 1901-1902.
There were in all of the libraries, June 30, 1902, I65,000
volumes and 1,500 pamphlets.*
Of these, 130,654 volumes and 1,250 pamphlets were in
the General Library; I9,627 volumes were in the Law Library;
12,062 volumes and 200 pamphlets were in the Medical
Library; 1,120 volumes were in the Dental Library; and 1,537
volumes and 50 pamphlets in the Library of the Homoeopathic
Medical College.
In my report for the year I892 I referred to the fact that
we were binding the more important of our unbound pamphlets, and dwelt at some length upon the reasons for doing so.
At that time we could not make much haste in the matter,
but after the establishment of the bindery it was possible to
move faster, and the work has been pushed as rapidly as possible. For the last three or four years it has not seemed
expedient to report the number of pamphlets left unbound, as
nothing  definite could be reported.  Now, however, the
change has gone so far that an enumeration on the new basis
may be begun. In passing to this new enumeration 1 will
state briefly what has been done.
Of what had before been called unbound pamphlets simply,
we made three classes:
I. Those of special interest for any reason, and those containing considerable matter were bound singly, and each one
was called a volume and counted as a volume.
2. Those of sufficient importance to catalogue, but not of
sufficient importance to bind singly, were classified and bound
in volumes.  Disposed of in this way they were no longer
counted singly, but collectively as volumes.
3. Those worthy of preservation, but not of sufficient
importance to catalogue, were classified and disposed of in
such a manner as to be available if wanted. These are known
as pamphlets and reported as such.
Of the first class, that is, those of sufficient interest to
bind singly, 3, I oo have been bound. Of the second class, 3,185
* The above number of volumes is the number remaining after a
reduction has been made for lost and worn out books.

have been bound in 163 volumes, averaging about 20 to the
volume. Where there have not been enough of a class to
form a volume, a volume has been begun in a temporary case.
These temporary cases receive the proper volume number and
go upon the shelves, and the pamphlets they contain are catlogued. When a sufficient number to form a volume have
accumulated they are permanently bound and the temporary
case is available for similar use again.  Of the third class,
1,500 have been disposed of in the manner already described.
In regard to the quality of the binding put upon these
pamphlets, experience has demonstrated that when a number
are bound together, good material and good workmanship are
necessary, and this experience has guided us in the binding
of the classified pamphlets.
The greater number of pamphlets bound singly have generally been inexpensively bound. Such as were rare and of
exceptional value received coverings to correspond with their
contents.
The new arrangement of our maps, to which I alluded in
my last report, and which we hoped to accomplish during the
year, we were obliged to postpone for various reasons.
The total additions for the year were 9,539 volumes, distributed as follows: General Library, 7,355 volumes; Law Library,
800 volumes; Medical Library, 1,163 volumes; Dental Library,
io6 volumes; Homeeopathic Library, 115 volumes.
The number of periodicals regularly received was o000. Of
these 739 came to the General Library; 20 to the Law Library;
200 to the Medical Library; i6 to the Dental Library, and 25
to the Homceopathic Library.
Your appropriation for the purchase of books for the year,
including subscriptions to periodicals and the maintenance of
the bindery, was $i6,ooo.oo.  You divided this sum among
the several libraries as follows:
G eneral  Library................................................................,580  00
Law   L ibrary...................................................................  2,460  oo
M edical  Library.............................................................  2,460  00

THE GENERAL LIBRARY.
ADDITIONS.-Of the 7,355 volumes added to the General
Library, 3,711 were purchased, 3,085 were presented, and
559 were the result of binding periodicals.
EXPENDITURES. -The bills certified to by me for this
library, exclusive of the bindery bills, amounted to $8,649.47.
Of this sum $7,003.82 was for books and periodical publications received irregularly, and $1,645.65 was for annual subscriptions to periodicals for the year 1902.
For miscellaneous expenses for the year, you assigned to
the library the sum of $I,I96.00.    The expenditures were as
follows:
Day  Attendant in  Cloak  Room.......................................... 171  00
Evening  Attendant in  Cloak  Room.......................................  64  98
Stationery  and  Postage......................................................  04  39
Sundries, Catalogue  Cards, Readers' Slips, Etc.......................  278  80
Pay of two young ladies doing general work...........................  619 52
*Total...................................................................$  1,238  69
This account was therefore overdrawn $42.69.
The expenditures from the endowment funds were as follows:
Expended of the income of the Ford-Messer Fund......................$977 58
Expended  of the income of the Coyl Fund.................................  80  99
No draft was made upon the Goethe Fund.
According to the Treasurer's books the condition of the
three funds, July i, I902, was as follows:
Ford-Messer Fund ($20.000ooo) with unexpended interest added.....$24,375 77
Coyl Fund ($io,ooo) with unexpended interest added.................2,659 38
Goethe  Fund  with  interest (see below)....................................  206  09
IMPORTANT PURCHASES. - It has been the policy of the
Library Committee to use the income of the Ford-Messer
and Coyl Funds for the purchase of important sets of books
and not for single volumes. On this account the greater
number of the following valuable additions to the library for
the year must be credited to those funds.
*This sum is accounted for here as money used entirely for the General
Library. It should be said that it was drawn upon, also, for the miscellaneous expenses of the Medical, Dental, and Homceopathic Libraries.

THE SHAKESPEARE AND GOETHE COLLECTIONS.-Mr. McMillan was not called upon for any contribution to the Shakespeare Library during the year. There were added to it,
however, by purchase from     the Library   funds, frorm   money
obtained by the sale of duplicates (about $50.00), and by
gifts from various individuals, 64 volumes. The whole number of volumes is now 5,082.
The original Goethe fund, contributed by German-American citizens of the State and others was $I,300.00.     By resolution of the Board, June, i886, the President of the University, the  Professor  of   the Germanic     Languages, and    the
Librarian were charged with the expenditure of the money
subject to the condition that when $1,ooo.oo had been used
the balance should be reserved as a fund and only the income of it expended. The sum constituting the fund would
therefore be $300.00.      Unexpected    continuations of some
works carried the expenditure beyond the specified amount
($i,ooo.oo).   There will, therefore, be no further payments
from this fund until by the addition of interest or further contributions to the fund, the present balance is raised to the
required sum.    Some additions to the collection were made
during the year from    the regular book appropriation of the
German department, and these have raised the total of the
collection to 1,024 volumes.
GIFTS.-The friends of the University have kept the Li

brary in remembrance as is evidenced by the number of volumes presented, viz., 3,085.
The Duke of Loubat has continued to send the reproductions of ancient Mexican manuscripts executed for him. Two
were received during the yearI. The Tonalamatl, of the Aubin Collection. Edited by Edw. Seler.
A reproduction of an old Mexican MS. in the National Library of France
with notes in English.
2. Codex Fejervary-Mayer, edited by Edw. Seler. A reproduction of a
MS. in the Liverpool Free Public Museum.
Volumes 144 and 145 of their " Minutes" were received
from the Institution of Civil Engineers of Great Britain.
From Miss Sarah Dorsey, of Marshall, Michigan, were received the two following works (bound together), of the celebrated Dr. Konrad Gesner, viz.,
I. Thierbucz.
2. Fischbuch.
These are parts of his Historia Animalia which was a summary of the knowledge of his time in regard to animal life.
The illustrations, which are numerous, are very curious.
A complete file of the Evening News (Detroit) for the year
was received from the publisher, James E. Scripps, Esq.
The Rev. Henrj C. Granger, of Chicago, of the Class of
'7I, whose gifts have been frequent and valuable, gave 56 volumes and 77 pamphlets.    The greater part of these were
Catholic works and they strengthen much our weak collection
of the books of that church.
From  Mr. Peter Schmidt, of Pontiac, were received the
numbers of the German periodical, Die Ilzustrirte Zeitung,
for sixteen years.
Mr. Kendall P. Brooks gave sets of the Baptist Missionary
Magazine, the Home Magazine (Baptist), and various church
reports.
The Missionary magazines are valuable not only for the
religious matter that they contain, but also for the geographical, ethnological, and linguistic matter contributed by foreign
missionaries.




OCTOBER M1EETING, 1902.


105


From H. P. Davock, Esq., of Detroit (Class of '70), 287
volumes of miscellaneous books were received. A number of
these were rare and valuable.
Dr. Mary M. Cutler, of the Medical Class of '88, and now
of Seoul, Corea, has for several years been sending us a number
of the periodical publications of that country. She gave us
last year 50 volumes of Corean books to which reference was
made in my report. Later she added another volume to her
gift. This was "An Atlas of the Chinese Empire, compiled in
the time of the Emperor Kung Leung of the Ching Dynasty."
It consists of 12 parts, brought together and held between
board covers by cords.
From Mr. William J. Howard, of Toronto, Canada, 8o
volumes relating to the Society of Friends were received.
They relate to the history and doctrines of the society. It
would be difficult to find eighty works on this subject of
more value than these. They were presented by Mr. Howard
as a memorial of his late wife, Anna Halleck Kelsey Howard,
a graduate of the Law Class of i880.
Mr. William Viennot, of the National Library of France,
sent volumes 6 and 7 of the Catalogue of printed books of
that library. He had previously sent the earlier volumes.
On my representation that we had a few numbers of the
Journal of the Diocese of Western Michigan, the Rt. Rev.
George D. Gillespie, Bishop of the Diocese, kindly sent such
others as were available for distribution.  These went'far
towards completing our set.
In the disposition of the books of President Tappan, his
Bible, in which he had himself recorded the marriage, births,
and deaths of the family, was secured by Professor Gabriel
Campbell, now Professor of Philosophy in Dartmouth College. Professor Campbell had for some time had the feeling
that the University ought to possess the volume, and in April
it was presented by him, and it now has its place in the
Library with other memorials of the first president of the
University.
In response to a solicitation made by President Angell
through the State Department at Washington, 54 volumes




106


OCTOBER MEETING, 1902.


relating to the Art Collections of France were received from
the government of that country. From the same source we
have for a number of years received, as published, the volumes
of the great historical publication Collection de Documents
inedits sur l'histoire de France. Two additional volumes of
this series came during the year. This generosity on the part
of the French government is highly appreciated.
Yale University issued in connection with her Bicentennial
Anniversary a series of publications representing the work Of
members of her Faculties. Copies of these publications, 29
in number, were sent to us with the compliments of Yale University. We received also from the University a copy of the
" Literary Diary of Ezra Stiles," edited by Franklin B. Dexter, 3 volumes.
Mr. Louis F. Post, editor and publisher of " The Public,"
contributed Vols I-4 of that publication, bound.
Hon. A. M. Todd, of Kalamazoo, presented through Dr.
A. B. Prescott, a copy of Das Buch zu Distilierendie, von
Hieronimus Brunsschwig, Strasburg, 1532. In this volume
the operations of distilling, as then practiced, are profusely
illustrated by two hundred quaint wood cuts.
Dr. H. S. Jewett, of Dayton, Ohio, of the Class of '68,
gave 19 volumes. Among them were three exceedingly rare
medical books of the sixteenth century for which we had been
looking for some time without success. There was also a fine
copy of the third edition of Dr. Johnson's Dictionary, 2 vols,,
folio, 1765.
Professor Kelsey, during his residence in Rome in I900 -I90o, as Director of the American School of Classical Studies, found for sale at exceptionally low prices, a number of
exceedingly valuable books for the work of his department.
As it was impossible to pay for the more expensive ones from
the Library Fund he represented the matter to Hon. D. M.
Ferry, of Detroit, who authorized the purchase at his own expense. They were the great work of De Rossi, La Roma
Sotterranea Cristiana, in 4 folio volumes, and Garrucci's Storia
della arte Cristiana, in six folio volumes.




OCTOBER MEETING, I902.


107


Professor J. M. Hart, of Cornell University, gave five
important works on literary subjects.
It gives me pleasure to acknowledge here a very courteous
act on the part of the Canadian government.       I had applied
to the Secretary of the Interior at Ottawa for maps showing
the Forests Reserves of the Dominion.     He replied that these
were not on any maps, but that he would have their location
shown, in color, on existing maps, and forward them. After a
very little delay the maps, eight in number, with the promised
additions, were received.
Sundry gifts of books and pamphlets are acknowledged
from President Angell, from Professors Adams, Kelsey,
Hempl, Demmon, and Freer; from Dr. S. A. Green, of Boston,
Edwin S. Balch, of Philadelphia, Miss Pease, of this city,
the Ann Arbor High School, and many other sources.
On solicitation, the following trade journals of the country
were sent to the library by their proprietors:
I. Illustrated Glass and Pottery World. Chicago.
2. American Carpet and Upholstery Journal. Philadelphia.
3. St. Louis Lumberman. St. Louis.
4. Butchers and Packers Gazette. St. Louis.
5. Dry Goods Economist. New York.
6. National Provisioner. New York.
7. The Tradesman. Chattanooga, Tenn.
8. The Manufacturers Record. Baltimore.
9. Book-Keeper. Detroit.
Io. Horseshoers' Journal. Detroit.
If. Indicator and National Journal of Insurance. Detroit.
12. Motorman and Conductor. Detroit.
I3. Trade and the "Storekeeper." Detroit.
I4. The Grand Rapids Furniture Record.
I5. Threshermen's Review. St. Joseph, Michigan.
I6. The Chicago Grocer.
I7. The Lumber Trade Journal. New Orleans.
USE OF THE LIBRARY ---The report of Mr. Finney, assistant in charge of circulation, sustains the opinion expressed
during the year that there was an unwonted activity on the
part of our readers.     The recorded   use of books was as
follows:
Recorded circulation in Reading Room and Seminary Rooms...I58,o36 vols.
Drawn  for home use by Professors.......................................  9,913   "
Total.........................       67,949 "




108


OCTOBER MEETING, 102.


This is io per cent. over the recorded circulation of last
year.  As I have had occasion to say before, this recorded use
represents no more (if actually that) than one-half of the
use of the library.  Our inter-library loans amounted to 6i
volumes.*
The daily average of readers in the Reading Room was
I75. The occasions were frequent when all of the seats (2Io)
were filled, and no temporary accommodation that we could
provide was adequate. At such times we felt obliged to permit an overflow to the stairways in the halls.
The number of students admitted to the stacks under the
two-months rule was 75-the full number entitled to admission.
During the two semesters, 424 students were admitted to
the Seminary Rooms, as follows: 120 to the East Room     for
the study of History, Political Economy, Pedagogy, Philosophy, and Mathematics; 304 to the West Room for the study of
Language, Literature, and Art.  It should be said here that
these rooms are overcrowded, while many whose work requires
facilities of this nature cannot be accommodated at all.
During the holiday vacation a scarcity of coal made it necessary to shut off the heat from all buildings except the Hospitals and that part of University Hall devoted to administration.  As a number of students were remaining in town in
order to use the library, which was of course uninhabitable,
the rule requiring the use of books in the building was suspended and the doors opened for an hour each day for issuing
books to students to use in their rooms.  About oo volumes
were issued daily in this way and no losses resulted.
CONDITION OF THE LIBRARY.-I have several times referred
to the favorable influences exerted upon the condition of the
library by the presence of the bindery. With the ability to make
necessary repairs at once there is no excuse for broken bindings
* For some years it has been the practice of the better equipped institutions to loan their books, if not in demand at home, to scholars in other
institutions who desired to consult them for short intervals. The loan is not
made directly to the individual, but to the library of the institution with
which he is connected, which assumes financial responsibility for the loan,
and is responsible also for the cost of transportation.

and loose leaves, and I am glad to say that in the particular of
repairs the library is in good condition.
For the first time in several years we have been able to
make an inspection of the departmental, or outlying, collections. This was done by Mr. Severance, the General Assistant. I am sorry to report that some of these collections were
found in a very unsatisfactory condition.  The action of the
Board for their establishment was taken March 21, I894. Two
things required by the resolution adopted were:
i. Proper cases for the reception of the books.
2. Responsibility of the head of the department for their safety.
It was found that in some cases'this responsibility had been
delegated to persons whose tenure of office was of a brief
nature, and whose successors did not take over this duty. This
has been to the detriment, or loss, of the books.  In the most
serious case-that of the Nurses' Library at the Hospital-I
have withdrawn the. books until their safety shall be better
assured. It is quite evident that in the case of these collections
frequent inspection by the library force is necessary.  The
completion of the reclassification of the library last year made
an examination of them possible during the year under consideration. An annual examination is on our schedule of work
for the future-and oftener if circumstances seem to require it.
There were many volumes that could not be found when
the library was reclassified and the outlying collections examined. The result of a painstaking search by Mr. Finney
during the summer was the finding of about half of these. He
is of the opinion that careful observation and checking during
the coming year will reduce the number much more.
The books missed in the operations of the year, and of
which no traces have been yet found, are more than I have ever
before reported for a single year.  The list is as follows:
Adams, H. C.-Science of Finance. 1898.
Baker, G. P.-Principles of Argumentation. I895.
Bennett, C. E.-Latin Grammar. I895.
Diez, F.-Zwei altromanische Gedichte. 1852.
Fiske, John.-Destiny of Man. I866.
'   " -Idea of God. 1887.

In all, 21 volumes.
It should be said that almost all of these were books of reference, permanently shelved in the Reading Room and accessible to all, or placed there as temporary reference books in
response to requests from professors.   This experience has led
to the locating of all books behind the desk, except those
of common reference.
Some mutilations of books and periodicals were discovered
during the year, but not many.     Attempts were made to discover the persons who had been guilty of these outrages, but
without success.
THE WORK OF THE YEAR.-This has been very largely
the routine work only.      The unusual increase in the use
of the library with which the year began, and the fact that the
desk attendants are all of them new to the work, made an addition to this branch of the force necessary.     At the October
meeting of the Board relief was given in this particular by the
employment of two additional attendants.
The following may be specified as extra work accomplished:
I. Completion, practically, of the change in the method of disposing of
pamphlets.
2. Examination of outside collections.
3. Completion of an additional case for engravings and photographs, and
the preparation and placing of these,




OCTOBER MEETING, 1902.


111


4. Completion, as far as possible, of files of college catalogues and reports,
and their systematic arrangement.
5. Much more reference work than heretofore.
6. Solicitation of free material on a wider scale than usual.
THE FORCE AND WORK FOR I902-Iq03. —Mr. Jordan, Mr.
Finney, and Mr. Severance remain in the discharge of the duties
heretofore performed by them. Miss Lane and Miss Belser
will continue the work which they have been accustomed to do.
The desk attendants will be Mr. R. E. Andrews, Mr. G. W.
Barnum, Mr. M. A. Hodgdon, Mr. H. E. Olson, Mr. E. W.
Waldron, Mr. R. I. K. Wood, and Mr. H. M. Comins. The
two last named together cover only the full time of one man.
Mr. Ernest S. Bates will have charge of the East Seminary
Room and Mr. F. F. Potter charge of the West Room.
At its May meeting the Board authorized the employment
of a person whose duty it should be to receive all books drawn
in the Reading Room, when returned, duly credit them, and
arrange and classify them for return to the shelves. The compensation allowed was $750.0o. The employment of an assistant cataloguer was also authorized at $500.00. Mr. Edwin N.
Brown has been engaged for the former work at $600.00, and
Mr. L. L. Forsythe to assist him at $I50.oo. Miss Esther
Braley has been engaged as assistant cataloguer.
There are three things that we shall try to accomplish, over
and above the routine work.
i. The Improvement of the Catalogues. —An item  of the
library budget passed by you in May was the enlargement of
the case containing the official catalogue. This will enable us
to put that important instrument in order. Both catalogues,
the official and the public, need to have many cards rewritten.
There are those that were not properly written at the outset,
and there are many others that are worn and soiled by constant
use. The assistant cataloguer whose employment was authorized
by you, will aid greatly in bringing this improvement about.
2. An Improved Arrangement of the Maps.-This arrangement we had planned to make last year, but failed to bring it




112


OCTOBER MEETING, I902.


about. You have authorized the furnishing of the map room,
and I do not think we shall fail to bring about the desired
result this year. In a former report I referred to the importance that maps have assumed in the work of instruction.
3. An Improved Arrangement of the Current Numbers of
Periodicals.-We have added considerably to the number of
our periodicals without any addition to our facilities for handling them. You have authorized the construction of new pigeon holes, which was a necessary preliminary of this work. At
the same time, by the proposed removal of the greater number
of the newspapers from the East Room to the basement, we
shall be able to afford the members of the faculties much needed
facilities for using the periodicals.
A NEED OF THE LIBRARY.-There is a matter that I think
it my duty to bring to your notice at this time. It is the
greater demand that is now made upon the fund set apart for
the purchase of books. For several years the annual appropriation of $I5,000.00 met the demand in a very gratifying way.
The current literature relating to existing departments of
instruction was kept up fairly well and we were able each year
to do something towards acquiring the desirable books of past
years. But the addition of new subjects to the curriculum in
recent years has changed this. Within three years the following new courses of instruction have been established, viz:
Administrative Law, Naval Architecture, Higher Commercial
Education, Forestry, Insurance-five new courses of instruction. Except for a few books, having a bearing on other subjects also, and touching these subjects only incidentally, there
was nothing in the library to serve as working material for these
courses. The absolutely necessary books have been provided
-at the expense, of course, of the old subjects-but a large outlay will be necessary to bring the literature of the new subjects
up and, afterwards, to keep it up.
I do not forget that more room is needed for books and
for readers, but this is already known to you and I will not take
time with what must be repetition.




OCTOBER AMEETING, I902.

THE OTHER LIBRARIES.
THE MEDICAL LIBRARY.-The additions to the Medical
Library were I,I63 volumes and 200 pamphlets. Of these, 716
volumes were purchased, 297 presented, and I50 were the result
of binding periodicals.
The total of bills certified to by me for this library was
$2,388.I5. Of this sum, $1,625.69 was for books and irregular periodical publications, and $762.46 was for subscriptions
to periodicals for I902.*
The gift of some rare volumes to this library, by Dr. H. S.
Jewett, of Dayton, Ohio, has already been referred to in this
report.
You appropriated in June, I901, $1,ooo.oo from the Bates
Professorship Fund, to be expended by the new Bates Professor of the Diseases of Women and Children, Dr. Peterson, in
bringing up the literature of his subject. Of this appropriation, $869.04 had been expended June 30, 1902, and unfilled
orders were out, covering the balance of $I30.96.
THE LAW LIBRARY.-The additions to the Law Library
were 800 volumes. Of these, 656 were purchased and I44
presented. The following particulars in regard to this library
I quote from the report of Professor V. H. Lane, Law Librarian:
"Our library force is made up of Miss Gertrude Elstner
Woodard, as Assistant Librarian, with Mr. Charles R. Loomis
assisting her. These persons, with what time I give to the work
of the library, seem to be caring very well for our present needs.
There has been put into the library during the summer vacation one large case for additions to our State Reports. I think
our accommodations are now adequate for our needs for at
least a year or two, provided we had a few feet of additional

text-book section of the library and shall increase it during the
present year as time can be found to do so. We hope soon to
have it in a condition where it will serve a very positive need
in the library.
"Since the close of the last college year the heirs of the
late Judge Thomas M. Cooley have very generously donated
to the library a number of books from his library as a memorial collection.  Our Faculty appreciate very deeply this
remembrance of one who was so long associated with this
Department, and whose great fame and learning gave to it so
much of that impetus which has carried it to its present high
standing.
"Judge Henry H. Swan, of the Eastern District of Michigan, has generously contributed Puffendorff's 'Observations
of the Universal Law,' and Grotius' 'War and Peace,' both
of which are fine copies of old editions bound in vellum."
THE DENTAL LIBRARY.-The additions to this library were
Io6 volumes, of which 20 were bought, 56 presented, and 30
were the result of binding periodicals. The bills certified to
by me for dental literature strictly, amounted to $76.73.
There was in addition a draft upon this appropriation of
$311.09 for medical literature to which reference has already
been made.
THE HOMCEOPATHIC LIBRARY. —The additions to this
library were 115 volumes and 50 pamphlets. Of these, 63
volumes were bought, and 42 volumes and 50 pamphlets were
presented.
The principal gifts were a set of the Homeopathische
Monatsbldtter, I873-1901, from Dr. Richard Haehl, the editor,
and a quantity of desirable medical matter, consisting of
books, pamphlets, transactions and proceedings of societies,
etc., from Dr. G. W. Bowen, of Fort Wayne, Indiana. The
total of bills certified to was $218.52.

It is seen by referring to the first table that the cost of the
work at ordinary prices was $2,597.85. Comparing this with




OCTOBER MEETING, 1902.                       117
the actual cost for labor and materials, $2,596.7I, there is a
balance in favor of the bindery of $I.I4.   This is the smallest
balance yet reported, but such balances must always be affected
by the amount of material bought, as compared with that
used during the year. The number of employees was one
less than in the year before, and, in consequence, both output and expense were considerably reduced.
On the basis of the percentages shown in the second
table, the expense to be borne by each of the libraries is as
follows:
General  Library............................................................ $,93I  95
Law   Library....................................................................  37   33
Medical Library.............................................................  24I  49
Homoeopathic Library..........................................  I8 I8
D ental   Library.................I.............I...................................   33  76
Dental Lbrary..33 76
Total........................................................................ 2,596  7
The above amounts have been charged to the appropriations for the several libraries.
The following statement in regard to the bindery, from its
establishment in February, 1896, to July I, I902, will be of
interest:
Value of work done, based on outside prices...         $I5,263 59
Cost of  Plant........................................  715  90
Paid  out in  wages....................................  II,37I  58
Cost of  materials.....................................  3,18I  24  I5,268  72
Excess of outlay over value of work........            5 13
Value of Plant and Material on hand.....             1,200 00
To the credit of the bindery.........         $ I,94 87
I trust you will pardon me if, in concluding this report, I
call attention to the fact that it is my twenty-fifth annual
report as Librarian of the University, and that this year completes my twenty-ninth year of service in the Library.
When I assumed the duties of librarian in October, I877,
the Library occupied a part of the lower floor of the old Law
Building; now the Library Building is one of the largest on
the Campus; then there were upon the shelves 26,409 volumes;
now there are I65,ooo volumes; then the number of period



118


OCTOBER MEETING, i902.


icals taken was 88; now I,ooo are taken; then the recorded
use of the Library, which was practically the whole use, was
less than 50,000 volumes annually; now the recorded use,
which does not exceed one-half of the actual use, is 167,949
volumes; then the accessions for the year were 667 volumes;
this year 9,539 volumes were added; then the Library was open
for use IO1   hours daily; now it is open I44 hours; then the
force consisted of the Librarian, a lady doing clerical work,
and a lad to assist in serving readers; now the force consists
of the librarian, three assistants in charge of departments of
work, three other assistants, eight desk attendants, two persons in charge of seminary rooms, and a bindery force of four
persons.
Probably in no department of the University are the great
changes wrought in the last quarter century more apparent
than in this one.
The increase in the number of volumes in the time is creditable, but in this respect we have been outstripped by a number of other Universities. In the use of our books, however,
I am convinced that we have surpassed all others. I will
repeat what I have said in an earlier report, that the characteristic of the Ann Arbor student is the reading habit.
Very respectfully submitted,
RAYMOND C. DAVIS,
Librarian.
October I. I902.
On motion of Regent Barbour, the report was accepted
and ordered printed in the minutes, and it was also ordered
that 500 copies be furnished the Librarian for exchange with
other libraries.

ANN ARBOR, MICH., April 15, 1903.
PRESIDENT JAMES B. ANGELL,
Ann Arbor, Mich.:
Dear Sir:-As all engineering students are required to
stay to one Summer term, the present class of chemical engineers will have to remain this coming summer. As some of
the class are irregular in their course, there will probably
not be over six or eight of these who will have to be here;
these will all take three hours work in dynamo-electric machinery. This is the only prescribed work they must take.
Under the present rules if they take elective work to fill up
their time to the six hours which is expected of Summer
School students they will have to pay the Summer School
fee of twenty dollars. As they 'are required to stay it does
not seem exactly just that they should have to pay this fee or
else take only half work. I would like, therefore, to have
you request the Regents to allow. the chemical engineering
students, who are required to remain to the Summer School
to take dynamo-electric machinery, to elect such other work
as may best suit their needs up to three hours without payment of the Summer School fee.
Very truly yours,
CHAS. E. GREENE.
Professor M. L. D'Ooge, executor of the estate of Love
M. Palmer, tendered securities amounting to $10,907.04,

ANN ARBOR, MICH., April 21, 1903.
To the Board of Regents, University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN: —About a year ago Mr. Alfred C. Lane,
State Geologist, wrote to both Dr. Prescott and myself,
inquiring as to whether we could make arrangements
whereby analyses could be made in this Chemical Laboratory
for the Geological Survey. We, Dr. Prescott and myself,
considered the matter. and wrote that if there was quite, an
amount of work to be done, enough to pay the salary of an
assistant, we would request the Board of Regents to appoint
an assistant to do the work and the Survey would pay for




APRIL MEETING, 1903.


175


the analyses, Mr. Lane could not at that time promise any
definite amount of work and no further action was taken.
He now has about two hundred determinations which he
would iike to have done as soon as possible and says that
there will probably be three hundred or so next year. I
think it only right for this laboratory to co-operate as far
as practicable with the State Geological Survey. Our present force cannot attend to this work but I would make the
following proposition: That I be empowered to appoint
an assistant to make such analyses as are called for by the
State Geologist. That this assistant receive no compensation from the University. That the State Geologist pay one
dollar for each determination made and that of this amount
the assistant receive three-fourths and one-fourth go to the
University, to the credit of the chemical laboratory, to pay
for the chemicals and apparatus used in the work. Dr.
Prescott has requested me to attend to this matter and I will
take charge of the work if the Board wishes, without compensation for myself. The University can in this way
materially assist the work of the Geological Survey and more
than reimburse itself for the materials used in the work. I
would request that I be authorized to select such an assistant and to begin thrc wTrk at once.
Respectfully submitted,
E. D. CAMPBELL.

Regent Dean presented and read the following communication from the Director of the Chemical Laboratory:
ANN ARBOR, MICH., May 6, 1903.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
Gentlemen-I am asked by Assistant Professor Alviso
B. Stevens to present his request for a leave of absence for
the next two college years without salary for the purpose
of study in Europe. The Faculty of the School of Pharmacy recommend that this request of Professor Stevens be
granted, looking forward to his return to his post with
added strength. He has served as assistant professor since
1892, his last reappointment being two years ago (Minutes,
1901, June, page 672). His subject, the Technique of Pharmacy, is important to the school. Its alumni are strongly
attached to him, and the Faculty and Dean unite with them
in desiring the long continuance of his services in the school.
In providing for the work of Professor Stevens during
his absence, it is recommended,
I. That Assistant Professor Schlotterbeck be charged
with the superintendence of the class and laboratory work in
the Technics of Pharmacy, and (by help of assistants) with
the teaching of the course in the Chemistry of Alkaloids,
also that he serve as Secretary and Registrar.
2. That Walter H. Blome, B.S., T902, for the last three
vears Assistant in Pharmacy, be appointed as Acting In



182


MAY IMEETING, 1903.


structor in Pharmacy at $900 a. year for the next two years
(not looking forward to reappointment).
3. That it be further authorized to obtain the services
of a non-resident lecturer or laboratory teacher for a part
or the whole of the second semester in Professor Stevens'
subjects at an expenditure of $3oo each year. This will
leave $400 unexpended on account of absence of Professor
Stevens.
I have recommended on personal grounds the advancement of Assistant Professor J. 0. Schlotterbeck to be
Junior Professor under the salary budget of the coming
year. I desire now to propose this promotion for the added
reason of his increased responsibility during the next two
years, and because this expenditure will be covered for the
next two years by the unexpended residue of Mr. Stevens'
salary. - (Blome, $90oo; non-resident teacher, $300; balance
to apply on salary of Dr. Schlotterbeck, $400; total, $I,600.)
Therefore, this promotion of Professor Schlotterbeck would
require in the work of Pharmacy and Pharmacognosy no
expenditure beyond that of the present year until two years
hence, and then an annual increase of $400.
Respectfully submitted,
ALBERT B. PRESCOTT.
On motion of Regent Dean, leave of absence was granted
to Professor A. B. Stevens for two years without salary,
and the distribution of his work as recommended in the
foregoing communication was approved, except that the
title of Professor Schlotterbeck be not changed, and that
the $400 added to his salary for the next two years shall
cease on the return of Professor Stevens.
On motion of Regent Dean, Carl C. Tarbox, A.B., was
appointed Instructor in Rhetoric in the Engineering Department for one year at a salary of $900, by the full vote of the

granted leave of absence for one year without pay, and that
his work and salary be distributed as follows: That Dr.
Raymond Pearl and Dr. S. J. Holmes be each assigned a
part of the work and receive $300 each- for such additional
service. That Mr. George Wagner be made Instructor in
Zoology for one year, salary $9oo; and that $IoQ be used
towards paying the salary of an assistant for the same work.
This arrangement to continue for one year only.
The motion was carried on a call vote.

MAY' MEETING, 1903.


On motion of Regent Fletcher, the Treasurer was
directed to pay Koch Brothers the sum o'f $3,277.70, in full
of their contract for the erection and completion of the
Palmer Ward, which amount includes all extra work done
on said building.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, it was voted to contract
with the Gardner Elevator Company of Detroit to put six
automatic gates on the elevators in the new M/edical Building at a cost, complete, of $125.
Regent Barbour moved that the Professor of Elocution
be allowed $ioo, or so much thereof as may be necessary,
to cover his traveling expenses while conducting contests
at other Universities, and that $500 be allowed for assistants
in Elocution for the ensuing year. The motion was carried
on a call vote.
Regent Fletcher moved that the entire roof of the new
Engineering Building (except the boiler room) be fireproofed at a cost of $2,127.06. The motion was carried oin
a call vote.
A communication was received from Dr. Peterson which
was, on motion of Regent Barbour, referred to the Dean of
the Medical Faculty.
On motion of Regent Dean, Mr. Norman A. Wood was
reappointed Taxidermist for one year, salary, $700.
Regent Farr, from the committee to consider the advisability of the University using its gift funds in the erection of
an apartment house on vacant property in the city of Detroit
belonging to the University, reported as follows:
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
Gentlem nen-Your committee appointed to investigate
and report upon the advisability of investing a certain
amount of your trust funds in the erection of an apartment
house in the City of Detroit, upon the premises donated to
the University by the Hon. L. L. Barbour, one of the mem —
bers of your honorable body, respectfully report:
That we visited Detroit upon the i th day of May last
for the purpose of the inquiry to which we had been
appointed. We found that there are a number of apartment
houses in the city, now constructed and in full operation, and
others in course of construction. The cost of these houses




lMA Y AMEETING, 1903.


189


ranges from fifty to two hundred thousand dollars, the cost
of the land upon which they are built being from 12 to 30
per cent of the entire cost. These buildings appear to be in
great and increasing demand, and when finished are quickly
rented. Indeed, they have been rented in advance of completion in some instances, and it is claimed might have been
in all had the owners permitted. These appear to pay a fair,
in many cases a large, interest upon the investment. The
smallest per cent appears in the case of the Palms, which is
about 6.8 per cent. The highest we found to be 19 per cent.
Of the cost of maintaining these houses, nearly 2 per cent
is for taxes. The question now arises whether it is good
policy to use a large part of the trust funds in the erection
of a building upon your property on Woodward avenue.
The principal of these funds is to be kept intact, and the
interest to be used for the purposes of the respective trusts.
We have two considerations before us as to these funds:
First, safety, which is of primary and controlling importance; second, the income to be secured.
This trust property now consists of real estate, mortgages and bonds. It now yields a net income of nearly 5
per cent, and is fairly well invested. The following reasons might be urged against the use of the trust funds in
the erection of such a building:
I. It would absorb a large part of the trust funds and
be putting, to use a homely adage, too many eggs in one
basket.
2. The changing character of locations in cities, and
notably in Detroit, as for instance in the vicinity of the
Biddle House, and of Michigan avenue.
3. The danger that the business of building apartment
houses in the city of Detroit may be overdone.
4. That there will be a constant depreciation of the property by use.
The above objections are worthy of consideration.
Upon the other side there appears to your.committee
many arguments in favor of such investment. Among them
we may state the following:
T. That investing in this manner will bring the larger
part of the trust funds within easy reach, and they can thus




190


MAY MEETING, 1903.


be readily managed from Ann Arbor, and the oversight
\would be comparatively inexpensive.
2. The trust funds are not sufficiently large to warrant
the employment of a fiscal agent, and the control and employment must then necessarily devolve upon the Finance Committee of the Board, and this is a heavy burden upon men
oppressed with personal affairs and often living at a distance
from the University.
3. We now have more than ten per cent o~ the cost of
building in the site, at present wholly unproductive.
4. This site is in the best resident district of the city
and in all human probability likely to remain so.
5. In such an investment the University would have
nearly 2 per cent the advantage of private owners in the
immunity from taxation.
6. In the opinion of the committee, from the facts presented to it, an income sufficiently large could be derived
from such a building to yield an income of 5 per cent ani
to leave a balance for a sinking fund to more than provide
for any depreciation.
Your committee would therefore respectfully report in
favor of the erection of an apartment house upon the Barhour property (so called) in the city of Detroit, the details
as to cost, plans, etc., to be left to the future action of the
Board.
Also we recommend the purchase of 54 feet adjoining
said premises on the south at a cost of not more than $6,ooo.
GEO. A. FARR.
CHARLES D. LAWTON.
FRANK W. FLETCHER.
The report was accepted and laid on the table until the,
next meeting.
Mr. Rembert Jones, Assistant Electrician, who was requested to inspect the plant on the campus and ascertain if
there is unnecessary waste of light and power, and if so
what means should be taken to prevent such waste, made an
exhaustive and intelligent report covering the whole subject,
with a number of recommendations, which, if carried out,
would, in his judgment, materially reduce the waste of light.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, the report was accepted and




M-A Y MIEETING, 1903.;91
placed on file, and the Building Committee were authorized
to carry out the recommendations therein contained.
Regent Dean stated that after the general budget for the
ensuing year had been adopted by the Board, the Engineering Faculty raised a committee on classification and schedule
of hours, and that said committee would require an allowance of $40 to cover postage, stationery and printing. He
moved that the secretary be requested to furnish the needed
supplies to the extent of $4o and charge the same to the
postage budget for general purposes. It was so ordered
by the full Board.
On motion the Board adjourned to Tuesday, June 16, at 
10 o'clock A. M.
JAMES H. WADE,
Secretary.

from the Dean of the Department of Medicine and Surgery,
and the recommnendations therein contained were approved
as indicated below by the full vote of the Board.
ANN ARBOR, June IO, I903.
H-ONORABLE CHARLES D. L\AWTON,
Chairman of the Committee of the Board of Regents on
the Department of Medicine and Surgery:
Dcar Sir-I am instructed by the Faculty of the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Michigan to present to the Honorable Board of Regents the following requests:
1. The Medical Faculty endorses the action of the Hospital Committee with reference to the work in x-Ray diagnosis and lr-Ray therapy and photography. The recommendation from the Hospital Committee bearing on this point




208


JUNE MEETING, 1903.


has already gone to you through another channel. The
Hospital Committee recommends that all the work with the,r-Ray apparatus be placed under the charge of Mr. Vernon
J. Willey, Instructor in Electrotherapeutics. Unless work
with the.j-Ray apparatus is placed under the charge of
some responsible and competent person, there is great danger
that injury may be done the apparatus.
2. The Medical Faculty requests that your Honorable
body address a letter to the Joint Asylum Board asking that
Board to co-operate with the Board of Regents in inaugurating the work of the Psychopathic Ward.   I may say in
explanantion of this request that it is the intention of both
Medical Faculty and the superintendents of the various
Insane Asylums in the State, with your sanction, to employ
Dr. August Hoch, Medical Superintendent of the Psychopathic WAard and Junior Professor of Psychiatry and Neural
Pathology, and Pathologist to the State Asylums, with the
proviso that the Joint Board of the asylums will pay Dr.
Hoch's salary. Dr. Herdman or the Dean, or both of us, will
be glad to appear before your Board, if you deem it necessary, and explain the details of the proposed arrangement.
3. The Medical Faculty recommends that Dr. A. S.
Warthin be given the title of Professor of Pathology and
Director of the Pathological Laboratory. The reason for
this action lies in the fact that Dr. Warthin's position
appears to medical men in other faculities as somewhat
anomalous. Moreover, it has been stated that we have no
full Professor of Pathology, and the fact that Pathology is
under the control of the Professor of Theory and Practice
has led to some criticism. Compliance with this request does
not carry with it the necessity of changing or advancing
Dr. Warthin's salary at the present time.
4. The Medical Faculty requests that the title of Dr.
Frederick Baldwin be changed to Instructor in Pathology.
Dr. Baldwin is at present Assistant in Pathology and has a
salary of $500 a year. The change in title, it should be
understood, does not provide for any increase in salary
unless your Honorable body feel that it can comply with
the request made by the Faculty in the budget already submitted. Dr. Baldwin has done his work faithfully, has been
with us for a number of years, and the only inducement




JUNE MEETINrG, 1903.


209


that he has to stay is the hope that he may be called elsewhere.   The chances of his being called elsewhere will be
greatly enhanced by this proposed change in title.
5. The Medical Faculty earnestly requests that you provide for an extra interne in the Hospital.    This seems to
be necessary in order that the increased number of patients
in the Hospital may receive proper and prompt treatment.
In the list of instructors to be given later we make a recommencation for the filling of this position.   There are six
departments in the Hospital, and as there are only five
internes, it has been found that it is impossible to give the
patients in each department the prompt and proper treatment which they should have.
6. The following recommendations for appointments to
subordinate positions in the Medical Department, for the
year 1903-04, are herewith submitted:
That Dr. Jeanne C. Solis be reappointed Demonstrator of Nervous Diseases and Electrotherapeutics, salary, $500.
That Vernon J. Willey, Instructor in Electrotherapeutics, be
reappointed, salary, $6oo.
That Dr. Theophil Klingmann be reappointed Assistant in Diseases of the Mind and the Nervous System, salary, $200.

To the Honorable Board of Regents:
The University School of Music respectfully requests the Board
of Regents to furnish electrical power for the organ in use in the
School of Music building, compensation for same to be made by the
School of lMusic, at the same rates which are now being paid to the
ci y company.
In explanation of this request, the following statement is made:
The organ is supplied with a low-tension motor and with other




JULY MEETING, 1903.


221


apparatus designed for low-tension service. The city company is
now changing to high-tension service. By an exchange of motors,
which would entail considerable expense upon the school, we could
operate the organ with the new power, except the appliances for
furnishing: electricity to the key-board; this cannot be operated with
the high-tension system, and, we must, therefore, secure some other
source of power or be practically deprived of the use of our organ.
The amount of power used is small, a boy being able to furnish
the force necessary; the power will be required for a period of sev(ral hours daily during' the season when the school is in session; the
hours during 'which the organ is used are during the day time,
almost entirely.
We dislike exceedingly to bother the Board of Regents with
this matter, but there seems no other source available.
Respectfully submitted by the Board of Directors of the school.
G. F. ALLMENDINGER,
Chr. Finance Con.
Professor Beman stated that he was unable to secure
such men as the University ought to have, as Instructors in
Mathematics, to fill the places now vacant, for a salary of
$900. Regent Barbolur moved        that he be    allowed  to
offer a salary of $1200 for each of the two men needed. The
motion was carried. as follows:
Ayes-Regents Butterfield, Barbour and Dean.
Nays-Regents Farr and Lawton.
Regent Barbour moved that Instructor James W. Glover
be made Assistant Professor of Mathematics with salary of
$i600.
The motion was carried by a unanimous vote.
On motion of Regent Dean, Professor Asaph Hall was
retained as Professor of Astronomy for one year at a salary
of $2000.
Mr. Holland, in charge of the bindery and printing plant,
asked permission to purchase a numbering machine at a cost
o!f $I5.  The expenditure was allowed.
On motion of Regent Farr, the Secretary was directed
to print in the proceedings of the Board that portion of the
will of the late Love M. Palmer which describes her bequest
to the University, as follows:


"Eighth-I hereby give and bequeath to the Regents of the




222


JULY MEETING, 1903.


University of Michigan the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,ooo) to be expended by them in the erection [of] an appropriate and
handsome ward of the University Hospital, to be known as 'The
Dr. A. B. Palmer Memorial Ward.' And I also give to said Regents
of the University of Michigan the further sum of fifteen thousand
dollars ($15,000) in trust, the income from the same to be devoted
to the support and maintenance of free beds, in said building or
ward, known as the 'Dr. A. B. Palmer Memorial Ward.'"
On motion of Regent Dean, the salary of A. S. Berry,
carpenter in the engineering shops, was made $2.25 per day,
by the full vote of the Board.
A committee of the city council appeared before the
Board and stated that the council had voted to submit to the
voters of the city a proposition to raise by tax the sum of
$20,000 for the erection and completion of a joint detention
hospital, provided the University will heat and light the
same, and provide nurses and medical attendants.  In other
words, the University should maintain said hospital and care
for all city patients with contagious diseases.
Regent Farr moved that the proposition by the city to
erect a joint hospital for the treatment of contagious diseases
commends itself to the Board and will have their careful
consideration. This motion was carried by the full Board.
On motion the Board adjourned to Wednesday, Sept. 9,
at Io o'clock A. M.

The question of supplying the University laundry with
soft water was referred to the Committee on Buildings and
Grounds.




224


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1903.


Tile President then presented and read his annual report,
after calling Regent Barbour to the chair. The report is as
follows:
THE PRESIDENT'S REPORT.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
I have the honor to present to you my Report for the year
ending September 30, 1903.
During that period your attention has been largely
directed to the construction of new buildings. Never before
in the history of the University has so much work of that
kind been proceeding at once. The addition of some special
gifts to our regular resources has made this possible, though
the exceptionally great cost of building at this time has made
a draft upon our treasury which we would gladly have been
spared. We have completed and taken possession of the
new Medical Building. It is admirably adapted to the purposes for which it was designed, and adds very greatly to
the strength of our medical instruction.
We have also completed and occupied the Palmer Ward,
which the generous bequest of the late Mrs. Dr. Palmer
enabled us to erect as a memorial to her husband. But we
deemed it wise to add an expenditure of about $5,000 to,
adapt the building completely to the needs of the Hospital
of which it forms a part.
We have also finished the large building which contains
the new boiler house and the laundry adjacent to the University Hospital. We shall now be able to heat the new Psychopathic Ward as well as the University Hospital from this
house. We have a sense of relief at the removal of the
boilers from the basement of the building, in which the
nurses lodged, since the danger to them from accidental
explosion is thus removed. The spacious laundry now easily
cares for the needs of both the University Hospital and the
Homoeopathic Hospital.
The Psychopathic Ward, for which the State made a
special appropriation, at last approaches completion, and will
soon be occupied. We regret exceedingly the long delay in
the erection of this structure and tlso what we regarded as




SEPTEMBER MIEETING, 1o03.


225


the necessity of adding $5,000 from the University treasury
to fire-proof the upper part of the building. But we thought
that we should hardly be acquitted of blame if from lack of
secure construction any of the peculiar class of patients who
are expected to occupy that ward should be harmed in case
of fire.
The new Engineering Building, which is to be the largest
and most costly structure on our grounds, is well advanced,
but to our regret is far from being completed. Large as it
is, there is every indication that owing to the strong inclination of students at this time for engineering branches every
foot of room in it will be needed by the time it is ready for
occupancy.
Let it not be thought that we are constructing more buildings than are necessary. The rapid and continuous increase
in the number of our students, the need of the very best facilities for instruction, the enlargement of the plant for heating
and lighting, which the addition of new buildings or the
enlargement of old ones calls for, have compelled us to incur
an expense which we would gladly have avoided. Indeed,
nothing but the limits to our means prevent us from carrying
still further this work of construction. As has been intimated
in previous reports, we need at once a considerable addition
to the Physical Laboratory, an entirely new building for the
Dental Department, which is wretchedly housed, an enlargement of the Library for seminary rooms and more book
room, the reconstruction of the interior of the old Medical
Building, which is worn out, not to speak of ampler accommodations for the students of History and Eco:nomics, of a
laboratory for the Natural Sciences and of a new Chemical
Laboratory. For some time to come all the money we can
accumulate for our building fund, after making provision
for the work of instruction, is sure to be required to meet
really pressing wants. It is a problem, of no little delicacy
and difficulty to decide how much of our income we can
annually set aside for buildings without curtailing unduly
our appropriations for apparatus, books and salaries. While
we cannot be blind to the urgent need of the repair or
enlargement of our oldbuildings and of the addition of new




226


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1903.


buildings, we cannot properly overlook the facts that good
teachers rather than fine structures make a good university,
that with our modest scale of salaries we are constantly
exposed to the danger of losing some of- our most useful
professors, and that with our growing classes we must have
an increasing number of instructors or be content with a
diminution in the efficiency of our teaching.
Whether we consider merely the prosperity of the University or the welfare of the State at large, it is most encouraging to observe how the weaker high schools of the State
are becoming strong, and how   the stronger schools are
improving the quality of their work. It is not many years
since some of the leading college men in the East were disposed to speak rather slightingly of high schools as preparatory schools for colleges, and to look with sympathy
mainly upon the academies and private schools as the
nurseries of college students. But that day has passed even
in New England, and it has hardly ever been known in Michigan. While we have a few excellent private schools and
academies in this State, yet both here and in the Western
states generally the great mass of students are and will continue to be trained for college in the public lAgh schools.
It is therefore a cause for the greatest satisfaction on our
part that the improvement in the high schools already established in the West is going on so rapidly and that the number of such schools which can properly prepare students for
college work is multiplying at a most gratifying rate. One
of the first ambitions of every western town, whose population and wealth will permit it, is to have a good high school.
The law which has now been passed, permitting the centralization of the school districts in a township, is likely to
encourage the providing of high school instruction in many
towns where it has been impracticable heretofore.  Such
instruction may thus be brought within the easy reach of a
large number of youths to whom it has been inaccessible.
It is highly probable that a similar cause will operate to
increase largely the demands on the colleges and universities in all the Western states. It is not extravagant, therefore, to predict that at no distant day, from this and other




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1903.


227


cooperative causes, the number of students at this University
will be doubled, as it has already been doubled within the
last fifteen years.
The number of Michigan schools from which we receive
students on diploma, after an inspection of such schools by
the University Examiner, is 127. Ten years ago the number
was 78. Several of these schools have been strengthened
through the sympathetic encouragement and counsel of the
University authorities, until they have worthily gained a
place upon our list. Not the least important part of the
work of the University has been its influence, exerted both
directly and indirectly, in the development of the high
schools. In its earliest days it accomplished excellent results
by the establishment of the branch schools, which were finally
transformed into the earliest high schools organized in the
State. In I870 it inaugurated the plan, ever since followed,
of visiting and examining schools and of receiving without
examination the graduates of such schools as were found
prepared to fit scholars for our classes. That plan, borrowed
with adaptations from the German system, has been adopted
generally by the colleges and universities in the states west
of us, and by not a few in the East. Under sharp discussion
it has gained rather than lost ground. We have established
this so-called diploma relation with a considerable number
of schools in the states adjacent to Michigan. Since it is
burdensome to us to visit schools in those states, the official
examiners of this University and of our sister universities
in those states are endeavoring, with good prospects of
success, to fix upon some plan by which each university
may safely receive the verdict of the other universities on the
merits of at least the stronger schools in their respective
states. If the plan meets in practice our expectations, it
must bring us into close relations with a considerable number
of schools remote from us and probably cause a substantial
addition to our body of students. This cooperation of the
universities in a spirit so free from jealousy is most gratifying. In truth, there is no ground for jealousy in respect to
students. For the rapidly increasing population of the Northwest, the prosperity of its inhabitants, the general desire for




228


SEPTEJMBER MEETING, 1903.


higher education, and the development of the high schools
all contribute to crowd the halls of colleges, universities and
technological schools in our section of the country. The
problem is not so much to secure students as to provide for
the proper accommodation and education of those who throng
the halls of the better institutions. And in the history of our
country there is nothing finer than the generous provision
which Michigan and her sister states in the West have
made for education.  If the sums which the legislatures
appropriate for universities are capitalized at the rate 'of
four or five per cent, it will be found that they represent
amounts fairly comparable with the permanent endowments
of most of the ancient and stronger universities in the Eastern
states.
The total attendance' during the past year, 3,792, differs
but very little from that of the previous year, 3,782. Excluding the Summer School there was a gain of 21, including that
school,'a gain of Io. -The slight loss in some departments,
and the heavy loss in the Dental Department, were more than
made good by the unusually large gain of I20 in the Engineering Department. The same causes which were operative
in cutting down the numbers in the Dental School last year
still held back the attendance this year, namely, the high
requirements for admission and the lengthening of the course
to four years. But it is expected now that most of the
other strong schools will this year redeem their promise to
establish the four years' course in imitation of ours. In that
case we may reasonably hope that our school will regain its
relative attendance within a year or two.
For the first time, I think, in the history of the University we can record the interesting fact that among our students were one or more representatives from every one of
the states of our. Union.  All of our territories, except
Alaska, and all of our new possessions, the Hawaiian Islands,
Porto Rico, and the Philippines, and the following foreign
states and provinces were represented, Japan, China, India,
South Africa, Turkey, Austria, Germany, England, Bulgaria,
Mexico, Jamaica, Ontario, Quebec. The number in attendance from Indiana, Ohio, New York and Pennsylvania con



SEPTEMBER MEETI.NG, 1903.


229


tinues to increase, being respectively 165, 306, I58, I27, while
the number from Illinois, though 12 less than the preceding
year, is still 314. From New England we received 36. This
widespread and undiminished appreciation of the work of
this University is most gratifying. By ministering to the sons
and daughters of the whole Union, this institution is
repaying in some degree the debt which it owes to the nation,
which, through the Congressional grant of two townships of
land, furnished the original endowment for its foundation and
support. The State, on the other hand, recognizes with gratitude the fact that other states have contributed to her many
of her most useful citizens, who, having as students been
attracted hither by the University, have taken up their permanent abode here and enriched her by their lives.
The number of women in attendance (exclusive of the
Summer School) was as follows:
Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts....... 654
Department of Medicine and Surgery..............  35
Department of Law.                                  5
Department of Law.............................  5
School of Pharmacy..............................   3
Homceopathic Medical College..........            12
College  of Dental Surgery.........................  5
714
An inspection of the figures of the preceding year shows
that there is this year a slight decrease in the attendance of
women as compared with that of men, namely, of five-tenths
of one per cent in the entire University and of seven-tenths
of one per cent in the Literary Department.
The discussion of the expediency of the co-education of
the sexes has been reopened in some quarters, because one
large university has decided to try the experiment of separate instruction of the sexes during the first two years of
the undergraduate course, and two or three other privately
endowed universities have been considering the wisdom of
limiting the number of women whom they will admit. Without attempting to judge whether there are any peculiar conditions in these institutions which call for the action they
propose, it is safe to say that the state universities are not




230


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1903.


likely to change their policy with respect to the admission of
women. So far as I know, nothing in their experience suggests the necessity of considering the question, whether their
long established policy needs to be modified.
In accordance with its desire and aim to be of the utmost
service to Michigan, the University is strengthening its work
in training men in the science and the art of Forestry. One
of the gravest economic problems in our State is presented
by the desirableness of restoring, if possible, the forests which
have been destroyed and of properly caring for the woodlands
which are still left. Many millions of acres, which have been
stripped of valuable pine, are lying comparatively worthless.
Over six millions of acres of such lands have reverted to the
State because the owners chose to surrender them rather than
pay the taxes on them. Through the generosity of Regent
F. W. Fletcher a tract of over eight thousand acres has come
into the possession of the University.  Mr. Filibert Roth,
B. S., one of our graduates, who has been an Instructor in
Forestry in Cornell University and who has been engaged in
work in Forestry under the National Agricultural Department,
has now been appointed Professor. Through him we expect
to cooperate with our State Forestry Commission in directing
public attention to the high importance of improving our
woodlands, while we are preparing young men for taking
responsible positions in caring wisely for the woodlands we
have and for the useful service, if it proves practicable, of
reforesting waste lands which have been denuded of their
forests and left in barrenness. It is believed that our situation affords special facilities for students of forestry, and
the instruction in the scientific branches required is already
provided for. There is now sufficient call for the courses in
forestry to indicate that we have not entered upon this work
too early.
With the purpose of meeting a pressing public need we
also made provision in the Department of Medicine and Surgery last April for the treatment of patients who had been
bitten by mad dogs. It was observed that in this State and in
adjoining states there was great danger of loss of life from
hydrophobia. A considerable number of persons were bitten.

As they could be successsfully treated only by going to Chicago or New York and by being subjected to pretty large
expense, we undertook to care for Michigan patients gratuitously, and some twenty-three from various parts of the
State have been relieved. This act has, it is believed, been
warmly appreciated by the public.
Our Hospitals are of course always rendering a gratuitous service to a great number of needy patients. In the
University Hospital there were during the year 2,526
patients, and in the Homceopathic Hospital I,875. A majority of these are persons who earn their living by manual toil.
They are treated without any charge for the medical and
surgical care they receive. Among them are residents of
seventy-nine counties of this State.
The Library contained on June 30 last 174,740 volumes
and 3,300 pamphlets. The recorded circulation of books was
I68,603. We are suffering for the want of room for the
storage of books, and even more for the lack of seminary
rooms for advanced students. As the Library is the very
heart of a university, it is to be hoped that the day is not
distant when our building can be enlarged.
The Report of the Curator of the Museum shows that it
is visited by an average of nearly a hundred persons daily.
It becomes a serious question in the administration of such a
museum, which is intended primarily to contain scientific
collections, how far it shall receive objects which are simply
rare or curious, but which have no special scientific value.
Some of them are interesting to visitors, and so attract
attention. But unless a conservative policy in regard to
accepting everything which is offered to us, is followed, we
shall soon have much of the room in the building occupied by
articles of no great scientific importance.
It is noteworthy that museums are apt to be better
supplied with scientific specimens from remote regions than
from their immediate neighborhood. We should like it to
be understood that specimens illustrating the flora and fauna
and archaeology of our own state are especially desirable and
will be very gratefully received.




232


SEPTEM3BER MEETING, 1903.


The general work of the University in all its departments
was carried on in a vigorous, earnest and orderly manner,
which is the best indication of a healthy life, but which calls
for no special remark in this Report.
The Summer School during this past season had a larger
attendance than ever before, namely:
Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts....... 382
Department of Medicine and Surgery................  68
Department of Law............................... 74
524
Of these I50 were regular students of the University. The
others are chiefly teachers, most of them from high schools,
but some from colleges. They are very earnest workers.
The value of the school to them and to the University is
beyond question. Not a few of the teachers, who have not
had the opportunity to gain a college education, are inspired
while here to return and enter upon a regular collegiate
course.
It were much to be desired that we had the means for
publishing in the name of the University the results of many
of the scientific, literary, economic and historical researches
made by members of our Faculties. They form valuable and
distinct contributions to knowledge. They now appear, if at
all, in various magazines, journals and proceedings of
learned societies, not infrequently in journals published by
other universities, which thus rather than we gain the reputation accruing from such publications. The professors of the
ancient classics are about to bring out a collection of papers
which will bear the name of the University. If it is successful, it is hoped it may directly or indirectly open the way for
the University at little expense to publish other series. I
know of no way in which a private contribution, which need
not be very large, would be more useful than in the aid of an
enterprise for the publication of the results of University
researches. I am confident that the friends of the institution,
as well as scholars generally, would be surprised to see how
many and how creditable they are.




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1903.


233


Grave as are the problems which the continuous growth
of the University and the constantly rising standard of
higher education in this country press upon the Board of
Regents and the Faculties for consideration, we enter upon
another year with confidence and hope, because we witness
so many gratifying evidences that the State of Michigan is
willing and eager to sustain the University with liberality,
and that far beyond her borders, in this land and in foreign
lands, there is a hearty appreciation of the work she does.
JAMES B. ANGELL.
On motion of Regent Hill the report of the President
was accepted and an edition of 8000 copies was ordered
printed for distribution.
The President presented and read the following communication from Professor Albert A. Stanley:
ANN ARBOR, September 8, 1903.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
'Gentlemnen-Through the kindness of M\r. C. M' Post of the
firm of Lyon & Healy of Chicago, Illinois, the Stearns Collection
of Musical Instruments of the University of Michigan has been
enriched by the gift of several unique instruments. These instruments are reproductions of famous and historical instruments and
were especially constructed for exhibition at the Columbian Exposition of I893. Since then they have been on view at the Field
Museum, but the firm were willing and desirous that they should be
part of a permanent collection consisting entirely of musical instruments. WQ have also received several models of actions from Mr.
H. H. Drummond, head of the pianoforte department of the above
named firm.
Respectfully,
AIBERT A. STANLEY.
On motion the President was requested to transmit the
thanks of the Board to Mr. C. M. Post, and through him to

Professor Guthe.
-JAMES B. ANCELL.
Regent Hill presented and read the following communication from Professor Scott:
ANN ARBOR, Sept. 8, 1903.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
Gentlemen-I have pleasure in calling your attention to a proposition recently submitted to me by Willis J. Abbot, editor of the
Pilgrim Magazine. Mr. Abbot offers to deliver to our students
without expense to them or to the University, a course of six
lectures on Modern Journalism in the United States, covering the
following subjects: I. Journalism as a Profession; 2. The Organization of a Newspaper; 3. The Collection and Treatment of News;
4. Magazines and Weekly Publications. The lectures would form
a part of the course in newspaper writing which I have announced
in the Department of Rhetoric for the coming semester.
Mr. Abbot is a graduate of the Literary Department in the class
of 1884. He has had wide experience in newspaper work and is an
author of repute. The proposed lectures would doubtless be an
original and a valuable contribution to a subject that is just now
attracting considerable attention.
Respectfully,
F. N. ScoTT.
On motion of Regent Hill, the proposition of Mr. Abbot
was accepted by the full Board.
The Board then took a recess until I:30 o'clock p. M.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
The Board reassembled at I:30 o'clock P. M.
Regent Hill moved that the sum     of $50 be appropriated for the purpose of aiding the Students' Christian Association in publishing a handbook of information for new
students.  The motion was carried on'a call vote.
Regent Lawton submitted the following communication
from  Dr. A. B. Prescott, and on his motion the Board
expressed their willingness to make the salary of Assistant
Professor Schlotterbeck permanent at $2000 on the return
of Professor A. B. Stevens.




236


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1903.


ANN ARBOR, Sept. 3, I903.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents,
Regent Lawton, Chairman of Department Committee:
Dear Sir-Circumstances make it important to learn, if possible,
from the Board, whether or not the advance which has just been
made for next two years in the salary of J. 0. Schlotterbeck, $600o
to $2000, can be made a permanent advance by action of the Board
one year hence.
This increase was made, at last May meeting, by reason of the
leave of absence of Assistant Prof. A. B. Stevens for two years.
That is, the Stevens' salary discontinued, $I600, was applied for next
two years to pay Instructor Blome $900, increase to Schlotterbeck
$400, and authorize $300 for a non-resident lecturer.
Now Dr. Schlotterbeck is solicited by a large manufacturing
house to take a position with them at not less than 3000 dollars.
He has replied, certainly not for the next year, being obligated to
remain here that time. He has then been assured that, if arranged
now, the same offer would be open to him one year hence.
Dr. Schlotterbeck says he would like to know now, if he is to
resume the rate of $1600 upon the return of Prof. Stevens in I905,
as in that case, though with great regret, he would be compelled to
leave the University a year hence and take this offer, in justice to
his professional interests. He has been an assistant professor since
I896.
It seems to me a fair question on the part of Dr. Schlotterbeck. 'I stated my judgment, as to retaining his services, in my
report on the salary budget for next year. I know of no personal
claims that stand in the way of his permanent advance to junior
professorship. Its effect on the salary budget would begin two
years hence, and then make an increase of $400.
I do not ask that his title be now changed to junior professor,
with permanent appointment at $2000, not if the Board find this inadvisable, but I respectfully ask that the Board express their intention,
or expectation, of this action one year from now.
Very respectfully,
A. B. PRgscoTT.
Regent Lawton moved that the salary of Dr. M. L.
Ward, Assistant in 'Clinical and Operative Dentistry, be
increased to $8oo, and that Mir. R. W. Bentley be appointed
Assistant to the Dean of the Dental Department and to the
Professor of Prosthetic Dentistry, without salary.
The motion was carried on a call vote.
The question of appointing Dr. Taft as Librarian of the




SEPTEMBER IMEETING, 1903.


237


Dental Library with salary of $500, was deferred until the
next meeting.
Regent Lawton submitted a code of rules for the government of the hospitals which were referred to the Medical
Committee for consideration.
On motion of Regent Lawton, Lydia M. DeWitt was
appointed Instructor in Histology for one year, salary $600,
by the full vote of the Board.
On motion of Regent Hill, Harrison M. Randall, Ph.D.,
was reappointed Instructor in Physics for one year, salary
$I200, by the full vote of the Board.
Regent Dean moved that Superintendent Miggett, be
authorized to employ a pattern maker in the engineering
shops at $2.50 per day. The motion was carried unanimously.
On motion of Regent Dean, Mr. W. L. Miggett, superintendent of shops,, was made a member of the Engineering
Faculty.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, Architect Kahn was
directed to have the kitchen for the pyschopathic ward placed
in the north end of the building.
Regent Fletcher moved that the contract to furnish pipe
and fittings for the new 'engineering building, according to
the specifications and schedule, be awarded to the John Davis
Company of Chicago, they being the lowest bidders, for the
sum of $4582.88. It was so ordered by the full Board.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, Mr. Fred McDonald was,
appointed assistant engineer in charge of the lighting plant
for one year in place of Mr. Rix, resigned, salary $850, by
the full vote of the Board.
Regent Fletcher moved that the Secretary be authorized
to pay Mr. R. B. Jackson, assistant superintendent olf the
new engineering building, an additional compensation of $30
per month for the months of July and August.
The motion was carried on a call vote.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, it was voted to pay the
contractor of the new engineering building $85 for making
conduits or channels in the fire proofing in order that the
steam and water pipes may be exposed.




238


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1903.


The request of the firemen for an increase of pay was
deferred until the next meeting.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, it was.voted to pay Albert
Kahn, architect, $700 for professional services on the new
engineering  building, and  $300 on the account of the
psychopathic ward.
On motion of Regent Barbour, the bill of Pond & Pond,
architects, for making plans for an extension to the Physical
Laboratory, was laid on the table until the next meeting.
Regent Hill moved that the contract for covering all the
exposed pipes and surfaces in the new boiler house, the tunnel to the psychopathic ward, and in the Palmer ward, be
awarded to the Philip Carey Mf'g Company of Detroit for
the sum of $I62I.I4.
The motion was carried on a call vote.
On motion of Regent Farr, the Treasurer was directed to
make a loan from the class fund of 1894, to Miss Mary
Louise Smith of $80 and the interest on the entire fund for
two years. This action was taken on the recommendation
of a committee of said class.
The President presented the resignation of Judge A. V.
McAlvay, as Professor of Law, to take effect October I,
1903.
On motion the resignation was accepted.
The Faculty of the Homceopathic Hospital gave notice
that the following persons had completed the  -ork in the
Training School for Nurses, and were recommended for
graduation:
Florence Atchison   Alma Howard        Ida Lockhart
Bessie Sinclair     Geneva Allen        Hattie Wilson.
On motion of Regent Carey, the President and Secretary were authorized to issue the proper certificates of graduation and attach the seal of the University thereto.
M'r. W. A. Hurst, Assistant Secretary of the State Commission of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, was present
for the purpose of ascertaining whether the University
desired to make an exhibit at St. Louis. After some discussion the matter was referred to the President and Secretary




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1903.              239
and Regent Dean, for consideration and report at the next
meeting of the Board.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, the proposition of J. E.
Bolles & Company, of Detroit, to put fire escapes on the
nurses' ward at University Hospital was accepted, provided
they will place them on the east and west sides, instead of the
north end, at a cost of $I75.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, the proposition of the
Powers Regulator Company, of Chicago, to install one of
their automatic tank regulators with four valves in the
psychopathic ward for the sum of $II5, was referred to the
Auditing Board with power.
On motion the Board adjourned to Wednesday, Oct. 14,
at o1 o'clock A. M.
JAMES H. WADE,
Secretary.




OCTOBER MEETING.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,     1
ANN ARBOR, October 14, I903.
The Board assembled in the Regents' room at 10 o'clock
A. M.
Present-Regents Butterfield, Hill, Lawton, Barbour,
Fletcher, and Carey.
Absent-Regents Farr and Dean.
The Secretary read the minutes of the last meeting, which
were, on motion, approved and ordered printed.
Communications which had reached the President were
placed in the hands of the standing committees of the Board
for consideration.
On motion of Regent Barbour, it was voted that the fire
escapes at University Hospital be placed on the north end of
the buildings.
Professors D'Ooge, Demmon, and Whitney, on behalf of
the contributors to the fund for the purchase of the portrait,
then presented to the Board an excellent oil portrait of the
late Professor B. A. Hinsdale.
On motion of Regent Lawton, the picture was accepted
by the Board, and the Secretary was directed to have it hung
in the Art Gallery of the University.
Professor Demmon, chairman of a committee raised by
the University Senate, to consider the advisability of the
University making an exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition, was present and made the following report:
ANN ARBOR, Oct. I2, I903.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
The Committee of the University Senate, appointed by the
President to consider and report on the question of an exhibit at




242            OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, beg leave to present the following facts and suggestions for the consideration of your honorable
body:
We have ascertained by correspondence that the leading universities of the country-Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Chicago, Wisconsin,
and Illinois, together with several smaller institutions, will make
exhibits of greater or less scope. We are also informed that the
exposition authorities, without any suggestion from this University,
have set apart a room 22'2X3I feet in the Palace of Education for
the use of the University of Michigan. If we are to occupy this
space, the Committee thinks the exhibit should consist, in the
main, of the following:
I. An illustrated pamphlet of from thirty to fifty pages containing a readable account of the rise and growth of the University,
with cuts of the buildings, tables of statistics, etc.,-this to be distributed freely to all visitors who care for it. (Such a pamphlet
would have permanent use for distribution from  the offices here
also.)
2. Bound volumes of reprints, so far as obtainable, showing
the results of scientific research at the University. This should
also include copies of printed theses accepted for the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy at this University; also, a carefully prepared
bibliography of publications by the various officers of instruction.
3. Models, charts, drawings, photographs of buildings, etc. For
this exhibit, there are about one thousand square feet of space at
our disposal.
In addition to these attractions it is thought desirable to make
this room a sort of headquarters for Michigan University graduates while at the Fair. This would necessitate providing chairs
and other suitable furniture. It would be necessary also to employ
a competent attendant who should receive visitors, dispense documents, and answer inquiries.
The Committee estimates that the expense of preparing, transporting, setting up, and caring for such an exhibit during the Fair
would approximate the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
ISAAC N. DEMMON.
ALBERT B. PRESCOTT.
CHARLES S. DENISON.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


243


On motion the report was referred to Regents Hill and
Carey for consideration.
Librarian Davis presented and read his annual report of
the present condition of the Library, and the use made of it
during the year ending June 30, I903. The report is as
follows:
LIBRARIAN'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR I902-I903.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN:-I have the honor to submit to you my
twenty-sixth annual report as librarian of the University.
There were in all of the libraries June 30, 1903, 174,740
volumes and 3,300 pamphlets.*
Of these, I39,002 volumes and 3,000 pamphlets were in
the General Library; 20,170 volumes were in the Law
Library; I2,62I volumes and 230 pamphlets were in the
Medical Library; 1,183 volumes were in the Dental Library;
and 1,764 volumes and 70 pamphlets were in the Library of
the Homceopathic College.
The total additions for the year were 8,053 volumes and
i,800 pamphlets, distributed as follows:  General Library,
6,660 volumes and 1,750 pamphlets; Law Library, 543 volumes; Medical Library, 560 volumes and 30 pamphlets;
Dental Library, 63 volumes'; and the Homoeopathic Library,
227 volumes and 20 pamphlets.
The number of periodicals regularly received was I,070.
Of these 780 came to the General Library; 20 to the Law
Library; 220 to the Medical Library; I6 to the Dental
Library, and 34 to the Homceopathic Library.
Your appropriation for the purchase of books for the
year, including subscriptions to periodicals and the mainten*One thousand, seven hundred and fifty-one (1,751) volumes,
produced by binding the 5,000 pamphlets of the Parsons Library,
are included in the above number. It is at the same time exclusive
of the lost and worn out books of the year, and of the collection
of duplicates for reference work, numbering 1,456 volumes. The
rearrangement of the maps has not yet progressed far enough to
make an accurate report of them possible.

ance of the bindery, was $I5,000.00. This sum you divided
among the several libraries as follows:
General Library................$......,000 oo
Law   Library..........................................  2,475 00
M edical  Library......................................  2,025  oo
Dental Library................                      250 oo
Homeeopathic  Library..................................  250  oo
Total............................................. $I5,000  oo
THE GENERAL IIBRARY.
REPAIRS AND IMPROVEEENTS. The wooden floors of the
Reading Room, the halls, and the offices, which had become
loose and decayed, were replaced at the close of the summer
school by a Venetian Mosaic floor. This in the matter of
appearance is very satisfactory, and it has proved less noisy
to the tread than had been anticipated. For some reason,
however, it has not worn well and in places has cracked badly.
It is hoped that these faults may be remedied in a large
degree by repairs to be made during the summer.
At the same time the old desks and fixed chairs of the
Reading Room were replaced by tables and movable chairs.
This change brought the seating capacity up from 210 to 300.
An additional toilet room was secured on the east side
by a rearrangement of the space occupied by the cloak and
toilet rooms used by the ladies. The East Room, which
had been devoted to a number of uses, such as the shelving
of bound volumes of newspapers and the Patent Office
Reports, the storing of duplicate matter, etc., was, the larger
part of it, given up to the Faculty as a reading room. The
other part, about one-quarter of the whole, was retained as
a convenient place for keeping the most used of the bound
newspapers, and for a work room for the reception of periodicals and their preparation for use. The small room on the
west side of the delivery desk, known as the Dictionary
Room, was removed, its value as a separate room not justifying its existence. The space thus gained will enable us to
extend the public catalogue of authors, something of which
we already feel the need.




OCTOBER MEETING, i903.


245


Changes were made in the desk at which books are delivered and to which they have been returned, by which it was
divided into two parts somewhat removed from each otherone for the delivery of books and one to which they were to
be returned. Of all the changes made, however, that which
has given the most satisfaction is the introduction of the
new system of ventilation for the Reading Room, the offices
and the Seminary Rooms.     Heretofore there has been no
ventilation at all except such as could be secured by raising
windows. The experience of the year has proved all of the
changes to be decided improvements.
ADDITIONS.-Of the 6,66o volumes and 1,750 pamphlets
added to the General Library, 4,196 volumes were purchased,
1,943 volumes and 1,750 pamphlets were gifts and 521 volumes were the result of binding periodicals.
EXPENDITURES.-The bills certified to by me for this
library, exclusive of those incurred for the bindery and those
drawn on the endowment funds, and the contingent fund,
amounted to $7,411.55. Of this sum     $5,857.94 was for
books and periodical publications issued irregularly, and
$I,553.61 was for annual subscriptions to periodicals for the
year I903.
For miscellaneous expenses for the year you assigned to
the Library the sum of $702.75.
The expenditures were as follows:
Day  attendant  in  Cloak  Room.......................... 7  50
Evening attendant in Cloak Room......................... 65 oo
One Smith  Premier Typewriter............................  go  oo
One  Densmore  Typewriter................................  77 75
Stationery and postage...................................  24 58
Sundries, as catalogue cards, readers' slips, etc........... 95 28
*Total..................................$7. Ii 


*This sum is described above as money used entirely for the
General Library. It should be said that it was drawn upon also for
the miscellaneous expenses of the Medical, Dental, and Homceopathic Libraries.




246


OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


This account was therefore overdrawn $7.36.
The expenditures from the endowment funds were as
follows:
Expended of the income of the Ford-Messer Fund......$1,276 32
Expended of the income of the Coyl Fund................ 326 89
The income of the Goethe Fund was untouched. As
explained in my last report, none of the income of this fund
will be used until by contributions and added interest it shall
amount to $300.00.
According to the Treasurer's books the condition of the
three above funds July I, I903, was as follows:
Ford-Messer Fund ($20,000), with unexpended interest
added............................................$22,834  15
Coyl Fund ($o0,000), with unexpended interest added... 12,085 63
Goethe  Fund.........................................  212  33
There have been, and still are, in the hands of the
Treasurer certain sums of money given by friends of the
University for the purchase of books and material for the
library. I have not reported these sums as funds, inasmuch
as they have been, or are to be, expended entirely. It has
seemed better to report the purchases made with the money
as gifts from those supplying it.
THE SHAKESPEARE AND GOETHE COLLECTIONS.-The
death of Senator James McMillan, to whose generosity the
University owes the greater part of the Shakespeare collection, was an event of a grievous nature. Inexpensive books
were purchased for it from the library funds. When, however, anything of a costly nature that we desired came to sale,
or a number of small things, making a large aggregate,
Senator McMillan was appealed to, and never, to my knowledge, in vain.  This resource and the industry of Professor
Demmon in the examination of sale catalogues of books and
of current bibliography, have made the University the possessor of the most extensive collection of Shakespeare literature in the West, if not in the whole country. It is a cause
of great gratification that Mr. W. C. McMillan has begun
to follow in the footsteps of his father in this matter.




OCIOBER HMEETING, 1903.


247


The additions of the year to this collection were I8I volumes. It now numbers 5,263 volumes.
The additions to the Goethe library were 13 volumes.
The cost of these was borne by the regular appropriation for
German literature. The collection now numbers I,037 volumes.
IMPORTANT PURCHASES.-It is the case, as stated in my
last report, that the greater number of our important purchases are made from    the income of the Ford-Messer and
Coyl funds. There has come to be such a minute division
of the regular library appropriation into portions to be used
in the purchase of special books that the purchase of any
costly set from it is impossible, unless there is a combination
of departments for the purpose, and that is something that
rarely occurs.
The more important purchases for the year have been as
follows:
Bought with the income of the Ford-Messer Fund:
I. Roman Academy (R. Accademia 'dei Lincei) complete
set of publications................................. $75 62
2. Turin Academy (R. Accademia delle scienze de Turino)
complete set of publications......................... 719 65
3. Journal of Society of Arts, Iondon, 50 volumes......... 200 oo
4. American Museum of Natural History, complete set of
publications.................................. 0.....  I04  25
5. Anglo Saxon Review, Io volumes...................... 25 oo
6. Babylonian Talmud (Trans. into English) vols. i-i6... 30 00
Bought with the income of the Coyl Fund:
7. Acta Sanctorum, 65 vols.............................  480 oo
8. Selden Society Publications, I5 vols.................... 70 87

small extent those received were from persons, or associations, whose names have already appeared in these reports as
benefactors of the Library. It is proper that I should enumerate a few of the more important of these gifts.
The Macmillan Co., publishers of New York, gave at the
suggestion of Professor Scott, 330 volumes of their publications which they valued at $260.00.
Mr. W. C. McMillan, of Detroit, son of Senator McMillan, as a result of a communication from Professor Demmon,
sent a check for $1oo0oo to be used in making additions to
the McMillan Shakespeare Library.
Continuing his benefactions, the Duke of Loubat sent the
following:
I. Codlex Vaticanus No. 3773. fine altmexikanische Bilderschrift Vatekanische Bibliothek. Ed. Eduard Seler, 2 parts.
2. Congres International des Americanistes XIIe Session.
3. Gesammelte Abhandlungen zur Amerikanischen Sprach-und
Alterthumskunde. Von Eduard Seler. Bd. I.
Certain publications of the French government have continued to come.  Of these there were received during the
year the following:
I. Collection de Documents inedits sur Flhistoire de France, 2
v oi0.
2. Inventaire general des richesses d' Art de la France, 3 vols.
A copy of the Journal fur Gasbeleuchtung was generously
contributed by the Michigan Gas Association. Vols. I-43,
with two volumes of Indexes, were bought at a cost of $93.50.
It has since been taken at the expense of the Association at
an annual subscription of $5.37.
From the Institution of Civil Engineers (London) we
received vols. 146, I47, 148, I49, I50 and 151, 6 vols. of
Proceedings. This is supplied regularly by the Institution.
Continuing  his gifts Mr. William     Viennot, of the
National Library of France, sent the following:
I. Vols. 10, II, T2 and 13 of Catalogue general des livres
imprimes de la bibliotheque nationale. Auteurs.
2. Three (3) volumes relating to Dante.
3. Bibliographie des Travaux de M. Leopold Delisle.
4. Photograph of Deslile.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


249


Twenty-six (26) pamphlets on legal and historical subjects were received from their author, Dr. Vladimir Pappafava, Advocate, of Zara, Austria.
Dr. H. S. Jewett of the class of '68, who gave us 19
volumes last year, this year gave 29 volumes of miscellaneous
books.
Col. Cornelius Cadle, Recording Secretary of the Society
of the Army of the Tennessee, gave a set of the Reports of
the Society from the beginning, except the 28th, in 15 volumes. This is a very valuable addition to our Americana.
Thomas W. Lawson, Esq., gave a copy of "The Lawson
History of the America's Cup." This is a beautifully illustrated volume.
Mr. H. M. Utley, Librarian of the Detroit Public Library,
sent to the library on behalf of the compiler, Jas. Taylor
Aulls, a volume entitled "Catalogues and Addresses," University of Michigan. Mr. Aulls, of the class of '6I, inscribes
this to the University of Michigan for the class of '6I. The
volume was loaned to Mr. Utley for use in preparing the
history of this class.  It contains besides catalogues and
addresses, programmes of various kinds, class songs, Palladiums, etc.
There was received from Mrs. Washington A. Roebling
of Trenton, N. J., a copy of a book entitled "The Journal of
the Reverend Silas Constant," Pastor of the Presbyterian
Church at Yorktown, N. Y., with some of the Records of the
Church and a list of his marriages, 1784-1825; together
with notes on the Nelson, Van Cortlandt, Warren, and some
other families mentioned in the Journal. By Emily Warren
Roebling. This copy was No. I54 of an edition of 300. It
is a book having a considerable historical importance.
Rev. John D. Parker of the class of '59 contributed a copy
of the second edition of his work entitled "The Sabbath
Transferred."
James E. Scripps, Esq., publisher of the Evening Neuws
(Detroit), has continued to supply us with a copy of that
paper for preservation.
Professor Mechem, before his departure for Chicago, presented to the Library 50 volumes of miscellaneous books and




250


OCTOBER MEETING, Q903.


a large number of pamphlets and odd numbers of periodicals.
Some of these were duplicates, but there were many things
that proved to be valuable additions.
Mr. V. E. Francois, formerly an instructor in the University, gave 15 volumes consisting of works on literary
history, and classical texts.
Forty-eight (48) volumes of new books of a miscellaneous character were presented by Professor A. C. McLaughlin.
President Angell, who has every year contributed generously to our resources, has this year put us under greater
obligations than on any former occasion.
Gifts have also been received from Professors Demmon,
Hempl, Kelsey, Greene, Adams, Stanley and Ziwet; also
from Dr. Cross, Mr. Severance, Mr. Hollands and many
others.
There have also been the usual documents from the
National, State and city governments, and from many societies and business associations whose publications are found
useful in the work of the University.
I desire at this point to supply an omission from the
report of last year. In that report the gift of a copy of
Konrad Gessner's Thierbuch and Tischbuchl, from  Miss
Sarah Dorsey Parsons, of Marshall, Mich., appears as
from Miss Sarah Dorsey. I regret very much the occurrence of this omission.
USE OF THE LIBRARY.-During the College year the
Library is open continuously I4'2 hours daily-that is, from
7:45 A. M. until Io P,. M. The only holidays are Thanksgiving day, Christmas and New Years, and in the summer
the Fourth of July. From Commencement Day until the
close of the Summer School it is open from 8 A. M. until 5
P. M., and from the close of the Summer School until work
is resumed in the autumn, from 9 A. M. to 12 M., and from
2 to 5 P. M.
The following statistics are drawn from the report of
Mr. Finney, the assistant in charge of circulation:




OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


251


Recorded circulation in Reading Room and Seminary
Rooms....................................... I57,37I vols.
Drawn for home use by Professors................... 11,232 vols.
168,603 vols.
This is but a slight increase over the recorded circulation
of last year. That the increase was not greater is due to the
interruption of reading in the Reading Room while the new
floor was going down.
It is desirable to state here, as I have done in former
reports, that this recorded use is only about one-half of the
whole use of the Library.
The inter-library loans amounted to 55 volumes and 30
photographs. The daily average of readers in the Reading
Room was I80. The highest number reported by Mr. Finney
as present in the room at one time was 275. This is 65 more
than the seating capacity of the room heretofore and lacks
only 25 of exhausting the new seating.
Under the rule admitting advanced students to the book
room for a period of two months, 75 were admitted. As the
number to be admitted at one time is I5, this was the full
number entitled to the privilege for the year. Numerous
temporary admissions were granted.
During the two semesters, 350 students were admitted
to the Seminary Rooms, as follows: IIo to the East Room
for the study of History, Political Economy, Pedagogy,
Philosophy, and Mathematics; 240 to the West Room for
the study of Language, Literature, and Art.
CONDITION OF THE LIBRARY.-Attention was given, as
usual, to the condition of individual books and to the collection as a whole. To keep the Library in good condition as
to the accessibility of books, grows more difficult each year
on account of lack of room. It is always difficult to preserve
the classification of a library in which there are already many
books and to which the annual additions are numerous. Not
to preserve the classification is to handicap readers in their
use of the books. We shall continue to do the best we can
under the circumstances, and trust you will find it possible
to increase our facilities in the near future.




252


OCTOBER MEETING, i903.


Mr. Finney -reports a larger number of books missing at
the end of the year than has been reported for any previous
year-44 volumes. Experience teaches us that some of these
will be found.  Of the 21 volumes reported missing last
year four (4) have been found. A book misplaced is practically a book lost, and as a large number of persons have
access to the shelves, misplacements cannot be avoided. Mr.
Finney reports two examinations of the shelves during the
year, resulting in the discovery of I,029 volumes out of place.
Fourteen volumes, chiefly reference books, have been
entirely worn out and have been retired from use.
Mr. Severance, the general assistant, made his second
annual inspection of the outlying libraries. The condition of
some of these remains unsatisfactory. If, after efforts that
we are now making, conditions are not improved it shall be
for you to consider whether the existence of these particular
collections of which no care is taken shall not be ended.
THE WORK OF THE YEAR.-We entered upon the year
with the intention-and the expectation, also-of accomplishing three important pieces of work in addition to the
routine work of the Library. These were:
I. The improvement of the official catalogue.
2. An improved arrangement of the current numbers of
periodicals.
3. An arrangement of the maps.
The first two were in a great degree accomplished. The
third, the arrangement of the maps, was not accomplished.
By correspondence with libraries that have large map collections we learned of the methods of caring for these in
vogue in each of them, and were able to devise a satisfactory
scheme for recording and cataloging our own. Preparations
for carrying out the scheme were made by printing the necessary headings on sheets and binding them. We were, however, unable to begin the work as the necessary drawers were
not made by the carpenter.
We were, however, able to accomplish a piece of work
that we had not planned to do. This was the reclassification
and recataloging of the Parsons Library and the making of




OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


253


some changes in its status. This collection was received in
i869, and was reported by Professor Ten Brook, who was
then librarian, to consist of 4,325 volumes and 5,o00 pamphlets. The volumes were almost entirely in paper covers. At
Professor Ten Brook's request some of these volumes were
bound at Mr. Parsons' expense, but for reasons with which
I am not acquainted this was not carried far. I thought it
desirable on many accounts to bind all of the remainder that
promised to be of service, and in all ways to make the use
of the collection as convenient as possible. Following the
example already set in dealing with pamphlets in general,
such as were of sufficient importance were bound singly and
the remainder were classified and bound in volumes. As this
library now stands it consists of 6,076 volumes and no
pam',iphlets.
Some of the matter was of such a nature that Professor
Ten Brook was unable to determine whether it was really a
part of the collection or waste matter put in the boxes to
improve the packing. To be on the safe side he preserved it
all. This doubtful matter we classified roughly and tied up
in bundles, placing it where it can be examined by any one
who cares to do so.
This Awork on the Parsons library was almost entirely
performed by Mr. Severance, assisted by Miss Lane. There
was much in the nature of the matter to perplex and much
in its condition that made the handling of it unpleasant. I
wish to commend their performance of the work.
THEI-  LIBRARY FORCE FOR 1903-'04.-The office force
remains the same as last year. MIr. J. F. Halliday has charge
of the East Seminary Room and M\r. G. L. Wait of the West.
Appointees to the Return Desk are G. WV. Barnum, W. D.
Moriarty and T. E. AVagner. These serve five hours daily,
each. The Delivery Desk attendants are twelve in number,
each one serving two and one-half hours daily. Formerly
each attendant at this desk served five hours daily.  So
decided a preference has been shown for the shorter service,
however, and so well has it worked that we have adopted it.
The total amount paid for the service is not changed. The




254


OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


names of the twelve are as follows: H. E. Olson, C. E.
Parry, V. L. Minor, J. H. McCandless, H. K. Stone, G. F.
Blanchard, F. D. Koelbel, B. H. De Priest, I. W. Long, E.
J. Creighton, H. P. Farnham, L. F. Cleveland.
THE WORK FOR I903-'04.-There remains the work on
the maps to which reference has been made. This will be
taken up as soon as the necessary drawers are made. Beyond
this nothing is planned except what might be called the general improvement of the Library.
THE NEEDS OF THE LIBRARY.-In my report last year I
called attention to the new courses of instruction established
by you in recent years as they affect the Library. I specified
the five new courses which had been established within three
years, viz.: Administrative Law, Naval Architecture, Higher
Commercial Education, Forestry, and Insurance.  I referred
to the fact that the Library contained but little on these subjects and that there was an immediate demand oh the part of
the instructors for books and periodicals. In the last year
a new department, Chemical Engineering, has been created,
and Rhetoric has been detached from the department of
English and made a separate Chair. According to the policy
of the Library Committee in regard to the distribution of
the Library funds, appropriations for special books have, in
compliance with requests from Professors Scott and Campbell, been made for these two departments.  It has been
necessary to provide for all of these special needs from a
reserve regularly kept for bibliographical books, and books
of general interest, and for securing at advantageous prices
at the auction sales and from antiquarian book catalogues,
rare and out of print books. These drafts upon this reserve
for general purposes have so depleted it that little remains.
If the appropriation made by you for the purchase of
books cannot be increased I think it would be wise.when
instruction in a new subject is authorized, to couple with the
authorization a sum of money sufficient to start it in books
and periodicals. The instructor should be able to tell what
sum would be necessary for the purpose.




OCTOBER AJEETIAG, 90o3.


255


I am constrained to speak again of the great desirabilityperhaps 1 ought to say necessity-of more room for the
storage of books, and for connecting more intimately the
Library and the work of instruction. In visiting one large,
new public library (Providence, R. I.) this summer and in
reading of others just completed, or in process of.erection,
I have been impressed by the revolution that has taken place
in libraries of this character.  They have connected the
library and the elementary schools in such a manner that the
children in the lower grades have greater facilities for the
seminary methods of instruction than do our graduate students.
I have not in any report failed, I think, to represent the
importance of the Library in the work of the University.
You may have regarded this as simply perfunctory, or as a
somewhat natural attempt on my part to magnify the importance of the work with which I am connected. This has not
been so in the past, and it is less likely to be so now that the
time approaches when I must lay down the work, and when
I perfectly understand that there cannot come to me either
credit or emolument for any library expansion that the
future may hold.
DUPLICATES FOR CLASS USE.-You will recall that at your
October meeting you voted $200.00 to each of the following
departments for the purchase of duplicates to be used in the
instruction-to the departments of General History, American History, and Political Economy. There were already
in use a number of duplicates of historical books which had
been purchased with money contributed by the classes needing the books. All of these books-those bought with student
contributions and those bought with money specifically appropriated by you, number 1,495 volumes. They are handled
as other books of the Library are, but they are entered upon
a separate accession book and it is understood that they are
to serve as nuclei of departmental libraries whenever the
departments have the necessary accommodation for them.




256


OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


THE OTHER LIBRARIES.
THE MEDICAL LIBRARY. The additions to the Medical
Library were 560 volumes and 30 pamphlets. Of these 285
volumes were purchased, 52 volumes and 30 pamphlets were
presented, and 223 volumes were the result of binding periodicals.
The total of bills certified to by me for this library was
$1,364.9I. Of this sum $880.06 were for books and irregular
periodical publications and $484.85 was for subscriptions to
periodicals for I903.*
Gifts were received from Doctors Vaughan and Dock
and others. From Dr. Abraham Jacobi, of New York, was
received a copy of the third edition (1903) of his "The
Therapeutics of Infancy and Childhood."
Of the $I30.96, balance remaining of the appropriation of
$1,000.00 from the Bates Professorship Fund, made June,
I901, $1OI.86 fell due and was paid.
THE LAW LIBRARY.-I quote as follows from the report
of Professor V. H. Lane, Law Librarian:
"The total number of volumes accessioned and unaccessioned is 20,I70, and of this number 17,843 are in daily use
by the students.
"All books, with the exception of texts and encyclopedias,
are on open shelving easily accessible to those desiring them.
The texts and encyclopedias are drawn from the delivery
desk which is in charge of an assistant who gives all necessary
aid to those using the library. The card catalogue which
was commenced one year ago last May is being steadily
enlarged and will in time greatly increase the working facilities of the library.
"Two assistants, Miss Gertrude Elstner Woodard and
Mr. Clarence N. Boord, have immediate charge of the library,
working under the direction of the Librarian.


*Of the above sum of $1,364.9I a part, $98.26, was loaned from
the appropriation for the Dental Library.  The students of the
Dental College have frequent occasion to make use of the books
of the Medical Library.




OCTOBER MEETING, z903.


257


"During the summer the walls of the library, consultation and faculty reading rooms, have been painted, decidedly
improving their appearance.
"There have been recently presented to the library several
etchings of prominent jurists and lawyers, five by the law
class of 1898, five by the Honorable James B. Dill, of New
York, and one by Mr. W. H. Bond, of the class of I90o. The
class of I903 presented to the library a portrait in oil of Professor Bogle, by Percy Ives.
"While we shall be able to get through the coming year
without any substantial additions to the shelf room, it seems
quite apparent that additional accommodations will be needed
in the near future."
THE DENTAL LIBRARY.-The additions to this library
were 63 volumes, of which 41 volumes were bought, two
were presented and 20 the result of binding periodicals. The
bills certified to by me for Dental literature purely amounted
to $84.39. There was in addition to this a draft upon the
Dental appropriation of $98.26 for medical literature, as
already reported.
A gift of great interest and value to the University was
received from Dr. Walter H. Jackson of Ann Arbor, a student
and an instructor in the Dental College i'n its beginning. The
gift was "A Compilation of Historical Data, referring to
the Dental Department of the University of Michigan from
the earliest conception of a desire to have said department
established.  Together with such oral handings down as
seem to have foundation in truth, down to reports of June,
1902, inclusive. By Walter H. Jackson, D. D. S."
THE HOMOEOPATHIC LIBRARY.-The additions to this
library were 227 volumes and 20 pamphlets. Of these 198
volumes were bought, 22 volumes and 20 pamphlets were
presented and 7 volumes were the result of binding periodicals.
The total of bills certified to by me was $176.75. Of this
$170.75 was for books, and $6.oo for periodicals for the
year I903.

was $2,745.09.
The expenditure for labor was........................$2,304 IO
The  expenditure  for  materials  was......................  440  99

As heretofore I append tables showing the nature of the
work done, the cost of it at the ruling prices for such work,
and its distribution by departments. What I have called
the ruling prices are the average prices for' different materials, paid on contract by twenty colleges and public libraries
in different parts of the country. The prices paid at these
libraries were ascertained by correspondence with them.

260           OCTOBER MEETING,           90o3.
By reference to the first table it will be seen that the cost
of the work at prices charged generally by binderies, was
$3,299.47. Comparing this with the cost of labor and materials for the year, which was $2,745.09, there appears a balance
in favor of the bindery of $554.38. To this should be added
$29.58 for waste gold recovered, making a total in favor of
the library of $583.96.
Hitherto in estimating the cost of the work at outside
binderies the figures were based on prices ruling in 1896,
when the bindery was established. If the advance of these
from year to year had been ascertained and taken into consideration the balances for recent years would have been
greater than reported.
On the basis of the percentages shown in the second table
the expense to be borne by each of the libraries is as follows:
General Library............................$2,6 3
Medical Library....................................  292 35
Law Library......................................   289 88
Dental Library.......................................  8 67
Homceopathic Library...............................  37 88
T otal............................................$2,745  09
The following is a list of the persons now employed in the
bindery, exclusive of Mr. Hollands:
George  Dengler................................  $700  per  year
Lydia Schleyer................................ $28 oo per month
George Roth........................ $20 00 per month
Frances Pattison................................  50c per day
The pay of these is charged to the book appropriation of
$ 5.000o00.
Mr. Hollands, in charge of the bindery, whose pay has
hitherto been drawn from that source, is now paid from the
current expense fund. The establishment of a printing press
in connection with the bindery, of which press he also has
charge, altered the conditions existing before as far as he
was concerned. Very justly there was at the same time an
increase of his salary.




OCTOBER MEETIVNG, 1903.


261


The single addition to the equipment of the bindery was
a sewing machine at a cost of $I40.00.
In concluding my report I wish to renew the recommendation made in my annual budget last spring for an
increase of pay for the three chief assistants in the library.
Mr. Jordan, Mr. Finney and Mr. Severance. It was not
found possible to make such an increase when the budget
was before you, but conditions change. I should much regret
if through fault of mine these men were overlooked in any
new consideration of salaries.
Very respectfully submitted,
RAYMOND C. DAVIS,
Librarian.
Oct. 14, 1903.
THE PRINTING PLANT.
To the Librarian:
DEAR SIR:-The following report of the Printing Plant
in the General Library, established in January, I903, under
your direction, is submitted for the period ending June 30,
1903:
Of your appropriation of $940.0o for plant, $938.91 has
been expended. The equipment consists of a 13xI9 Universal press with a one-half horse power Browning motor, 3I
fonts of type in two cabinets of 41 cases, proof.press, imposing stone, perforator, wire stitcher, lead and rule cutter, stock
cases, etc.
The equipment is adequate for nearly all the small work
of the University, but six months experience has shown
that an occasional order is received requiring a greater quantity of some special sorts than has been purchased for the
plant.
Of the $200.00 appropriated for stock $198.66 has been
expended and the stock will nearly always approximate this
amount.
As the basis for charging work to the several departments,
60% of the price list compiled by D. Ramaley, and used by
the Typothetae, is used. This list is made on a 33/3%  profit
basis, and the 40%  discount was deemed a fair reduction
for comparative uses.




262


OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


The plant has filled i8I orders, which at the above named
charging prices amount to $696.66.
During the same period $246.22 have been paid for
wages, and $I50.67 for stock, exclusive of the $200.00 appropriated by you for that purpose. Nearly the whole amount
of wages has been paid to three students, two in the Law
Department and one in the Literary. For the coming year
five students will be employed, an average of 12 hours per
week each, on a time schedule which allows one man at
nearly all hours in the office. Two of these are from the
Law, two from the Literary, and one from the Engineering
Department.
In addition there are registered two Law, one Dental and
one Mledical student, who can be called upon for special
occasions.
The efficiency of the plant could be increased by a small
outlay from time to time as work calling for special additional
equipment is encountered, the expense of such special sorts
to be charged to the order requiring it.
Very respectfully,
W. C. HOLLANDS.

To the President and Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLLEMENS-I have the honor to present herewith my report
upon the work of the tenth annual Summer Session of the University.
The session opened in the Department of Literature, Science, and
the Arts on July I and closed August 14. In the Department of Law
work began June 22 and ended August 14. In the Department of
Medicine and Surgery the session extended from June 22 to August 7,
while in the Department of Engineering the required work for the
summer extended from June 22 to July 31.




OCTOBER MEETING, I903.                     265
The enrollment in the various departments was as follows:
Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts............... 382
Departm ent  of  Law...........................................  74
Department of Medicine and Surgery........................ 68
Department of Engineering................................... I07
Total  enrollment........................................  63 
Of the 382 students enrolled in the Department of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, the distribution by states is as follows:
Michigan, 213; Ohio, 36; Indiana, 29; Illinois, 24; New York,
I6; Pennsylvania, 13; Iowa, 7;. Missouri, 6; Kansas, 5; Minnesota, 4;
Maine, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Montana, California, Georgia, Kentucky, Washington, South Dakota, District of Columbia, and Ontario
each 2, and one each from Nebraska, Utah, Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, Japan and the Philippine Islands.
Of the enrollment in this department 230 were new names and
152 were those of persons already enrolled in some department of
the University. Of the 230 new students, those actually engaged in
teaching numbered I79. The enrollment of teachers thus formed
43.2% of the total enrollment in the department, or 77.8% of those
in attendance in the University for the first time. Of those already
enrolled in the University, 102 were members of the Literary Department, 35 belonged in Engineering, 8 in Medicine, 6 in Law, and one
in Pharmacy. There were also in attendance two students from
Purdue, two from Cornell, and one from Vassar College.
Of the total enrollment in this department, I42, or 37.2%, were
graduates of Normal Schools, Colleges or Universities. Of these
40 were from this University, 34 from the Michigan State Normal
College, 7 from Albion, 6 from Olivet, 6 from the Indiana State
Normal, and the remaining 49 from institutions in various parts of
the United States.
In the Announcement of work in this department for the Summer
Session of 1903 there were offered o09 courses in 24 different branches,

OCTOBER MEETING, I903.                      267
An interesting feature of the Summer Session was the series of
open lectures by members of the University Faculty. The series this
year comprised lectures by President Angell, Professors Carhart,
Adams, Stanley, and Assistant Professors Cooley and VanTyne.
The attendance was most generous, and the interest and enthusiasm
of the student body was gratifying in the extreme. It is certainly
very desirable that those in attendance upon the Summer Session,
of whom so large a percentage are teachers, should have liberal
opportunity to hear and to meet prominent members of all the
University Faculties. In no way can the University influence be
more properly or effectively diffused among the people and schools
of Michigan and the surrounding States.
The work in the various classes during the Summer Session
is characterized by earnestness and zealous application, the large
proportion of the student body who either have been or are now
actively engaged in teaching renders the interest in the subjects
pursued more vital and real than that usually manifested in the
same subjects during the college year. It is the testimony of practically all the Professors engaged in Summer work that the class
of students found in the University during the Summer Session
leaves nothing to be desired on the score of interest and willingness
to work. While lack of sufficient preparation is notable in some
cases, yet in very few cases has insufficient preparation been found
accompanied by an indisposition to serious and strenuous effort.
The University offers great advantages to persons of limited opportunities in allowing them to enter the classes freely and derive
therefrom all the inspiration and benefit which they are capable
of receiving. In no way can the University more effectually gain
and retain a firm hold upon the schools of Michigan and of the
Middle West than by guarding and promoting the relations of
mutual helpfulness and mutual interest established during the Summer Session. Teachers from small or remote High Schools, with
vague ideas of the needs or the functions of a properly organized
secondary school and with insufficient preparation or with no preparation for the work they have been attempting to do, are awakened
and inspired to attempt things undreamed of before. No branch of
activity of this department reaches so far or takes hold so firmly
upon the schools and the people of the State as does the work of the
Summer Session. It bears something of the same relation to the
work of the Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts, that
the University Hospital does to that of the Department of Medicine
and Surgery. It makes friends for the University, except in cases
of educational mal-practice, in every corner of the State, and transforms the lukewarm or indifferent school into an enthusiastic feeder
of the University.




268


OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


The system of University inspection in maintenance of the
diploma relation is a very efficient means of promoting and maintaining the best relations between the schools and the University,
as it leads to better acquaintance and better understanding.  But
the work of the Summer Session goes farther. It begins where the
other leaves off. The inspector, be he ever so observant, can see
little beyond the surface indications as to the efficiency and workings of the school, although that is usually considerable, and be he
ever so eloquent he can only speak for the University while he
stands before the school. The teacher, however, who has become
acquainted with the workings of the University through attendance
upon the Summer Session, and has become imbued with the aims
and methods of University men, goes back to that school to stay,
and to talk University of Michigan during the entire year, to an
audience that is both familiar and easily influenced. If there were
no other reason for its existence, the Summer Session is worth
three times what it costs simply as a means of advertising the
University and of strengthening its hold upon the good will of the
people of the State.
Another feature of the work of the Summer Session that. is
deserving of attention is that of graduate study. In this respect
the showing of the University during the year is by no means as
strong as it should be. During the past collegiate year there were
enrolled 97 persons classified as graduates, and in June, 1902, there
were conferred 53 higher degrees-42 M.A., I Sc.D., and io Ph.D.
During the Summer Session there were 14 graduate students actu-.
ally doing work toward the Master's or Doctor's degree. During
the past Summer Session there were more bona fide graduate
students working for the Master's or Doctor's degree, in the Department of Physics, than were enrolled in the same department during
the collegiate year of I902-1903. It seems reasonably clear that one
of the best ways to build up graduate work in the University is
to offer better facilities and more encouragement to persons competent to undertake graduate work in the Summer Session. The
State has many teachers of collegiate or University training, who
are anxious to go further in their special lines of work, and who
would more of them enroll for higher degrees if suitable courses
were offered and proper provision were made for assigning and
arranging their work.
Many of us know that with the majority of men, post-graduate
study, like collegiate study itself, is largely a matter of getting
started; once the decision is made and the work begun, the rest
is easier. Whatever any one may think of the possibility of doing
graduate work during the summer, two facts are well assured;




OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


269


first, that graduate work has been done, and is being done during
the summer, and second, that those departments that are really
anxious to have graduate work done, will find students in the Summer Session ready and competent to begin such work.
In the hope of gaining additional information upon important
phases of summer work in American Colleges and Universities,
it has been my pleasant task to collect a consderable body of
statistics pertaining to the work in the leading institutions in this
country. To this end, a circular letter containing numerous questions regarding the organization, attendance and management of
summer work, was sent to some thirty-five of the leading colleges
and universities of the United States. The results of these inquiries
are embodied in a table herewith submitted. (Omitted in printing.)
A glance at the table shows the following significant facts:
I. The majority of the Summer Sessions represented on the
table have been organized since 1890.
2. During the past summer there were over I2,ooo   students
engaged in summer work in the United States.
3. Professional schools are to be found in a large majority of
the institutions giving summer work.
4. The Universities Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, University of
California, have about one-fourth to one-fifth of their total enrollment in the Summer Session. In the case of Missouri and Chicago,
it is approximately one-half.
5. The larger Summer Sessions with the exception of Chicago,
which has special trains, all enjoy the advantages of reduced rates
from the railroads.
6. The acccepted length of term seems to be six weeks. Even
where two terms are attempted, the six-week term is made the unit.
With the knowledge and approval of the President, I have the
honor to submit the following suggestions for the betterment of the
Summer Session:
SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTERMENT OF SUMMER SESSION.
I. Establishment of some modus vivendi with the Departments
of Law, Medicine and Surgery, and of Engineering, so that there
may be some degree of uniformity in regard to date of opening,
tuition fees for students taking work in two departments, registration, etc.
2. That strenuous effort be made to secure for students of the
Summer Session the same concessions from the railroads as are
granted to the students of Harvard, Columbia, Cornell and the
University of Colifornia.




270


OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


3. Establishment of a Biological Station at some suitable station
on the lakes of Michigan, for the study of Botany and Zoology and
for accommodation of persons desiring to do advanced work in
those lines.
4. Establishment of Courses in Library Training, in connection
with the University Library; the same to form part of the work
of the Summer Session.
5. Establishment of one or more Courses in Pharmacy, in the
Sum1mer Session.
6. That a more liberal policy be adopted as regards the printing
and distribution of the Announcements for the Summer Session
work, including the preparation of appropriate views of Ann Arbor,
lists of students, etc.
7. That the question of an advance in the salaries of men doing
work in the Summer Session be carefully considered, and if possible that some plan be adopted whereby those giving instruction in
Summer Session may be given the option between a salary for such
work and vacation during the regular semesters.
Respectfully submitted,
JOHN 0. REED,
Chairman Summer Session.
On motion of Regent Barbour, the President was requested-to appoint a committee consisting of two members
of the Board and one member from       each of the Faculties
directly interested in the work of the Summer Session, which
committee shall consider all questions relating to said school,
with the view of devising some plan of building up and
enlarging the work, and report their conclusion to the Board.
On motion of Regent Butterfield, the reports of the Treasurer and of the Auditor were referred to the Finance Committee for consideration, and with power to print.       The
report of the Treasurer is as follows:

give half his time to the work, at three hundred dollars each. I
may state that Dr. Bowen's salary was $900.00. This, therefore,
does not necessitate any increased expenditure.  At present Dr.
Lombard is prepared to recommend Fred M. Abbott as one of these
assistants, and I respectfully ask his appointment.
7. Dr. William  H. Morley has resigned his service on the
Gynecological staff, and Dr. Peterson requests that Charles L. Patton, M.D., be advanced to First Assistant in Obstetrics and Diseases

vacated by Dr. Patton, and that Rolland L. Parmeter, M.D., be

changes do not necessitate nor ask for any increased expenditures.
All of which is respectfully submitted,

subject to their direction and control, it being understood, however, that the nurses in caring for patients shall in such duty be
subject to the instructions of the physician in charge. No pupil
nurse may be discharged except by action of the Hospital Committee.
The Superintendent shall see to and provide for all the housekeeping necessities of the,institution. But in all matters pertaining

them fully informed regarding its condition and-especially of particular' facts as' they'may arise.
In the purchasing' of supplies and the hiring of help and discharging employes the Superintendent shall consult with the Auditing Board of the University and shall not act without their consent,
'The Superintendent shall be a member of the Hospital Committee,.
which;Committee shall otherwise, consist of the heads of the se~eral clinics.. The Hospital Committee shall employ and control
the action and duties of the internes subject to the Regents. This.
Committee shall control the medical treatment of patients and the
attendance of students' at the lectures andat clinics and shall have
jurisdiction over any and ail matters, purely medical, pertaining

subsequent revision, if necessary, by the Hospital Committee. The
House Physician shall be chosen..by the Superintendent subject to
the approval of the Hospital Committee and preference shall be given
in this matter of making a selection to retiring internes; it being

cleanliness is secured; to see that wastefulness is eliminated and
due economy in the consumption of food and materials is adhered

OCTOBER MEETING, 1903.


to; and that the employes are all careful, respectful and duly attentive. to their work.
'rhe Superintendent is not expected to interfere in any matter
pertaining purely to the medical or surgical treatment of patients,
but this may not exclude him from noticing if there be any seeming
neglect of the treatment and care of patients and from calling the
attention of the head of the clinic to such neglect if he finds it
to occur.

Carey were appointed a committee to secure the services of a

OCTOBER MEETINVG, 1903.

to this object, and unless your honorable body shall deem it proper
to vote an appropriation for this purpose from the funds of the

of our friends, most of whom are alumni, to support this worthy
enterprise.
The funds contributed have come into my hands or been senon to the Treasurer of,the school. It might be more satisfactory
to all who are interested if hereafter these funds should pass

of the Board for his valuable gift.
DETROIT, MICH., Oct. 26, 1903.
Mr. James B. Angell, LL. D.,
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
DEAR SIR:-I am sending you by American Express an album of
photographs illustrating log handling in Michigan between the woods
and the saw mill. It is unnecessary to call attention to the fact that
Michigan owes much of her wealth to her timber. These photographs
will gain in interest as the years go by. Logging operations are
almost a thing of the past, in the Lower Peninsula, and it will be only
a few years before it will be impossible to gather together such a set
of pictures. Allow me to express the hope that the album may be
saved, as far as possible, for the future student of our lumbering
operations.             Yours truly,
J. D. HAWKS.
The President called the attention of the Board to the fact
that the plate for the Bachelor of Arts diploma had become so
worn by long use that it was desirable to have a new plate
made, and that the plate for the Bachelor of Laws diploma
needed retouching.

arranged with Dr. W. T. Reeves, of Chicago, and Dr. E. B. Spalding, of Detroit, eminent specialists in their lines, to give a course in
porcelain filling, crown and bridge work, during the first and second
weeks in February.
It is the desire of the Faculty to open this course to a limited
number of practitioners. As there are not now any special University
fees covering such cases, the Dental Faculty recommends that a fee
of twenty-five dollars be authorized, to be collected from practitioners
attending the course, the same to be used in defraying the expense
involved.
It is confidently expected that these fees will be sufficient to
cover all expenses, and at the same time this valuable instruction
will be secured to the two upper classes without expense to the University.
Respectfully,
N. S. Hors,

Supervisors of Washtenaw County, for the purpose of considering the advisability of joint action by the county and
the University in the erection and maintenance of a detention hospital for the treatment of the more serious contagious diseases, submitted the following report, which was
adopted by the Board, and the Secretary was directed to
transmit a copy of the same to the Board of Supervisors:
Your committee appointed to confer with a committee of the
Board of Supervisors of Washtenaw County, on the matter of the
establishment of a hospital for the treatment of the more serious
contagious diseases, such as smallpox, diphtheria and scarlet fever,
report as follows:
First: They find that the County Clerk has been ordered by the
Board of Supervisors to submit to the voters of the county at the
spring election the question of issuing $30,000 of bonds, and, with the
proceeds, building a hospital for the treatment of these contagious
diseases. It has been deemed desirable by the Supervisors to learn
upon what basis the University will undertake the care and management of such hospital, and Messrs. Miner and Damon, of the Board
of Supervisors, met with your committee at the office of the County
Clerk for that purpose.
Second: In order to learn what might fairly be asked of the
University in such connection, a joint inspection was made of the
accounts showing expenditures by the county in connection with
contagious diseases, from which it was learned that the annual
expense therefor is at the rate of from $I6,00o to $I8,ooo.




308


JANUARY MEETING, 1904.


It further appeared from a statement prepared by the County
Clerk, that as far as the bills were audited, the proportionate expenses were as follows:
Physicians................................. 6%
N urses.....................................  I7%
Provisions........................         %
Property destroyed......................... %
Drugs and disinfecting.................... 4%
Total..................................100%
Third: Your committee recommend that the University be
authorized to enter into a contract to furnish medical attendance,
light, heat and water for such hospital without cost to the county.
All other expenses connected therewith to be borne by the county.
The University further to supply nurses and medicines at cost, and
board at ordinary hospital rates. This would reduce the expense to
the county on account of contagious diseases at least one-half,
besides furnishing the most enlightened, effective and humane treatment to the patients. As to the University, it would furnish students an opportunity to study these deadly diseases with safety to
themselves (as the patients are viewed through glass partitions),
and with great ultimate benefit in learning to detect and treat these
diseases.
Under such an arrangement, the county should purchase a site
satisfactory to the Uhiversity authorities, and erect the hospital
thereon, under plans to be jointly agreed upon, and convey the property to the University, which on its part, should assume entire
control, under a proper contract, binding it in perpetuity.
It will be observed that it will cost the county only $I,200 per
year, being the interest on $30,000 at 4 per cent. per annum, to
furnish the University with a hospital building, while the University will expend about that sum in supplying light, heat and water,
besides the leading item of medical attendance. Further, there will
be a reduction to the county in the other items of exepnse, such
as nursing, medicines, etc., with an improvement in personnel of
attendance and quality of material.
Dr. Vaughan and Dr. Hinsdale, and Regent Dean were present
during a portion of the conference, and participated in it, and concur
with the committee.
Respectfully submitted,
HENRY W. CAREY,
CHARLES D. LAWTON,

Owosso, Mich., January 14, I904.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN:-The Michigan State Federation of Women's
Clubs desires to give at this time to the University of Michigan the
sum of three thousand dollars, which is only a part of the sum that
this Federation expects to give, to be used for the benefit of women
students in the University.
As President of the State Federation for the present year, it
becomes my pleasant duty to inform you relative to the history of
this "New Year's Gift," for as a Federation of Clubs is not a financial organization, a gift, even of this amount, has a history.
The prime object for which our organization exists, and upon
which its permanency depends, is "for the general advancement
of women." In view of this, and as citizens of Michigan, our members are proud to recall the fact that "for the advancement of
women" our State University was the first institution of its kind




FEBIUUARY MEETING, 1904.


321


to throw wide open its doors to women students. And thrice proud
is the membership of Michigan State Federation of the contribution
made to the intelligence and culture of our State and Nation
through the noble influence of the women graduated from its halls.
In the records of the acts of the Governing Board of the University, it is stated that the first woman upon whom the honorary
degree of Doctor of Philosophy was conferred never was graduated
either from a college or a university; but Lucinda Hinsdale Stone,
for she it was, was a woman who, when university doors were
closed against her sex, because endowed by nature with fine mind
and an indomitable purpose, attained so high an order of scholarship
that the University Board thought it wise and fitting to confer upon
her a degree.
Mrs. Stone's life work was to raise higher the standard of
educated womanhood, and in this memorial gift to our University,
the Michigan State Federation desires through that institution to
honor the memory of the revered founder of the Michigan State
Federation, and also to perpetuate her life work for the higher
education of women through the benefits that may accrue to women
students in the University of Michigan through this gift.
We ask, therefore, that you will accept the gift, first pledged
to the University at the eighth annual meeting of the State Federation, held in Muskegon, October, I902.
At this meeting Mrs. Goodenow, President of the Twentieth
Century Club, of Kalamazoo, Mrs. Stone's own club, was introduced
and outlined the plan of that club for establishing a memorial to
Lucinda Hinsdale Stone, and presented, in behalf of that club, a
nucleus of the sum of one hundred dollars ($Ioo.oo) for a Michigan
University Scholarship, trusting that the State Federation would
carry on the work in some way.
Miss Clara A. Avery, of Detroit, then stated the information
received from the Secretary of the University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor, and moved: "That this generous offer of a nucleus for a
memorial to Mrs. Lucinda Hinsdale Stone, of Kalamazoo, be accepted by the Federation from the Twentieth Century Club of Kalamazoo, and that the individual clubs and club members be requested
to try to complete by subscription the sum of five thousand dollars
($5,000.00) for this Scholarship."
Miss Avery's motion was carried, and at the ninth annual
meeting of the State Federation, held in the City of Grand Rapids,
October, 1903, the following resolution was adopted by the convention:
"Resolved, That when three thousand dollars shall be in the
hands of the Treasurer of the fund, she shall turn it over to the




322


2FEBRUARY 2MEET'ING, 1904.


Treasurer of the Michigan State Federation of Women's Clubs, and
the Board of the Michigan State Federation shall forward it at
once to the Regents of the University for investment, the balance
to be paid when the full amount shall be raised."
Today, enclosing to you a draft for the sum of three thousand
dollars, we ask that this sum shall be known by the name, and
administered by you as provided in the following resolution:
"Resolved, That the fund raised by the Michigan State Federation of Women's Clubs, for the Stone Memorial Scholarship, shall
be called The Lucinda Hinsdale Stone Supplementary Loan Scholarship Fund. That it shall be given to the University of Michigan
for the benefit of women who are students in the University; and
that the interest on the amount shall be administered by the President of said University, the Dean of the Women's Department, and
a third person of their.appointment (who shall be a woman)."
Very sincerely,
JOSEPHINE M. GOULD.

of Engineering, a portrait in oil of our late Dean, Professor Charles
E. Greene, by Mr. Percy Ives, of Detroit.
The presentation was accompanied by a number of speeches by
alumni and professors, in which all paid high tribute to the memory
of Professor Greene and his work in the University. Numerous
personal reminiscences added much interest to the occasion and
revealed the deep affection in which he was held. A committee was

MAY MEETING, I904.


339


DETROIT, MICH., May 9, I904.,
Honorable Board of Regents, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
GENTLEMEN: In compliance with your request, we have made a
careful inspection of the old Medical Building at the University in
Ann Arbor, and beg to submit the following report as to its present
condition and the possibilities for alterations and future use.
For the purposes of this report we have considered 'the east
and west buildings separately. The west building is in a decidedly
bad condition, and although it may be used for a few years without
any material changes, it would be impossible to attempt to reconstruct
the interior and use the old walls, as we are of the opinion that such
alterations in the interior would put the walls in an unsafe condition. In this west building we find that the floors have sagged
quite seriously toward the center, indicating that either the foundations of interior columns have settled or that the connections at the
top of columns have given way in some manner, and if the building
is used in the present condition for any length of time, these matters
should be looked into and the necessary repairs made. In our opinion it would not only be impracticable but very difficult to reconstruct this building so as to make it permanent and up to date, and
we should advise its entire demolition at such time as it cannot
further be used in its present condition. The outside walls form a
mere shell, and if an attempt is made to remove the interior floors
and replace them with new, the walls will be further damaged to
such an extent that they could not be repaired and made a part of
a permanent building. The north and south walls are cracked from
the grade to the roof, indicating that the foundations have settled
at points near where a tunnel has been put through.
The arrangement of heating and ventilation is very bad, and the
present conditions are unsanitary, the foul air being conducted direct
from basement to lecture rooms. The basement is in bad condition
and in need of a new floor.
The roof is much in need of repair, and plastering under the
roof should be entirely replaced.
The arch over the opening in the wall between the east and west
buildings is badly settled and the walls have cracked. We do not
think any serious trouble will result from this, however.
The truss in this wall, supporting the floor timbers of the upper
lecture room, should be examined and properly repaired, as it is
evident that some settlement has taken place at this point.
In the east building the walls and foundations are in much better
condition, in fact such inspection as we have been able to give
indicates that they are in practically as good condition as when




340


3l4MAY MEETING, I904.


erected; the brick work having been thoroughly protected on the
outside, there is no reason to believe that any disintegration has
taken place, and all parts of the work where exposed are found to
be in sound and perfect condition. The interior of this building
may be entirely removed and reconstructed in a modern way and
arranged to suit the future requirements without serious damage to
the walls.
The heights of stories in this building are somewhat less than
they should be, and the lighting is bad, but we believe that it would
be possible to rearrange the floor levels and alter the heights of windows, without seriously affecting the exterior design of the building.
If desired, the interior construction may be left as at present,
in which case some minor repairs would be necessary and a new roof
should-be put on, together with new truss and roof timbers, the old
timbers being badly decayed. A new front porch floor and steps
should be provided, and other exterior repairs made as may be found
necessary.
Arrangements should be made outside of the building for keeping animals, and the basement cleared out and provided with a new
floor, which would greatly improve the sanitary conditions.
Some improved heating and ventilating system    should be
installed.
The walls and general construction of the building are in fairly
good condition, and perfectly safe.
During the course of our investigation we talked over the entire
situation with Professor Lombard and Supt. Reeve, and judging
from their statements as to the future requirements, also bearing in
mind the fact that there is a desire to retain the old east building
for sentimental reasons, we would suggest the following:
IAST BUILDING.
The entire interior construction to be removed and replaced with
modern fireproof construction, with stories increased in height as
much as possible, the walls and partitions arranged to suit the
present requirements, also windows altered to suit the new interior
conditions, the roof construction, front steps and other external parts
of the building properly repaired. in the most permanent manner and
new heating and ventilation installed. The building would then be
in practically as good condition as a new building which might be
erected, and would last an equal number of years.
WEST BUILDING.
Old building to be entirely removed and new building erected
of such arrangement and character as you may desire, possibly with




MAY MEETING, 1904.


341


lecture rooms and laboratories, which would be connected with the
east building, as may be found desirable.
We would suggest that the original design of the east building be
carried out in the exterior of the new west building, so that the result
of the change would be to retain the old original design, to which
there is a sentiment attached, and obtain a building which would be
complete and up to date, with a design which would be uniform in
character and pleasing and perfect as a whole.
We trust that the foregoing report may cover the matter to your
entire satisfaction, and remain,
Yours very respectfully,
FIELD, HINCHMAN & SMITH,

Regent Barbour moved that Mr. W. T. Graham (who is
acting as the agent of the Board in the care of property belonging to the University in the city of Omaha, Nebraska,)
be authorized to sell the west 46xIIO feet of the Taggert
lot in said city, and also that he be requested to reshingie
'the two houses on the property known as the Manning

Regent Barbour stated that a tax of $60 for grading had
been levied against the north 25 feet of lot 2, block 3, and the
north 25 feet of lot I, in the Campbell addition to the city of
Omaha, the property being a part of the Bates bequest to
the University. He also stated that Crawford & Clark, attorneys, had written that in their opinion this tax was illegal
and could be set aside in the courts, but they would undertake to clear this property of this tax for the sum of $30.
It was voted that Mr. W. T. Graham be authorized to secure
the release of the property from this tax, through Crawford
& Clark, for a sum not exceeding $30.
On motion of Regent Barbour, it was voted to pay Theodore W. Koch $35 for programs illustrating his lecture on
Dante.

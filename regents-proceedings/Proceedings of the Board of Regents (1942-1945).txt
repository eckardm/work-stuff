The Board met in the Regents' Room at 2:10 P.M.
Present, the President, Regent Shields, Regent Burhans, Regent
Herbert, Regent Connable, and Regent Kipke. Absent, Regent Crowley,
Regent Cram, Regent Lynch, and Superintendent Elliott. There were
also in attendance Provost Stason and the Secretary.
The usual financial reports were placed on file.
The minutes of the meeting of May 28 were approved as submitted
to the members of the Board in press proof.
The Board voted that at each future meeting a report should be presented showing, by departments, the effect of additions to and deductions from the total budget for the current year.
The Board voted that the Deans be asked to consider and report
with respect to arranging suitable graduation exercises, in addition to
the regular Commencement exercises, as should appear to be required
by the new three-term schedule.
Regent Herbert and Regent Connable were appointed delegates
from the University to the annual meeting of the Association of Governing Boards of Colleges and Universities, to be held in Minneapolis
during the coming fall (p. 959).
The Board received and accepted with thanks the gift of $100
from Dr. Glenn A. Carmichael of the medical class of 1928. This gift,
by its terms, is to be set aside for the Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology to be used in part or in whole for any cause or causes
deemed appropriate by the head of that department. It was suggested,
however, that the money should be used to defray expenses incurred
by one of the staff members in attending a recognized scientific meeting (p. 974).
The Board requested the President to write, in behalf of the Regents,
a suitable letter to Regent Cram expressing the sympathy of her colleagues in her illness and their hope that she might soon be able to
resume her duties as a Regent.
Authority was given to appropriate University officials to solicit
state aid to the extent of $20,000 for the erection of a temporary
laboratory to meet special war needs.
The Board voted that if and when a possible gift should come
from a specified foundation of funds to aid students in nursing, the
gift should be accepted with thanks and in accordance with its terms
(p. 911).
The President was authorized to defray, out of an appropriate
gift fund, the traveling expenses of Professor Harry C. Carver between various flying fields of the United States as necessitated by

scholarly activities of the institution, and thereby has gained for himself the
esteem and affection of his colleagues and students which is amply due to him

search, teaching, and writing are acknowledged to have made the largest single
contribution. Recognition of his eminence as a scholar has come to Professor
Pillsbury in many forms, from sources both in this and in other countries, throughout this time, and to this has been added the genuine affection of students and
colleagues inspired by his wholesome character and unassuming friendliness. The
approach of his seventieth birthday, on July 21, 1942, makes it possible for
Professor Pillsbury to retire from active service under the regulations of this
institution. Accordingly, the Regents of the University of Michigan have incorporated this memoir as a part of their official Proceedings, and furthermore have

his personal studies and researches.

The Board established an executive committee for the School of
Business Administration, on the following basis (p. 14 above):
That the Executive Committee should be made up of two faculty members
in addition to the Dean
That the term of office of the faculty members should be two years with the
terms of individual members overlapping
That the faculty submit a panel of double the number of persons to be appointed at any time, which panel will constitute the faculty's recommendation
and indicate their preference
On recommendation of the Faculty of the School of Forestry and
Conservation the degree of Bachelor of Science in Forestry (Wood
Technology) was changed to Bachelor of Science in Wood Technology,
and the degree of Master of Forestry (Wood Technology) was changed
to Master of Wood Technology. As a result of these changes it follows
automatically that the combined course degree of Bachelor of Science




24


JULY MEETING, 1942


in Engineering (Forestry-Wood Technology) is changed to read
Bachelor of Science in Engineering (Wood Technology).
The Board directed that thirty student loans, to a total of $4,311.15,
be charged to the Reserve for Uncollectible Student Loans (p. 613).
The reason for the action in each case was stated in the recommendation of the Vice-President and Secretary.
The Board further voted that 50 per cent of the interest collected
on student loans should hereafter until further action be set aside in
the reserve fund for uncollectible loans.
The following gifts were received and accepted with thanks and
in accordance with their terms and conditions (p. 8 above):
From Mrs. Henry B. Joy, Detroit, $500 for a fellowship in botany for Mrs.
Francesca Thivy. This fund has been named the Joy Fellowship in Botany.
From Mr. B. V. Lawson, Jr., President, and Dr. Raymond L. Hayes, Treasurer,
of the University of Michigan Club, Washington, D.C., an organization
of negro graduates of the University, the sum of $50 as a contribution to
the University general loan fund
From the Rockefeller Foundation, New York City, $2,200 toward the expenses
of the General Library "in collating, recording, and listing microfilm materials
coming to it from Great Britain, particularly microfilm copies of periodicals
from European countries." The sum of $2,000 is to be used as salary for a
cataloger and $200 is to cover "expenses essential to the progress of the work."
Any balance remaining unneeded for the work is to be returned to the Foundation.
A final settlement was received from the executors of the estate
of the late Leona R. Lounsbury in the amount of $2,513.25 (R.P. 1936 -1939, p. 488). This estate has been in process of settlement for approximately fifteen years, and it is doubtful whether final settlement
could have been brought about even at this date without the assistance
of Mr. Raymond M. Crossman, attorney at law in Omaha, a member
of the class of 1911. Mr. Crossman, as a contribution to the University, declined to accept any compensation for his services over a period
of a considerable number of years. The Board extended to Mr. Crossman a vote of thanks for his generous action. The John W. Lounsbury
and Leona R. Lounsbury Fund in memory of their beloved daughter,
Edith Lounsbury, class of 1915, has now been brought up to approximately $3,300.
The President reported the death June 24 of former Regent Junius
E. Beal and on July 7 of Professor Emeritus Jesse S. Reeves, and
stated that appropriate memorials will be drawn up and presented for
adoption at the next meeting of the Board.
The salary of Everett J. Soop, Assistant Director of the Extension
Service, was increased by $600 for the three terms of the year 1942 â€”
1943 for his added work in connection with the Engineering, Science,
and Management War Training Program in the Detroit area, payable
from the War Training fund (p. 871).
The sum of $540 was added to the Salary budget of the Department of Military Science and Tactics to cover the employment of an
extra typist for a period of six months, beginning July 15, 1942, at
$90 per month.
Approval was given to the following trust-fund budgets as recommended by Dean Yoakum (p. 18 above):

of protection of property and persons against enemy bombing. The
Board authorized the expenditure of $2,000 for electrical changes and
blackout arrangements; $2,000 for fire prevention equipment; and
authorized the purchase of material for refuge areas with appropriate
posting upon the campus, as might be required for a total expense,
including labor for completion, not in excess of $8,000. This latter action was taken with the understanding that the material to be bought
would be usable for other purposes should it be decided that these socalled refuge areas were unnecessary. In any event the actual installation of the refuges is not to be carried out till further order. The action
of the Regents excluded expenditures for refuge areas and posting for
the University Hospital and the residence halls, leaving these questions
in so far as they concern the Hospital and residence halls in the hands
of the authorities of those divisions of the University. Whatever action
may be taken by these authorities will be at the expense of the Hospital
and the residence halls respectively.
All the above actions were by unanimous vote except as otherwise
expressly recorded.
The Board adjourned to meet at the call of the President.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary

Zeta Psi fraternity house, numbered 512 South State Street, for the use
of the Department of Military Science and Tactics (R.P. 1939-1942,
p. 863).
Leave of absence, without pay, for one year beginning November 1,
1942, was voted to Professor Udo J. Wile in order that he might accept
a commission as Colonel in the United States Army and serve as
Medical Director in Charge of Venereal Disease Control in the
United States Public Health Service.
The Board authorized, subject to the approval of the President in
each case, award of four tuition scholarships to students selected
among those eligible for employment in the NYA program. These
tuition scholarships are for the fall and spring terms of the current
University year (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 702). The action adds approximately $500 to the Fellowship and Scholarship account.

in the Clements Library for a period of one year beginning September 1, 1942,
with compensation at the rate of $2,250 a year, twelve-month basis, vice Lloyd A.
Brown, resigned (p. 30). No addition to the budget is necessitated by this
action.
August 1, 1942
The committee, on recommendation of the appropriate dean or head of the
department concerned, approved the following appointments for the terms and at
the salaries indicated. No addition to the budget is necessary in any case:

30                 SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1942
Actions of the Operating Committee were approved and ratified in
accordance with the following minutes (p. 4):
July 15, 1942
The committee appropriated the sum of $495, budget of 1941-1942, to University Extension Salaries to take care of an overdraft occasioned by appointment of Helen Gleason to the Branch Office of the Extension Service in Detroit
in February of 1942. There were insufficient funds to meet the total salary paid
to Miss Gleason up to June 30, 1942, in the University Extension budget.
July 16, 1942
The committee added to the Salary budget of Physical Education for Women
the sum of $200 to permit the employment of Betty Anne Bandlow as Assistant
Supervisor in Physical Education, Program in Physical Education for Women. The
budget provided $1,500, and the services of Miss Bandlow, which are particularly
desired, could not be had for less than $1,700. This action was based on the request
of Director Crisler and had the express approval of the Faculty Personnel Committee.
The committee added $130 to the Salary budget of the School of Dentistry
to permit employment of Helen Gadbery as telephone exchange operator on the
twelve-month basis instead of the ten-month basis. This additional service was
required by the Kellogg Institute. It does not mean any change in the rate
of Mrs. Gadbery's salary.
July 18, 1942
The committee added the sum of $260 to the Salary budget of the Bureau
of Appointments and Occupational Information, in order to provide two clerical
salary increases, one from $1,180 to $1,3201 and one from $1,080 to $1,200, and
thus to retain the employees affected. These increases have the approval of the
Office Personnel Committee.
July 23, 1942
On request of Director Hopkins of the Summer Session and with approval
of other officials concerned, the committee transferred one-half of the salary of
Professor Ralph L. Belknap, or the sum of $317.50, from the Camp Davis budget
of the Summer Session to the Summer Term     Salary budget, Department of
Geology.
July 27, 1942
The committee approved the transfer of the sum of $1,140 from Summer Session, Salaries account, to Summer Term, Salaries account, to provide salaries of
$580 and $560 respectively for Warren R. Good and Byron O. Hughes, whose appointments in the School of Education have been changed from the summer session to the summer term.
July 27, 1942
In view of the resignation of Lloyd A. Brown, Curator of Maps in the
Clements Library, as of August 31, 1942, and of the prospective employment
of Colton Storm, the committee took the following action, with a resultant saving
to the University of $100.
Mr. Brown had reached a salary of $2,500 per year. Colton Storm will be
appointed at $2,250 plus an agreed allowance of $150 to cover moving expenses.
The committee, therefore, authorized the transfer of $150 from the Salary account
of the Clements Library to the Current Expense account, with payment thereof
to Mr. Storm.
July 27, 1942
The committee granted leave of absence with pay to Grace Eager, Artist for
the Museum of Zoology, for the period of two months beginning July 27, because
of illness necessitating a serious operation.
July 29, 1942
In view of the leave of absence granted to; Professor Lawrence Preuss July
17 (p. 17), it became necessary to provide for his work during the remainder
of the Summer Session. The only feasible arrangement apparently was to arrange
with Professor Howard B. Calderwood to serve for the two weeks between July
27 and August 8 at $155, and Dr. William I. Cargo to serve from August 10
to August 21 for $125. These salary payments are within the amount that would
have been paid to Professor Preuss had he not been take away from here by the
Government.
August 5, 1942
On recommendation by Superintendent E. C. Pardon of the Buildings and
Grounds Department and 0. E. Roszel, Storekeeper, University Storehouse, the
committee approved an increase in salary for William  E. Brittan, Requisition
Clerk at the Storehouse, from $1,850 to $1,950 a year, twelve-month basis,
effective as of July 1, 1942. No addition to the budget is necessitated by this
action.

for the fall and spring terms of 1942-1943. This gift was accepted
with appropriate thanks from the Board, and Dr. Irving D. Scott,
a senior member of the Faculty of the Department of Geology, was

The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan express to Mr.
George A. Richards, President, and to Mr. Leo Fitzpatrick, Vice-President and
General Manager, of Station WJR, Detroit, their cordial thanks for making
available to the University during the year 1941-42 broadcasting time commercially valued at $52,290, and for many other courtesies extended to members
of the University staff and student body. Similar privileges have been now accorded the University of Michigan by Station WJR    over a period of fifteen
years, and have made it possible to bring directly to the people of the State
a varied and extremely valuable series of educational broadcasts. The Regents of
the University of Michigan recognize that by their co-operation in this type of
work Messrs. Richards and Fitzpatrick and their associates in Station WJR have
most effectively evidenced their public spirit and their belief in the fundamental
value of education in a democratic nation.
The following memorial resolution was adopted, with instructions
that a copy be sent to Mr. Beal's family (p. 24):
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby record their
deep sorrow for the death, on June 24, 1942, of their friend and former colleague,
the Honorable Junius Emery Beal, a member of this Board from 1908 to 1940,
whose important services to this institution formed the subject of a memoir included in the Proceedings of the Regents of January 26, 1940 (R.P. 1939-1942,
p. 169), at the time of his retirement. Now that this busy, steadfast, and useful
life has finished its appointed course, leaving multitudes of citizens grateful for
his public service and multitudes of friends who will constantly cherish the
memory of his kindly, wise, and helpful spirit, the Regents of this University send
to Mrs. Beal and her family this resolution as an expression of their profound
sympathy.
The following resolutions were adopted (p. 24):
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby record their
deep sorrow for the death, on July 7, 1942, of Jesse Siddall Reeves, Professor
Emeritus of Political Science, whose retirement from active teaching had taken
place only a short time previously and a memoir of whose notable services to
this University was made a part of the Proceedings of the Regents for January

Resolved, That as an expression of the Regents' profound sympathy these
resolutions be communicated to Mrs. Reeves and the other surviving members of
Professor Reeves' family.
The President reported the death of Professor Emeritus Edwin C.

Edwin Charles Goddard, Ph.B. '89, LL.B. '99, Professor Emeritus of Law,
whose death occurred on August 14, 1942, in the 77th year of his age, served on
the faculties of the University of Michigan from  1895 to 1935, at first as Instructor in Mathematics and after 1900 as Assistant Professor and Professor of
Law. He was Secretary of the Law Faculty from 1903 to 1917. Few teachers
have commanded to the same degree as Professor Goddard the combined respect
and affection of students and colleagues, which came as the natural tribute to a
man of unswerving uprightness of character, an able teacher and writer, whose
interest in his fellow man was throughout his life translated into kind deeds and
effective participation in an unusually wide range of public activities. His retire



SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1942


ment to the emeritus status in no wise diminished his loyalty and devotion to the
University and to the community of which he was a distinguished and valued
citizen. His wise counsel and readiness to aid in any good cause will be long
remembered and sorely missed.
The President reported the sudden death, on July 23, 1942, of
Associate Professor Edwin W. Miller of the Department of Mathematics, and in accordance with the President's recommendation the
following resolutions were adopted:
Resolved, By the Regents of the University of MIichigan, that they hereby
record their heartfelt sorrow for the untimely death of Dr. Edwin W. Miller,
Associate Professor of Mathematics, an alumnus of Michigan in the Class of
1926 and recipient of the Doctorate in Philosophy in 1930, since that year a
member of the faculty in Miathematics, and a scholar and teacher who was highly
regarded by his students, colleagues, and many friends for his accomplishments
and his promise for the future; and be it further
Resolved, That the Regents hereby express their sincere sympathy to Professor Miller's surviving family in their bereavement.
The President reported the death in Ann Arbor, July 19, 1942, of
Associate Professor Howard M. Wight, and in accordance with the
recommendation of the President the following preamble and resolution
were adopted:
WHEREAS, The death of Howard Marshall Wight, Associate Professor of Forest
Zoology, on July 19, 1942, has deprived the University of the services of a
scholarly and devoted teacher, known for his many contributions to the literature
of his field, who has been connected with the University of Michigan since 1928,
and who before that time served his country as a valiant soldier, and began a
brilliant teaching career at Oregon State College, therefore be it
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan incorporate in
their official Proceedings this resolution, as a record of their sorrow  for his
death and in recognition of the loss suffered by the institution thereby, and direct
that a copy be transmitted to Professor Wight's family as an expression of the
Regents' deep sympathy with them in their bereavement.
The President reported the sudden death in Ann Arbor on July 18,
1942, of Dr. Elmer Rolland Townsley, Assistant Professor of Physical

following memoir and resolution were adopted:
Elmer Rolland Townsley, a native of Vincennes, Indiana, an alumnus of this
University (B.S. '33; M.D. '39; A.M. '41), and since 1929 a member of the
staff in Physical Education, died suddenly on July 18, 1942, while engaged in
the active pursuit of his duties as Assistant Professor of Physical Education.
A loyal son of this University, thoroughly trained for his profession, respected and
admired by his colleagues and students, Dr. Townsley's unexpected death profoundiy shocked our entire community and interrupted a career which had already
contributed valuably to the interests of this University and held great promise
for the future. Therefore be it
Resolved, By the Regents of the University of Michigan, that they hereby
record their deep sorrow for the death of Dr. Elmer Rolland Townsley, and their
appreciation of the loss which the University, his friends, and his family have
sustained thereby, and that a copy of this resolution be transmitted to Dr.
Townsley's surviving family in token of the Regents' sincere sympathy with them
in their great bereavement.
The Board adopted the following statement and resolution upon
the retirement of Dr. George A. May, Associate Professor of Physical
Education and Director of Waterman Gymnasium           (p. 31):
George Augustus May, Associate Professor of Physical Education and Director
of Waterman Gymnasium, having reached the age of 70 years on July 8, 1942, is
relinquishing his active teaching and administrative duties at the University of
Michigan after forty-one years of valuable service to the institution and its




36


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1942


students. A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Dr. May came to Michigan as
Instructor and Physical Examiner in Waterman Gymnasium in 1901, shortly after
he had received the degree Doctor of Medicine from Yale University. Since that
time his has been a record of enthusiastic devotion to his professional duties,
of sustained loyalty to this University, of patient and sympathetic interest in
the welfare of the hosts of students who have had the benefit of his instruction
and guidance, and of the maintenance of standards of life and character which
have gained him many friendships and universal respect. His work in his department, whether forthe physical conditioning of large groups or the special training
of individuals, has been of a high order; and he has participated in the activities
of the numerous associations which deal with the subject of his profession. In
view of Dr. May's noteworthy service over an unusually long period, the Regents
of the University of Michigan have adopted the following resolution:
Resolved, By the Regents of the University of Michigan, that Dr. George
Augustus May be permitted to retire under the provisions of the Bylaws of the
University as of July 8, 1942, that the title Associate Professor Emeritus of
Physical Education be conferred upon him, that the usual retiring allowance be
provided for him beginning with the date of his retirement, and that he be
invited to make use of the University's facilities in connection with such studies
and activities as he may engage in as an emeritus member of the Faculty, and
be it further
Resolved, That the Regents cordially felicitate Dr. May upon his many
accomplishments as a member of the faculty of this University and wish him all
health and happiness for the future.

The budget of the University residence halls for the fiscal year
1942-1943 as prepared by the Board of Governors of Residence Halls
was adopted by the Regents in the amount of $103,359.00 for the
group of six residence halls not covered by any bond issue and
$744,859.50 for the group of five residence halls whose revenues are
pledged to secure a bond issue (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 667).
The Board approved the recommendation of Dean Stason of the
Law School that the request of the Judge Advocate General of the
Army for the transfer to this University of the Judge Advocate General's School for training officers in the legal branch of the Army be
approved. All the personnel sent here by the Army will be officers
of the Captain grade or higher and all will be members of the bar
who have been in active practice. The Army will furnish the instruction (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 861). The approval of this proposal by the
Regents was embodied in the following resolution:
Resolved, That the accommodation of the Judge Advocate General's School
in the W. W. Cook Law Quadrangle is approved, and the President and Secretary are authorized to execute the necessary contracts with the War Department,
it being understood that rates to be charged for room and board shall be the
going rates established for students in the Law School.
Bylaw, Section 3.08, was changed to read as follows (p. 25):
Sec. 3.08. Vacation and Terminal Allowances. University employees, on a
twelve-month basis, who have been in University service for one year or more
may be granted vacation allowances of not to exceed one month with full pay.
Such employees who have been in the service for six months or more but less
than one year may be granted vacation allowances of not to exceed two weeks
with full pay. No employee on vacation with pay from one department shall be

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1942


employed with pay in any other department of the University during such vacations. An employee on a twelve-month basis who leaves in good standing and
has been in the service of the University for one year or more and who has
earned a vacation allowance under the foregoing provisions but is unable to
receive it because he is resigning or being granted a leave without pay, may be
paid a terminal allowance equal to the salary that he would have received for
the vacation period had he continued in the University service.
The President reported the following gifts, which were accepted in
each case with appropriate thanks and in accordance with their terms
and conditions (p. 33):
From The Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, through Dr. John Norton, Director of
Research, $750 for the Upjohn Company Fellowship in Pharmacy, for 1942-1943
(R.P. 1939-1942, p. 598)
From an anonymous donor, $1,000 for the Helen Newberry Residence Scholarship
fund, for scholarships for 1942-1943 in the amount of $500 each, for Marion
Edgar and Archolose Godoshian (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 736)
From State Street merchants, $50 toward the cost of the war bond sales booth
on the campus
Dr. Wolfgang H. Kraus was appointed Assistant Professor of
Political Science for the fall and spring terms of the present University year, with salary of $3,200. This appointment is to replace temporarily Associate Professor Harlow J. Heneman, on leave (R.P.
1939-1942, p. 970).
Dr. Herman H. Riecker, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine,
was appointed additionally as Lecturer on Medical Information for
Social Workers in the Institute of Public and Social Administration

budget.
Professor Robert Gesell was appointed to membership in the Executive Committee of the Medical School for the term of three years,
beginning September 1, 1942, vice Dr. Bradley M. Patten, term expired (R.P. 1939-1942, pp. 701 and 88).
Beulah K. Ankenmann was reappointed to the Executive Committee
of the School of Nursing for a two-year term beginning July 1, 1942
(R.P. 1939-1942, pp. 890 and 583).
The title of Laurie Estelle Campbell was corrected from the form
in which it appears (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 963) to read Assistant Professor of Physical Education for Women, School of Education, and
Supervisor in Physical Education, Department of Physical Education
and Athletics.
The appointment of Zella M. Fiester in the School of Public Health
was changed to read Assistant in Public Health Economics, and the
salary of the position, under the new title, was fixed at $1,680 to
date from August 1, 1942. This involves an increase in the budget of
$380.
The salary of Elmer S. Mason, Animal Man in the Virology
Laboratory, was increased from   $1,500 to $1,620 a year, beginning
September 1, 1942. No increase in the budget is involved.
The salary of Dr. Basu Kumar Bagchi, in charge of electroencephalography in the Neuropsychiatric Institute, was increased from $1,500
to $1,900 a year, twelve-month basis, beginning September 1, 1942.

This increase is provided out of funds now unallocated in the budget
of the Neuropsychiatric Institute.
Leave of absence, with full pay, on account of illness was granted
to Margaret McKechnie, secretary to Assistant Secretary Watkins, for
the period of thirty days beginning September 8.
On recommendation of the appropriate authority in each case, degrees and certificates were voted as follows:

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1942


51


The sum of $1,430 was added to the budget of the Medical School
to provide from September 15, 1942, inclusive to June 30, 1943, one
assistant in Endocrinology at $100 a month and one assistant in the
same subject at $50 a month, the latter to be paid on an hourly basis.
A total sum not in excess of $19,000 was voted by the Board to
provide, subject to the President's approval of details and subject
to ability to secure priorities for the buildings involved, at the Forestry Camp at Golden Lake in the Upper Peninsula, the following new
facilities: a dining room and kitchen, estimated at $10,000; new road,
estimated at $500; faculty residence, estimated at $2,000; and additional land, estimated at $6,500.
To constitute the Board of Governors to advise and assist the
Director of the International Center, as provided in Bylaw 30.10, the
Regents approved the President's nomination of Dean Joseph A.
Bursley, for a three-year term; Professor Arthur S. Aiton, for a twoyear term; and Professor George E. Carrothers, for a one-year term,
dating from July 1, 1942.
In view of the proposed reduction in the draft age, the Board
voted that all male students, except those properly excused, should
hereafter be expected to participate in the physical hardening program
(p. 39).
The Board further referred to the University Committee on Annuities all individual questions arising through appointments for
comparatively brief periods but with titles that under the general
regulations require the appointees to co-operate with the University
in the purchase of old-age annuities. The committee will report its
decisions of this nature to the Board.
The traveling expense of Regent Burhans in attending the meetings
of May 29 and July 17, $22.59, and of Regent Herbert in attending
the meeting of July 17, $66.38, were approved.
Leave of absence was voted for one year, beginning August 16, to
Boyd C. Stephens, Cashier of the University, commissioned First
Lieutenant in the U. S. Coast Artillery.
Leave of absence for one year was voted to Bert Peterson, Clerk in
the Business Office, who has enlisted in the Army, the leave to be
effective with the date at which he should leave to be inducted into
the service.
The Secretary further reported for record, with regret, the resignation July 31, 1942, of F. Hazen Dick, Purchasing Assistant in the
Business Office, who had been charged particularly with buying for
the University Hospital, the resignation being tendered because of
an advantageous appointment offered Mr. Dick in a Louisville, Kentucky, institution.
To meet in part the situation created by these leaves and the
resignation, the following appointments and changes were made, all
changes in duties and salaries to be effective as of September 1, 1942:
To succeed Mr. Stephens during his leave, George E. Gere, who has been
Assistant Chief Accountant for a considerable period, with salary as Acting
Cashier of $3,800 a year
To succeed Mr. Gere, Raymond R. Garlough, as Acting Assistant Chief Accountant,
with salary fixed during the appointment at $2,400 a year




52


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1942


The salary of G. Harold Staebler, Assistant Cashier, was increased from $2,100
to $2,400 in view of added duties and responsibilities
To succeed to Milr. Dick's duties, Waldo W. Buss, Assistant Purchasing Agent,
with salary of $3,300
To succeed MAr. Buss as Assistant Purchasing Agent, J. Frederick Shear, now Order
Clerk, at the salary of $2,400
The salary of Ralph E. Rash, Purchasing Assistant, Business Office, in view of
additional duties and responsibilities, was increased from $1,900 to $2,100
a year
Under circumstances related by the Secretary, the Board authorized increases in deposit limits as follows:
State Savings Bank, Ann Arbor, increase of................. $90,000
Ann Arbor Bank, Ann Arbor, increase of..................... 25,000
Further, the Board authorized the placing of not to exceed $6,000 in
the shares of the Ann Arbor Federal Savings and Loan Association.
The Secretary placed on file a letter of thanks from Professor
Walter B. Pillsbury for the action of the Regents at the time of his
retirement (p. 10).
The Secretary filed a copy of the will of the late Professor
Emeritus Edwin C. Goddard under which the University will in due
course become a beneficiary.
The Secretary proposed to the Regents the donation by the University of the metal in the so-called Library Chimes (five bells)
originally presented to the University in 1883 (R.P. 1881-1886, pp.
340-342). The donors were the late Dr. Andrew D. White, the late
Mr. J. J. Hagerman, of the Class of 1861, and, principally, the late Mr.
Edward C. Hegeler, Honorary 1883. The removal of the bells from the
old library tower to their present location, when the present library
was built, about twenty-five years ago, had rendered the bells practically inaudible to much of the Campus, and now the clock mechanism  is worn out beyond practical operation.   Further, the Baird
carillon and clock have fulfilled in a larger and more complete way the
original purposes of the chimes. Correspondence with the son and
daughters of Mr. Hegeler indicated that they would heartily approve
the proposed patriotic use of the metal in these bells, believed to
amount to two tons or more. Under these circumstances the Regents
voted to present these bells to the metal salvage needs of the Government.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
In view of the emergency questions that may arise at any time,
the Board adjourned subject to call of the President.
SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary

Hospital, the several residence halls, the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, and the Michigan League (R.P. 1939-1942,
p. 715). The auditor's certificate with respect to the general accounts
of the University, including the Hospital, was as follows:
To the Board of Regents of the
University of Michigan:
We have made an examination of the accounts of the University for the
year ended June 30, 1942. In the course of our audit we examined or tested
records and supporting documents, made test checks of income and expenditures,
and made a general review of the accounting methods, but did not make a detailed audit of all transactions.
We have compared the data printed in the following financial reports with
the records of the University. Consistent with prior years, the accounts have
been maintained on the basis of cash receipts and disbursements, with adjustment made at the close of each year to reflect the accounts receivable on the
balance sheet.
In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and schedules relating thereto
correctly set forth the financial position of the University of Michigan as at
June 30. 1942, and its operations for the year ended that date.

OCTOBER MJEETING, 1942


The following statements were placed in the record on behalf and
by authority of the Chairman of the Finance Committee:
We have examined the report of the audit of the books and accounts of the
University for the year ended June 30, 1942, made by Miller, Bailey and Company, certified public accountants, and submit to the Regents the following matters of general information relating thereto:
In addition to the general statement made in the auditor's certificate, their
report includes the following: All cash balances were verified, cash on hand
was counted and bank balances were confirmed by correspondence with the depositories. Securities held at the Detroit Trust Company and at the offices of
the University at Ann Arbor were inspected. These securities constituted the
major part of the fund investments. Funds in trust, held by others, were verified
by certificates from the custodians. The complete report of investments of the
University, covering securities and residual cash balances, was checked in detail
as to book value and, in addition, market values were tested to a considerable
extent. Book values of bonds, preferred stocks, and common stocks in hands of
the University were $13,442,183.71 market values, $13,614,739.66.
Student loan notes were inspected and checked against the records. A total
of the detail was found to be in accord with the control maintained. Payments
during the year were test checked to the notes. Accounts receivable were examined
and found to be in agreement with amount shown on the balance sheet. The reserve for uncoliectible accounts at the Hospital has been increased during the
year from $66,794.27 to $88,853.37. Inventories were test checked as to price
and clerical accuracy. Construction cost records of the Horace H. Rackham Educational Memorial, located at Detroit, Michigan, were examined for classification
and authority, and appear to be in order.
During the year the following reductions were made in revenue bonds outstanding:
Consolidated Dormitory Revenue Bonds...... $ 232,000.00
Health  Service  Notes.....................    9,000.00
Michigan Union Revenue Bonds............       66,000.00
Stadium   Bonds..........................     75,000.00
Total...................................   $  382,000.00
Receipts of tuition, laboratory fees, dormitory income, income from securities,
and other general receipts during the year, were test checked. Disbursements
were tested for approval, support, and classification.
The following resolution on motion duly made and seconded was
adopted:
Resolved, That the reports of Miller, Bailey and Company, as auditors, be
accepted and placed on file and that the annual Financial Report of the VicePresident and Secretary for the year ended June 30, 1942, as filed by him and
as covered by the above recorded audit, be accepted and adopted by the Regents
as the report of the Board to the Governor of the State, and that the usual
number of copies be printed.
Regent Kipke called attention to several features of the auditors'
report on the Michigan Union.
The report of the auditors showed for the year for the several
enterprises of the University the results tabulated on page 55 (R.P.
1939-1942, p. 717).
The report on the affairs of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics contains the following data (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 718):

OCTOBER MEETING, 1942


The Board authorized qualification by the University as an issuing
agent of United States war bonds purchased by payroll deductions.
The new arrangement is to facilitate more prompt issue and thus to
contribute to the success of the plans of the Government (R.P. 1939 -1942, p. 915).
The Board voted to permit and request the Trustee to invest
dormitory reserves in appropriate Government bonds (R.P. 1939-1942,
p. 17).
The Board deferred to the next meeting action upon an appointment recommended by the Faculty of the Medical School.
The President reported that the State Administrative Board had
made an appropriation of $20,000 for the erection of temporary laboratory facilities to aid in the war effort (p. 1). Professor Gram presented plans for the utilization of these funds, involving an extension
of the West Engineering Annex, of temporary construction, to add
about twelve hundred square feet and for another building of temporary construction immediately south of and adjoining the present
R.O.T.C. headquarters, providing about twenty-seven hundred square
feet. These plans received the approval of the Board.
Professor Gram was excused.
The Board directed the revival of the citation or certificate embodying appropriate sentiments, used in World War I in communicating sympathy to parents or other near relatives of students or alumni
who may give their lives in World War II (R.P. 1917-1920, p. 527).
The President filed reports of student registration to October 10.
These show a reduction from last year's attendance of approximately
10 per cent.
The following action was taken:
WHEREAS, It is the policy of the University to encourage its students to participate actively and patriotically in the war effort; to aid them in their preparation for war service; to devote its facilities and resources to such preparation
and to co-operate with the agencies of the government dealing with these problems.
Now therefore to assist in implementing such policy there is hereby created
a Regents' committee on War Activities, which committee shall consist of Regents
Lynch, Crowley, and Connable to study the war problems of the University, to
collaborate with the University War Board of the faculty and other organizations
having similar purpose, and to make its recommendations to the Board of Regents
from time to time.
Regent Crowley did not vote on this resolution.
The Board referred to this committee certain recommendations
with regard to added personnel for the University War Board.
The Board approved change in the status of Assistant Professor
Robley C. Williams effective during the fall and spring terms of
1942-1943 by which Professor Williams is relieved of certain observational duties at the Observatory, with reduction in salary from $2,700
to $2,200. Professor Williams will devote the time for which he is
relieved to a war research problem, and the amount saved in the
Observatory budget will be available for the appointment of assistants
to do the observational work which he has been carrying on.
The status of Assistant Professor Lewis N. Holland was similarly
changed to a part-time basis, with reduction in salary from $3,100
to $2,100, for the fall and spring terms of 1942-1943.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1942


59


The Secretary filed a report by the counsel of the Board upon the
applicability of the Act of Congress of October 2, 1942, and executive
order implementing such Act, to the payrolls of the University. No
action was taken.
The Board accepted a gift from    Mr. Philip S. Harper of the sum
of $800 to constitute a scholarship to be known as the Philip S.
Harper Scholarship, to    which on an informal understanding       Miss
Rose S. Stoetzel is to be appointed (pp. 33-34).
The Secretary filed notice that the United States Office of Education had remitted the sum of $20,000 to be applied under specified
conditions toward the needs of students in engineering, physics, chemistry, medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy. The applications of this
fund are to be in the form of loans.
The Board approved and ratified actions of the Finance Committee

OCTOBER MEETING, 1942

September 23, 1942
On recommendation of the Dean of the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts, the committee approved the transfer of the sum of $300 from the
Administration budget of the College to the Salary budget of the Department of
Psychology to provide for the fall and spring terms of 1942-1943 an addition
of $300 to the salary of Dr. Burton D. Thuma, recently appointed Executive
Secretary of that Department, effective at the time of Professor Pillsbury's retirement on September 26, 1942.
September 30, 1942
On request of Professor L. M. Gram and Mr. J. C. Christensen of the committee in charge of building the Horace H. Rackham Educational M\emorial in
Detroit. the Operating Committee authorized payment to Mr. David Norton of
$200 from the Rackham    Building Fund. MIr. Norton was employed as Radio
Technician, Broadcasting Service, University Extension Service, from  January
7 to June 30, 1942, and was also employed during the summer session. Between
the close of the summer session and the opening of college he built for the Rackham  Building in Detroit a broadcasting equipment. The equipment was needed
but the University's application for a priority had been denied. Mr. Norton was
able to pick up the necessary parts in various places through the country and
put them together into an entirely satisfactory completed piece at a total cost
very substantially less, including this $200, than the price quoted by the manufacturers had the University been able to secure priority.
October 2, 1942
The committee appropriated the sum of $225 as an addition to the Salary
budget of the Alumni Catalog Office in order to retain the services of S. B.

the increase being effective October 1. This action was with the approval and on
the request of the Office Personnel Committee. I\r. Hadley is the only male employee of the Catalog Office, and the work involved in handling the addressograph and the addressograph lists (300,000 plates) requires the services of at

and its regret at his retirement from the position of Chairman of the Department
of Postgraduate Medicine. Doctor Bruce came to Ann Arbor, leaving an extensive




102


OCTOBER MEETING, 1942


practice in Saginaw, to direct the activities of the Department of Internal Medicine in the Medical School. His tact and executive ability were of great help in
many difficult situations. The personal contacts and experiences of Doctor Bruce
convinced him of the need for postgraduate medical education, and when this department was organized no man more fitted to direct it could have been found.
Doctor Bruce has been eminently successful in his endeavor to create a feeling
of good will between the medical profession and the Medical School of the University. It is with deepest regret that the Medical Faculty faces the loss of his
services.
Gifts were reported by the President and accepted with thanks and
in accordance with the terms and conditions in each case, as follows
(p. 59):
From  the Rockefeller Foundation, $1,400 for aid to studies of methods of
teaching English to Latin-American students; $600 of this amount covers
the expenses of Professor Charles C. Fries while he was in Mexico City, and
S800 is to be assigned to Mr. David W. Reed, as a Grant-in-Aid while he
is in Ann Arbor. The money has been added to the English Language Institute funds (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 735).
From   the American   Association  of University  Women, Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti
Branch, $500 for the A.A.U.W. Scholarship for 1942-1943, which has been
awarded to Miss Isabelle Lugoski. One-half of the grant, the stipend for the
fall term, has been received (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 736).
From the Class of 1931, College of Engineering, $400 to establish a loan fund

The purpose of this fund is for student loans for Junior and Senior Engineering Students as deemed advisable by the Directors of the University of
Michigan Student Loan Fuinds. We request that the University authorities notify
the 1931 Engineering Class Officers of Engineering Students receiving aid through
this loan each semester so that the student may be contacted by a member of
the 1931 Class. Also, we request a yearly report on the status of this fund.
The donors further requested that this fund be governed by the University's
general policy in regard to its use should the need for which the grant is made
cease to exist. The fund has been designated the Class of 1931 Engineering Memorial Loan.

APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREE
Voted July 17, 1942, page 18. Conferred October 5, 1942.
Characterization by Professor John G. Winter.
MASTER OF SCIENCE
GROVER CIEVELAND PENBERTHY. A graduate of the Medical School in 1910,
since 1913 a practitioner in Detroit, where he has won distinction as one of the
country's foremost surgeons. His ability is attested by the responsible positions
he has long held in the city's leading hospitals and by his rank as Clinical Professor of Surgery in Wayne University. In matters of civic government and in
problems of social welfare he has been unfailingly helpful. Devotion to the demands of his profession has not lessened his interest in research, nor has research
dulled his sense of its purpose in medicine. Numerous contributions to leading
journals bear witness of his activity in extending the horizons of knowledge for
the benefit of mankind. In an age whose chief concern is the destruction of life,
he and his colleagues in the noblest of all professions fight valiantly and ceaselessly to save it.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
ANN ARBOR, NOVEMBER 12, 1942

this carefully prepared report which was made available so promptly.
2. (This paragraph of the report gave approval to the co-operation by the
University in a United States Army project which for the time-being is not to

3. We have endorsed the Student Mlanpower Corps, its announced purpose

The changes in the Christmas vacation seemed necessary to conform
to the requests of the military authorities and of the railroads to
avoid travel on the dates immediately before and after Christmas
and New Year's:
Classes close for vacation Friday evening, December 18 (instead of Wednesday,
December 23)
Classes resume Wednesday morning, December 30 (instead of Monday, January 4)
Classes to be held on January 1
On the basis of the further recommendation of the Deans, the
Board approved the holding of graduation exercises for the present
fall term on Saturday, January 23, 1943 (p. 1).
Mr. Clarence E. Wilcox, as Secretary of the Board of Trustees
of the Horace H. Rackham       and Mary A. Rackham       Fund, transmitted

of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1931, as amended.

NOVEM1BER MEETING, 1942


The Secretary reported receipt from the estate of J. B. Finley,
deceased, by Mr. John S. C. Herron, Trustee, of a check for $500
for use as financial aid to Alexander Cranston Peat, a student in the
Medical School, to enable him to continue his education. This gift
was accepted with thanks in accordance with its terms and conditions.
The Secretary presented the desirability and propriety, in order
to correct inequities and retain employees, of making increases in
the compensation of a number of employees of the Michigan League.
The Regents approved such changes in salaries as were determined
to be proper in order to relieve these inequities and retain services.
These increases are individual salary adjustments within the established salary ranges of the University for comparable positions. They
are based upon individual merit and length of service and hence fall
within the exceptions set forth in Section 4001.7 of regulations relating to wages and salaries issued by the Economic Stabilization Director
and approved by the President on October 27, 1942. If, under existing
statutes and regulations, these salary adjustments shall subsequently
be found as a matter of law to require approval by the War Labor
Board. they shall be suspended until such approval is secured.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to Friday, December 18, 1942, at 2 P.M..
with the understanding that the meeting would be held in the office
of Regent Shields, 1492 National Bank Building, Detroit.

Leave of absence, without pay, was granted Katharine A. Fellows,

December 1, 1942, until January 31, 1943.
The Board approved, as requested by the School of Business
Administration, certain changes in the curriculum of that School. not
involving either admission requirements or additional expenditures,
and authorized the School to issue a brief bulletin setting forth the
pertinent facts.
The Board approved and enacted the following recommendations
of the University War Board for the establishment of a Division for
Emergency    Training  and appointed    Associate  Professor Marvin L.
Niehuss, of the Law School, as Co-ordinator of Emergency Training,
effective at once:
In view of the present crisis it is hereby recommended that the Board of
Regents establish as soon as possible a University of Michigan Division for
Emergency Training. The purpose of this Division would be to organize and
direct such special programs suitable for students preparing for military and
civilian service to the country as do not fall within the scope of the existing
educational branches of the University. It is not contemplated that this Division
should take over the functions of the established schools and colleges or attempt
to duplicate their work, but that it should supplement their activities and act in
co-operation with them.
Furthermore, in order that the Division for Emergency Training may not
constitute a severe drain upon the University budget, it is recommended that its
instructional staff be recruited insofar as possible from the present faculties,
many of whose members could be loaned to it by their respective schools and
colleges in view of the prospective diminution of their teaching obligations.
If new appointments are found necessary they will, of course, be made in the
usual manner with the approval of the Committee on Faculty Personnel.
It is also recommended that the Regents appoint an executive head of the
Division and authorize the creation of an advisory committee.
If these recommendations are approved, it is further recommended that the
Division should proceed with all speed to plan and announce training programs
relating to the war effort for the following classes of students:
a) Those high-school graduates who wish to receive special preparation prior
to their induction in the armed service.
b) Those students now enrolled in the University who wish kinds of preparation for special war or supporting civilian services not available in the schools
and colleges in which they are enrolled.
c) Adults, including those who are not high-school graduates, but who are
qualified to take courses offered in the Division for Emergency Training.
(d) Officers and enlisted men and women of the armed forces who may be
sent to the University for prescribed training not available in the other schools
and colleges.
c) Veterans of the present war who wish specialized training not provided
in the existing schools and colleges.
I) Such other selected individuals not eligible for admission to other schools
and colleges of the University for whom it is possible and expedient to provide
programs of instruction that would increase their efficiency in the armed forces
or in supporting civilian services.
The Board approved and ratified actions of the Finance and Propertv Committee as follows (p. 114):

DECEMBER MEETING, 1942


November 9. 1942
At the request of Dean Alice C. Lloyd, the committee appropriated the sum
of $25 as an addition to the Salary budget of the Office of the Dean of Women,
which with the sum of $500 already in the budget for an Assistant to the
Social Director will provide salary of $75 a month for the period from November 1, 1942, to May 31, 1943, for Valerie Cushman, who is to be appointed
to this position. It is further understood that beginning with the year 1943-1944
this position will require an item of $600 in the budget each year.
November 10. 1942
At the request of Dean James B. Edmonson and Assistant Professor Philip E.

necessary, will be used to obtain temporary help of a clerical and stenographic
nature to December 31, 1942. It is possible that within that time the Army will
assign an additional private or noncommissioned officer who can be used for this
work. If not, Colonel Ganoe will probably have to ask the Board at the
December meeting for an additional clerk through the balance of the year.
November 11, 1942

alumni.

Dean of Students. The fund is to be known as Dean of Students, Manpower
Mobilization Corps.

The following resolution was adopted       (p. 103; R.P. 1939-1942,

Resolved, That the Board of Regents hereby approves and adopts the revised
Bylavws of 1942 and directs that the revision be printed and promulgated as the
bylaws and regulations governing the University.
The approval of the Bylaws and authorization to print included the
two following   sections which have not previously       appeared in the
Proceedings:
Sec. 5.091. Procedure in Cases of Disnmissal or Demotion.
(1) Whenever it is proposed to dismiss or demote any member of the University faculty who is on indeterminate tenure, the grounds for such dismissal or
demotion shall be stated in writing to the individual in question, and he shall have
an opportunity, before such dismissal or demotion is ordered, to appear in person
for a hearing before an appropriate committee, as defined in subsection (2) hereof.
Like procedure shall be followed in all cases of dismissal or demotion of assistant professors or instructors who have been on the staff in the assistant professor
or instructor grade, or both, for six years or more. The procedure shall also be
followed in cases of dismissal or demotion of other members of the faculty not
hereinbefore included if they are dismissed or demoted during the term for which
they are appointed, or if renewals of their term appointments are denied for reasons injurious to their personal reputation. In each such case, a stenographic
record shall be kept, unless otherwise determined by the committee, and where
a record is kept it shall be available for examination by the person or persons immediately concerned.
(2) In schools or colleges in which an executive committee has been appointed. the hearing provided in subsection (1) shall be held before such executive committee or before a special committee appointed for the purpose by the
executive committee. In schools, colleges, or divisions in which no executive
committee has been appointed, the hearing shall be held before a special committee appointed by the governing faculty for the purpose.
In all cases the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs may be requested by the person whose dismissal or demotion is in question to review the
procedure followed and to receive any evidence that the Advisory Committee
deelms relevant. The Advisory Committee may act in such cases through a subcommittee appointed from its membership, to consist of not less than four persons.
(3) Wherever a hearing is requested as provided in subsection (1) of this
section, the committee or committees before which such hearing is held shall deliver a report to the individual whose dismissal or demotion has been considered,
and shall deliver a copy thereof to the President and another copy to the dean
of the school or college involved. In the event the hearing is held before a special
committee or a review is requested by the Senate Advisory Committee, the findinzs and recommendations shall be advisory only, but, at the request of the in

dividual concerned, shall be forwarded to the Board of Regents together with such
recommendations as may be made in the case by proper authorities.
(4) "Demotion" within the meaning of this section shall include reductions
in academic rank and reductions in salary except as the latter are part of a general reduction of salaries throughout the University.
(Senate action, October 21, 1940; R.P. 1939-1942, p. 688)
Section previously designated 5.20 becomes Section 5.20 (1).
(2) Employees of the University not on the teaching staff shall be provided
retirement allowances under the University retirement plan hitherto adopted by
the Board of Regents. Participation in this plan shall be determined from time to
time by action of the Board of Regents designating groups of employees eligible
for such participation. Any member of an eligible group may participate in this
plan if and when he has completed one year of continuous service for the University and has attained age thirty. He must participate in the plan after one year
of service in an eligible group if group eligibility has been in effect for at least
one year and if he is thirty years or more of age. (R.P. 1939-1942, pp. 959 -961)
The Board approved the following statement of procedure. prepared by Dean Yoakum, with respect to transfers of academic credit
(p. 113):
During the present war period, whenever a student transfers from one school
or college within the University in order to prepare himself more speedily for
entry into the military or industrial and civilian services, -those courses and
grades taken in the first unit shall be recorded in full in the second unit and
applied as follows:
(1)  as electives or the equivalent of electives which are open to students
already in the unit, and
(2)  as substitutes for appropriate recommended or required courses for
which substitution can be made without causing the student to enter
advanced courses for which he is unprepared.
Such application of transfer of credit as electives or substitutes shall not be
deemed to relieve the student from announced, essential regulations nor legal requirements governing the degree or certificate which he seeks in the school or
college to which he transfers.
The Regents directed inclusion in the record of the following
agreement amending the contract with the W. K. Kellogg Foundation
as originally made (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 705):

January Meeting, 1943
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, JANUARY 29. 1943
The Board met in the Regents' Room at 2 P.M.
Present, the President, Regent Crowley, Regent Shields, Regent
Lynch. Regent Kipke, Regent Herbert, Regent Connable. and Regent
Bishop. The last named took his seat for the first time after appointment by the Governor to succeed Regent Cram, who has resigned
because of ill health. Absent, Regent Cook (see below, p. 178) and
Superintendent Elliott. There were also in attendance Vice-President
Yoakum. Provost Stason, Dr. F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G. Watkins.
and the Secretary.
The Secretary placed on file the usual financial reports.
The minutes of the meeting of December 18 were approved as submitted to the members in press proof.
The Emergency Committee was specifically authorized to act for
the Board in the conferring of degrees recommended by the several
Faculties at the end of the present fall term.
On recommendation of the Dean's Conference committee, the
Regents voted that the summer term of 1943-1944 should begin June
7. and the summer session of 1943 should begin June 28. The fall
term will begin September 27.
The President and Secretary were specifically empowered to contract with the representatives of the United States Surgeon General's
office for the instruction, housing, and feeding of not more than eighty
students to be enrolled in a proposed basic science nurses' training
course, at a net cost to the University not in excess of $15,000. The
approval of this course, it was explicitly provided, was for one session
only and without precedent in case of proposals for further sessions.
The Board gave consideration to a proposed basic curriculum of
the Division for Emergency Training (p. 148). The curriculum recommended consists of an intensive program, twenty-four weeks in length,
designed to provide (1) fundamental academic training in mathematics.
physics, social studies, and language arts; and (2) thorough physical
conditioning. It is expected that the students will spend approximately
twenty-four hours a week in classroom work, laboratory periods, and
supervised study in addition to the regular physical conditioning program. It is further expected that a moderate number of students
who have completed not less than half of the senior year's work in
a high school but who have not fully met the usual requirements for
university admission, and who are believed by their high-school authorities and the admitting officers of the University to have achieved a
maturity that will enable them to carry university work, may be admitted to this course. It is understood that if they carry their work
in the University successfully, their high-school authorities will accept
their University work in lieu of the high-school work that they have
missed and will graduate them  from the high school. The Regents
approved the proposed program for the basic curriculum in the Divi175




176


JANUARYI MlIEETING, 1943


sion for Emergency Training with the proviso that if the work done
in the basic curriculum   is presented for University credit, the regular
entrance requirements shall first be satisfied; and that no credit toward
a degree shall be given for that portion of the student's work which
has been applied to the satisfaction of regular University entrance
requirements. Regent Connable voted no on this action because he
believed it lowered the University standards for admission.
The President asked the Board for an expression of opinion on
the desirability of broadcasting over the station of Michigan State
College. The Board gave informal approval, if a plan satisfactory to
Michigan State College could be developed.
The   Board   approved   and  ratified  actions of the   Finance   and

as extra compensation to Edna Z. Aiber. Secretary of the Student Religious
Association, for special services rendered in connection with this lecture course
(R.P. 1939-1942, p. 972). The funds for the payment of this salary are!)rovided from the sale of tickets to the lectures, and therefore no appropriation
is necessary.
December 28, 1942
At the request of Clark Tibbitts, Executive Director of the University War
Board. and J Ml. Trytten, Principal of the University High School, the cominittee approved the appointment of Geneva B. Laird as Twxo-thirds-time Teachei

for this salary.

at present paid at the rate of $900 for the period from August 31. 1942. to
June 30, 1943, but because of increased responsibility and the increase of work
in the Dental Clinic, it is considered proper that she receive this extra compensation for the period indicated. It is not contemplated that the salary of this
position is to be increased indefinitely. This action necessitates the addition
of $100 to the Salary budget of the School of Dentistry.
December 28, 1942
At the request of Dr. Bradley M. Patten, Chairman of the Department of
Anatomy, and with the approval of Dean Albert C. Furstenberg, the committee increased the salary of J. Fred Bareis, Assistant Technician in Gross

Science, and the Arts, the committee appropriated the sum of $400 as an addition to the Salary budget of the Department of Russian, which amount together

Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan express their
deep sympathy to the family of the late Associate Professor Emeritus David M.

to his colleagues and to the many students of former years who profited by their
association with him and by the instruction which he so ably gave.

Emeritus Moritz Levi be incorporated into the record. Professor Levi

The death of Moritz Levi, Professor Emeritus of French, on November 1,.
1942. recalls the many years of devoted and successful service as a teacher
contributed to the University of Michigan by Professor Levi prior to his retirement in June, 1923. His skill as an instructor and the varied interests of his
active mind made him many friends and admirers among the students and faculty
members of this University and the citizens of Ann Arbor, nor did retirement

from the ordinary duties of his professorial chair diminish the extent of his
friendships and his intellectual pursuits. The Regents of the University of
Michigan, therefore, hereby record their sorrow  at Professor Emeritus Levi's
death and express their heartfelt sympathy to his surviving family.
The following memorial was incorporated         into the minutes with
respect to the late Dr. Reuben Peterson, who became Professor Emeritus of Obstetrics and Gynecology, June 30. 1931          (p. 170 and R.P.
1929-1932, p. 516):
Resolved, By the Regents of the University of Michigan, that the sincere
condolences of the Board be transmitted to the family of the late Dr. Reuben
Peterson, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Medical School of this
University from  1907 to 1931, Medical Director of the University Hospital
from  1911 to   1918, and since 1931 Professor Emeritus of Obstetrics and
Gynecology. Dr. Peterson's skill won eminence for himseif and his department:
his strong and genial personality made countless friends among Michigan students.
his colleagues, and professional associates. The Regents join with the host oi
those who respected and admired Dr. Peterson in recording their deep sorrow
at his death on November 25, 1942.
The Board further directed inclusion in the minutes of the following resolution adopted and transmitted by the Executive Faculty of
the Medical School:
Dr. Reuben Peterson was born June 29, 1862, in Boston, Massachusetts.
He was the son of Reuben and Julia Turner (Beale) Peterson, and a descendant
of George Soule and John Alden, both of whom came to America on the "Mayflower."
In 1885 he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from  Harvard University,
and his medical degree from the same University in 1889.
On March 6, 1890, Dr. Peterson was married to Josephine Davis, who bore
him four children, Reuben, Marian, Ward, and Julia.
Dr. Peterson's illustrious career is reflected in his numerous scientific reports.
his progressive advancement in the field of medical education, and in the confidence and trust placed in him  by his colleagues and members of scientific
societies. He first engaged in the practice of medicine in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
in 1890. In 1898, he moved to Chicago, where he served until 1900 as Professor
of Gynecology at the Chicago Postgraduate Medical School. From 1898 to 1901
he held the post of Assistant Clinical Professor of Gynecology at Rush Medical
College. In 1901, Dr. Peterson was called to the University of Michigan to
serve as Professor and Head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
and Bates Professor of Diseases of Women and Children, which positions he
held until his retirement in 1931. Since this latter date, he has been Professor
Emeritus in Obstetrics and Gynecology. In 1909, Dr. Peterson organized the
Clinical Society of the University of Michigan. He was its first president, and
afterwards its secretary until war caused a discontinuance of meetings in 1918.
The underlying purposes of the Clinical Society were to encourage the younger
memubers of the staff to report their cases and to gain facility in the discussion
of medical questions. During his active years his administrative abilities were
early recognized, and as a consequence he was not permitted to confine his
talent to the running of a department alone for he also served as Medical
Director of the University of Michigan Hospital from 1912 to 1918.
In recognition of his outstanding ability, Dr. Peterson was invited into
the membership of many scientific organizations. In most of these he served as
chairman or president, at one time or another. Thus he was one of the founders
and a member of the American College of Surgeons. He was a member of the
Chicago Gynecological Society and presiding officer during the year 1910. Dr.
Peterson was an active member of the American Gynecological Society from
1897 to 1931. He was president of this organization in 1911, and was made
honorary member in 1931. For many years he was an active member of the
Detroit Obstetrical and Gynecological Society, and in later years served as an
honorary member. Other affiliations included membership in the American Medical
Association, the Michigan State Medical Society, of which he was president in
1915, the Washtenaw County.Medical Society, president in 1902. Dr. Peterson
was also an honorary fellow in the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society. He was a
mnember of Sigma Xi, Nu Sigma Nu, and Alpha Omega Alpha.

JANUARY MEETING, 1943


Dr. Peterson was a member of the Ann Arbor City Board of Health for
sixteen years, and during World War I served his country with the rank of
Major. He was Medical Adviser to the Governor of Michigan froml 1917 to 1919.
An extensive contributor to the medical literature, Dr. Peterson also edited
the.American, Textbook of Obstetrics and was author of A Demonstration Course
in Obstetrics, which went through several editions. For many years he served
on the Advisory Editorial Board of the American Journal of Obstetrics and
Gynecology.
His kindly and    generous disposition, his sincerity, and keen sense  of
humor endeared him to both patients and colleagues alike. While his ability as a
skillful physician and obstetrician was everywhere recognized, his remarkable
judgment was both the pride and joy of his close associates. Time and again
his uncanny insight into medical problems proved the saving grace in the lives
of many patients. Among his staff members, Dr. Peterson created a spirit of
loyalty and deep friendship which was a source of pleasure and pride to him
as well as to those favored by this happy association.
As a teacher of practical obstetrics and gynecology and their many ramifications. Dr. Peterson had no peer. The many wise principles enunciated by him
are as true and sound today as when first pronounced. Always kindly and
generous in material matters, a splendid preceptor, a charitable disciplinarian,
Dr. Peterson was beloved by one and all of his many devoted understudies.
Following his retirement, Dr. Peterson spent several years writing a history
of the University of Michigan Hospital. He also kept close touch with his
former assistants. and many of his former students, taking in each a (ledel
and personal interest. In his passing, the world has lost an outstanding scholar.
a distinguished physician, an inspiring teacher, and we have lost a true and
steadfast friend.

The Vice-President and Secretary was authorized to execute a grant
to the United States Coast Guard of a right-of-way through the Chase
S. Osborn Preserve for a telephone line extension, the right-of-way
covering that portion of "Section 35, Town 46 north, Range 2 east in
the State of Michigan and County of Chippewa, abutting and adjacent
to the south side of the existing county road" (R.P. 1939-1942, p.
311).
The Board discussed at some length the proposed provision of
further tuition scholarships. This proposal was referred back to Dean
Yoakum for further consideration and report. The Board declined to
consider at this time any cash scholarships in addition to the tuition
scholarships, with the understanding that any specially meritorious
and appealing cases could be brought to the attention of the Regents
as such individual cases might arise.
Dr. Harley A. Haynes, Director of the University Hospital, reported on the development of a consultation service in serology and
syphilis, particularly in connection with Kahn tests, as now operated
by the University Hospital. The Regents approved the procedure and
practice outlined and appointed Dr. Reuben L. Kahn as head of this
service.
On recommendation of the Faculty of the College of Literature.
Science, and the Arts, students in the combined curriculum of letters
and medicine are given the option of receiving the degree of Bachelor

of Arts or that of Bachelor of Science upon the successful completion
of the first year in the Medical School.
On recommendation of the Executive Board of the Horace H.
Rackham School of Graduate Studies. the Regents established the
degree of Master of Science in Pharmacology (M.S. Pharmacol.).
The President placed on file the report of Professor Ralph W.
Aigler. as Chairman of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, for the year ended June 30, 1942. This report supplements and
amplifies the report of the auditors submitted to the Regents October
16. 1942 (p. 54 and R.P. 1939-1942. p. 841).
The President reported the gift of $100 from  the Goodfellow
Daily fund, for the Textbook Lending Library fund (R.P. 1939-1942.
p. 873).
The President further reported the gift, subject to acceptance by
the Regents, of the sum of $163 to constitute the nucleus of a possible
total of $500, contributed by colleagues and friends of the late Associate Professor Edwin W. Miller (p. 35). The purpose of the fund
will be to provide an annual award, in memory of Dr. Miller, to a
graduate student who has done outstanding work in pure mathematics.
It is expected the award would be in the shape of a volume containing
an appropriate book plate and suited to the mathematical taste of the
recipient. who would be chosen by a committee within the department.
It was further provided that should the size of the fund so warrant.
the committee might also make a similar award to an undergraduate
student in the College of Engineering who has done outstanding work
in mathematics. The gift was accepted with appropriate thanks, and in
accordance with its terms and conditions.
Leave of absence. with pay. on account of illness was voted to
Assistant Professor Paul N. Bukovsky of the Department of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing. The leave is for the period from
February 8 to April 5. 1943 (p. 192).
Leave of absence. without pay. was voted to Professor Elmer D.
Mitchell from January 20. 1943. to January 19. 1944. This leave is in
view of the commissioning of Professor Mitchell as a Lieutenant
Commander in the Navy, on which duty he reported January 20.
The appointments of Dr. Francis Randolph X. Byron and Dr.
Forest Dewey Dodrill as Volunteer Residents in Surgery. without
salaryv were canceled (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 967). Each was then appointed Resident in Surgery for the period from January 1 to June
30, 1943. with compensation of $528.22 each, for the period.
The term of appointment of Beatrice E. Fisk to the Executive
Committee of the School of Nursing was extended through June 30.
1943 (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 890).
The Board approved the traveling-expense vouchers of Regent
Herbert, covering his attendance at the meetings of November 12
and December 18, in the amount of $128.87.
The Board increased the salary of Raymond R. Garlough, Acting
Assistant Chief Accountant, Business Office, from $2,400 a year to
S2.800 a year, twelve-month.basis, beginning February 1, 1943. This
'action added $166.66 to the Salary budget of the Business Office
for the balance of the present fiscal year.




JANUARY MEETING, 1943


197


The Board directed that the following expression of the sentiments
of the Regents be recorded in the Proceedings:
Mrs. Esther Marsh Cram was appointed a member of the Board of Regents
of the University of Michigan on September 30, 1929. and was elected in 1935
for the term ending December 31, 1943. She was still serving this term when,
for reasons of health, she felt herself obliged to resign the position entrusted to
her by the citizens of the State which she had so ably filled. She is the first
woman to be a member of this Board and was its senior member in length of
service at the time of her retirement. Her colleagues believe it eminently ap-'
propriate at this time to express formally their high regard for Regent Cram
and for the quality of her services as a Regent. As an alumna of Michigan,
the interests of the institution, and particularly those of its women students,
were close to her heart, and her loyalty and sense of responsibility led her
to devote much time and energy to active participation in the councils of the
alumnae, the Michigan League, and the women's residences. The Regents caime
to rely upon her for advice and leadership in such matters, even as they prized
her good judgment and co-operativeness in all discussions of University policy.
Her native fineness of spirit, her unfailing serenity and dignity have been a constant source of inspiration. Her colleagues hereby collectively, as they already
have individually, express their deep sympathy for Regent Cram in the physical
affliction which has brought about her retirement from the Board. and they have
unanimously adopted this memoir to constitute a permanent and public recognition of her achievements in the service of this institution as a member of its
governing board.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote except in the
case expressly recorded.
The Board adjourned to Thursday, February 18, at 9:30 A.M.


SHIRLEY W. SMITH, Secretary




February Meeting, 1943
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, FEBRUARY 18, 1943
The Board met in the Regents' Room at 11:50 A.M.
Present, the President, Regent Lynch, Regent Kipke, Regent
Bishop, Regent Connable, and Regent Herbert. Absent, Regent Shields,
Regent Crowley, Regent Cook, and Superintendent Elliott. There
were also in attendance Provost Stason, Vice-President Yoakum, Dr.
F. E. Robbins, Mr. H. G. Watkins, and the Secretary.
The Secretary placed on file the usual financial reports.
The minutes of the meeting of January 29 were approved as submitted to the members in press proof with certain minor changes as
reported by the Secretary.
Dr. Harley A. Haynes, Director of the University Hospital, appeared and discussed with the Regents certain hospital problems
growing out of so-called Acts 158 and 283, and the administration
of these Acts by the Crippled Children Commission. As representatives
of several groups of citizens of the state, interested in various features
of the care of crippled and afflicted children, are now studying revision of these Acts, the Regents postponed any action on the problem
until the work of this committee, to the end of eliminating troublesome and burdensome features of these Acts, should progress further.
It was understood that the President might appoint a Regents' committee of one or more members to confer with Dr. Haynes from
time to time and to keep the Regents advised of developments (R.P.
1939-1942, pp. 770, 688, and 372).

Personnel (p. 191).
A proposal for an increase in salary in the personnel of the University News Service was postponed for consideration in connection
with the budget.
The title of Miss Dorothy Markham, A.M., was changed from
Secretary, Museum of Art and Archaeology, to Assistant to the Director of the Museum of Art and Archaeology, with increase in salary,
twelve-month basis, from $1,350 per year to $1,500 per year, effective

of the Museum of Art and Archaeology.
The status of Perry L. Sisson, whose title has been Handyman,
Malaria Research Project, at $100 per month, was changed to Watchman, Malaria Research Project, at $150 per month, beginning January
1, 1943., This change is due to very considerable increase in time required of Mr. Sisson to comply with an order from the Government
that a guard be on duty at the laboratory at all times. The money
required for this change in compensation comes from project funds
and does not increase the budget.
Leaves of absence were voted as follows:

The University Committee on Honorary Degrees, by its secretary,
Dr. F. E. Robbins, placed before the Regents recommendations for
honorary degrees to be conferred at the Commencement exercises,
May 29, 1943. In accordance with established policy (R.P. 1939-1942,
p. 585) these recommendations are to lie on the table until the next
succeeding meeting of the Regents (p. 111).
Vice-President Yoakum discussed with the Regents a further report
upon the project for University of Michigan Undergraduate Scholarships for Michigan high schools on the University list. Final action
on this proposal was postponed to the succeeding meeting (p. 195).
The Regents received a communication from Dean A. C. Furstenberg of the Medical School pointing out the necessity for greatly improved and enlarged facilities required by medical students in the
Department of Obstetrics. The President was requested to designate
a committee of the Faculty to work out a developed plan of postwar
construction, including order in which recommended buildings should
be erected, with such special attention as might be possible to the
needs of the medical students and of this class of patients in the
Hospital (R.P. 1936-1939, p. 553).
Expendable funds which have accumulated in the Alfred A. Dunton,
Jr., Fund, to a total of slightly less than $500 (R.P. 1936-1939, p.
237) were authorized to be drawn upon by the Medical School for any
of the following purposes: lectureships, scholarships, fellowships, equipment and research, publications, and travel incident to scientific study
and research.
The Board directed that the degree of Bachelor of Science in
Engineering (Electrical Engineering) conferred February 26, 1925,
upon Roger Berry Kellogg should hereafter be recorded and treated
"As of the Class of 1923" (R.P. 1923-1926, p. 552).
The Board declined, under the general rules governing determination of residence for purposes of registration, to permit Tames T.
Harper to register as a resident of Michigan (p. 143).
The Board approved the request of Professor John B. Waite of
the Law School that he be allowed to serve as Compliance Commissioner for District No. 11 of the War Production Board, with the
understanding as proposed by Professor Waite that such compensation as he receives from the Government will be paid over by him
into the general funds of the University. This service will presumably
be rendered on an average of one day per week, and Professor Waite
will continue to carry his regular teaching load.
The following gifts were received and accepted in accordance with
their terms and conditions and with the thanks of the Regents:
From Mr. James B. Nelson, Indianapolis, Indiana, $6,562.50 for the James B.

Mechanism    and Engineering Drawing for the spring term         1942-1943,
with salary of $1,000 for the term. This sum was added to the budget.
The Board directed that the following memorial to Professor Albert
Becker Peck be incorporated into the record:
Albert Becker Peck, a graduate of Syracuse University in 1914, and a
recipient of the graduate degrees Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy, in
1915 and 1925 respectively, from the University of Michigan, began his service
on our faculty in September, 1914, as Assistant in Mineralogy. In 1916 he became
an instructor, and, save for the years 1917-1920 when he was a member of the
staff of the U. S. Bureau of Standards, his name has constantly appeared on
the iaculty roll, with successive advances in rank until the honor and responsibility of a full professorship in Mineralogy was assigned him at the beginning
of the year 1942-43. His ability as a teacher and scholar amply justified the
confidence thus shown by the University. His researches in ceramics, in the
optics ot mineralogy, and on the effect of heat treatment upon the structure
of minerals led to numerous publications, and he was an officer and active member of Sigma Xi. the Mineralogical Society of America, the American Ceramic
Society, and the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters. His death,
on February 13, 1943, is lamented by many who had prized his friendship and
respected his scholarly attainments; it removes a valued member of the Universitys faculty. The Regents of the University of Michigan have adopted
this memoir of the late Professor Albert Becker Peck as a permanent indication
of their appreciation of his achievements and services, and they extend to his
survivinL family their deepest sympathy with them  in their loss.
The Board directed that the following memorial to Mr. Harry
Andrill Tillotson be incorporated into the record:
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend their deepest sympathy
to the surviving family of the late Harry Andrill Tillotson, whose death occurred
on February 14, 1943. Mr. Tillotson's long service to the Board in Control
of Intercollegiate Athletics was characterized both by the display of unusual
ability and by utter loyalty to this University. The fairness, patience, and even
temper with which he consistently dealt with thousands of alumni and other
citizens during his twenty-two years of service as Ticket and Business Manager
of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics were most helpful in maintaining this phase of the University's public relations. There are countless
faculty members, officers, and former students of the University, and hosts of
friends in this and other states, who have come to know him in his official
capacity. who will mourn the sudden loss of one for whom they had long entertainedI feelings of genuine respect and affection.
In order to provide for increased enrollment in the Department
of German, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the Regents
appropriated $650 as compensation for teachers to be appointed to instruck three additional sections during the spring term of 1942-1943.
The sum of $900 was added to the Salary budget of the Department of Philosophy, and Dr. John T. Daling was appointed Instructor
in Philosophy for the spring term of 1942-1943 with compensation
of $1,000 for the term.
The traveling-expense voucher of Regent Herbert for attendance
at the meeting of January 29 was approved in the amount of $64.35.
The Secretary reported that in accordance with authority specifically
lodged with the Emergency Committee at the January meeting                (p.
175>. the following degrees and       certificates are to be recorded as

2. Setting aside all the balance of the trust estate after payment of expenses in connection with the current accounting as a trust fund for the payment of the annuity to Marcia Prendergast, provided in Article Seventh, 2 (b)
of the decedent's will, and for the payment of the annuities to her children after
her death.
3. Any excess income over and above the amount required to provide such
annuities shall be paid each year three-fourths to the Regents of the University
of Michigan, and one-fourth to the Trustees of the Field Museum.
4. After the death of Marcia Prendergast, as each one-fourth portion of
the trust estate becomes available through the death of a child of Marcia Prendergast, that one-fourth shall be paid or distributed, three-fourths to the Regents
of the University of Michigan, and one-fourth to the Trustees of the Field
Museum.
The Trustees of the Field Museum have already agreed to the settlement herein recorded, subject to the approval of the Surrogate's Court

into between the undersigned, Grace J. Nelson, and the Regents of the University
of Michigan, dated December 23, 1942, this letter is written for the purpose of
stating that at the time of the execution of said Trust Agreements, it was the
intention of the undersigned donors thereunder that at no time during the administration of the Trusts created by said Trust Agreements should The Regents
of the University of Michigan be subjected to any liability for shrinkage or
decrease in the value of any of the securities from time to time comprising the
corpus of the respective Trusts created by said Agreements, nor should The
Regents of the University of Michigan be subject to any liability by reason of
225

FIRST APRIL MEETING, 1943


said Trust Agreements for any loss sustained by the corpus of the respective
Trusts created thereby, except that such loss be occasioned by the wilful action
or gross negligence of The Regents of the University of Michigan, its agents
or employees.
It was further the intention of the undersigned donors that The Regents
of the University of Michigan as donee under said Trust Agreements should not be
subjected to any obligation to pay out of its own funds any assessments for taxes,
either Federal or State. that might at any time be legally levied against either the
corpus of said Trusts or the income therefrom, and that in the event of such
assessment of taxes against the corpus or income of said Trusts, said Donee shall
be entitled to pay said taxes as will be legally determined, out of income or out
of principal in case the income should be insufficient therefor.
It was further the intention of the undersigned Donors that The Regents of
the University of Michigan as Donee under said Trust Agreements, shall be
under no obligation to determine the legality of any tax levied by any taxing
authority against the corpus or income of either or any of the said Trusts. The
Donors, however, reserve the right to be notified by the Donee of the assessment
of any such tax and the opportunity, upon their own motion and at their own
expense, to determine the legality of any such assessment or assessments, and
in the event the Donors decide to contest the legality of any such assessment.
the Donee shall not pay said tax until the question of the legality thereof shall
be fully determined, and the Donors shall reimburse the Donee for any interest
or penalities charged upon said tax assessment during the period of said contest.
This statement is given as a statement of the intention of the donors under
said Trust Agreements existing at the time of the execution of said Trust Agreements.
The undersigned, Julia Jean Nelson Rudd. joins in this statement in confirmation of her understanding of the intention of the donors under said Agreements, as herein expressed.
If the foregoing statements of the intention are consistent with your understanding of the intention of the donors at the time of the execution of said
Agreements, will you kindly cause the enclosed copy of this statement to be
signed by your duly authorized officers?
Very truly yours,
James B. Nelson

The Board approved a second course in Basic Science Training for
Nurses (p. 175). Contributions from the United States Public Health
Service. the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, and the several hospitals sending nurses here for training are expected to cover direct operating
expenditures of the course. In case these funds are insufficient the
Board authorized an appropriation of not to exceed $5,000.
On recommendation of the Chairman of the Henry Russel Award
Committee, the Regents voted the award for the present year to Dr.
Carl A. Moyer, Assistant Professor of Surgery         (R.P. 1939-1942. p.
923).
The Regents approved for a trial period of two years, 1943-1945
the establishment of a University of Michigan Center in the city of
Grand Rapids, under the general supervision of the University Extension Service. It is anticipated that the Center will be housed in a
building of the Grand Rapids Junior College. The estimated budget for

227


the Center for 1943-1944, $24.070, is to be included in the budget of
the University for that year, as finally prepared. The total of these
expenses will be reduced, it is estimated, by $10.000 in student fees.
making a net cost of $14,070.
The Board considered the request of the Michigan Council of Defense to provide for a second year a faculty member to serve at the
University's expense in the activities of the Council (R.P. 1939-1942.
p. 971). The Regents laid this request upon the table indefinitely.
The Board requested the Budget Committee and the Faculty Personnel Committee to prepare the budget of the University for the year
1943-1944 within the estimated income of $7,990,384 (exclusive of the
University Hospital) with a suitable margin for contingencies.
After discussion it was voted that no honorary degrees be given
during the present calendar year. Regent Shields and Regent Lynch
voted no on this action (p. 209).
The Board voted to defer for further consideration the proposed
additional undergraduate scholarships (p. 209).
Within certain specified limitations, and excluding academic, official,
and clerical personnel, the Vice-President and Secretary, in consultation
with other interested officials. was authorized to make immediate adjustments in pay as present circumstances might require.
The following actions, down to and including special appointments
in the School of Dentistry. payable from    the Kellogg Dental Postgraduate Trust fund (p. 241), had been acted upon following the failure
of a quorum at the meeting called for March 26. by the Emergency

The Secretary placed on file copy of certain clauses from        the will
of the late Dr. Robert L. Morse. of Norwalk, Ohio, a member of the
University medical class of 1902. Dr. Morse's will, in which he gave
his wife. Dora E. Morse, and two others, namely, Ottie G. Morse and
Roberta Dombart, life interests in his estate, further provided that
upon the death of these life beneficiaries the residue of his estate becomes payable to the Regents to constitute
a loan and scholarship fund, for the benefit of needy and promising students
in the Medical Department of said University of Michigan; and I further
direct and provide that said loan and scholarship fund shall be used by said
Regents for loans to needy and promising students in said Medical Department
an( in such manner and by such means as to said Regents may seem       fitting
and proper; and that if in any one year any part of said fund remains unused
for loan purposes, then such part of said fund as so remains may, in the year
next following, be used for scholarship purposes in said Medical Department by
said Regents; and I further provide and direct that. as loans to said promising
and needy students are repaid, with such interest as may be charged by said
Regents. said loans, with the accumulated interest, shall go into said loan and
scholarship fund. from which withdrawals are to be made by said Regents solely
for the financial aid of needy and promising students in said Medical Department.
and in such manner and by such means as to said Regents may seem fitting and
proper. Said Regents shall not be required in any event or under any circumstances to account to any court or tribunal for the control of said trust estate.
The will further provides that
Upon the expiration of fifty (50) years from said delivery, then said trust
in said Regents shall terminate and thereupon and thereafter the entire corpus
of said residue and remainder of my estate shall be available for such purposes
exclusively in the lMedical Department of said University as the Regents thereof.
in the exercise of their sound discretion, may deem fitting and proper.

The sum of $200 was added to the Salary budget of the Department
of Physics to permit employment of additional stenographic service
during the remainder of the present University year.
The sum of $600 was added to the Current account of the Bureau

The sum of $2,600 was appropriated to cover the cost of printing
the tenth edition, in 5,000 copies, of Michigan Trees (R.P. 1929-1932.
p. 343). This expense will ultimately be reimbursed, it is expected. by
sale of the books.
The Regents authorized acceptance of approximately eighty Naval
officers to be sent here by the Navy Department for postgraduate instruction in naval architecture and marine engineering. Appropriate
arrangements will be made under which the Federal Government will
meet the expense involved.
The following resolutions were adopted for the record, having been
already approved by a mail vote as of March 13:
Resolved, That a ration bank account, or accounts, as defined in General
Ration Order No. 3, be opened and maintained in the name of this Corporation
with Ann Arbor Bank or one of its branches, which bank shall act as an
agency of and under the direction and supervision of the Office of Price Administration and shall be responsible only to the Office of Price Administration;
that any one of the following officers or employees of this Corporation; VicePresident and Secretary, Controller and Assistant Secretary, Assistant Purchasing

FIRST APRIL MEETING, 1943

effective at once.
The Regents approved sale of a number of duplicate pamphlets
and newspapers by the Clements Library for the sum of $246. While
the sale of duplicates from the Clements Collection is disapproved in
the terms of the deed of gift, it was the opinion of Dr. Randolph G.
Adams, Director of the Library, that the language of the deed of gift
did not contemplate transactions so obviously of advantage to the
Library as the present one; in fact it was stated that Regent Clements
had during his lifetime made similar sales. The present action of the
Regents is not to be regarded as a precedent for future transactions
without express approval of the Board in each such case.
In view of the induction into the Army of Mr. Dwight L. Gadbery.
who for approximately eight years has lettered the University's diplomas, the Regents authorized the Vice-President and Secretary to
employ others including appropriate members of the Faculty who are
qualified and willing to letter diplomas and to pay them the usual compensation therefor.
Dean Yoakum placed on file for the Office of Educational Investigations its report with respect to the so-called Special Service Positions
within the University. The Regents approved the report and authorized the preparation of such rules and procedures as would give effect
to the recommendations.

their terms and conditions and with the thanks of the Regents (p. 227):

Second April Meeting, 1943


UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, APRIL 30, 1943
The Board met in the Regents' Room at 2:05 P.M.
Present, the President, Regent Herbert, Regent Connable, Regent
Bishop, Regent Shields, and Regent Kipke. Absent, Regent Crowley,
Regent Lynch, and Superintendent Elliott, and the Vice-President and
Secretary. There were also in attendance Provost Stason, Vice-President Yoakum, Dr. F. E. Robbins, and the Assistant Secretary.
The minutes of the meeting of April 8 were approved as submitted
to the members in press proof with certain specified changes.
Dr. Harley A. Haynes, Director, and Dr. Albert C. Kerlikowske,
Assistant Medical Director of the University Hospital, appeared before
the Board to discuss the labor situation as it is now affecting the
Hospital. Dr. Kerlikowske reported two possible sources of male help,
namely, conscientious objectors now in custody of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation who have refused to register for the draft, and the
American-born Japanese now confined in camps in various parts of
the country. The discussion with respect to the possibility of Japanese labor was not confined to the Hospital alone, but included the
possibility of employment in other departments of the Campus where
such labor is necessary and not now available. The Regents gave
approval to the Hospital authorities to investigate fully both proposed
sources of labor and use their best judgment as to what course to
follow.
Approval was given to the proposal by Dr. Harley A. Haynes that
during the present emergency he might arrange with personnel in the
University Hospital who are entitled to thirty-one days' vacation to
spend actually only two weeks of that period on vacation and to serve
the rest of the period carrying out their usual duties, with the understanding that for the period of their vacation during which they are
on duty they are to receive salary in addition to vacation allowance.
The Secretary placed on file the usual financial reports.
A fact-finding and study committee to work with the Educational
Policies Committee in the formation of a plan to select and adequately
follow up scholarship students who may be selected on the proposed
plan for undergraduate scholarships for high schools on the accredited
list of the University in this State (p. 227) was constituted as follows:
Clark Tibbitts, Chairman, Dr. Theophile Raphael, and Dr. Wilma
Donahue. Further consideration of the plan will be given at a later
meeting when more definite rules for selection, and follow up during
the period of attendance at the University, have been formulated.
The portrait by Makielski of Alfred H. White, Professor of Chemical Engineering, who retires from active duty as a member of the
Faculty on May 29, 1943, was accepted with thanks to the donorshis friends and former students (R.P. 1939-1942, p. 873).

The Regents approved the recommendation that Associate Professor
Cleo Murtland, of the staff of the School of Education, who will reach
retirement age on May 23, 1943, be given the title of Associate Professor Emeritus of Education and that her formal retirement be as of
June 30, 1943. This date is fixed rather than that of May 29, 1943,
because Professor Murtland's work in vocational education, which is
carried on for the most part in Detroit, does not end until June 30
although the University's spring term ends on May 29.




SECOND APRIL MEETING, 1943


261


The following resolutions were adopted:
WHEREAS, Associate Professor Cleo Murtland, of the School of Education,
will attain the age of seventy years on May 23, 1943, and will then become
eligible for retirement under the provisions of the Bylaws of the Board of Regents,
and
WHEREAS, Professor Murtland, a recognized authority in her field of Vocational Education, a keen student of humanity, and one who, in her personal
relationships, has won the good will, respect, and affectionate regard of colleagues
and students alike, has for the past twenty-four years contributed importantly to
the University's efforts to bring its services directly to those people of the State
who are engaged in carrying on its industries, therefore be it
Resolved, By the Regents of the University of Michigan, that the title Associate Professor Emeritus of Education be conferred upon Professor Cleo Murtland
on and after May 29, 1943, in recognition of her long years of distinguished
and valuable service to this institution, and be it further
Resolved, That the Regents express to Professor Murtland their deep appreciation for all that she has accomplished, their felicitations, and their good
wishes to her for the future, and that they cordially invite her to avail herself
of all the courtesies and privileges customarily extended to emeritus members of
the University Faculties.

The President reported with deep regret the death of Dr. Norman
Rudolph Kretzschmar, Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which took place in Ann Arbor, May 5, 1943. The following resolution was adopted and ordered placed in the record:
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby record the
great loss which the University has sustained by the sudden death, at the age of
only thirty-nine years, of Dr. Norman Rudolph Kretzschmar, Associate Professor
of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and express to Dr. Kretzschmar's family their
heartfelt sympathy. An alumnus of the Medical School of this University in the
Class of 1926 and since that time one of its faculty, Dr. Kretzschmar, as a
scholar, a teacher, and a practitioner, had already accomplished much and gave
promise of long continued distinction in his chosen field of medical science. His
presence added prestige to our Medical School and Hospital, and the abrupt
termination of his distinguished and useful career has caused deeply felt and
sincere grief to the many students, alumni, patients, and professional colleagues
who had good reason to regard him with affectionate respect and admiration.




ANNUAL MEETING, 1943


299


The following memorial to the late Franklin M. Cook was adopted
by the Board and ordered placed in the record, and the Vice-President
and Secretary was directed to transmit a copy to Mrs. Cook (p. 256):
The death of Regent Franklin Mead Cook has brought to his colleagues of
the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan deep and sincere sorrow.
During the years of his service upon this Board they have prized their friendship
with him. There was in Franklin Cook a rich store of the traditional American
sturdiness of character which manifests itself in scrupulous honesty, self-respect,
and consideration for others, which endows its possessor with strength, and which
makes him a source of strength for his friends. These qualities, together with
the ability to deal wisely with practical affairs, Regent Cook brought with him
into public office. His native capacities, increased by many years of experience,
his faculty for understanding men and their motives, and the universal respect
with which he was regarded, made him a superior Regent; to have been associated
with him through the years in the deliberations of the Board was an unforgettable
experience for each and every one of his colleagues. To Mrs. Cook and her
family the Regents of the University of Michigan express their heartfelt sympathy,
and in appreciation of their former colleague, as a public servant and as a friend
ever to be borne in affectionate remembrance, they have adopted this memoir
and have made it a part of their official records.
Routine appointments, all within the budget, were approved as
follows (p. 261):

for the Library without the necessity for competitive bidding, which would
inevitably entail such delay as to defeat the purpose of this Resolution.
3. That all other heads of libraries at the University of Michigan be notified
of the existence of such duplicate material, and that such material be held for
their examination for a period of one week before being otherwise disposed of.
The Board adopted the following statement as a substitute for the
second and third sentences of the paragraph in the Proceedings of the
annual meeting of June, 1941, page 665, setting up the duties of the
Research Committee for the Museum of Art and Archaeology:
The duties of the Research Committee of the tMuseum of Art and Archaeology
shall be specifically limited to devising and administering plans for the study,
with a view to publication, of the University's archaeological materials from the
Mediterranean lands and the Near East, including the papyrological and ancient
palaeographical collections; to the acquisition of similar materials; and to the
promotion of archaeological excavations in those regions.
It shall be the policy of the committee to permit access to all materials in the
collections for purposes of study and of publication to such members of the
University staff and student body, regardless of departmental affiliation, as are
competent to make such use of them, subject only to such restrictions as are
necessary for the safeguarding of valuable University property.
The committee shall control the use of unpublished materials in the collections by persons not connected with the University.

Faculty, referred to the Committee on Educational Policies by the
President on April 8, 1943. The committee presented its report in

duties as Assistant Professor of Political Science at the end of two
years was referred to the Educational Policies Committee for recommendation. The committee recommended that Dr. Cuncannon be given
a concluding appointment for two years, at his present salary, plus
the blanket and automatic increases to which he is entitled, and that
during the first year of such appointment he be assigned to the teaching of courses other than the basic course in political science, with
special emphasis on extension work. During the second year of the
appointment it is suggested that Dr. Cuncannon be given leave of
absence, with pay, in order to pursue his work on publications which
he has begun and to allow him an adequate opportunity to establish
other connections. Regent. Connable signed the report with the understanding that he might at his discretion file a supplementary report.*
The Board approved these recommendations.
The Board again considered the question of the establishment of
scholarships for the high schools of this State now on the University
accredited list. The Committee on Educational Policies recommended
acceptance of the scholarship plan in accordance with the program
outlined by the committee specially appointed by the Regents at their
meeting on April 30 to make plans for this project; the administration
of these scholarships is to be under the direction of Mr. Clark Tibbitts,
Administrator, Dr. Theophile Raphael, Technical Director, and Dr.
Wilma Donahue, Assistant Technical Director, with the assistance of
an advisory committee and a special technical committee, in cooperation with the Alumni Association and under the supervision of the
President. The Board approved this recommendation, which, it will
be observed, is different in some respects from the recommendations
made by the Committee on Educational Policies at the meeting of May
28 (p. 288).
As voted by the Board at the meeting of May 28, 1942 (R.P. 1939 -1942, p. 968), a list of all assistant professors and instructors whose
terms of appointment are currently expiring, with an indication of the
terms for which reappointments are recommended and the length of
such terms, as well as cases in which reappointments are not recommended and cases in which so-called concluding or terminating appointments are recommended, was filed. It is understood that in future
years it will be necessary only to indicate cases of demotion, termination of appointments, and nonrenewal of appointments, with reasons for
the action recommended.
The following gifts were received and accepted in accordance with
their terms and conditions and with the thanks of the Regents (p.
308):
From Mr. Justin R. Whiting, New York City, $200, Mr. George J. Burke, Ann
Arbor, $100, and Mr. Charles B. Belknap, Toledo, Ohio, $100 to establish the
Class of 1907 Law Scholarship and Loan fund. These constitute the nucleus
of the fund, to which it is expected further contributions will be made from
time to time either in cash or in pledges.
* Regent Connable presented and read the supplementary report at the meeting of July 30,
and it is filed with the Committee's report of the present meeting.

work in the respective universities, and

No appropriation is necessary as this fellowship is provided in the

On recommendation of the committee representing the Deans'
Conference on matters concerning scholarships, the Board voted that
the income of the Arthur C. Tagge Scholarship fund (p. 268) be used
to provide scholarships for students in the College of Architecture
and Design to be selected by the Faculty of that college through its
Committee on Scholarships; that the applicants to be eligible shall
have been in residence for at least one semester and shall have demonstrated unusual aptitude and ability in architecture, design, or landscape
architecture, and that applications shall be made to the Dean of the
College on or before March 1 of each year. Further, the number and
amounts of the scholarships to be awarded are to be determined within
the funds available by the Scholarship Committee of the college, and
the first scholarship shall be offered for the year 1944-1945 after the
income for the intervening year has been received.
The Board approved a program for the training of Latin-American
students in forestry and wood technology in the School of Forestry
and Conservation (p. 268) under the following terms and conditions:
1. The University of Michigan will offer 20 tuition fellowships for a period

2. The Department of State, through the Division of Cultural Relations, will
provide transportation and maintenance for the equivalent of 10 men for one
year (three terms), subject to renewal for an additional term provided appropriations for the purpose are available. This contribution is estimated at approximately $20,000. Grants for maintenance will be limited to a maximum of
$100 a month and will be adjusted to the needs of individual students.
3. The Department of State will proceed at once to acquaint our missions
in all of the other American republics with the project with the request that
it be given publicity through the press, educational institutions, and otherwise,
and applications for fellowships invited.
4. All applications will be reviewed by the local selecting committees of the
Institute of International Education, with special reference to the candidate's
ability and personality; previous training and experience, which should include
graduation from a recognized institution; reading and speaking knowledge of
English; and plans for future use in his own country of the training to be received.
5. Final decision as to the individuals to whom fellowships will be offered
will be made by the University of Michigan in consultation with the Institute
of International Education and the Department of State.
The following gift was accepted with thanks to the donor (p. 319):
$500 from the National Committee on Maternal Health, New York City, for
the Maternal Health Research fund, for the period from June 1 through
August 31, 1943, under the direction of Dr. Norman F. Miller (p. 277)
The Board referred to the Finance and Property Committee with
power the questions involved in any plan of payment of academic
salaries under the budget for 1943-1944.
The following memorial was incorporated in the record (p. 289):
By the sudden death, on May 26, 1943, of Edwin Myron Baker, Professor
of Chemical Engineering, at the age of fifty years, the faculty of the University
of Michigan has sustained the loss of a distinguished teacher and scholar who
had contributed greatly to the reputation and prestige of his department. His
connection with this University had covered a period of 25 years, and in that
time, by natural aptitude and hard work, he had established himself as one of the
country's leading authorities on electroplating, a fact evidenced by his election
to the presidency of the American Electrochemical Society. The extent of Professor Baker's contributions in this field is shown by the many books and papers
published by him; he was also instrumental in bringing about the use of
chromium plating by modern industry. Neither his long-continued research nor
his relations with the industry which gave them practical application, however,
prevented Professor Baker from giving generously of his time to his students,
nor from participating actively and co-operatively in the efforts of his college
to improve its own methods for the education of young engineers. Those who
worked with him and came to know him well appreciated to the full the fine
character of this modest, gifted, and industrious man and have been deeply
affected by his untimely death, which came at a time when he was on short
leave from his teaching duties in order to participate in important war work.
The Regents of the University of Michigan hereby record their appreciation of
Professor Baker's great services to this institution, and convey to his surviving
family their deepest sympathy for their bereavement.
Traveling-expense vouchers of Regent Herbert for attendance at
the meeting of the Educational Policies Committee on May 27 and the
annual meeting on May 28, in the amount of $82.64, were approved.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to meet on call of the President.
HERBERT G. WATKINS, Assistant Secretary

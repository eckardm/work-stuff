Kennedy, Baits, Connable, and Herbert, and Superintendent of Public
Instruction Taylor. There were also in attendance Vice-Presidents
Niehuss, Pierpont, and Lewis, Mr. A. L. Brandon, Mr. E. A. Walter,
and the Secretary.
The minutes of the meeting of June 11, as submitted by the Secretary, were approved with certain specified changes.
The Board confirmed and ratified the actions of the Regents,
sitting as a Committee of the Whole, on June 25, 1954, as follows:
The Regents convened as a Committee of the Whole at 10:00 A.M. at the
Inglis House. Present, the President, Regents Eckert, Bonisteel, Stevens, Doan,
Kennedy, Baits, Connable, and Herbert. There were also in attendance VicePresidents Niehuss and Pierpont, Mr. E. A. Walter, and the Secretary. Absent,
Mr. Arthur L. Brandon.
In accordance with the authorization delegated to him by the Regents at their
meeting on November 20, 1953 (R.P., 1951-54, p. 1174), the Vice-President in
charge of business and finance reported that he has been able to provide suitable
quarters at 927 South Forest Avenue for the project to be administered by Dr.
Theodore M. Newcomb, who will conduct a sociological experiment, funds for
which have been provided by the Rockefeller Foundation (R.P., 1951-54, p. 1213).
The Committee approved leave of absence to Dr. Otto Laporte, Professor of
Physics, for the University year 1954-55, to accept an appointment as scientific
attache in the American Embassy in Tokyo, Japan (p. 45).
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance advised that on or about
July 13 bids will be received for the construction and rehabilitation of Couzens
Hall (R.P., 1951-54, p. 1375). It is understood that the project cost will be
approximately $1,950,000, to be financed by a bond issue. The National Bank of
Detroit has agreed to purchase bonds in the amount of $850,000 and the Mutual
Benefit Life Insurance Company of New Jersey will purchase the balance. The
formal resolutions and trust agreements will be presented to the Regents at their
meeting on August 6 (See Appendix).
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized to accept
the bid of the lowest responsible contractor and to award the contract, so that
work on the project may be started as soon as reasonably possible.
On recommendation of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, the
appropriation for Elmer Gedeon Scholarships was increased from $15,000 to
$20,000 for the University year 1954-55, with the understanding that the individual scholarship may not exceed the sum of $1,500. The Regents approved this
arrangement with the understanding that before any further increases are proposed,
either in the total amount available for Elmer Gedeon Scholarships or in the
amount of individual scholarship awards, a general review of the problem be presented to the Regents for consideration.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized to make
an official request to acquire a building on the east side of the Willow Run
Airport which has heretofore been used by the U.S. Air Force in carrying on
research conducted by the Packard Motor Car Company and later by Smith,
Hinchman and Grylls, both of Detroit. It is hoped that this building, and approximately twenty-three acres of what is at present government property, may be
acquired by the University for the use of its research activities.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized to negotiate with the trustees of the Kresge Foundation in order, if possible, to acquire

Dr. Harold M. Dorr, Director of the Summer Session, notified the
Regents that Camp Killarney has been permanently abandoned, and
that University affairs in that vicinity will be completely closed out in
the course of the current calendar year. Dr. Emerson F. Greenman,
Curator, Division of Great Lakes, Museum of Anthropology, and Associate Professor of Anthropology, submitted a final report for the period
from 1938, when this project originated by a research grant from the
Rackham Board, to the present time, indicating the number of students
involved and the results which have been gained. The report appears
as Exhibit G of this meeting.
The Secretary filed a letter from Dr. J. Speed Rogers, Director of

Retirements:     The Assistant to the President reported that the following former
Academic  members of the faculty have reached the retirement age since the
meeting of June 11. The following memoirs were adopted for inclusion
in these minutes:
A. H. Lovell:     Alfred Henry Lovell joined the faculty of this University in 1911 as Instructor
Memoir   in Electrical Engineering. By that time he already had had a decade of practical
experience as assistant to engineers of various electric power companies in Canada
and the United States. From 1917 to 1919 he served at Fort Sheridan, Fort
Leavenworth, Fort Custer, and with the 310th Corps of Engineers in England and
France, and as Colonel of the Third Engineering Training Regiment at Camp
Humphreys, Virginia. On his return to the University, he became Professor of
Electrical Engineering. For the next eleven years he often acted as consultant on
electric power projects at the University, in the State of Michigan, and throughout
the United States. In 1930 he published his textbook, Generating Stations-Economic Elements of Electrical Design, which is now in its fourth edition. From 1930
to 1944 Professor Lovell was Assistant Dean of the College of Engineering, being
also Secretary of the College from 1933 to 1944. Upon his retirement from the
assistant deanship, he became Chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering. A fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineering, he was
Director of that body from 1932 to 1936 and its Vice-President from 1938 to
1940. For a number of years he served as faculty adviser to foreign students in
the Engineering College and also was a member of the Advisory Committee of the
Reserve Officers' Training Corps. In his forty-three years of service to the University, Professor Lovell has proved himself a clear expositor of a difficult subject,
a stimulating teacher, and a wise and effective administrator who is known to
many alumni for his fair and just decisions. As he now retires from active membership on the faculty after a long and honorable career, the Regents of the University
of Michigan express their profound appreciation to Professor Lovell and confer
upon him the title Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering and invite him
to avail himself of all the courtesies customarily shown to emeritus members of
the faculty.
H. W. Miller:      Having reached the age of seventy years on July 12, 1954, Henry Willard
Memoir   Miller, Professor of Engineering Drawing and Chairman of the Department of
Engineering Drawing, has become eligible for retirement under the provisions of
the Bylaws of the Board of Regents. Professor Miller, who is completing his
thirty-third year of service at the University of Michigan, was at the University
of Illinois from 1909 to 1917. There he was in charge of the Department of
General Engineering Drawing and was Assistant Dean of the College of Engineer

ing from 1912 to 1917. For the next four years Professor Miller made extraordinary contributions to the military effectiveness of his country. In 1917 he was
President of the Academic Board and organizer of the United States Army School
of Military Aeronautics. By 1919 he had become Lieutenant Colonel of Ordnance,
Chief Engineer and Chief of the Technical Service on All Heavy Artillery of the
Expeditionary Forces. He is now Colonel in the Ordnance Reserve Corps. The
War Department published, in 1919, his book Erosion of Guns, in 1920 and 1921
his two-volume work on Railway Artillery, in 1923 American Seacoast Artillery,
and in 1926 Mobile Artillery. Four years later his volume entitled The Paris Gun
appeared. These books brought him an international reputation. He was decorated
Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, was awarded the Purple Heart, and was cited
by General Pershing for services rendered the American Armies. For many years
Professor Miller acted as Chairman of the Scholarship Committee of his College
and helped hundreds of students in their adjustment to academic life. The Regents
of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound thanks Professor Miller's
contributions to the University and confer upon him the title Professor Emeritus
of Engineering Drawing and invite him to avail himself of all the courtesies that
are customarily extended to emeritus members of the faculty.
Robert Gordon Rodkey first became a member of the faculty of this Univer-  R. G. Rodkey
sity in 1914, the year he earned the A.B. degree from the College of Literature,  Memoir
Science, and the Arts. The A.M. and Ph.D. degrees he earned successively at this
University in 1915 and 1928. Professor of Banking and Investments since 1928,
Professor Rodkey has been continuously associated with the University since
1914 except for a period from 1917 to 1923 when he was Associate Professor of
Accounting at Washington University (1917-18), Director of Personnel at the
Chase National Bank, New York (1918-21), and Acting Professor of Economics
at Tulane University (1922). His clear analysis of his subject drew many students
to his classes. He is well known as an authority on banking and brought to his
classes his own experience as a banker and as a bank director. For many years
he was a faculty representative on the Finance Committee of the University of
Michigan Union. He served as consultant for the Michigan State Banking Department and for the Securities Exchange Commission. In 1918 he was Captain in the
Statistics Branch, General Staff, of the United States Army. His books include
The Banking Process, Legal Reserves in American Banking, and Sound Policies
for Bank Management. The Regents in granting Professor Rodkey's request that
he retire one year before his seventieth birthday, express to him their thanks
and their congratulations, confer upon him the title Professor Emeritus of Banking and Investments, and invite him to avail himself of all the courtesies that
customarily are accorded to emeritus professors.
The President reported the deaths of three members of the faculty,        Deaths
William Platt Wood, Professor of Metallurgical Engineering, on July
12; Theodore Ernest Raiford, Instructor in Mathematics, on July 14;
and John Alexander, Professor of Surgery, on July 16. The following
memoirs were adopted for inclusion in these minutes:
The loss of William Platt Wood, whose death occurred most suddenly at his  W. P. Wood:
office July 12, 1954, is one which is deeply felt by the University of Michigan, Memoir
by his many associates in the professional circles in which he was active, and by
his countless friends in the faculty, among the students, and in the Ann Arbor and
Ypsilanti communities. Professor Wood, a Michigan alumnus, came to the University after earning the B.Pd. degree at the Michigan State Normal College at
Ypsilanti in 1909, and after teaching science and mathematics the following year
at the high school in Stafford, Kansas. At the University he successively completed the requirements for the A.B. degree, the B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering, and the M.S.E. degree in the same field. From 1914 to 1917 he was a member
of the faculty of the Michigan State Normal College at Ypsilanti, in the Department of Chemistry. For the next two years he was Supervisor of Materials for
the United States Bureau of Aircraft Construction, in Detroit. He joined the
faculty of the College of Engineering in 1919 and rose through the several ranks
until in 1931 he became Professor of Metallurgical Engineering. Professor Wood
was a member of the American Society for Metals, the American Foundrymen's
Society, and the American Society of Engineering Education. He was co-author of
two books, Pyrometry, and Unit Operations. He regularly contributed the results
of his researches and technical investigations to the journals in his field. These
articles were often reports of studies he undertook for industrial concerns through
the Engineering Research Institute. Professor Wood's reputation as an expert in




44


AUGUST MEETING, 1954


the field of Metallurgical Engineering was recognized by the frequent invitations
he received to appear as a witness in patent and other types of litigation. The
Regents of the University of Michigan share the grief of Professor Wood's many
friends and extend to the members of his surviving family their heartfelt sympathy.
T. E. Raiford     The Regents of the University of Michigan express their deepest sympathy
Memoir to the members of Dr. Theodore Ernest Raiford's family and mourn with them his
death, at the age of sixty-four years, which occurred July 14, 1954. Dr. Raiford,
who joined the faculty of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in 1923,
earned the Bachelor of Science degree in 1914 at Earlham College. The A.M. and
Ph.D. degrees he earned in 1923 and 1933 respectively at the University of Michigan, and he served as Instructor in the Department of Mathematics for thirty-one
years. Before coming to the University, Dr. Raiford taught from 1919 to 1923
at Purdue University. He was cost accountant for the McDougall Kitchen Cabinet
Company from 1918 to 1919 and acted as actuarial consultant from time to time
throughout his teaching career. Dr. Raiford was an inspiring teacher of undergraduates and is remembered by them for his clear presentation of his subject and
for his personal interest in their academic success. The Regents by this memoir
record their sorrow at Dr. Raiford's death and condole with his family in their
bereavement.
J. Alexander:    The death of Dr. John Alexander on July 16, 1954, at the age of sixty-three
Memoir   years, has taken from the University and from the world a great medical mind
and a renowned surgeon. Dr. Alexander was born February 24, 1891, in Philadelphia, and attended the Episcopal Academy and Chestnut Hill Academy in Philadelphia before entering the University of Pennsylvania. There he earned the B.S.
degree in 1912, the M.A. degree in 1913, and M.D. degree in 1916. As an undergraduate he was active in athletics, in literary publications, and in class affairs.
He won the Botany Prize in 1910, the French Prize in 1911. His work for the
master's degree was in the field of English Literature. As a medical student he won
the Undergraduate Medical Association Prize in 1913, the Professor of Obstetrics
Prize, the Frederick A. Packard Prize "for the greatest proficiency in the course
in internal medicine," and the Spencer Morris Prize "for passing the best examination for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine." Dr. Alexander's war service was with
the French Army in 1916 and with the American Army, in the United States and
in France, from 1917 to 1919. He was First Lieutenant and Captain in the
United States Army Medical Reserve Corps. In 1918 he completed a postgraduate
course at the University of Pennsylvania in Neurological Surgery. The following
year at the Universite de Lyon he received Certificates in Surgery and Anatomy.
From 1928 to 1931 Dr. Alexander pursued postgraduate studies in thoracic
surgery at Paris, Lyon, Berlin, Hamburg, and London. His first resident appointment was at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in 1917. After one year
(1919-1920) as Assistant Instructor in Surgery and Assistant to the Professor of
Clinical Surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, he joined the faculty of the
University of Michigan Medical School, rising quickly from Instructor to Professor
of Surgery by 1932. From 1920 to his death Dr. Alexander was Surgeon-inCharge, Section of Thoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery in the University
Hospital. At the time of his death he was also chief surgeon at the Michigan State
Sanatorium at Howell, Michigan, and consulting thoracic surgeon to seven other
Michigan hospitals as well as to St. Luke's-in-the-Desert at Tucson, Arizona, the
Edwin Shaw Sanatorium, Akron, Ohio, and the Franklin County Sanatorium,
Columbus, Ohio. He was a member of the editorial board of the Journal of
Thoracic Surgery and of the American Review of Tuberculosis, was editor for
thoracic surgery of the International Abstract of Surgery and was honorary member of the editorial board of The Punjab Medical Journal. Dr. Alexander held
membership in eighteen medical associations and societies, including the American
Board of Surgery, the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, the American
College of Surgeons, the American Trudeau Society, Sociedad Argentina de
Cirujanos, Societe Internationale de Chirurgie, and the Society of Clinical Surgery.
In 1925 Dr. Alexander was awarded the "Quinquennial Samuel D. Gross Prize"
for his essay, History, Present Practice and Proposed Reforms of the Surgical
Management of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. In 1941 he was the recipient of the
Trudeau Medal of the National Tuberculosis Association. At the University of
Michigan he won the Henry Russel Award in 1929 and was named to the Henry
Russel Lectureship in 1944. The Surgery of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and The
Collapse Therapy of Pulmonary Tuberculosis are books that pioneered in their
field. His monographs and articles number more than one hundred. When it is
realized that much of Dr. Alexander's work was done at times when he himself




AUGUST MEETING, 1954


45


was recovering from tuberculosis, the magnitude and brilliance of his accomplishments assume even truer proportions. He was withal anxious and most happy to
counsel with his patients and their families. His students have carried his theories
and his techniques throughout the world. As his disciples they will always remember his inspiration, his great professional skill, and his profound understanding
of his fellow human beings attacked by illness. The Regents of the University of
Michigan express to the members of Dr. Alexander's family their deepest sympathy
and mourn with thousands of his friends their great loss.

AUGUST MEETING, 1954


That the life and works of Professor Ermine Cowles Case may be a source
of inspiration to future students, and that his memory may be perpetuated on the
University of Michigan campus, The Ermine Cowles Case M\emorial Fund is to be
raised by popular subscription and set up to provide annually for:
(a) The Ermine Cowles Case Memorial Lecture.

duly authorized, in writing, at the main office of the Trustee, in Detroit,
Michigan; which registration shall be endorsed by said Trustee on the

Dormitory Revenue Bond so registered may be transferred on the
books of the Trustee by the registered owner thereof, or his attorney
thereunto duly authorized, in writing, which transfer shall be endorsed

authorized attorney and noted by the Trustee on the bond; but the
bond may be discharged from registration by being in like manner
transferred to the bearer, and thereupon transferability by delivery
shall be restored; and such bond may again, from time to time, be

such reserve, up to a maximum of 1% of the cost of the building and
10% of the cost of the furnishings and equipment, out of such excess.
The Obligor further covenants and agrees that if in any one year
the Net Operating Income derived from the operation of the dormitory,
prior to making any payment to the reserve fund as provided for in
this section, shall be insufficient to meet its obligation to the Trustee
and the payment to the said reserve fund, then, in that event, all or
any part of the amount set aside or to be set aside for the Maintenance

and Equipment Replacement Reserve for that year shall be made available to meet the principal and interest payments to be made to the
Trustee hereunder; it being the intent of the Obligor that the payments
to be made to the Trustee in any one year shall have priority over
any payment to be made to the Maintenance and Equipment Replacement Reserve in said year.
Section 5. ANNUAL PAYMENT OF REMAINING NET INCOME. The
Obligor covenants and agrees that on or before October first of each
year, beginning with October 1, 1956, it will pay to the Trustee any
balance of Remaining Net Income derived from the operation of the
dormitory (whether operated in whole or in part) for the preceding
fiscal year, not previously paid to the Trustee.
Section 6. OBLIGOR TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE DORMITORY. The
Obligor covenants and agrees as follows:
(a) That it will, as soon as the dormitory shall be wholly completed, furnished, and equipped, at all times keep the same in operation
while the University is in session, except during the summer session,
when it may be operated or closed, in the discretion of the Obligor; and
that it will at all times charge and use its best efforts to collect rates
for rooms and board sufficient to produce net income, as herein defined,
sufficient to meet all payments to be made to the Trustee herein provided for, including the maintenance of the reserves herein set forth;
(b) That it will, if necessary to meet the payments to be made
to the Trustee herein provided for, including payments for reserves,
adopt such reasonable rules, regulations, and requirements relative to
the residence of students attending the University of Michigan as shall
be necessary to assure that the dormitory will be as fully occupied
during the regular scholastic year as is reasonably possible.
Section 7. INSURANCE. The Obligor covenants and agrees that it
will, when the dormitory is placed in operation, out of revenue derived
from the operation thereof:
(a) Pay the premium necessary to provide standard form fire and
supplemental coverage insurance (except damage due to riot and civil
commotion) upon the dormitory in an amount at least equal to the
face value of all Dormitory Revenue Bonds outstanding hereunder.
Provided that in case the face value of the Dormitory Revenue Bonds
outstanding shall be greater than the insurable interest in the building,
then the Obligor shall insure the same to its insurable value.
(b) Pay the premium necessary to provide standard form fire and
supplemental coverage insurance (except damage due to riot and civil
commotion) upon the contents of the dormitory, in an amount equal
to their full insurable value.
(Note: The term "supplemental coverage," as used in the preceding
paragraphs (a) and (b), shall mean and include insurance against loss
from smoke, windstorm, hail, explosion, and aircraft and vehicle damage.)
(c) Pay the premium necessary to provide rental value insurance
and/or business interruption insurance for the dormitory in a principal
aggregate amount which shall not be less in any one year than the
annual payments to be made to the Trustee, as herein provided in
said year.

insurance on the dormitory herein designated shall be deposited with
the Trustee and it shall have a first lien on all payments made on the
same, up to, but not to exceed the face value of all Dormitory Revenue
Bonds outstanding. In case of loss, the Trustee shall apply the proceeds
of said insurance to the repair and restoration of the building and the
contents thereof, wholly or partially destroyed, to its or their former
condition, or in such other manner as will make the building usable or
tenantable, to the satisfaction of the Trustee and the Obligor. Provided,
however, if in the judgment of the Trustee, the funds received from
said insurance policies or otherwise shall be insufficient to make the
building suffering such loss usable or tenantable, then, in that event,
the Trustee may hold the funds paid to it by reason of such loss for
the benefit of the holders of all Dormitory Revenue Bonds and the
retirement thereof.
Section 8. OBLIGOR MAY USE OTHER FUNDS TO REDEEM BONDS.
In making any payments to the Trustee herein provided for or for
the purpose of retiring by redemption or otherwise any Dormitory
Revenue Bonds, issued hereunder, the Obligor reserves the right to use
any funds in its possession which it may legally appropriate for that
purpose.

derived from the operation of the dormitory, the actual expenses for
operation, administration, insurance, ordinary maintenance, and ordinary repairs to building and equipment during the preceding fiscal year,
the amount paid in to the Maintenance and Equipment Replacement
Reserve, the net amount in said Reserve, and the Remaining Net
Income earned.
The report shall be certified by an independent Certified Public
Accountant selected by the Obligor and approved by the Trustee.
The Obligor further agrees to permit the Trustee to examine at
any convenient time all of its books and records relating to the operation of the dormitory.
The Obligor agrees that it will pay for and cause to be made any
and all reasonable audits requested by the Trustee, and it will employ
such Certified Public Accountant or Accountants in making such audits
as the Trustee shall designate.
The Obligor agrees that it will furnish to the Trustee such additional
information as shall be requested from time to time.
Section 10. TRUSTEE TO HAVE FIRST LIEN. The Trustee shall
have a first lien on all Net Operating Income derived from the dormitory from and after the date when said dormitory shall be placed in
operation, in part or wholly, and on the income from the investment
and re-investment of funds held in the Debt Service Reserve, as herein
authorized; and the Obligor hereby assigns and pledges to the Trustee
all of said Net Operating Income and said income from investments as
security for the payment in accordance with their terms of all bonds
to be issued hereunder.
The Obligor covenants and agrees that it will not make any assignment of, or pledge, or create any encumbrance on, the Net Operating

Income of the dormitory covered by this Agreement, which shall be
effective while any of the Dormitory Revenue Bonds issued hereunder
are outstanding. Provided, however, that the Obligor shall at any time
have the right to pledge, assign, encumber, or otherwise deal with said

shall not become enforceable prior to the payment of the bonds issued
hereunder, both principal and interest, or affect the rights of the
Trustee or the holders of said bonds, in any manner.

agreement contained in this Trust Agreement or in any Dormitory

of any indebtedness hereby authorized shall be had against the State of
Michigan, the Obligor, or any member or officer of the Obligor, individually; it being expressly understood and agreed that the Dormitory
Revenue Bonds issued hereunder are secured by and payable only
from Net Operating Income as herein defined, and that no other liability
whatsoever shall attach to or be incurred by the State of Michigan, the

or other instrument which this Agreement may require or permit to be
filed and executed by the bondholders may be in any number of concurrent instruments of similar tenor, and may be filed or executed by

action or for any other remedy hereunder or relating thereto; it being
understood and intended that no one or more holders of bonds shall
have any right in any manner whatever, by his or their actions, to

all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had, and maintained in the manner herein provided and for the equal benefit of all

defaults complained of by the Trustee shall have been cured, and it be

Memorial Fund  total sum of $200 from Professor Emeritus John F. Shepard and former
Associate Professor Martha Guernsey Colby of the Department of
Psychology, which, together with $68.25 originally subscribed by colleagues and friends of Professor Pillsbury, is to establish a fund as a
memorial to Walter Bowers Pillsbury, Professor of Psychology and
Chairman of the Department of Psychology, who retired some twelve
years ago (R.P., 1942-45, p. 10). Of this amount, $50 is to be credited
to the expendable portion of this fund as an award "to a senior student
for excellent work in experimental psychology under conditions to be set
up by the Department of Psychology" for-the University year 1954-55.
The amount of 68.25 from the fund originally established at the time of
Professor Pillsbury's retirement, together with the amount of $150
mentioned above, will constitute the endowment portion of the fund.
It is expected that there will be further contributions as additions to the
endowment portion of the fund from former students and colleagues of
Professor Pillsbury.

The Regents accepted, with sincere thanks, a check for $100 from
Mr. and Mrs. Milton Toporek of Ann Arbor to establish the Ellen H.
Toporek Memorial Award, to be presented, for the time being, at least,
in the amount of $50 annually "to the senior student nurse exhibiting
in general a high degree of excellence and aptitude in her nursing duties,
and in particular possessing those essential attributes of love, warmth
and understanding which are so important for successful pediatric nursing." It is suggested by the donors that the selection committee include
the Director of the School of Nursing as well as senior members of the
medical staff of the Department of Pediatrics and graduate nurses directly concerned with the training of student nurses on the pediatric wards.
It is hoped by the donors that further contributions to the endowment
fund of $50 here established will in time be sufficiently large to provide,
in interest, the $50 award.
Routine appointments, all within the budget, were approved as follows (p. 16):

OCTOBER MEETING, 1954

The President reported the retirement of Frank Egleston Robbins,
Ph.D., on September 9, 1954, and of Orlando W. Stephenson, Ph.D., on
August 19, 1954. The following memoirs were adopted for inclusion in
these minutes:
Frank Egleston Robbins, whose seventieth birthday fell on September 9, 1954,
has had, since his appointment in 1921 to the post of Assistant to the President, more
various kinds of duties, responsibilities, and associations on behalf of the University
than any administrative officer other than the President himself. A graduate of
Wesleyan University with the degree of A.B. in 1906, followed by the A.M. degree
in 1907, he was Latin Master at the Fessenden School in West Newton, Massachusetts, until 1908, when he continued graduate study at the University of Chicago
until he received the Ph.D. degree in 1911. There he also was Fellow in Greek from
1909 to 1911; and from 1911 to 1912 Assistant in Greek. For the next eight years
Dr. Robbins was successively Instructor and Assistant Professor of Greek in our
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. In the three decades during which he
was Assistant to Presidents Burton, Little, Ruthven, and Hatcher, he helped to
initiate scores of changes that have shaped the University's continual growth. He
often formulated the exact steps of changing procedures, and frequently was appointed
to guide new committees. The Senate Council. the Committee on University Lands
Used in Instruction and Research, and the Committee on University Archives are
cases in point. He pioneered the activities now followed in the University Scholarship
Committee. His assignments with the Conference of Deans, the University Calendar
Committee, the Committee on Honorary Degrees, and the Committee on Commencement Procedure, he managed without friction and with general satisfaction to the
many parts of the University community that were affected. He developed an art of
his own in the writing of official communications, including faculty memoirs, resolutions, and citations. They were done in perfect prose, combining clarity, variety, and
elegance. In his avocation of water-color painting he has also shown his appreciation
of line and color. With such talents and such a marked skill in the use of language,
he was the natural choice as Director of the University of Michigan Press. The
strength he built for the last twenty-one years into this phase of University activity
will always endure, as will his many contributions as Consulting Editor of the
University of Michigan Encyclopedic Survey. Dr. Robbins has edited the Michigan
Alumnus Quarterly Review from 1950 until the present time and will continue his
editorship for another year. In his hands the Quarterly Review has kept the distinction it won under Wilfred B. Shaw and has added new luster to its pages. The Regents
of the University of Michigan record their sincere gratitude for the notable and
characteristically unselfish service of Dr. Frank Ealeston Robbins to the University
and confer upon him the titles Assistant to the President. Emeritus, and Director
Emeritus of the University Press. They wish him long-continued enjoyment of the
leisure now afforded him and cordially invite him to avail himself of all the courtesies
customarily extended to emeritus members of the faculty.
Thirty-eight years ago Orlando W. Stephenson, a graduate in 1908 of Michigan
State College with the degree of B.S. in Civil Engineering, and recipient of the M.A.
degree from the University of Chicago in 1915, came to the University of Michigan
as Assistant in History in the College of Literature, Science. and the Arts. In 1919 he
earned the Ph.D. degree in history at this University and became Instructor in that
subject. From 1925 to 1954 Dr. Stephenson was on the faculty of the School of Education, where he became Professor of the Teaching of History and Head of the
Social Studies Department in the University High School. Professor Stephenson has
shown extraordinary capacity to succeed in various kinds of activities besides teaching. These include bridge construction, farming, editing of historical material, playwriting, high school administration, detection of forged documents, and police administration. He served from 1939 to 1945 as Police Commissioner of Ann A-bor
and was Chairman of the Commission from 1942 to 1945. Although most of his
published work is in the field of social studies, including the volume Everyday
Economics, a Study of Practices and Principles (with C. C. Janzen), Dr. Stephenson
also has written articles on reading ability, teaching methods, and crime prevention.
In 1927 he wrote a history of the City of Ann Arbor under the title Ann Arbor, The
First Hundred Years. Dr. Stephenson has been a most active person throughout his
life, having traveled very extensively in all parts of the world in connection with his
study of police administration. He has been called upon frequently as an expert
witness with respect to questioned documents. Now that on August 19, 1954. Professor Stephenson has reached his seventieth birthday and has become eligible for
retirement under our Bylaws, the Regents of the University assure him of their deep
appreciation of his important service and extend to him their cordial felicitations and

College of.
L., S., and A.


On recommendation of the faculty of the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, the following resolution, adopted by that faculty
on May 13, 1953, with respect to requirements for the bachelor's degree
in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, was confirmed by the
Board:
Resolved, that all candidates for a bachelor's degree from this College shall
complete a fourth semester course in a foreign language, or display equivalent proficiency in an achievement test to be administered by the department concerned.
No student may automatically satisfy this requirement or any part of it by presenting entrance units in a foreign language. Students electing to qualify in a language
studied before entering college shall take a placement test to be administered by the
department concerned, and shall continue with credit, at the level indicated; except
that students who score at the fourth semester proficiency level on this test shall be
deemed to have satisfied the requirement.
It is understood that this requirement is to be effective for freshmen
entering for the first semester of the University year 1956-57, with suitable interim adjustments thereafter for students entering or returning to
the College with advanced standing.
On recommendation of the faculty of the College of Engineering, the
Regents approved the establishment of an undergraduate degree program
in science engineering, the supervision of which is assigned to the Science
Engineering Committee of the College of Engineering, under the chairmanship of Professor Robert R. White. It is understood that the program
will be inaugurated at the beginning of the University year 1955-56. The
requirements for the degree program providing for the degree of Bachelor
of Science in Engineering (Science) will be substantially as outlined
below:
A. The level of attainment in English, drawing, mathematics, chemistry and physics
described on page 18 of the College of Engineering Announcement for 1954-55.
It is expected that a high school graduate will usually fulfill this requirement by

On recommendation of the faculty of the School of Public Health,
the Regents approved the following two proposals leading to the degree of
Master of Public Health (Industrial Health):
1. As a means of identifying the holder of the degree in this specific field of
competence within public health, it is proposed that there be added to the degree an
appropriate and prominent subtitle indicating the student's concentration of work
in his curriculum. The degree and diploma would then read as follows:
"MASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH
(Industrial Health)"
2. It is proposed that this special degree designation be awarded to those students
in industrial health who elect a minimum of six credits of additional work in industrial health beyond the minimum of thirty credits required for the presently-offered
degree of Master of Public Health without special designation. The nature, scope,
and arrangement of the traditional course work will be prescribed by the Governing
Faculty of the School of Public Health. Students not electing the proposed additional
work will receive the Master of Public Health degree without special designation,
as at present.
Section 31.09 of the Bylaws, International Center for Foreign Students, was amended to read as follows:
Sec. 31.09 International Center for Foreign Students. An International Center
shall be maintained for the purpose of providing a place where foreign students and
other members of the University, both faculty and students interested in international
affairs, may meet for mutual acquaintance and the exchange of ideas. The Center
shall be in the charge of a Counselor to Foreign Students, who shall be appointed by
the Board of Regents on recommendation by the President. He shall bear the title
of Counselor to Foreign Students and Director of the International Center.
As Counselor to Foreign Students he shall be assisted, especially in the handling
of academic problems, by a Committee of Advisers to Foreign Students. This Committee shall consist of the Adviser to Foreign Women and other members of the
faculty to be appointed by the President from the various schools and colleges.
As Director of the International Center he shall be assisted by a Board of
Governors consisting of the Vice-President for Student Affairs, ex oflicio, who shall act
as chairman, the Dean of Men or his representative, ex officio, the Dean of Women
or her representative, ex officio,. and five appointed members, at least four of whom
shall be members of the University faculty, and three students chosen by the
President of the University from a panel of six who have been in residence at this
University for at least two semesters and who have been nominated by the House of
Representatives of the International Students Association, the three students to
serve for one-year terms. The appointed faculty members shall be designated by the
Board of Regents on recommendation by the President for terms of three years each,
the terms to be so arranged that not more than two vacancies shall occur in any one
year. (R.P., 1942-45, p. 817, 1945-48, pp. 726-27, 1948-51, p. 381, and 1951-54,
p. 1344.)
The Regents voted that beginning with the University year 1954-55
the stipend for the Henry Russel Lectureship shall be in the amount of
$700, and that for the Henry Russel Award in the amount of $350, and
that until such time as an endowment is established sufficient to provide
the additional funds needed, the required amount be taken from the
income of the Baird Endowment.

G. G. Brown:   On recommendation of the Research Club, the Regents confirmed
Henr Russel the appointment of Dean George Granger Brown as the Henry Russel
1954-55  Lecturer for 1955. It is understood that the announcement of this
appointment will be made in due course by the officers of the Research
Club (R.P., 1951-54, p. 1124).
Regents-Alumni   On recommendation of the Committee on University Scholarships,
Honor Awards:
Discontinued  the practice of granting Regents-Alumni Honor Awards was discontinued
by the Board (R.P., 1951-54, pp. 1172 and 48). 
B. K. Swartz   On recommendation by the Committee on Student Loans, the Blair
Memorial Loan
e  fund  K. Swartz Memorial fund, now an expendable trust fund for prizes and
student aid, was changed by action of the Board to a loan fund, available
to graduate students in the field of personnel administration, sociology,
social psychology, and psychology; "... the amounts and duration of
these loans to vary at the discretion of the Dean of the Graduate School.
It is hoped that this fund will be easily available to the graduate students,
and that a minimum of formal data will be required from each applicant."
V. Haller Memorial  On recommendation of the staff and officers of Huber House, South
Scholarship:
Expendable fund  Quadrangle, the Regents approved the transfer of the endowment portion
of the Vena Haller Memorial Scholarship fund, amounting to $470, to the
expendable portion of the fund, making a total of $489.61 available for
scholarship purposes (R.P., 1951-54, p. 755).
G. H. Benzenberg  On recommendation by the Vice-President in charge of business and
Scholarship fund finance, the sum of $28,304.72 was authorized for transfer from the income account to the investment account of the George H. Benzenberg
Trust fund (R.P., 1920-23, p. 16), so that the fund will now have a total
investment of $50,000. It is understood that the income received from
this investment will be allocated to scholarships to undergraduate students of the College of Engineering with the understanding that if at any
time the amount retained in the income account for student loans proves
inadequate, a portion of the $28,304.72 will be re-transferred to the
income account. The program for administration of the scholarships here
provided is to be the responsibility of the Dean of the College of Engineering.
Chemistry    The Regents approved a change in fees assessed against those students
Laboratory Feeswho are studying chemistry, and provided for a flat charge to be made
for each chemistry course. Under the terms of this arrangement the student would receive no refund, nor would he be billed for additional costs
except in very unusual circumstances. A schedule of fees or course charges
has been compiled on the basis of average experiences over a number of
years, and it is believed that the proposed change will not burden the student nor increase operational costs appreciably. This does not constitute
a change in University fee policy, but only a change in procedure, and is
to be effective at once.
Girlstown Board  The co-operation requested from the Regents, as expressed in the
Resolutions
Approved  following resolution of the Girlstown Board, was approved:
WHEREAS, We, the Girlstown Board, comprised of officers and elected members
of the Michigan State Federation of Women's Clubs, and professional and civic
leaders, having for the past three years considered ways and means of establishing a
much needed home for girls whose family problems are such that they cannot be
cared for in existing communities' facilities and are in need of corrective care; and
WHERE XS, The Michigan State Federation in convention assembled has previously inaugurated a continuing campaign of fund-raising as a means of accomplishing
the objective; and




OCTOBER MEETING, 1954

of facilities for housing a limited number of girls in a homelike atmosphere; and
(b) assist in the selection of trained personnel and in other ways participate jointly
with the Board of Directors of the Girlstown Board in the continuing operation of
this pilot unit.
The Regents approved the following budget of the Board in Control
of Intercollegiate Athletics for operating purposes for the fiscal year
1954-55 (R.P., 1951-54, p. 1139):
Sports activities, including equipment, game expense, etc........... $184,150.00
Administration, plant maintenance and operation................  164,300.00
Contingencies..............................................     15,000.00
Total.............................................. $363,450.00
The Regents instructed the executive officers to prepare the general
funds budget for 1955-56 in the total amount of not to exceed $29,921,394, based on a state appropriation to be requested from the Legislature of $23,903,394 and an estimated income from student fees and miscellaneous sources of $6,018,000 (R.P., 1951-54, p. 1077). The Regents
approved also a request to the Legislature for the operations budget of
the Veterans Readjustment Center in a total of $348,647, for the Neuropsychiatric Institute of $633,506, and for the Children's Psychiatric
Hospital of $883,955. In addition, the Regents approved a request for a

January 1 to June 30, 1955.
The petition of Commander M. C. Torian, USN, now residing in
Kalamazoo, for permission for his son Melvin to register as a resident of
Michigan, was granted.
A request from the Executive Board of the Annuitants Association,
presented by Professor Emeritus Henry W. Miller, chairman, was received by the Board and referred for further study and report to the
Vice-President in charge of business and finance.
The President reported the death of Frank Heath, Senator of the
Michigan State Legislature, on September 1, 1954. The following memoir
was adopted for inclusion in these minutes:
The loss of Frank Heath, Senator of the Michigan State Legislature from the
Twenty-fourth District, whose death occurred September 1, 1954, is one which is
deeply felt by the University of Michigan and by his many friends in the University
community. Coming to the United States from England in 1904 when he was
eighteen years old, he always showed a deep and serious interest in public education.
In his holding of public office as Bay County Treasurer, as a member of the City
Commission of Bay City, and finally as Senator from the Twenty-fourth District
from 1944 until his death, he labored constantly and consistently to extend the
benefits of higher education to the people of his State. Since he himself had been
denied such benefits at a time when he could best have taken advantage of them, he
was an outstanding e-ample of a man who of his own volition became a student of
history, of public affairs, and of literature. In understanding the ideals of education
and in striving to extend its boundaries, he developed his own mind and became
a truly cultured man. The Regents of the University of Michigan share the grief of
Senator Heath's many friends and extend to the members of his surviving family their
heartfelt sympathy.

of the State of Michigan, Principal, and NATIONAL BANK OF DETROIT, Agent,
for purposes of custody and management of the stock portion of the Principal's
Employees Retirement Fund. The account shall be called "THE REGENTS OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN-EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT FUND".
This Agreement applies to securities deposited with the Agent and listed on
separate deposit schedules, cash deposited hereunder or realized from securities, and

I.
The Agent is authorized and agrees as follows:
(a) To hold the assets to which this Agreement applies, using the same care in
the physical custody thereof as is required in the case of assets held by a trustee, and
to be responsible for the disappearance of all or any part thereof, unless such disappearance shall be the result of war, insurrection, disturbances of nature or other
catastrophes listed as exceptions under the standard form of bankers' blanket bond.
(b) To analyze, promptly upon their receipt by it, all assets deposited and thereafter, from time to time, to analyze the assets held hereunder and, upon completion
of such analyses, to report to the Principal its recommendations as to the sale or
other disposition of any of said assets and as to the investment of cash available for
such purpose.
(c) To execute the specific instructions of the Principal with respect to the sale,
exchange, investment, or other disposition of the assets held hereunder.
(d) To give receipts for income and principal received; to prepare, sign and

(e) To deposit the net income monthly in Principal's commercial account in the
National Bank of Detroit and forward duplicate deposit ticket to Principal.
(f) To furnish an inventory of the assets held hereunder annually as of June 30
in a form satisfactory to Principal's auditors and to furnish such other inventories
as may be required from time to time.
(g) To furnish a statement of cash receipts and disbursements monthly as of the
last day of each month to the Principal.
II.

name of its nominee or nominees, without the addition of any words indicating the
existence of the agency relationship, provided, however, that the Agent shall be
absolutely liable for any and all acts of said nominee. Unless it has received specific
instructions from the Principal, the Agent shall have no responsibility with respect
to proxies in connection with securities held hereunder. If so directed, the Agent
shall cause the same to be executed by its nominee or nominees.
IV.
The Principal agrees to pay the Agent as compensation for its services hereunder

$10,000,000 principal value of the account and one-twentieth of one per cent (1/20
of 1%) on the value in excess of $10,000,000. The fee shall be payable quarterly
and shall be based on the fair and reasonable value of the assets, including principal
cash, held on the last day of the preceding quarter plus a pro rata adjustment for
additional deposits to principal during the quarter.
The Agent is hereby authorized to pay all postage, insurance, transfer taxes,
and all other necessary and proper disbursements and expenses in connection with
the performance or termination of this Agreement and bill the University quarterly
for these expenses, except that expenses incurred in the normal course of collecting
income or principal shall be paid by the Agent.
V.

given by the Principal to the Agent hereunder shall be effective until received by the
Agent in writing, provided, however, that the Agent may at its option accept communication thereof by any other means and shall be fully protected in acting upon
any communication believed by it to be genuine.
The Agent shall act on instructions signed by such individuals as the Board of
Regents of the University of Michigan shall designate by resolution duly certified to
the Agent from time to time.
This Agreement may be terminated upon thirty days' (30) written notice by
either party. If any termination shall become effective on any date other than the
end of a quarter, fees for the period shall be pro-rated.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.

(a) Pay the premium necessary to provide standard form fire and supplemental
coverage insurance (except damage due to riot and civil commotion) upon the
apartments in an amount at least equal to the unpaid principal balance of this loan,
provided that, in case the unpaid principal balance of this loan shall be greater than
the insurable interest in the said apartments, then the University shall insure the

(b) Pay the premiums necessary to provide standard form fire and supplemental
coverage insurance (except damage due to riot and civil commotion) upon the contents of the apartments in an amount equal to their full insurable value.

herein designated shall be deposited with the Bank, and it shall have a first lien on

Bank and the University. Provided, however, if in the judgment of the Bank the
fund received from said insurance policies or otherwise shall be insufficient to make
the building suffering such loss usable or tenantable, then, in that event, the Bank
may hold the funds paid to it by reason of such loss and such funds shall be
considered and applied as balance of Net Operating Income.
Section 13.

The Regents accepted the commitment of the National Bank of
Detroit to purchase at par up to $600,000 of bonds issued to refund this
term loan upon the terms and conditions set forth, and the Regents
further agreed to purchase for its investment accounts or to sell to
others the remainder of the bonds necessary to refund this term loan at
or before maturity.
Messrs. Parker, Weston, and Williams, representatives of the National Bank of Detroit, and Mr. R. Gordon Griffith, Investment Officer,
appeared before the Regents to discuss the investment program for the
major endowment funds which has been in operation for approximately
two and one-quarter years (R.P., 1951-54, p. 1327). In general, the report
showed that the program has, as of September 30, 1954, brought the
total of common stocks up to 28 per cent of book values, and an increase
in rate of return from 3.17 per cent on April 30, 1952 to 3.63 per cent
on September 30, 1954. It was recommended by this committee, and by
the Vice-President in charge of business and finance, and approved by
the Regents, that a flexible monthly purchase program be followed during
the next few months to be adjusted for shifts in the levels of the market.
Further, the Board approved the addition to the approved list of common
stocks the common stock of five companies which had not hitherto
appeared on the approved list.
Regent Bonisteel suggested that on the occasion of the next visit of
representatives of the National Bank of Detroit to review the investment
program, the Regents meet the night before the regularly scheduled
meeting of the Board so that more time can be allowed for a proper
presentation.
The Regents authorized the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance to negotiate for the purchase of the property known as the Mud
Lake area (R.P., 1951-54, p. 1345). It is understood that the property
comprises approximately 255 acres of land which can be purchased for
$18,500. The land will be used by the School of Natural Resources and
the Division of Biological Sciences for scientific and teaching purposes;
this tract is the last available property near Ann Arbor of a unique bog
type. The purchase of the property by the Regents is contingent upon the
condition that mineral and oil rights are included in the deeds of sale at
no increase in price.
The Regents approved the recommendation of the Vice-President in
charge of business and finance that $8,667.37 of $47,076.21 of excess
employee contributions over costs for the Group Insurance Program for

the 17-month period ended June 30, 1954, be retained by the University
to cover the cumulative University contributions to date toward the
expense of this Program. The remaining excess of employee contributions over costs, amounting to $38,408.84, is to be refunded to those
employees who participated in the Program during this period and who
were included in the Program on June 30, 1954 (R.P., 1951-54, p. 855).
Committee on     The Regents referred again to the report of the Committee on Student
Student Governt  Government originally discussed at the meeting of the Regents on
ment: Student
Referendum  August 6 (p. 11), and authorized the students, under the supervision of
the Vice-President for Student Affairs, to obtain a general campus opinion
on this subject.
Resolution:    The Regents received from the Secretary of the Faculty of the College
Severance Pay
for H. C. Davis  of Literature, Science, and the Arts the following resolution adopted by
that Faculty on November 1, 1954 (p. 87):
WHEREAS, Dr. H. Chandler Davis was dismissed from his position as instructor
in this College, at a time when his contract still had one year to run,
WHEREAS, No charge of moral turpitude is involved in his case,
WHEREAS, It is the position of the American Association of University Professors,
expressed by its Secretary, that in such cases a financial settlement, to the amount of
one year's salary, is appropriate, and
WHEREAS, Dr. Davis's dismissal came less than three weeks before the beginning
of the current semester, and under such circumstances that it cannot fail to inflict a
special hardship on him and on his family,
Therefore Be It Resolved, That this body urges that the University pay Dr.
Davis one year's salary.
The Regents instructed the Secretary to notify the Secretary of the
Faculty of the College that careful consideration has been given to the
cases of Dr. H. Chandler Davis and Dr. Mark Nickerson and that they
have concluded that the circumstances of these cases do not warrant
severance pay.


Lawrence D. Bell
Scholarship
San Francisco Bay
Area Scholarship


The Secretary reported that on October 20, 1954, the Bell Aircraft
Corporation, Buffalo, New York, had proposed the tentative establishment for a trial period of a series of Lawrence D. Bell Scholarships in the
amount of $1,000 annually, to be awarded at the sole discretion of the
Scholarship Committee and the Admissions Committee of the College of
Engineering to an entering freshman beginning with the University year
1954-55. The award will be based on financial need and other general
qualifications such as scholarship, personality, and United States citizenship. Further, the donor desires that the entire sum be applied annually,
and there will be no objection if the money is apportioned to assist more
than one financially needy student. The Bell Aircraft Corporation would
prefer, but not require, that the recipient be selected from the western
New York area, and that the son of a Bell Aircraft employee should be
given preference, everything else being equal. Male students only are
eligible for this scholarship.
The Regents approved a proposal by the Golden Gate Chapter of the
Michigan Alumni Association to create the San Francisco Bay Area
Scholarship Fund, to provide scholarships for one or more students from
northern California. It is understood that this fund will be administered
in accordance with the established rules and regulations of the University
governing similar alumni scholarship funds. An initial contribution of
$100 to the fund was accepted with sincere thanks.




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1954

The Regents approved the proposal of Albert Kahn Associated
Architects and Engineers, Inc., Detroit, that beginning with the University year 1955-56 this sponsor will provide a stipend of $1,000 to be
awarded as a graduate scholarship for a period of five years to a student
of architecture in the College of Architecture and Design of the University of Michigan or another accredited school, who shall be appointed
by the Regents on recommendation of the faculty of the College of Architecture and Design. It is understood that the faculty will take into consideration in making their recommendations the ability and promise of
the applicant, and financial need.
The Secretary reported that the Rockefeller Foundation, by action of
its Executive Committee on October 29, 1954, has voted to provide up to
$28,000 to the University of Michigan for a program of American studies
in Kyoto and Japanese studies in Ann Arbor under the sponsorship of
Kyoto University, Doshisha University, and the University of Michigan.
This fund is for use during the period ending March 31, 1956, and
approximately $16,800 will be used for salaries and travel of personnel,
$3,000 for library purchases, $7,000 for support and travel of Japanese
scholars, and $1,200 for administrative expenses.
At the same time, an appropriation was authorized for funds for
Kyoto University for use during the same period for a program in
American Studies at Kyoto University under the sponsorship of that
University, Doshisha University, and the University of Michigan. The
Regents gratefully accepted this grant under the terms and conditions
submitted by the Rockefeller Foundation.
Regent Herbert's travel expense vouchers for attendance at the meeting of October 22 were approved.
Dr. Frederick H. Wagman, Director of the University Library, discussed with the Board the present program with respect to the proposed
Undergraduate Library which will presumably be constructed on South
University Avenue on the present site of the Automotive Laboratory.
The original cost of this proposed building, $2,650,000, has been increased
by the addition of space for an engineering library, thus increasing the
present estimate of the project cost to $3,680,000. The executive officers
were instructed to include this figure for the Undergraduate Library in
their program for capital expenditures to be presented to the State Budget
Office on or about December 1.
The Regents approved a recommendation to the Development Council of the University of Michigan to consider the possibility of obtaining,
by gift from an alumnus or from alumni, a fund the income from which
would provide for Oriental men the advantages which the Levi Barbour
Oriental Girls' Scholarship provides for Oriental women.
The Regents requested the executive officers to determine the insurance coverage now provided for athletes representing the University in
public appearances.
The Board voted to reconsider its action taken at the meeting on
October 22 (p. 204), at which time the practice of granting RegentsAlumni Honor Awards was discontinued.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1954


249


The Committee on Budget Administration reported its action taken
on November 24 as follows:
The committee approved the use of an amount not to exceed $2,400 from the
funds available to the Institute for Social Research, which, together with funds
now available in the budget of the Plant Department in the amount of $1,034,
will provide for the rehabilitation of Rooms B-25 and B-27 in the quarters now
occupied by the Institute, space which was formerly used by the Department of
Dermatology and Syphilology.
The Secretary filed a letter from Mr. Alan W. MacCarthy, Director
of the Development Council of the University of Michigan, in answer
to a request from the Regents for the Development Council to study the
problem of providing scholarship funds for Oriental men analogous to
those provided for Oriental women by the Levi Barbour Oriental Girls'
Scholarships (p. 245).
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance presented a
report of the needs for fire protection on several buildings on the
campus, as indicated by the State Fire Marshal's recommendations. The
total area of the buildings concerned is 480,922 square feet, and the
replacement cost, on the basis of $25 a square foot, would amount to
something over $12,000,000. During the next five years, however, fire
protection projects are to be carried out which will provide for enclosing
of stair wells, for fire doors, and for related work, which, if funds can
be provided, will during the five-year period entail the expenditure of
$1,211,830.
Pursuant to the decision of the Board to reconsider its action discontinuing the practice of granting University of Michigan RegentsAlumni Honor Awards (p. 245), the Vice-President for Student Affairs at
a meeting of the Michigan High School Principals' Association on Friday, December 3, brought the attention of that body to this matter.
He explained the concern of the Regents and various alumni groups with
respect to the discontinuance of the Regents-Alumni Honor Awards
program, but the principals voted that insofar as the interests of the
high schools are concerned, the granting of the awards should be discontinued. The Regents, however, instructed the Vice-President for
Student Affairs to continue the study of a plan to recognize at the end
of the freshman year those students from Michigan high schools who
have in their first year achieved outstanding academic records.
On December 8 and 9, 1954, the student body expressed its opinion
on the subject of the Student Government Council by a vote of 5,102
favoring it and 1,451 favoring the present structure of student government (p. 244). The Regents adopted the proposal for student government as approved by the student body in this poll, and suspended for a
two-year trial period Section 8.13, Committee on Student Affairs of the
Bylaws, and any other provisions of the Bylaws inconsistent with the
Student Government Council plan. In adopting the proposal and suspending the Bylaws for the two-year trial period, the Regents are acting
in harmony with their constitutional responsibilities for the management of all affairs of the University and with their inability to delegate
these responsibilities without also holding the right to appraise, modify, or
suspend said delegations and acts of their agents. The Vice-President
for Student Affairs was instructed to implement the new plan as soon
as feasible and, during the trial period, to make such progress reports to
the Regents as seem necessary and proper (p. 244).

L. M. Eich:    The President reported the retirement of Professor Louis Michael
Memoir   Eich on his sixty-sixth birthday, November 22, 1954. The following
memoir was adopted for inclusion in these minutes (R.P., 1951-54,
p. 1247):
The Regents of the University hereby express to Louis Michael Eich, Associate
Professor of Speech, upon the occasion of his retirement from active membership
in the University faculty, their sincere appreciation of his service as a teacher and
as an administrator who in his capacity of Secretary of the Summer Session was a
friend to thousands of teachers throughout the nation. Professor Eich, who earned
the A.B., A.M., and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Michigan, began his teaching in 1912 as an instructor at Knox College, Galesburg, Illinois. The following
year he taught English literature and composition at the Ann Arbor High School.
From 1914 to 1917 he was Instructor in Oratory at the University of Michigan.
Except for a year as an instructor in public speaking at the Ohio State University
and for a year's similar assignment at the Grand Rapids Junior College, Professor
Eich's professional life was completely identified with the University of Michigan.
From 1933 to 1948 he was Secretary of the Summer Session and played a significant
role in its growth. From 1935 to 1952, as Chairman of the Committee on University
Lectures, he showed extraordinary patience and tact in dealing with the problems
that inevitably confronted him. Because of continued ill health, Professor Eich a
year ago petitioned for retirement on his sixty-sixth birthday, November 22, 1954.
The Regents of the University of Michigan now extend to Professor Eich their
sincere thanks for his long and conscientious service and confer upon him the title
Associate Professor Emeritus of Speech and invite him to avail himself of all the
courtesies customarily shown to emeritus members of the faculty.
L. J. Carr,   On recommendation of the faculties of the departments concerned
H. W. Hann:  and the Executive Committee of the College of Literature, Science, and
Beginning of
Retirements the Arts, the Regents deferred the beginning of the retirement furloughs
Deferred  of Professor Lowell J. Carr of the Department of Sociology and Professor Harry W. Hann of the Department of Zoology to the end oT the
second semester of the University year 1954-55. These furloughs
would ordinarily begin at the end of the first semester of the present
University year.

of Arts with Distinction rather than the degree of Bachelor of Arts,
which was originally granted (R.P., 1951-54, p. 1381).
B.S. in Nursing:  On recommendation of the faculty of the School of Nursing, the
Degrees Conferred  degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing was conferred on the following:
Martha Cecil                        Emma Louise Tate
Lois Jean List                      Anne Willits
Architecture   On recommendation of the Committee on Budget Administration,
Building Plans:  the Regents, by unanimous call vote, approved an appropriation of
$10,000 to the account Construction Fund-Architecture Building Plans,
to provide funds for a preliminary study by the faculty of the College
of Architecture and Design of the building needs of that College during
the next ten-year period.
University Press:  The Regents, by unanimous call vote, on recommendation of the
Appropriation  Executive Committee of the University Press and with the approval of
the Committee on Budget Administration, approved an appropriation
of $10,000 as an addition to the salary budget of the University Press.
Further, the Regents voted that the income from the sale of James
Burrill Angell-An American Influence, by Vice-President and Secretary
Emeritus Shirley W. Smith, be deposited to the University Press Revolving Fund for the use of the Press.
Parking Policy    The Vice-President in charge of business and finance reviewed in
Approved  some detail the present facilities for parking cars on or adjacent to the
campus in the restricted and open lot areas. After some discussion the
Regents approved the general principle of charging for the use of the
present parking space by the installation of parking meters or by the
use of attendants of the lots, whichever seems more desirable in any
specific instance. The charges for space will be determined after further
study, when a report will be made to the Board. The Regents also approved the plan to use any amount collected, both in the campus and
Medical Center areas, excluding only the areas controlled by the Board
in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, for the building of parking structures, this being in general the principle followed by the City of Ann
Arbor parking plan. Several possible sites for parking structures were
suggested. The Regents will finally approve the exact locations, when
and if these structures are erected.
National Music    The Regents were advised that at present, with their approval, a
Camp Loan loan  in the maximum    amount of $100,000 has been authorized to the
National Music Camp at Interlochen (R.P., 1951-54, p. 1082). This
loan was approved as an investment of the Employees' Retirement




DECEMBER MEETING, 1954


269


Fund, and is for a period of five years with interest at 4 per cent and
annual payments on the principal. To date, a total amount of $96,000
is still unpaid, a principal payment of $4,000 having been made in April
of this year.
The National Music Camp has now requested that the loan be increased to a total of $150,000. The question of increasing this loan, as
explained by the Vice-President in charge of business and finance, was
presented to the Regents for discussion. The Regents authorized the
Vice-President in charge of business and finance to enter into an agreement with the National Music Camp, if an agreement can be reached
mutually satisfactory to the University and the National Music Camp,
by which the loan already made by the University and also the loans
made by two banks in a present total amount of $65,000 may be paid
within a reasonable period. Further, the Regents voted that a plan to
insure the buildings be studied, and that some restrictions be placed on
the management of the National Music Camp to prevent the borrowing
of any more funds from any source without the knowledge and approval
of the University.
The Regents accepted with thanks a partial payment made by the
Toledo Trust Company, the executor of the estate of Ray M. Mann,
'081, whose will has been offered for probate in Lucas County, Ohio.
This payment of $6,000 is to be used for the establishment of a fund
to be known as the Ray M. Mann Loan Fund for Law Students, "a loan
fund for needy students of the Law Department."
On recommendation of the President, the position of Assistant to the
Vice-President in charge of business and finance was created, the purpose being to provide the Vice-President with the services of an aide and
representative whose duty it will be to consider the function and possible sites of new buildings, and to co-ordinate the work of architects
and building committees during planning periods.
The Regents approved the recommendations of the Executive Committee of the Medical School to use the University's share of the estate
of Felicia Robbins. '99m, in the amount of $12,211.57 as a memorial to
Dr. Aldred Scott Warthin (R.P., 1948-51, p. 1260). It is understood
that this fund will be used to provide furnishings for a combined conference and seminar room in the Department of Pathology in the new
Medical Science Building, and that any unexpended residue will be retained in the trust fund for repair and renewal of furniture and, possibly,
as need may arise, for maintaining journal subscriptions. It is proposed
that a small plate or plaque, properly inscribed with the name of the
room and the source of the gift, be attached in some conspicuous place.
The Department of Pathology was authorized to draw upon this fund
for expenditures of the sort designated, subject to the usual University
procedures.
The present agreement between the University of Michigan and the
National Music Camp, approved by the Regents at their meeting on
September 24, 1949 (R.P., 1948-51, p. 506), was extended for a further
five-year period under the following terms and conditions:

courses at the National Music Camp be continued in the amounts of
$45 for residents of the state and $105 for nonresidents, with the understanding that these fees do not include membership in the Michigan
Union or the Michigan League or the privileges of the University Health
Service. The instructional fee for All-State students was fixed at $12.50
for each two-week session. This represents an increase of fifty cents for
the All-State group. It is understood that all the fees of the University
courses at the National Music Camp will be reviewed before announcements are published for the summer of 1956.
The National Association of Foreign Student Advisers was added to
the list of those organizations in which the University has membership
and toward which it pays annual fees. The fee in this case, of $10 a
year, is to be paid from the Current account of the Law School.
The petition of George Ilyas Haddad for permission to register as a
resident of Michigan was denied.

January Meeting, 1955
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR, JANUARY 21, 1955
The Board met in the Regents' Room at 2:15 P.M.
Present, the President, Regents Eckert, Bonisteel, Doan, Kennedy,
Baits, and Connable. Absent, Regents Stevens and Herbert and Superintendent of Public Instruction Taylor. There were also in attendance
Vice-Presidents Niehuss, Pierpont, and Lewis, Mr. A. L. Brandon, Mr.
E. A. Walter, and the Secretary.
The minutes of the meeting of December 17, as submitted by the
Secretary, were approved with certain specified changes.
The Board confirmed and ratified the action of the Regents sitting as
a Committee of the Whole on December 17, 1954, as follows:
The Regents convened as a Committee of the Whole following the formal
session of the Board, which ended about 4:00 P.M. on Friday, December 17. Present
at the meeting were the President, Regents Eckert, Bonisteel, Kennedy, and Herbert,
Regents Doan and Connable finding it necessary to leave. There were also in
attendance Vice-Presidents Niehuss, Pierpont, and Lewis, Mr. E. A. Walter, and
the Secretary.
The committee invited Mr. Cummiskey, University Attorney, to be present to
discuss the question which has arisen in connection with the settlement of the estate
of Alice B. Groesbeck (p. 162). Mr. Cummiskey expressed the opinion that the
chances of invoking the New York State statute with respect to the payment of
certain taxes involved in the settlement of this estate are practically nil. In his
opinion, under the provisions of the will it is clearly indicated that taxes should be
paid before the distribution of the estate to the residuary legatees. However; since
if objections are to be raised on the part of the Regents, the Board must file an
objection before Tuesday, December 21, the Committee agreed that an opinion
should be had from Mr. Lauren, a member of the New York firm which represents
the Regents in this matter, and on receiving his advice, the Vice-President in charge
of business and finance is authorized to settle the matter in a manner which in his
judgment is satisfactory to the University's interests.
The matter was again discussed with Mr. Lauren, who, in response to a direct
request for a recommendation, reiterated the statement contained in his letter of
December 4, 1954, and concluded that it was impossible for him to estimate the
chances of success of the proposed objections to the final account of the executor
because he was satisfied that Mrs. Groesbeck and the draftsmen of the will clearly
intended that the estate taxes should be paid out of the general estate. The revised
statement from Mr. Lauren was communicated to Regents Bonisteel and Herbert by
the Vice-President in charge of business and finance, and they agreed that no objections should be filed to the final account of the executor and directed the Vice-President to so advise Mr. Lauren and to report the action to the Regents for confirmation
at the next regular meeting.
The committee then considered the problem which has arisen with respect to
the revocable trust created by Eleazar Darrow, '92e, and agreed with the opinion of
Mr. Cummiskey and the Vice-President in charge of business and finance that no
appeal be taken from the decision of the Common Pleas Court of Hamilton County,
Ohio. Mrs. Darrow has filed a bill in the Common Pleas Court for Hamilton County,
claiming her statutory share in the trust fund as a part of the estate of her deceased
husband, as well as the right to the income for life from the remainder of the trust.
The court ruled that the widow, having elected to take under the statute rather than
under the will, is entitled to her statutory share of the revocable trust, but not to
the income for life from the remainder of the trust. The trust is to terminate and after
payment to the plaintiff of her widow's allowance and statutory share, the remainder
of the trust is to be turned over to the Regents of the University of Michigan for
the purposes stated in the trust agreement. If this decision is sustained by the
Regents, the University will receive approximately $13,000, and if the trustees'

position is maintained, the University will receive the corpus of the trust, approximately $28,000, after the death of the widow, who is now sixty-two years old.
Flint Junior   The committee requested the President to present to the Board for consideration
College:  a plan, satisfactory to the Regents and to the Flint Board of Education, under which
Co-operation  an agreement can be made for the co-operation of the University and the Flint
Agreement  Board of Education in operating the Flint Junior College on a four-year curriculum
basis. The President indicated that certain questions must be solved to determine
the University's long-range course relative to the possibility of the establishment of
University of Michigan centers in various localities in the state, and, further, that the
problem of creating the proper kind of relationship with the Board of Education in
Flint, by which a four-year college might presumably be administered, must be solved.
Because of the several questions involved, the committee requested the President
to report to the Board as soon as is feasible a plan by which co-operation in this
matter with the Flint Board of Education might reasonably be expected to be
successful.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance filed a report
of progress made on plant extension since the meeting of the Regents on
December 17.
Medical Science   Special attention was given to discussion of the first unit of the
Building:
Budget proposed Medical Science Building, which will provide for the activities
Approved  of the Departments of Pathology, Biological Chemistry, and Pharmacology, and of the School of Nursing. Dean Albert C. Furstenberg, Dr. Walter J. Nungester, Chairman of the Department of Bacteriology, and Miss
Rhoda F. Reddig, Professor of Nursing, Director of the School of
Nursing, and Director of Nursing Service, were present at the meeting to
answer questions and to discuss the needs of space for the basic science
departments. Mr. Lynn W. Fry, Supervising Architect, described the
proposed buildings with respect to their architectural features. The Regents approved a construction cost budget of approximately $7,000,000,
with the understanding that the estimated cost of equipment and furnishings, utilities, and architects' fees for this building will be presented to
the Board at a future meeting for discussion and action when these costs
shall have been determined.
The usual financial reports were accepted and placed on file.
Investment    The report on investment transactions, which was accepted and
Transactions  placed on file, is summarized below (p. 247):

The President reported the receipt of a gift of $1,000 to establish       Guatemalan
the University of Michigan Guatemalan Scholarship fund, to be admin-          Scholarship
istered under the following terms and conditions. This gift is from Oscar
R. Palomo, an employee of the General Electric Company, which, under
the agreement made with its employees, will match the gift made by
Mr. Palomo.
1. That the fund be administered by the Regents in accordance with the usual
procedure of the Regents in administering scholarship funds and with the assistance
of a committee to be composed of a principal officer of the International Center, as
chairman, and four other members to be named by the President of the University.
At present I would like Mr. M. Robert B. Klinger to serve as chairman.
2. That half of the income shall be added to the principal and not more than
half the income and never the principal shall be used for scholarships for worthy




282


JANUARY MEETING, 1955


students who are citizens of Guatemala, until such time as the annual income is
enough to provide a sufficient number of scholarships. The Regents, on recommendation of the committee, shall determine when there is a sufficient number of scholarships.
3. The number of scholarships granted, the amount of each scholarship, and
the recipient of such scholarship shall be fixed by the Regents upon recommendation of the committee.
4. In the selection of recipients of the scholarships, preference shall be given to
native-born citizens of Guatemala. However, rather than have any portion of the
income unused, the committee shall be authorized to recommend as recipients of
the scholarship native-born citizens of Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, or El
Salvador.
5. The committee shall attempt to find additional aid from outside the fund,
in the form of travel grants, or other grants, usually opened to scholarship students.
6. It is hoped that the Regents can assign to the Fund any monies matched to
my gift by the General Electric Company. The General Electric gift may be used
immediately for a scholarship for a Guatemalan student if the committee so recommends.
7. Any interested donor may make further contributions to this fund from time
to time.
It is desired that the donor remain anonymous except to the Regents
and other University officials and to interested officials of the General
Electric Company.
Buhr Foundation    The Board accepted with an expression of grateful appreciation a
Scholarship
Loan Fund  check for $5,000 from the Buhr Foundation to establish a scholarship
loan fund "for the use and benefit of upper class or graduate students
in any one of the following: mechanical engineering, mechanical design,
automatic machine tools and methods of control, particular consideration
to be given to sons and daughters of employees of Buhr Machine Tool
Company of Ann Arbor, Michigan.... It is understood that any loans
made from   this fund are to be paid back as soon as may be possible
after graduation and adequate employment by the recipient. It is further
requested that at the time of making a loan, a copy of the language of
this gift shall be given to the recipient thereof." It is understood that
the usual interest rate will apply to all loans made from this fund.
Buhr Foundation    An additional check for $5,000 was received with sincere thanks
Oriental Men  from the Buhr Foundation, establishing an endowment fund to provide
scholarships for Oriental men, "commemorating the memory of Joseph
F. Buhr, the founder of the Buhr Machine Tool Company, an Alsatian
by birth who came to this country and carved out an enviable career
here in his chosen field of machine tool multiple drilling, in which he
was one of America's pioneers.... He likewise believed it to be the
duty of industry to support a constructive program of international good
will, and this gift is made to set up a scholarship endowment fund to be
known as the Scholarship Fund for Oriental Men, with the understanding
that the general purpose of the fund is to follow the pattern of the Levi
Barbour Oriental Girls' Scholarship."
A. D. Krom     The Board accepted with an expression of sincere thanks to Mr.
Arthur D. Krom, Chicago, Illinois, a check for $2,000 to establish the
Eita Krom Endowment in memory of Mr. Krom's sister, Eita Krom,
who was a graduate of the Class of 1923, College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts. At present, Mr. Krom is not certain whether the fund here
established would be more serviceable as a scholarship to graduate
students in the Department of Sociology or to graduate students in the
School of Social Work. Within a year's time, however, he expects to




JANUARY MEETING, 1955


283


make this decision. If, however, by January 2, 1956, the decision has
not been made, the principal and any interest earned is to be added to
the principal of the Eita Krom Prize Fund (R.P., 1923-26, p. 31).
The Regents accepted with grateful appreciation a check for $2,000
from Miss Bernice Leland of Eugene, Oregon,' to establish the Winifred
B. Chase Fellowships for Botanical Exploration, to be administered under
the following terms and conditions:
1. This gift is to be in memory of Miss Winifred B. Chase, a loyal alumna of
the University of Michigan and former Professor of Botany and Adviser to Women
at Wayne University, and the appointments provided for are to be designated as
Winifred B. Chase Fellowships for Botanical Exploration.
2. The appointees are to be nominated by the Director of the Botanical Gardens
of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
3. It is the intention of the donor to provide for additions to the principal sum
by gifts or bequests from Miss Chase's many friends who knew her lifelong interest
in botanical exploration.
4. Since the objective of the proposed gift would be in some measure attained,
however small the income might be, if the fellowships were available for summer
travel of short duration and often within Michigan, appointments might be for as
short a period as a month.
5. The proposed appointments are designed to aid the research programs of
students in systematic botany, plant geography, and other phases of botany requiring
study in the field, in this country or abroad, or personal accumulation of plant
materials for garden, herbarium, or laboratory investigation in Ann Arbor.
6. The amount of each fellowship is to be set at the discretion of the Director
of the Botanical Gardens, and if in any given year the amount available as income
is insufficient for aiding any worthy project, the interest is either to accumulate and
remain expendable, or to be added to the principal, as may seem best.
7. Fellowships are to be granted to graduate students already working toward
degrees in botany, or exceptionally to undergraduates concentrating in botany at the
University of Michigan, or to holders of Michigan degrees whose work would be of
significance to the University, as for example, being part of a continuing research
program. If the fellowship is for summer travel, or for a whole semester or year,
there should be no requirement of payment of fees by the appointees for the period
of nonresidence, provided no academic credit is earned.
8. Without tying any strings on the proposed fund, it is hoped that it may some
time provide for completion of work undertaken jointly by Miss Chase and the
late C. A. Weatherby of Harvard, but never completed, on the flora of Grand Manan.

The Board instructed its Secretary to express to the Board of
Trustees of the Ford Foundation its grateful appreciation for a grant
of $500,000 to the Law School, for the purpose of assisting programs in
international and comparative law, with the expectation of the Foundation that the funds will be used to promote understanding of, and competence in, international affairs by improving and extending the training
in international and foreign problems which is already an integral part of
undergraduate studies in the Law School. In addition, the program of
the Law School will be strengthened by providing fellowships and training for able young law graduates from foreign countries, who will be
brought to Michigan so that they may pursue graduate work in the Law
School and thus become familiar with American legal institutions as
well as with specialized problems in international and foreign law. It is
understood that this grant is payable upon request, in a lump sum, and
it is expected that the funds will be invested on a short-term basis so that
the principal and income may be disbursed uniformly over a ten-year
period.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR, FEBRUARY 25, 1955
The Board met in the Regents' Room at 2:15 P.M. for the regular
meeting, postponed from the previously scheduled date of February 18.
Present, the President, Regents Eckert, Bonisteel, Kennedy, Baits,
Connable, and Herbert. Absent, Regents Stevens and Doan and Superintendent of Public Instruction Taylor. There were also in attendance
Vice-Presidents Niehuss, Pierpont, and Lewis, Mr. A. L. Brandon, Mr.
E. A. Walter, and the Secretary.
The minutes of the meeting of January 21, as submitted by the
Secretary, were approved with certain specified changes.
The Committee on Budget Administration reported its action taken       udget Adinison January 25, as follows:                                                tration Action
In the Proceedings for September 20, 1940 (R.P., 1939-42, pp. 404-5) appears
that portion of the will of Miss Effie M. Griffith providing for a bequest to the
University of approximately $20,000 to establish the Joseph and Esther Griffith
Memorial Scholarship Fund.
The University has been advised that Miss Griffith is buried in Silver Brook
Cemetery in Niles, in the family lot, but that no headstone marks her grave.
The committee therefore approved the use of $200 of the James B. Angell-Willard
M. and Jessie G. M. Clapp Fund so that Miss Griffith's grave may be appropriately
identified. As a matter of record, the registration cards in the Alumni Catalog Office
indicate that Miss Griffith's first name was Euphemia, but all subsequent records
with respect to her will indicate that this name was not used during her adult life.
The usual financial reports were accepted and placed on file.
The report on investment transactions, which was accepted and          Investment
Transactions
placed on file, is summarized below   (p. 276):

The President reported the retirement of Clair Upthegrove, Profes-       C. Upthegrove:
sor of Metallurgical Engineering, at the end of the first semester of the      emoir
present University year. The following memoir was adopted for inclusion
in these minutes:
Thirty-nine years ago, in the fall of 1916, Clair Upthegrove joined the Engineering faculty of our University as Instructor in Chemical Engineering. He had been
at the University as a student and had earned the Bachelor of Chemical Engineering
degree in 1914. Mr. Upthegrove had taught chemistry in the Alma and Ironwood
high schools (1905 to 1913), had been assistant chemist at the Oliver Mining
Company at Ironwood, and chemist and metallurgist at the Detroit Copper and
Brass Rolling Mills (1913 to 1916). After a year's teaching at the University, Mr.
Upthegrove joined the Ordnance Department of the United States Army and attained
a captaincy before he returned to his teaching in 1919. In World War II he was
metallurgical consultant on Army and Navy contracts to the Hancock Manufacturing
Company of Jackson, Michigan (1942 to 1944). He rose steadily in his College
until he became Professor of Metallurgical Engineering. Professor Upthegrove is an
authority on the metallurgy of nonferrous metals, nonferrous equilibrium systems,
scaling and decarbonizations of steels, and diffusion in metals. His contributions
to the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, the American
Society for Testing Materials, the American Foundrymen's Association, the American
Society of Metals, and the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education
have been recognized repeatedly by his election and appointment to offices in these
professional bodies. Professor Upthegrove took an active part in solving faculty and
student problems of his Department and of his College. These included revision of
curricula for graduates and undergraduates, activities in the honor society Tau
Beta Pi, and always being accessible to students as a teacher and as a friend.
On November 30, 1954, Professor Upthegrove reached his seventieth birthday and
became eligible for retirement under the provisions of our Bylaws. The Regents
express their good wishes to Professor Upthegrove and confer upon him the title
Professor Emeritus of Metallurgical Engineering. They further invite him to avail
himself of all the courtesies customarily shown to emeritus members of the faculty.

to be held Friday, May 13.
On recommendation by the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance, subparagraph (2) of Section 3.14 of the Bylaws, Execution of
University Documents, was amended to read as follows:
(2) All routine contracts entered into by the University for the purchase, sale,

business and finance is authorized to delegate to the Secretary, Controller, or
Purchasing Agent authority to execute such contracts.
Further, subparagraph (3) of Section 3.14 of the Bylaws, Execution of
University Documents, was amended to read as follows:
(3) All contracts for sponsored research and supplements thereto, including
agreements for fellowships, scholarships, and grants-in-aid, and all contracts covering
payment for tuition and supplies may be executed by the Vice-President in charge
of business and finance, and his signature shall be certified by the Secretary where
such certification is requested by the contractor. Provided, however, that the VicePresident in charge of business and finance is authorized to delegate to the Controller
or other designated representative authority to execute such contracts where the
amount involved is less than fifty thousand dollars and where the commitments
involved fall within the normal activities of University operations.


The Regents requested that the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance present to the members of the Board at the March meeting
a statement of the nature of the contracts which these amended bylaws
would ordinarily include.

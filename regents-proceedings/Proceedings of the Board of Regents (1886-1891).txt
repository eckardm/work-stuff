Dec. 1st, 1885. 
HON. JAMES B ANGELL, LL. D., President of the University of Michigan:
MY DEAR SIR: â€”Having already verbally communicated to
you my purpose, for reasons connected with my private interests,
to sever my connection with the University, I now offer my resignation of the Kent Professorship in the Law Department, to take
effect on the 31st December inst.
I need not assure you or the Board of Regents that this step,
on my part, is taken with reluctance and regret. The years that I




MARCH MEETING, 1886.


have given to service in the Law School have been among the happiest of my life. To have had the opportunity of refreshing my
own legal studies, and exploring the sources and development of
the law by more systematic research than is possible in the exigencies of legal practice; to have been brought in contact with the
fresh and eager minds which have passed under my instruction; to
have enjoyed intimate and improving intercourse with my distinguished associates in the faculty; to have been benefited by my
nearness to the academic life of the University; all these have been
sources of great pleasure to me, and will continue among my dearest recollections.
I recall with gratification the unfailing courtesy towards me
of the President and all the members of the Board of Regents;
and I remember with peculiar sensibility, that during a long illness, a few years ago, so protracted under leave of absence as to
have justified the Board in intimating a wish for my resignation,
nothing was ever manifested to me except kindness and consideration.
The interest I felt in the University before my official connection with it, deepened during the years I have given to its service,
will not be diminished by the termination of my present connection with it. No occasion in the future will be neglected by me,
when I can serve it in any way. With just pride in the distinction
it confers on our Commonwealth, in its assured prosperity and its
high place among leading Universities and in the great work it is
doing for the cause of liberal culture in the land,
I am, very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,
WM. P. WELLS.
On motion of Regent Joy, the resignation of Professor
Wim. P. Wells was accepted.

HON. GENTLEMEN:-I take pleasure in presenting to the University for the use of the Engineering Department, my Standard
Steel Rod, 72 inches long, at a temperature of 61.6 o F.-rate of expansion of 0.00043 inches for one degree. This standard measure
was obtained from the U. S. Coast Survey Office.
I do this with the only provision that it shall be supplemented

use in testing any chains, tapes, or measures, and especially of any
belonging to members of the Michigan Engineering Society.
GEO. E. STEELE.

MARCH MEETING, 1886.


15


City, Mich., to the University of a six feet steel U. S. Coast Survey
Standard Rod, I beg leave to report as follows:
1. This wooden standard should be about 101 feet long.
2. It may be made of 2x4 pine scantling spliced and bolted
together with carriage bolts.
3. Bolts may be fixed in it at the proper places for the various
needed lengths on it to be indicated by marks on said bolt heads.
4. This pine rod may be carried on some 11 to 13 cast brack
ets with a small adjustment both horizontally and vertically for
setting and keeping said rod straight and level.
5. Said cast brackets may be carried by suitable castings secured to a solid brick wall in some of the buildings.
6. Another bracket of suitable form should be fixed beyond
one end of the wooden rod to attach the end of any measure to,
for comparison with the standard wooden rod.
7. I consider the brick wall on the west side of the hallway,
upon the third floor of the main building, as the best place for this
rod.
8. I think $50. a sufficient sum for erecting this rod. Even
this sum need not be expended if the employees of the College can
do a part of the work, such as making patterns for castings, making and mounting the rod and setting the brackets.
9. If informed of the action of the Regents favorably to the
erection of this rod, I can publish it in the proceedings of the Michigan Engineering Society so that the members of the society can
avail themselves of the provisions of Mr. Steele's gift.
10. I contemplate no charges for making comparisons.
Respectfully,
J. B. DAVIS.

are agreed in pronouncing the likeness absolutely perfect. The

thanks for pointing out the way in which good service can done to,

OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


Dec. 1, the Kent Professorship of Law, the Committee appointed Otto Kirchner, of Detroit, to fill the vacancy for the
remainder of the year.  They also appointed Daniel A.
McLachlan, M. D., Professor of Theory and Practice of
Medicine in the Homceopathic Medical College, to take the
place of Professor T. P. Wilson, who was disabled by illness,
and who resigned on the following day, Dec. 9.    They
changed the title of David P. McGuire, M. D., from Associate
Professor to Professor of Ophthalmology and Otology in the
Homceopathic Medical College, and the title of Clarence G.
Taylor, from Assistant in Mechanical Engineering to Superintendent of Shops in the Engineering Laboratory. In February, the Executive Committee appointed Dewitt B. Brace,
Ph. D., Assistant Professor of Physics for the second semester.
The above action of the Executive Committee was ratified by the Board at the March meeting, 1886.
During the second semester, Professor Prescott was
absent on leave, and Professor Johnson was in charge of the
Chemical Laboratory, and T. S. Wrampelmeier was Assistant
Professor of Organic Chemistry and Pharmacy.
In June, 1886, H. S. Carhart, A. M., was appointed Professor of Physics, and Charles I. Walker, LL. D., Kent Professor of Law; Jerome C. Knowlton, A. M., was continued Assistant Professor of Law for one year; John Dewey, A. M.,
was promoted from the Instructorship to the Assistant Professorship of Philosophy; Walter Miller, A. M., was appointed
Instructor in Greek, and Jacob E. Reighard, Ph. B., Instructor in Zoology.
Professor Frieze was made Acting President for the
period of President Angell's absence in Europe.
July 19th, Charles A. Kent's resignation of the Fletcher
Professorship of Law, was tendered and accepted; B. L.
D'Ooge, A. M., was reappointed Instructor in Latin; and
Arthur W. Burnett, A. M., was reappointed Instructor in
English and German for one year.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


45


August 23d, Levi T. Griffin, A. M., of Detroit, was
elected Fletcher Professor of Law; Charles M. Gayley being
absent on leave in Europe, and B. L. D'Ooge having resigned
his place as Instructor in Latin, Andrew  C. McLaughlin,
A. B., was appointed in his stead. The title of Thomas M.
Cooley was changed from Professor of History to Professor
of American History and Constitutional Law. The resignation of T. J. Wrampelmeier, Assistant Professor of Organic
Chemistry and Pharmacy, was accepted.
Many of the graduates of the Law School will hear with
regret of the resignations of Professor Kent and Professor
Wells. The former had held his chair continuously since 1868,
and the latter had served with a somewhat prolonged interruption by illness, since 1874. Both had devoted themselves
with fidelity to the school, and by their ability and learning
had left their impress upon it. But while we are called to
part with these experienced teachers, we have the pleasure of
welcoming back Professor Walker, who was connected with
the school before either of the two Professors just named.
He filled the Kent chair of Law from 1859 to 1876.
It is with special pleasure that we see Professor Olney
and Professor Elisha Jones sufficiently recovered from prolonged illness to undertake their work again this year.
Professor D'Ooge is absent on leave as the Director of
the American School of Archaeology at Athens for the coming academic year. The appointment of him to this post is
alike an honor to him and to the University and will as may
be seen, be of real service to our Institution as well as to
the cause of good learning:

The total attendance the previous year was 1,295. The
largest part by far of the increase this year was in the Literary Department. We were gratified to see that not only was
the number who entered from the preparatory schools larger
than usual, but there was an unprecedented accession of students from other colleges. These last were attracted, as we
think they well may be, by the variety and extent of the advanced instruction which we are able to offer them under our
elective system in the last half of the college course. If the
day should ever come when we could leave to the schools or
the smaller colleges the work now done here in the first two
years of the course, and could bend our energies entirely to
the work of the last two years and to professional instruction,
we should rejoice. It is certain that during the year now
about to begin the attendance in the Literary Department
will be altogether beyond precedent, and that the total attendance in the University will closely approach that of 1881 and
1882.
The women in the University numbered 229. The previous year there were 196. Two years ago there were 180.
The attendance of women this year was distributed as follows:
Department of Literature, Science and the Arts.............. 135
Department of Medicine and Surgery........................ 61
Department of Law..........................................  5
School of Pharmacy.......................................  2
Homceopathic Medical  College..............................  20

There is not only an increase in numbers as compared
with the two previous years, but also an increase in the proportion of women to the total attendance. In 1883-4 the wo

men formed 13 per cent of all the students, in 1884-5, 15 per
cent, in 1885-6 a little over 16 per cent. The experience of
years does not shake our confidence in the wisdom of the
policy of opening our doors to the:women. Every year sees
more and more of the colleges and universities in this country and in Europe extending the privileges of instruction to
them. We hazard little in predicting that most of those institutions which now provide separate instruction for the two
sexes will at no distant day abandon so expensive and unnecessary a system.
The work of the University in all its Departments has
gone on with harmony and marked efficiency. In the light of
our own experience and of the warm discussions upon the
elective system of studies in colleges, we are strongly impressed with the belief that the plan which we are now pursuing in our Literary Department is best adapted to the needs
of the American college student. That plan prescribes about
one-half of his course to each student, covering most of the
work of the first year and a half or two years, and after he is
thus grounded in the more fundamental studies leaves him
large liberty in the choice of his studies for the last two
years of his course. Our so-called university system opens to
advanced students and especially to graduates large opportunities for specialization of study. We thus secure the elementary knowledge of various branches which every scholar
should have and at the same time open to those who are sufficiently mature and advanced to form wise judgments of their
special needs, the privilege of devoting much time to the
studies they may choose.
The demands upon the students in the Law Department
have been made, during the past year, more exacting and rigorous than ever before, and the Faculty have decided to introduce the most important change which has been made in the
method of the school since its establishment. They have
graded the course, and instruction will in the main be given
separately to the two classes. Text-book work and the study




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.

of leading cases will be combined with instruction by lecture.
The training will, we believe, be more thorough and systematic and effective than it has ever before been.
The Homceopathic Medical College has in large degree
escaped the unpleasant embarrassments from which it has
often suffered by reason of the unfriendly attitude of certain
homceopathic physicians in the State and has had a quiet and
successful year. The result is visible in the larger class which
is presenting itself now. Its prospects have not been so
bright in many years.
The Department of Medicine and Surgery and the
School of Pharmacy have carried on their work with their
usual vigor. Some of the wants of the Medical Department
will be referred to later in this Report.
By the prudent and judicious use of the fund for repairs
given us by the last Legislature the Steward has carried on
the work begun last year so that our buildings are now in
better condition than they have been for many years.  Perhaps the most important improvements completed this year
have been in the Law Building. The reconstruction of the Law
Library room will attract particular attention. The better
lighting gained by the opening of new windows, the hard
wood flooring, the re-arrangement of the books in new cases
easily accessible, adapt the room admirably to its purposes.
The Museum building has been thoroughly examined and the
defects in its original construction have been remedied as far
as possible. A good deal of work has been done at the Observatory. The improvements which the steward has with
the limited means at his command been able to make in our
grounds, you will observe with pleasure.
Cases have been made for the Chinese exhibit, and the
articles have been tastefully arranged in them. The whole of
one room in the Museum is assigned to them, and the value
of this handsome gift of the Chinese Government can now be
appreciated.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


About one-half of the Rogers collection of statuary has
been received and placed in our Art Gallery. This part of the
collection numbers fifty-three statues and groups including
many of the finest works of the eminent sculptor. It is perhaps not so generally understood as it should be that these
casts, being the literal transcripts of the clay as it left the
artist's hand, are more valuable for purposes of instruction in
art than copies wrought in marble, because they reproduce
more exactly the artist's work. One has only to compare the
cast of Nydia with our marble statue of Nydia to perceive
this. When we consider the variety and beauty of the work
in this Rogers collection, we may say with safety that no
collection of statuary comparable with it is to be found in the
gallery of any other of our Universities.
From the reports of the Curators of the Museum, I draw
the following facts. Two important additions have been
made to the Botanical Collection, first a set of North American Fungi, the gift of Joseph B. Whittier, of East Saginaw,
and second, a collection of North American Woods presented
by Prof. C. F. Sargent of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard
University. The fungi are nmounted ready for use by students. Assistance is needed to care for the botanical collections.
A considerable number of desirable specimens has been
added by gift to the collections in applied chemistry, especially to the pharmaceutical collections.
Director Otto J. Klotz, Astronomer of the Dominion of
Canada, and a graduate of our Literary Department in 1872,
has presented to our paleontological museum a highly interesting collection of fossils from the flanks of the Rocky
Mountains in latitude 57 ~. They are said by the Curator to
represent the primordial zone of life. The locality is hitherto unknown to science, and the species sent appear to be
new.
It will be remembered that most of Dr. Roeminger's
unique collection of fossils is deposited on our shelves. It is




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


so very desirable that we should secure it, that I cannot but
call attention to the danger of our losing it, unless we can
soon fihd the means of purchasing it.
Our Museum of Art has received not only the statuary
above referred to, but also two additions to our collection of
portraits, one of President Tappan, presented by C. H. Denison, Esq., of the claas of 1861, and the other of Professor
Ford, by the last graduating class of the Department of Medicine and Surgery. We very much desire to make large additions to our collection of the portraits of men who have been
benefactors of the University, either by important gifts or by
eminent service as teachers in its Faculties. It would also be
fitting that in the halls of the State University the portraits of
the Governors of the State should be placed.
The other Museums have received no important additions,
as the condition of our treasury has been such that we have
not been able to avail ourselves even of favorable opportunities to increase our scientific collections by purchase.
The report of the Librarian shows that we have now in
all our Libraries 60,201 volumes, 12,267 unbound pamphlets and 212 charts.  Of these there are in the General
Library 47,187 volumes, 11,404 unbound pamphlets and 212
charts; in the Law Library 9,250 volumes; in the Medical
Library 3,3.60 volumes, 872 unbound pamphlets; and in the
Library of the Dental College 404 volumes. The increase in
all the Libraries has been 3,640 volumes and 1,087 pamphlets.
The number of volumes drawn by readers for use in the reading room and by Professors for use out of the building has
been 82,063.
Among the gifts to the Library we may name the
great Piranesi collection of Engravings, 27 volumes, containing 1,577 engravings, presented through Dr. Frieze by a recent
graduate who prefers that his name should not be known; a
collection of English Dramatic works, 240 volumes, presented
through Professor Demmon by a recent graduate who makes
the same modest request as the giver of the engravings con



OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


cerning the disclosure of his name; the addition by James
McMillan, Esq., to the McMillan Shakespearean collection, of
298 volumes and 111 pamphlets of great value purchased from
the Crosby Shakespeare Library of Zanesville, 0., and a number of valuable works added by Philo Parsons, Esq., to the
Parsons Library.
It is with special pleasure that I make mention of the
generous interest manifested in our Library by some of our
German fellow citizens. Having learned of the inadequacy
of our means to provide the needed supply of German literature, they have established the so-called " Goethe Library
Fund," the proceeds of which are to be devoted to the purchase of German books for our Library. The sum of $1,360
has already been raised, and it is confidently expected that
handsome additions will be made to the fund. A thousand
dollars worth of books have already been ordered on the account of this fund.
Now, as always, our prosperity brings with it the call for
larger equipment. It is obvious that we should have a new
building, especially constructed for galleries of art. To display properly the Rogers collection of statuary and the Lewis
collection of pictures we need much larger accommodations
than are afforded by our present galleries in the Library
building. We cannot doubt that in due time the State will
cheerfully furnish a suitable house for these valuable gifts
which have been so generously bestowed upon it by two of its
citizens. The Art Building should have architectural fitness
for the high purpose to which it is to be dedicated.
We are also in pressing need of certain scientific laboratories. We should have without delay a physical laboratory
for instruction in the wide domain of theoretical and applied physics.  Our outfit for teaching this branch should be
materially enlarged. In no department of college work has
greater change been made in our better colleges and scientific
schools during the last few years. The demand for high
training in physics with special reference to practical applica



OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


53


tion, as for example in electrical engineering, is very considerable. A building must be constructed with special regard
to the work in physics. We wish to give to our Professor in
charge of that important department of study, who is a
teacher and investigator of large experience and established
reputation, the materials for securing the greatest efficiency
to his department.
The Faculty of the Department of Medicine and Surgery
also make an urgent request for a laboratory for pathological,
physiological and histological work.  The best medical
schools are coming to give instruction as largely as possible
by laboratory methods, and there can be no question that
these methods present great advantages for imparting instruction in certain branches.  At an early day our medical
school won distinction through its laboratory facilities for
the study of chemistry, when few medical schools offered
such advantages. We must see that we are not now outstripped by other schools in furnishing opportunity for laboratory
work in such other branches as can be best taught in part at
least by the aid of laboratories.
The State Board of Health has also forwarded a request
to us to establish a hygienic laboratory, in which investigations could be made of the adulterations of food and of all
such sanitary problems as it is well to have studied for the
protection of health. There can be no doubt that the State
would receive from such a laboratory, properly organized and
conducted, more than it would cost to establish and maintain
it. In Germany such laboratories are maintained by the
government, and the city of Paris has one which is found to
be of the greatest service to the public.
Probably the medical and hygienic laboratories could all
be provided for under one roof. It is possible that a physical laboratory could be placed in a separate wing, and some
economy in expenditure thus be secured. I commend the
whole subject to your most careful consideration.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


As we expected, the new Engineering Laboratory is completely filled at once on its being opened. The question of
enlargement will force itself on us at an early day. The
equipment should be increased without delay. There is a
strong and growing tendency among young men to prepare
themselves for the various fields of engineering work andfor
the practical application of the sciences to the arts of life. To
all such some part of our shop work is helpful, if not absolutely essential. We have now about 1'20 students of engineering in the University, and the number is steadily increasing year by year.  Our present Engineering Laboratory can
accommodate only 45, and so many only by undue crowding.
We need more room, and we need for those who cal be accommodated more tools and machinery, especially a new
steam engine, and more assistants. The implements for an experimental laboratory for testing machines, steam engines, the
strength of materials, etc., are much desired.  As elsewhere
stated, we should aim at the earliest opportunity to add to
our other engineering work instruction in electrical engineering.
The growth of the Dental College calls for an enlargement of the building they occupy. That growth has been
healthy and promising. It has taken place in the face of a
constant and rapid increase of the requirements for admission
and especially for graduation. When it was organized in
1875 a two years course of six months in each year secured a
degree. Now a student must study dentistry three years and
pursue in that time two courses of nine months each in order
to graduate, and the standard of examinations has been
raised. The success of the graduates, the eagerness with
which in many cases they are invited to settle in important
towns, and the recognition of their diplomas in Europe, attest
the excellence of the instruction. The school has beyond
doubt rendered a most valuable public service by sending
forth well-trained men and women to the important work entrusted to the dental profession. Every year it attracts stun




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


dents from beyond the seas. It is to be hoped that means
may be found to give the school the ampler accommodations
which the present number of students requires. Without such
enlargement it will be necessary to refuse admission to many
applicants.
We need at once to settle upon some carefully considered
plan concerning building upon the campus. It is greatly to
be regretted that when land in the vicinity of the University
was cheap, the Regents had not procured at least a hundred
acres. But no one could in the early days foresee the needs
which we now experience. Our forty acres seemed a liberal
supply.  But already we are finding ourselves crowded,
while yet at no distant time, and we hope very soon, we shall
be called to find sites for the art gallery, the gymnasium,
and several laboratories. If we could at once remove the dissecting room and the hospitals from the campus to some
eligible site, not far away, I should deem it very wise to
make the removal. It would be well if we had a large field
for the sports of the students. More room than we have is
now desired by them for ball grounds and tennis courts, and
we can of course never have fine lawns on ground which is
used for either ball or tennis. The expediency of acquiring
more land before the growth of the city carries the price still
higher than it now is seems to me well worthy of consideration.
The report of the Finance Committee will doubtless
show that the aid furnished to our repair and contingent
fund was of very essential service. It is very desirable that
such aid be again furnished, since it is far more economical
to keep our buildings in repair than to allow them to get into
so bad a condition as they were in two years ago. A smaller
sum will suffice for the next two years than we asked before.
By the closest economy and by heroically refusing our various
departments many things which they greatly needed, and by
pinching salaries, we have somewhat improved the condition
of our treasury. The new appraisal of the property of the




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


State so increases the valuation that the one-twentieth mill
tax will yield about $6,700 more than heretofore. We may
count on an enlarged income from students' fees for the year
1886-7. Still our needs are so many and so pressing that we
must rely on the constant aid of the State. For many years
now that aid has been so cheerfully furnished that we do not
allow ourselves to doubt that it will be continued. The simple truth is that the State now holds property here representing a greater value than all the money it has raised for the
support of the University. The service which the University has rendered to the State by the education of its sons and
daughters has been a clear gain to the State. We believe that
the slight burden, which we ask her to take upon herself in
securing a larger usefulness to the Institution and so a larger
blessing to her own children, will be cheerfully borne by her
in the future as it has been in the past.

Regent Field presented the following resolution which
was adopted.
Resolved, That the report of the President be accepted and
printed in the minutes, and that one thousand extra copies be
printed and bound in paper covers, for the use of the Board and of
the University.
The President presented and read the following report:
UNIVERSITY OF MICIIGAN, t
October 12, 1886. t
To the Board of Regents;
Mr. T. J. Wrampelmeier having resigned the chair of Assistant Professor of Organic Chemistry and Pharmacy, the Executive
Committee on September 23, last, appointed Alviso B. Stevens, Ph.
C., a skilful pharmacist of Detroit, Instructor in Pharmacy for the
current academic year, at a salary of $1,000. They also appointed
Fred. G. Novy, B. S., Assistant in Organic Chemistry for 1886-7 at
the salary of $200, and Edgar D. Smith, Ph. C., Assistant in Pharmacy for 1886-7 at the salary of $160.
It is understood that Mr. Stevens assisted by Mr. Smith will
take the principal portion of the work in Pharmacy heretofore
performed by Dr. Prescott and Mr. Wrampelmtier, and that Dr.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


Prescott, assisted by Mr. Novy, will take the work in Organic
Chemistry heretofore done by \Mr. Wrampelmeier.
These changes do not increase the sum expended for salaries
heretofore.
September 2d, the Committee appointed A. C. McLaughlin,
A. B., Instructor in Latin for one year at a salary of $900, in place
of B. L. D'Ooge who resigned to accept a Professorship in the
Normal School.
Respectfully submitted,

On motion of Regent Field the report of the Executive
Committee just read was accepted and adopted by the following vote:
Ayes-Regents Grosvenor, Blair, Clark, Field and Whitman.
Nays-None.
Regent Blair from   the Law Committee presented and
read a letter from  Levi T. Griffin, accepting the Fletcher
Professorship in the Law Department to which he had been
appointed at the last meeting of the Board, which was on
motion, accepted and placed on file.
On motion of Regent Clark, the Board listened to the
following report of the Librarian:
To the Honorable the Board Regtnts of the University of Michigan:
The following report on the Libraries of the University covers
the twelve months between Oct. 1st, 1885, and Sept. 30, 1886. It is
submitted at this time in accordance with the law defining the
duties of the Librarian.
The Libraries are four in number, viz.: The General Library,
the Law Library, the Medical Library, and the Library of the Dental College. They contained Sept. 30th, the end of the period covered by this report, 60,201 volumes, 12,267 unbound pamphlets,
and 212 charts.
The distribution of the books is as follows:
In the General Library there are 47,187 volumes, 11,404 unbound pamphlets, and 212 charts.




58


OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


In the Law Library there are 9,250 volumes.
In the Medical Library there are 3,360 volumes, and 872 unbound pamphlets.
In the Library of the Dental College there are 404 volumes.
The additions to the General Library during the year have
been 3,057 volumes, 877 unbound pamphlets, and 1 chart. Of
these 1,511 volumes and 30 pamphlets were bought; 1,179 volumes
and 847 pamphlets were presented, and 367 volumes were the result of binding periodicals.
The expenditures for this library, so far as the bills came to
me for endorsement, were $4,477.96. Of this sum $3,346.17 were
paid for books and pamphlets; $468.44 for subscriptions to periodicals, and $663.35 for binding, rebinding, and mending volumes.
This was all paid out of the special fund for the purchase of books.
There was also paid out of the current expense fund for catalogue
cards, readers' tickets, book supports, &c., $72.10.
The Legislature of 1885 appropriated $10,000 for the Libraries
of the University, $5,000 for the year 1885, and $5,000 for the year
1886.
The division of this by the Board was as follows:
FOR THE YEAR 1885.
To  the General Library.......................................................$3,000
To  the  Law   Library............................................................  1,000
To  the  M edical Library..................................................  1,000
FOR THE YEAR 1886.
To the General Library......................$................................ $3,500
To  the  Law   Library..........................................................  1,01'0
To the Medical Library......................................................  500
Of the two sums assigned to the General Library, making together $6,500, there remained unexpended Sept. 30th, $1,484.78. I
have since that date turned over to the Steward unpaid bills
amounting to $218.20. There are outstanding orders for books
that will cover quite $250 more. This reduces the unexpended
balance to about $1,000, which sum must meet all our expenses
until another appropriation shall be made by the Legislature of
1887.  Out of tie sum of $1,000 must necessarily be paid the subscriptions to periodicals for 1887, which will exceed $450, and something for binding and mending and continuations. There cannot
possibly remain much for the purchase of books.
When the Legislative appropriation for the Libraries for the
year 1886 was divided by the Board in Nov. 1885, 1 had the honor in

connection with Professor Pettee, of presenting for your consideration certain needs of the General Library. I called attention, at
that time, to the fact that the University had post graduate students 'in attendance, and that she was using every proper endeavor
to increase the number of them. Now the post graduate's method
of work is different from that of the undergraduate. He concentrates his energies on one subject for the whole period of his stay
at the University. Those who make specialties of Literature.
History, Philosophy, Language, and the phases of Political Science, are entirely dependent for material with which to work,
upon the library, while those working at the Physical Sciences and
Natural History are largely dependent upon it.
What do we have to meet the demands of students working
in these special directions?
We have in English Literature a good collection for the
study of Shakespeare, and a good beginning of a collection for the
study of English Dramatic Literature in general. In German
Literature we shall have in the course of the year a good collection for the study of Goethe and his period.  But nowhere
except in the three instances named, is there, in all the realm of
literature, a department, or a period, or an author, adequately represented. This lack is emphasized every time a post graduate
asks to see the literature of the subject to which he proposes to
give his time.
In History and Political Science the lack is not so conspicuous. The Parsons Library and the collection presented by an unknown benefactor of the library, through Professor C. K. Adams,
add greatly to the strength of these departments; but there is still
very much lacking, especially in the department of History.
The Physical sciences are fairly well represented, but in the
literature of Natural Iistory we are lamentably weak. In the department of Philosophy, also, our collection is far from full.
Can these departments, and others not named, be brought up
with the sums that we have been accustomed to receive for the
purchase of books?
I will go into particulars on the subject. The average sum annually at the disposal of the library for the last nine years-since
the Legislature began to make special appropriations for it-has
been about 83,700. This includes the large appropriation of $15,090, made for the years 1883-84.




60


OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


The phrase purchase of books has been interpreted to cover
subscriptions to periodicals, and the cost of binding and mending,
and transportation-the transportation of both purchases and
gifts. The average yearly cost of these three things, viz.: subscriptions to periodicals, binding and mending, and transportation, is
about $1,200.  Deducting this from the.3,700 there remains $2,500. It has been found necessary to have a reserve-something
with which to buy books of general reference, and books that pertain to departments of literature that are not represented by
chairs of instruction, as Art, Theology, Philology, Bibliography,
and something, also, to make Our bills good when the cost of books
has been underestimated. This reserve has been about one-third of
the sum remaining after the periodicals, binding and transportation
have been provided for. Reduced by one-third $2,500 becomes
$1,663. This divided among the 23 departments of instruction
gives to each a little less than $73 for the year.
While this may suffice for some of the departments of which
the literature is not large, how far will it go towards supplying the
wants of others of which the literature is large? Of Zoology, for
instance, which covers Biology, and Comparative Anatomy, as
well as that literature which describes and classifies the varied
forms of animal life? This sum will barely pay for the numbers
of Tryon's Manual of Conchology which are issued during a year,
and which are necessary for the identification of the shells in the
Museum. How far will it go towards supplying the wants of the
department of English Literature which covers Grammar, Rhetoric,
Literary History and Criticism, as well as the works of the Standard Authors of England and America? The new Scholar's edition
of Wordsworth, by Knight, alone costs $50.00.
It is evident that we cannot meet the needs of this post
graduate class of students without more funds than we have been
accustomed to have. It is, also, evident that we must meet these
needs or run the risk of losing, the students. The University is
competing for them with institutions that have large libraries
with large incomes.
I, therefore, urge upon the Board the importance of securing
from the Legislature of 1887 as liberal an appropriation as possible. Also, events lead me to suggest that a specified sum be asked
for for each library, rather than one sum to be divided among the
libraries subsequently.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


61


Attention is particularly called to the large number of books
and pamphlets presented, viz.: 1,179 volumes, and 847 pamphlets,
or more than a third of all the additions to the library. Among
the benefactors of this year are found those of former years.
Mr. McMillan furnished money to buy from the Shakespeare
library of Mr. Joseph Crosby of Zanesville, O., which had come to
sale, all the books contained in it which were not found in the
McMillan Shakespeare Collection. These additions, consisting of
298 volumes and 111 pamphlets, bring our Shakespeare collection
up to 3,000 volumes and more. Mr. Parsons has made very valuable additions to the collection bearing his name. Dr. S. A. Green,
Librarian of the Massachusetts Historical Society continues to
send parcels of books and pamphlets.
Other benefactors have arisen, but they are unknown. One,
through Dr. Frieze, has contributed money for the purchase of the
Piranesi collections of Engravings; 27 volumes containing 1,577
engravings of great interest and value. Another, through Professor Demmon, has furnished money for the beginning of a Dramatic
Collection. With this money 240 volumes consisting chiefly of collections of plays, and works of individual dramatists, have been
bought.
About a year ago Professor Thomas conceived the idea of interesting the German citizens of the state in the establishment of
a Goethe Library in the University, which should be a part of the
General Library. The idea was carried out very successfully, as is
already known to the Board. The contributions now amount to
81,200. Orders for books have been given to the amount of $800,
and the books have already reached New York from Germany.
Many gifts have come to the Library from men in the service
of the University, and from Alumni in different parts of the
country. These have been prompted by the warmest affection for
the University, and frequently have been accompanied by expressions of such affection.
The use of the Library continues to be gratifying; we cannot
however, now make it a matter of record to the extent that we
have been accustomed to do. Each year that we have been in the
new building there has been a small decrease in the number of
books used in the Reading Room. On the other hand, however,
there has been a constantly increasing demand for accommodation
in the Seminary Rooms, and for permission to visit the Book Room.




62


OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


All my observation leads me to believe that on the whole, there is
an increased use of the Library from year to year:
The number of volumes' drawn and used in the Reading Room
w as............................................  79,380
The number drawn out by Professors................  2,683
In   all.....................................82,063  vols.
Tickets of admission to the Book room were granted to 21
persons, who made 413 visits to the shelves.
In the course of both semesters 204 students were admitted to
the Seminary Rooms-128 to the West Room for the study of English Literature, Latin, Greek, and Classical Art, and 76 to the East
Room for the study of History, Political Economy, Philosophy,
and the art of Teaching.
Seven volumes have disappeared. Three of them belonged to
the main collection, viz.: Green's Short History of England, Eng.
Edition Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, and Fairbairn's Studies in
the Philosophy of Religion and History.  Two were from the
Chemical Laboratory, viz.:  Wohler's Inorganic Analysis, and
Tidy's Chemistry. Two were from the Botanical Rooms, viz.:
Poulsen's Micro-Chemistry, and The National Dispensatory, 1880.
A faithful search has been made for these without success,
and I feel it my duty to report them; still I am not without hope
that some of them may yet return to us.
Two volumes have been used up and laid aside, viz:-Wilson's
French and English Dictionary, and Spier's and Surenne's French
and English Dictionary.
The books are, generally, in a good condition.
MEDICAL LIBRARY.
The Medical Library has been much strengthened during the
year by the addition of new editions of standard works, and many
new books. Many gaps have been filled in sets of periodicals. The
strength of this library lies in its sets of bound periodicals. The
additions during the year have been 454 volumes and 145 pamphlets. Of these, 282 volumes and 1 pamphlet were bought, 13 volumes and 144 pamphlets were presented, and 149 volumes were the
result of binding periodicals.
The total of bills endorsed by me for this library was $1,157.68.
Of this amount, $790.26 were for books, $218.97 for periodicals, and




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


$148.45 for binding. The use of this collection is included in the
statistics for the General Library. The books of both collections
are shelved in one building and handled by one set of attendants.
LIBRARY OF THE DENTAL COLLEGE.
The purchases for the Library of the Dental College are made
by the Dean of the College out of the special funds of his department. I cannot, therefore, report in regard to expenditures. The
books are kept in closed cases in the Faculty room of the College
building. They are all in very good order. At no remote period,
additional shelf room will be required, The extent of the collection, as stated in the beginning of this report, is 404 volumes.
THE LAW LIBRARY.
I give, verbatim, the report on the Law Library made to me
by Mr. Vance, the assistant in charge.
"Amount expended from Oct. 1, 1885, to Sept. 30, 1886.... $1,087.18
No. of periodicals taken.................................. 10
Books added  during  the  year............................. 195 vols.
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LIBRARY ROOM.
During the year a new hardwood floor has been laid; the old
book cases have been altered, new book cases suitable in design
and appropriate in style have been constructed and placed in position. Four new windows have been made, and to the walls of the
room the color has been given best suited to the purposes of a
reading room. The combined result of these changes and improvements is that the Library Room of the Law Department is considered to be superior to any other room similar in character in the
State and probably second to no other library room connected with
any Law School in the country."
There is one thing I wish to add to Mr. Vance's report. During the last part of last year it was represented to me by students
that the statutes of the different States were not possessed by the
Law Library, and that there was frequent need of them. It occurred to me that some of them might be given, on application,
and I accordingly wrote in the vacation to most of the State
governments, asking for copies of their Revised Statutes and
Session Laws passed after the last revision, for our Law
Library, if they were accustomed, on solicitation, to send
them to the libraries of Law Schools. To about one-quarter of my
applications there have been favorable responses, and in reply to
nearly all the others have come expressions of regret that no law




64


OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


existed which made compliance possible. As the matter stands,
the Revised Statutes and Session Laws of Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Missouri, New Hampshire, and Illinois, Nevada, and Rhode Island
have been received. Those of Maine and Massachusetts are promised. The number of volumes in this library, as stated earlier, is
9,250 volumes. This is exclusive of the volumes of Laws just referred to, which have not yet been placed in the Library.
Certain changes have taken place in the force engaged in the
General Library. Mr. R. F. Eldredge, general assistant, has been
succeeded by Mr. G. F. James, of the class of '86. Mr. F. C. Hicks,
and Mr. T. H. McNeil, assistants in charge of the Seminary Rooms,
have been succeeded by Mr. A. J. Covell and Mr. G. W. Lacea.
Mr. Osgood Ingalls and Mr. F. M. Sessions, desk attendants,
have been succeeded by Mr. D. C. Worcester, and Mr. F. F. Lehman
In all cases the compensation has been unchanged.
Very respectfully submitted,
R. C. DAVIS,
Librarian.
On motion of Regent Field the report of the Librarian
was accepted and ordered printed in the minutes.
Professor Frieze presented and read the following communication from the Secretary of the Senate:
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
At a meeting of the University Senate held last evening a
communication was presented from Harvard University inviting
the University of Michigan to participate by a delegate in the
celebration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of Harvard,
to be held on the 6th, 7th and 8th of November next, and a committee consisting of Professors Frieze, T. M. Cooley, Palmer,
Rogers and Prescott, was appointed to act in conjunction with
your Board in the selection of a delegate.
Respectfully yours.
MW. H. PETTEE,
Secretary of the Senate.
Regent Blair moved that the President appoint a committee of three to act with the Senate Committee in selecting
a delegate to represent the University of Michigan at the
celebration of the 250th anniversary of Harvard University.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


65


The motion prevailed and the President named Regents
Blair, Field and Grosvenor as such committee.
Regent Blair, chairman of special committee to select a
delegate to attend the anniversary celebration of Harvard
University, reported that they had made choice of President
Angell, and recommended that the Auditing Board be authorized to pay the expenses incurred by him while acting as such
delegate.
The above report and recommendation were adopted by
the following vote:
Ayes-Regents Grosvenor, Blair, Clark, Field and Whitman.
Nays-None.
Regent Grosvenor presented a form of receipt to be
given by the Treasurer to donors to the German American
Goethe Library Fund of the University.  On motion the
form was adopted, and the Steward instructed to cause the
same to be printed for immediate use.
Regent Grosvenor presented and read the following
resignations in the Iomceopathic Medical College; of Emma
E. Bower, Assistant to the Chair of Obstetrics, and Assistant
to the Chair of Materia Medica. R. C. Reedy, M. D., House
Surgeon and Assistant to the Chair of Surgery. G. G. Caron,
M. D., Assistant to the Chair of Ophthalmology and the
Chair of Theory and Practice. On motion of Regent Grosvenor the foregoing resignations were accepted.
Regent Grosvenor, Chairman of the Medical Committee,
read a communication from the Homceopathic Medical Faculty in which the following appointments were recommended:
George G. Caron, M. D., to be House Surgeon and Assistant
to the Chair of Theory and Practice of Medicine, salary $350.
Harold B. Wilson, M. D., Assistant to the Chair of Ophthalmology and Otology, salary $100, and Assistant to the Chair
of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children, salary
$100; and Frank A. Johnson, M. D., to be Assistant to the
Chair of Surgery, salary $100, and Assistant to the Chair of
Materia Medica, salary $100.




66


OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


On motion of Regent Grosvenor, the above recommendations of the Homeopathic Faculty were approved by the following vote:
Ayes-Regents Grosvenor, Blair, Clark, Field and Whitman.
Nays-None.
Regent Blair read the following communication from
Professor M. W. Harrington, Director of the Observatory:
ANN ARBOR, MICH., I
October 13, 1886. 
To the Honorable the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN:-I need in my department a good astronomical
globe. Those I have are antiquated and out of repair. Mr. Morley
has shown me Bailey's Cosmosphere, and 1 find it well suited to my
purpose. Mr. Morley will have the Cosmosphere set up for inspection. I think it the best instrument of the kind now on the
market, and am sure that if purchased it will increase the efficiency of instruction in astronomy.
I regret that I cannot be present personally at the meeting to
call the attention of members of the Board to the especial excellencies of this apparatus.
Very respectfully,
M. W. HARRINGTON.
Mr. Morley being present, was invited by the Board to
explain the working of his Cosmosphere, after which on motion of Regent Blair the matter was referred to the Committee on "Observatory and School of Mines."
The following communication was received from     the
Faculty of the Law Department:
To the Honorable the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN: At a meeting of the Board held on Oct. 14th,
1885, a resolution was adopted, calling on the Faculty of Law to
consider whether certain changes might not be made with advantage in the course of instruction pursued in the Law Department.
The Faculty having taken the matter into consideration, found
themselves unable to agree on any fundamental changes in. the
system pursued, owing to certain differences of opinion among
themselves, and they accordingly reported to the Board at a meeting in March, 1885, that any change in the methods of instruction
was, in their judgment, at that time impracticable.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.


67


Since that report was transmitted to the Board, changes have
taken place in the Faculty itself, and the present members of that
body are now unanimously agreed upon certain very fundamental
changes in the course of instruction.
(1). We deem it advisable that the course of instruction should
be a graded one, and the lectures delivered to the two classes separately, the more elementary subjects to be assigned to the junior
year, and the more complicated postponed to the senior year.
This change exacts much more labor from the Professors, requiring them in one year to deliver the lectures formerly delivered
in two years. But they are willing to take upon themselves the
additional labor in the hope of thereby promoting the efficiency of
the Department, and of enhancing the reputation of the University
itself.
(2). The system of instruction by text-books has proved very
satifactory, and while we are not at all of the opinion that instruction by lectures should be supplanted by the use of text-books, we
are firmly persuaded that it would be a great misfortune to the
Department if the text-book instruction were to be abandoned.
We therefore have thought that this system of instruction should
be continued with the Junior class as heretofore, and also that it
should be extended to the Senior class during the second Semester.
The extension of the system to the Senior class will devolve on the
Assistant Professor a largely increased amount of labor, which
he is very cheerfully prepared to render.
(3). As much instruction can be derived from a proper study
of leading cases, the Faculty have thought it well that such a
study should be made a feature of the instruction given during the
Senior year. Such instruction has been given in other law schools
of the country, and has been found to be of very great benefit to
the students. We hope and believe that similarly happy results
will attend its introduction into our course.
Having reached the conclusion that the above noted changes
in the course of instruction would be to the advantage of the Department and should not be postponed, but made applicable to the
current College year, the Faculty ventured to open the school on
October 1st under a system of instruction embodying the ideas advanced in this communication. We preferred to begin the new
year upon the new plan, inasmuch as it would be less difficult
to change afterwards from the new system to the old if the Board




68


OCTOBER MEETING, 1886,


disapproved this change, than it would be to change from the old
to the new after the work of the year had once commenced.
In an appendix hereunto annexed will be found in detail the
system of instruction which we are now pursuing.
We hereby respectfully submit our action in the matter to the
consideration of the Board, hoping that it may meet with cordial
approval, and at the same time we desire to express our willingness to conform to the wishes of the Board, if in your opinion it is
wise to modify in any way the plan we are now pursuing.
We cannot conclude our report without calling attention to
the desirability of having some instruction given in the Law School
on the subject of Medical Jurisprudence. For years the Faculty
of Advocates in Scotland has insisted that every gentleman who is
called to the Scotch Bar should have studied Forensic Medicine.
While this has not been insisted on in this country, it is agreed that
a knowledge of the subject is very desirable. We would therefore
recommend to the Board that Edward S. Dunster, M. D., be appointed a Lecturer in the Law Department on Special Heads of
Medical Jurisprudence, that Victor C. Vaughan, M. D., be appointed a Lecturer in the Law Department on Toxicology; and
that Charles H. Stowell, M. D., be appointed a Lecturer in the Law
Department on Legal Microscopy.
We make these recommendations after conference with the
gentlemen named, and with the assurance upon their part of entire
willingness to give the instruction desired in addition to the instruction given by them in the Medical Department. It is intended that this instruction, if authorized by the Board, shall be given
at such hours as not to conflict with or in any manner curtail the
instruction now being given in this Department.
We would also suggest that it would increase the efficiency of
the Department, if a special lecturer on Admiralty Law could
be appointed to deliver a few lectures upon that subject to the
Senior class. There is no provision for instruction upon that subject, and it never has been possible to give any adequate instruction therein in the past. A special lecturer might be appointed
for that particular subject at very little expense. But we do not
urge that any action be taken at this meeting of the Board so far
as this appointment is concerned.
We would also call the attention of the Board to the desirability of making some provision for the training of law students




OCTOBER MEETING, 1886.                 69
in Forensic Elocution. In some of the Law Schools of the country
opportunity is afforded for training of this character, and we cannot prudently neglect providing such instruction here. If an instructor in Elocution should be appointed, he could give instruction both in the Law and Literary Departments; but in our judgment his work should be so arranged that he could give at least as
much time to the training of the students in this Department as
to those in the Literary Department, not only because his classes
would be as large in the one Department as they would be in the
other, but also because it is more important that law students
should receive such training than it is for any other class of students in the University.
All of which is respectfully submitted,

As to Text Book instruction the arrangement is as follows:
The members of the Junior class will be required to attend
daily recitations in Cooley's edition of Blackstone's Commentaries,
Anson on Contracts, and Schouler on Bailments. This work will
be done under the direction of Assistant Professor Knowlton, and
will continue throughout the Junior year. The class will meet at
8 o'clock A. M.
All members of the Senior class will during the second
semester attend recitations in Gould on Pleading, and such of
them as may so elect can attend recitations in Pomeroy on Remedies and Remedial Rights (Code Pleading). Students who come
from Code States will be expected to attend regular recitations in
this work, and they will find the instruction thus obtained invaluable in their subsequent practice. Students from States where the
reformed procedure has not been introduced, may or may not, at
their option, attend such recitations. But students from Code
States are expected to attend the recitations in Gould on Pleading,
as well as in Pomeroy, inasmuch as the works on common law
pleading are not superseded by the codes, and it is thought that a
careful study of such works is the best preparation for the pleader
whether he practices under the old or the new procedure. This
work will also be under the direction of Assistant Professor
Knowlton, The class will meet at nine o'clock A. Ir.
As to the instruction in Leading Cases, the following announcement has been made:
THE STUDY OF LEADING CASES.
As much instruction can be derived from a proper study of
what are known as Leading Cases, and inasmuch as it is desirable
that students should be familiar with the more important of these
cases, they are requested to purchase "Indermaur's Common Law
Cases." They will be expected to make themselves familiar with
the cases contained in that work, and they will be examined upon

them during the year by one or more of the professors at such
times as shall be hereafter announced.
And upon the subject of Examinations the following announcement has been made:
EXAMINATIONS.
At the end of the year the members of the Junior and Senior
classes will be subjected to an oral and written examination both
upon the lectures and the text-book work.
The members of the Junior class will be required to pass
these examinations as a condition precedent of their admission
into the Senior class.
Regent Blair submitted the following resolutions which

Resolved, That this Board approves the action of the Law
Faculty in making the changes in the course of instruction in the
Law Department, outl.ned in the communication this day received,
and that hereafter instruction in that Department shall proceed
according to the plan lately put in operation by the Faculty.
Resolved further, That the part of said communication which
recommends appointments and instruction' upon other subjects
than those previously taught in the Law School, be referred to the
Law Committee of this Board with instructions to report thereon
at the next meeting.
Professor J. B. Steere, on behalf of the City Council, addressed the Board urging the desirableness of the Board
placing two electric lights on the tower of the main building.

in June last, but could not be present on Commencement Day, as required by University law for graduation at that time. The Faculty, therefore, have directed me
to present his name to the Regents for action at the October Meeting.
A. B. PRESCOTT.
On motion of Regent Clark, the Degree of Pharmaceutical Chemist was conferred on William Douglas Condon, in
accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty of the
School of Pharmacy.
Regent Whitman presented and read the following comnunication from   Professor Frieze, Dean of the Literary
Faculty:
To the Honorable the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN: I have the honor of presenting to the University in behalf of an Alumnus who prefers to withhold his name, a
collection of the complete works of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, the most distinguished Roman engraver of the eighteenth
century. The collection embraces fifteen hundred plates, printed
on folio pages, with an explanatory text. They were executed under the patronage of the papal government.
They are universally regarded as masterpieces of the art of
engraving.  The subjects represented by them are the architectural remains of ancient Rome and many of the most important
medieval and modern works of art in the modern Roman museums and palaces.
This collection is a most valuable accession to the art treasures possessed by the University, and, we have reason to hope, is
the beginning of similar gifts destined to build up, what the University at present much needs, a complete art library. The purchase of the Piranesi collection was made by Professor Elisha
Jones with funds placed in his hands for this purpose during his
recent visit to Rome.
HENRY S. FRIEZE,
Dean Literary Faculty.
At the conclusion of the reading of the above communication, Regent Whitman submitted the following resolution:
Resolved, That the communication from Professor Frieze be
accepted, and 'that he be requested to convey to this unknown
donor the cordial thanks of the Board for his valuable contribution to the Department of Art in this University.

ADJOURNED MEETING.
1886.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,          t
December 7th, 1886.
The Board of Regents assembled in the room of the
President, at 7:00 o'clock P. M.
Present: The President, Regents Grosvenor, Blair, Clark,
Willett, and Field.
Absent: Regents Shearer, Joy, and Whitman..
The meeting was called to order by the President.
Sundry papers which had reached the President, were at
his suggestion, referred  to appropriate Committees of the
Board.
Regent Grosvenor, Chairman of the Finance Committee,
presented and read the following report:
To the Board of Regents:
The Finance Committee herewith present the Treasurer's
statement' of receipts and disbursements for the fiscal year ending
September 30th, 1886, also their estimates of receipts and expenditures for the year ending September 30th, 1887.
Your Committee have caused the books and vouchers of the
Treasurer to be examined and compared with the accounts of the
Secretary and have found satisfactory evidence of the correctness
of the Treasurer's report, although a few vouchers are incomplete
and not in the usual form. The sums involved are small, being
remittances for purchases made in Europe.  The proper vouchers
when received will be placed on file. It will be seen by the
Treasurer's report that there is a larger balance in the Treasury
than was estimated a year ago. This has arisen in part from increased receipts from students' fees and miscellaneous sources, and
in part from a reduction in current expenses. The principal re



76


ADJOURNED MEETING, 1886.


ductions have been made in the estimates for repairs and contingent expenses, for fuel and lights and for chemical laboratory supplies, some of the repairs contemplated having necessarily been
postponed until another year and the exceptionally mild winter of
1885-86 having effected an unexpected saving in fuel.
This apparent gain will be affected in part by an outstanding
indebtedness of about $5,000, as follows: $2,000 for bills already
audited and payable on demand and about $3,000 for fuel and
laboratory supplies purchased and received or in transit, for which
bills have not been audited.
The slight improvement in the condition of the finances has
been accomplished only by the exercise of the most rigid economy,
and the Auditing Board should be heartily commended for their
watchful care in avoiding all unnecessary expenditures and for
enforcing all economies inaugurated by the Board.
In the judgment of your Committee economy must be continued, and appropriations from the Legislature must be secured
to provide for any increase of salaries or of teaching force as well
as for all new buildings or other permanent improvements that
may be needed.
In the estimate of receipts for the ensuing year, the Committee have assumed that the next Legislature will provide at least
the same amount as in former years for the support of the Homoeopathic Medical College, the Hospitals, the College of Dental Surgery and for assistance in the Engineering Laboratory.
The estimate of expenditures includes the usual items. The
sums standing to the credit of the Engineering Laboratory and
of the Libraries are unexpended balances of the appropriations
for those purposes. For anything in excess of these sums we
must depend upon the Legislature.
The estimate of $5,000.00 for the Rogers collection is based on
what was expended for transportation and placing in its present
position the portion already received. The expense attendant
upon the acceptance of Mr. Rogers's munificent gift, and of the
New Orleans Chinese Collection presented by the Chinese Governmnent, it is anticipated will be reimbursed by the Legislature.
Respectfully submitted,
E. O. GROSVENOR, Chairman,
MOSES W. FIELD,
C. J. WILLETT.

submitted in the following paper. (Present, the President and

ANN ARBOR., Mich, Feb I th, 1887.
President James B. Angell:
DEAR SIR:-I am instructed to inform you of the action taken at tihe mteetiln
of the Faculty last evening, Thursday, Feb. 10, in regard to the affairs of the Hospital.
WHEREAS; Accusations of a serious character have been made to variolus
persons in tie community, and have reached the public, of gross mismnanag'nement
in the University Hospital, and on the other hand, charges of outrag(ous impropriety on the part of a subordinate in the Hospital, viz.:
C(harges of having excited patients to complain of their treatment, and of inducing them to make disparaging, exaggerated and false statements, and aiding
them in going out of the Hospital to make such statements. Therefore
Resolved, Thatj the Board of Regents, -or their Executive Committee, be requested to institute as soon as may be a thorough investigation into the facts of the
case, and take such action as justice and the circumstances require.
Yours very respectfully,
WM. A. CAMPBELL, MI. I).

They listened to statements from       members of the Hospital
Committee of the     'aculty, and from   nmembers of the lHospital

MARCH MEETING, 1887.


91


"Certain complaints concerning the management of the University Hospital having been brought to the attention of the Executive Committee, they assembled at the Hospital, and listened to
statements by Dr. Palmer and Dr. Frothingham of the Hospital
Committee of the Faculty, Dr. Chadbourne, House Surgeon, Dr.
Patterson, Ward Master, Ida R. Brigham, M. D., Ward Mistress,
Mrs. -losebrough, Matron, Miss Stoddlarc, M. D., Nurse, Miss
Cutler, Nurse, also to statements of Rev. Dr. Haskell, Miss Brown.
Mrs. Sunderland, and Mrs. Jaycox, residents of Ann Arbor, and to
numerous letters and communications from patients, presented
through the above named persons or otherwise.
After carefully considering all the statements and papers,
tlis committee have come to the conclusion that while there have
been some cases of negligence in the preparation and in the serving of food, tlTere has been no such neglect or mismanagement as
calls for the action of the Board of Regents, but whatever improvements are needed can, they believe, be secured by the exercise of proper supervision on the part of the IHospital Committee,
andl they commend the matter to the careful and continued attention of that Committee."
The Commnittee also accepted the resignation of Miss Brigllam aIs Ward Mistress. They authorized the Auditing Boarc to
supply such additional assistance in the Hospital as was rendered
necessary by the resignation of Miss Brigham.

may approve â€”to be expended for purposes of decoration at that
time.

March 21st, 1887.
l-resident Jas. B. Angell:
DEAR SIR: â€”My assistant, Mr. Chas. K. McGee, is incapacitated for duty on account of sickness. He remained at work substantially during the whole of the tirst semester of this year. He
now desires from the Regents leave of absence for the second
semester of the present college year. I concur in his request and
recommend that it be granted.
Mr. McGee's absence leaves the Department of General Chemistry without an assistant, and compels much of the work which
he ordinarily performed to be omitted.  Another part of this
labor can, however, be done by a comparatively untrained man,
and I therefore recommend that Mr. F. F. Sharpless, an undergraduate, be appointed temporary assistant for the time extending
from March 15th, to June 30th, at a salary of $100,00 payable in
the quarter ending June 30th.
Respectfully yours,

To President Angell:
I have the the honor of submitting the following statement
for your use at the meeting of the Board of Regents this evening.
The books bequeathed to the University by the late Hlon. W.
W. Murphy were delivered into my hands by Mrs. Murphy, in January. The collection consists of 154 volumes, eight pamphlets,
and fifty loose maps of various portions of the Western Continent,
without date, but evidently of the sixteenth century.
Many of the books are old and rare and only at long intervals
are found in catalogues of books for sale. There are also some fine
specimens of early printing. If in collecting, Mr. lMurphy had any
specialty it was chartography. There are about a dozen volumes
on this subject, including several volumes of old alid valuable
maps.
Very respectfully,
R. C. DAVIS, Librarian.
On motion of Regent Blair, the President was requested
to accept the bequest of the late Hon. W. W. Murphy, and to

the same.

JUNE MEETING, 1887.


PRESIDENT'S ROOMS, CORNELL UNIVERSITY, 
ITHACA, N. Y., May 4th, 1887.
To the Honorable the Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN:-Soon after the organization of the School of
Political Science in the University of Michigan, some five years
ago, I received from a personal friend, who was at the same time
an ardent friend of the University, a considerable sum of money,
amounting in all to $4,350, for the purchase of books in the department of History and Political Science.   Accompanying the gift
were two easy conditions, first, that I should purchase with the
money such books as I needed in the department without asking
the advice of any one, and, secondly, that I should not reveal to
any one except the President and the Librarian the name of the
giver. These conditions were complied with. Not long since I
received a letter from my friend of which the following is an extract:
"Some time ago I received your letter with the package of invoices and
vouchers of the books you bought with the money I gave you for the School of Political Science. I have looked over the list. They are a noble lot, and I am very
glad to believe that the money will do as much good as any equal amount I ever expended. I don't know whether the Regents of the University know who Mr. 'X.' is
or not; I see no reason why the matter should now be a secret. I care nothing
about it now one way or the other."
The injunction of secrecy having thus been removed, I take
pleasure in informing your honorable body that the benefactor of
the University was James J. Hagerman, Esq., of the class of '61,
now at Colorado Springs, Col.
Hoping that the books so generously contributed will long
continue to instruct and inspire students of History and Political
Science, and wishing for the University in all of its Departments
the prosperity it so richly deserves, I am
Your obedient servant,
C. K. ADAMS.
Regent Willett submitted       the  following   resolution,
which was adopted unanimously.
WHEREAS, The injunction of secrecy as to the donor of a considerable proportion of the books, purchased for the Department of
History and Political Science, has been removed, as appears from
the letter of President Adams;
Therefore, Resolved, That the thanks of this board be and are
hereby tendered to the liberal donor, James J. Hagerman, Esq., of
Colorado Springs, Col.

The Board of Regents are in receipt of the following communication from Mr. Albert D. Elliott, a graduate of the Law
class of 1887.
ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN,
July 8th, 1887. i
Professor Henry Wade Rogers:
DEAR SIR:-Allow me to present to the Law Department, an
oil portrait of Hon. Thomas M. Cooley, who was for so many years
one of its honored Professors. I feel that the men who helped to
bring such great renown, not only. to the Law Department, but to
the whole University should be remembered. If the portrait of
Judge Cooley encourages like gifts from students or others of the
Alumni, I shall feel amply rewarded. Surely, the students of the
different departments will be benelitted by having before them in
the class room the portraits of those who have given the best years
of their lives to their instruction, and who have achieved greatness
and prominence. The portraits of such men as Judge Cooley,
Judge Campbell, Ex Gov. Felch and others will give birth to higher
thoughts and aspirations.
It is my wish that the portrait of Judge Cooley shall always
adorn the walls of the Law School, for his name and that of the
Law Department of the University of Michigan are inseparable.
Most respectfilly,
ALBERT D. ELLIOTT,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The Board accepts the appropriate gift, and thanking Mr.
Elliott for the same, directs that it be hung upon the walls of the
lecture room of the Law Department, in compliance with the request of the donor.
Regent Clark, Chairman of the Literary Committee, presented and read the following communication from the Professors of Modern Languages.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
MEMORIAL CONCERNING THE DEPARTMENT OF MODERN LANGUJAGES.
To the Honorable the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN:-In view of the great size of the Department of
Modern Languages, and in view of other facts hereinafter set forth,
you are respectfully requested to take into consideration the ex



134


1JULY MiEETING, 1S7.


pediency of dividing the said department and of establishing in lieu
of the present single Professorship of Modern Languages, two
Professorships, one of the Iomance Languages and Literatures,
and one of the Germanic Languages and Literatures.
The Department of Modern Languages is now by far tle
largest in the University. Accurate data for comparison are f-urnished by the following table which gives tle total membership
for the present semester of all the classes in each of the subjects
mentioned.
Greek................  160   Philosophy............  25) Botany................  73
Latin........   54   Pedagogy.............   138Physiology.............  13
Mathematics......... 385  Interr:ational Law....  1l Drawing................ 1 8"
French.............  305  I Physics..  47  ivil Engineering.......  0
German............  35  Chemistry.............. 1  Surveyi ng............  25
Spanish..........  17\ Astronomy............. 174 Mechanical Engineering  93
- Minieralogy...........   16 Metallurgy.............  5
Modern  Languages.. 674  (Geolog..............  4   Musi..................  60
English..............  360  Zoology............  45 Bibliography............ 27
History.....4......... 348
From these figures it will be seen that the classes in Modern
Languages have at the present time an aggregate membership
more than four times as great as in Greek, two and a half times as
great as in Latin or Philosophy, somewhat less than twice as great
as in Mathematics, English or History, and considerably greater
than in all the Physical and Biological Sciences taken together and
including Geology and Mineralogy, a group of subjects represented by eight different professors.
To describe the situation in other words: Were tihe division
made as herein recommended, the classes in German would constitute by themselves one of the four largest departments of thle University, the nmembership of the classes in German nlot differing
materially from that of the classes in Mtathematics, English or
History. The classes in German number twice as many members
as in Greek, a third more than in Latin or Philosophy and from
two to twenty times as many as in any one of the scientific de â€”
partments.
Your attention is further called to the fact that -there is no
such relation between the French alnd German languages as rencers it necessary or even desirable to have them includlec uder a
single professorship. The historical connection between them is
less close than between the (Greek and the Latin, and either French
or German alone presents to the scholar a field wlhich is certainly
no less extensive and varied than that offered by either of the two
classical languages. It is also true that in recent years no branch
of scholarship has grown more rapidly in dignity and importance




JULY 1MEETING, 1887,


than Modern Philology. Both in Europe and in the United States
there has been of late a notable movement for the elevation of
standards of scholarship, and of the relquirements of academic instruction i the  oden Lagun the n  angges.  n the better I niversities of
Germany, the Romance Languages, with their history, comparative
philology, and their literatures, are now usually grouped together
as a single specialty, while the Germanic Languages with their
history, comparative philology, and literatures, constitute anotlelr.
In our own country a similar division of labor is rapidly cominlg to
be the rule. Thus we find at the Johns IIopkins iUniversity an
Associate Professor of Rom-ance Languages and an Associate Professor of German; at Bryn Mawr an Associate Professor of Rlomnance Languages and an Associate Professor of Germanic Languages; at Cornell, a Professor of Romance Languages and t\wo
Professors of the German Language and Literature. At the University of Indiana we find a Professor of Romance Languages and
a Professor of Germanic Languages.
So far as our own lli versity is concerned, a considerable extension of the scope of its instruction is desirable. There should
be cn tinuous instruction in both Italian and Spanish. Opportunity should also be offered as soon as possible to advanced students fur the study of Old French, Provencal and Portuguese, and
also for work in the comparative philology of the 1,omance tongues.
In the Germanic field, more work of a philological character for
advanced students is needed. The first desideratum is probably a
course in Gothic, the oldest known form  of (ermanic speech.
Scarcely less urgent than the Gothic, are the Scandivanian languages, the Old Icelandic, modern Swedish and Danish-Norwegian.  The language of Bjhrnson and Ibsen, the language of
Tegner and Iuneberg hiave, from a literary point of view, the very
highest claims to scholarly attention, while to tne Germanist some
knowledge of the Scandinavian languages is indispensable. Instruction in Gothic and in one or more of the Scandinavian languages, is now offered not only at all the well equipped universities of Germany, but also at many of the better institutions in our
own country.
The intrinsic importance of the modern languages in education is not a matter of dispute. While nothing, save perhaps a knowledge of the mother tongue, can in these days be called an indispensable element of liberal culture, yet a knowledge of French and
German is more and mlore coming to be recognized as an exceed.




i86

ingly desirable element in such culture. Without these languages
the scholar in almost any branch of inquiry is more or less crippled. Leaving aside any comparison with the ancient languages,
the educational or disciplinary value of the study of 'he modern
languages is admitted by all to be very great, and it is destined to
become greater still through the enlargement of the scope of instruction in these studies and through the improvement of pedagogical methods. Unless all the signs of the times are illusory,
the study of modern languages in school, college, and University
has before it a future of greatly increasing value and importance.
Wherever the elective system prevails, these subjects come to the
front; there is a popular demand for them and that demand is not
likely to diminish but rather to become stronger and more proriounced.
Is it not time, therefore, in view of all the considerations
above set forth, that the University of Miclligan should reorganize
its work in Modern Languages to the extent and in the manner
suggested at the beginning of this Memorial, and thus put itself at
once upon the line whic4a the practice of the best institutions is
pointing to as the true line of development for the future?
Respectfully submitted,

CALVIN THOMAS.
IRegent Clark submitted the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Department of Modern Languages be divided, and that, in lieu of the present single Professorship of Modern
Languages, Professor Walter be appointed Professor of the Ilomance Languages and Literatures, anad Professor Thomas as Professor of the Germanic Languages and Literatures, each at a salary
of 32,200 per annum.

The IHomorable the Boaril of Regents:
GENTLSEMEN: â€”The Committee on Pluildilngs and Grounds and
the Committee on Medical Department, to whom was referred
the matter of the Scientific Laboratories aid who were asked also
to report the most expedient and advisablel lan for the use of the
thirty-live thousand dollars appropriated for said laboratories,
would report as follows: viz.
First, as to the proper uses of the appropriation, your comamittees are assured that the intention of the originators of the bill
for the appropriation of,75i,000 -was for a new building and the
equipment of Laboratories for Physics, Hyg'_iene, LPatlology, P)Ihysiology and Histology.
Of this sum one-fifth appears to 1ave been intended for equipment and apparatus, and four-lifths (4-5) for a new buildilng.
As the bill was passed the total sum allowed for the above
named purposes was,35,000. It seems to your Commlittee a proper
interpretation of the intention of the legislatcors to assumi.e, that
the same proportion of the reduced appropria-tion should 'be set

nal sum asked for. That is to say, that 1-5, equal to $i7,000, be allotted to equipment and apparatus, and that this sum be divided
by the Committee on Medical Department after consultation with
the Professors in charge of the laboratories above named, in proportion to their several needs; and that the several portions be expended uinder the supervision of the Auditing Board.
The above disposition leaves four-fifths, equal to $28,000, oi
the appropriation to be applied to the erection and completion of
a new building.
As this sum is much too small to erect a building sufficient to
accommodate all of the laboratories first proposed, your Colmmittees would recommend that a brick building be erected, three stories
in height, and on a plan suited to accommodate at least two (2) of
the laboratories, those of Hygiene and Physics, and that this proposed building shall be respectable and appropriate in design, and
not to exceed in cost the sum of $28,000.
Your Committee submit herewith rough plans for such a
building, which can be modified to suit the several departments.
Y our Committee would further recommend that the remaining laboratories be assigned rooms in the Medical College Building, selecting those that would be most conveniently served by
the present arrangement of rooms in that building; and that said
building be thoroughly cleansed, and be altered as to rooms, cases
&c., to suit the convenience of these departments and their relation to each other.
Also, that the rooms adjoining the elevator and the amphitheatre be thoroughly ventilated, and that all of the renovation,
alterations, ventilation &c., of the Medical College SBuilding Ie

Absent-Regent Draper.
The meeting was called to order and opened with devotional exercises by the President.
On motion of Regent Grosvenor the minutes of the
two preceding meetings were approved as printed.
A number of communications which had reached the
President were, at his suggestion, referred to appropriate
committees of the Board.
The President stated that his annual report had been
prepared and was held subject to the pleasure of the

PRESIDENT'S REPORT.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
I offer you my annual report for the year ending Sept.
30, 1887.
The following changes have occurred in the Faculties:
October 12, Alviso B. Stevens, PH. C., was appointed
Instructor in Pharmacy.




146


OCTOBER MEETING, 1887.


December 7, the title of Acting Professor Spaldiing
was changed to that of Professor of Botany.
December 21, the Executive Committee granted leave
of absence for the rest of the year to Professor T. M.
Cooley, and appointed for the same time William P. Wells
Lecturer on American History and Constitutional Law.
They also appointed J. M. Schaeberle, who was Assistant
in Astronomy, Instructor in Mathematics and Astronomy
for the remainder of the year.
At the March meeting of the Board the above action
of the Executive Committee was ratified. At the same
meeting the resignation of the Jay Professorship of Law
by I1. B. Hutchins, was accepted to take effect on October
1st. It is with regret that we lose from our corps of
teachers Professor Hutchins, who has rendered very valuable services as a member of the Law Faculty and in
former years as a member of the Literary Faculty. Tle
new law school of Cornell University is fortunate in
securing him as one of its professors.
At the June meeting of the Board, Henry C. Adams,
PH. D., who as Lecturer in Political Economy had for six
years given instruction for one semester of each year, was
appointed Professor of Political Economy and Finance and
required to give instruction through the whole year; Assistant Professor W;V.. Benan was appointed Professor
of Mathematics; the title of Professor Morris was changod
fiom Professor of Ethics and History of Philosophy and
Logic to Professor of Philosophy; and Professor Steere
received leave of absence for one year to conduct a scientific expedition to the Spanish East Indies. J. E. Reighard was appointed Acting Assistant Professor of Zoology
during the absence of Professor Steere. The following
appointments of instructors for one year were made:
Arthur AV. Burnett, Instructor in English; Andrew C.
McLaughlin, Instructor in History; Walter Miller, Instructor in Latin; S. W. Clary, Instructor in Modern Lan

guages; J. M. Schaeberle, Instructor in Astronomy;
Ludovic Estes, Instructor in Mathematics; F. L. Washburn, Instructor in Zoology.
At the July meeting of the Board the resignation of
B. C. Burt, Assistant Professor of English and Rhetoric,
was offered and accepted.
The University sustained a heavy loss in the death of
Professor Olney, which occurred on the sixteenth of January.  He had filled the chair of Mathematics since
1863.  He had thus given nearly twenty-four of the
ripest years of his life to the service of this institution.
Few of its professors have contributed more to its usefulness and its reputation. As a teacher of' Mathematics his
gifts were remarkable. IHe awakened in his classes a
genuine enthusiasm in his favorite science. The number
of students who chose the elective courses which he
offered was always large. His methods of instruction
were so simple and lucid and charming that I have heard
his pupils say thlat the art of teaching could nowhere be
better learned than in his class-room. His mathematical
writings won for him an enviable reputation, and reflected honor on the University. But his interest in the
University was by no means confined to his class-room.
He took broad views of the work and policy of the University. He was largely instrumental in introdlucing the
various changes, which during thle last twenty years have
so widened and enlarged and enriched the teachings in
the Literary Department, and have brought that department into so fruitful relation with the schools and with
the public. He was always among the foremost in laboring for the moral and religious upbuilding of his pupils.
His activity both with voice and with pen in all moral
and religious enterprises, whether designed for the welfare
of the students or for tlat of the wider public, helped to
win favor for the University which he represented. His
earnest, positive, forceful character was a power for good

which was recognized far beyond the limits of his personal acquaintance. It is such men as he who are the
true builders of a University.
Below is given the list of degrees which have been
conferred. In accordance with the usage of Universities,
we mark our semi-centennial year by bestowing a much
larger number of honorary degrees than we are accustomed to confer. The policy of this institution in respect
to honorary degrees has been very conservative. It has
recognized the propriety of acknowledging distinguished
merit by academic distinctions, as the great Universities
of the world have long done, but it has selected a very
small number in each year as the recipients of such an
honor.  For the past ten years it has abstained from
giving degrees " in course."

The number of students exceeded that of the year

year, was in the Literary Department, 97, and in the Law
Department, 52. There was, however, a gain in every
Department except in that of Medicine and Surgery, which
lost six. As in the year 1885-6, we were gratified by the
large accessions to the Literary Department from other
colleges. About fifty were received from other institutions

of collegiate rank. No better evidence can be furnished
of the reputation which our advanced courses of instruction are giving to the University. With our elective system, our laboratories, and our means of illustrating higher
instruction, we may well hope to attract many students,
who have completed the more elementary studies in the
smaller colleges, and who desire to procure for the latter
part of their course the ampler range which is afforded
here. It is our true policy, indeed it is our duty, while
abating no jot of our thoroughness in the fundamental
work of the first two years, to do all in our power to enrich and enlarge the higher work of the undergraduates,
and the work of our resident graduates. It should not escape our attention that the number of graduates studying
either in residence or in absentia was forty-two. The
stimulating and lifting power of the presence of a body
of graduate students on the general spirit and life of the
University is very considerable.  It is highly gratifying
to see so many of the scholarly graduates of this and
of other institutions pushing their studies under our guidance far beyond the range of the undergraduate curriculunm.
In this connection we may properly recognize with
grateful appreciation the effort which the alumni are
makilng to establish one or more fellowships, to be tenable
by our graduates. The generous friends of the University
can most effectively contribute to its usefulness and to the
promotion of advanced scholarship by endowing fellowships, yielding from four hundred to six hundred dollars a
year. Such assistance will enable a few gifted scholars to
remain for a period after graduation and receive the
amplest culture which we can here impart.
It must, however, be remembered by us that the development of the post-graduate work makes larger demands
on the time of the Professors and so increases the necessity
of giving them more help for the instruction of the under



OCTOBER MAEETING, 1887.


151


graduates. Indeed the increase of the number of undergraduates by nearly one hundred this last year has made
this necessity so apparent, that the legislature has readily
made a timely appropriation for an addition to our force
of instructors. But an increase in the number of ograduate
students, no two of whom, it may be, are pursuing the same
line of studies, entails upon the Professors a much larger
proportionate increase of labor than the addition of an
equal or a much larger number of undergraduates.
The number of women in attendance during the past
year was as follows:
Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts  175
Department of Medicine and Surgery --- â€” 51
Department of Law                            --

College of Dental Surgery â€”                       4
Total â€”.        -â€”. 265
The number of women present was greater by 36 than
in the previous year. The number in attendance in the
Literary Department was greater by 40, and in the Homceopathic College greater by 7, and in the Department of
Medicine and Surgery less by 10 than in the previous year.
In the other Departments the difference was unimportant.
The women form sixteen and eight-tenths per cent. of' the
whole number of students. Last year they formed sixteen
and three-tenths per cent. There is therefore the slight
proportionate gain of one-half of one per cent. The largest
absolute and proportionate increase we find in the Literary
Department. Twenty-five per cent. of the students in that
Department are women. That is a proportionate increase
of two and a half per cent. as compared with the previous
year.
For a few years after women were admitted, it used to
be said, and with some truth, that our students' of that sex




152

were women of exceptional ability and force of character,
since others did not venture to come. Their success in
study, which could not be questioned, was ascribed to this
fact. It was urged by those who doubted the expediency
of receiving women, that when young women should come
in larger numbers, including those of average ability as
well as those of exceptional talent, embarrassments would
occur and the impolicy of admitting them would become
manifest. It is apparent that we are now put to the test
thus predicted. But the unfortunate results prophesied
have not appeared. We have indeed some women, as we
have some men, not eminent in scholarship. But no embarrassments of administration due to that fact have presented themselves. Nor can any inferences against receiving women into our class-rooms be properly made from
the fact. The womei who partially or wholly fail in their
work meet with the same fate as the men who have the
same difficulties. They neither ask nor expect any discriminations in their favor because they are women. But
the results of our experience has been confirmed at colleges
and universities on both sides of the Atlantic-and strikingly so in the great English Universities recently-where
women by their brilliant success have shown their ability
without risk to their health to meet the severest tests of
scholarship to which the male students are subjected. And
what is perhaps of equal importance, the advantaes derived from the University courses have proved as helpful
to the women in their lives subsequent to graduation as to
the men.
There is little in the history of the IHomoeopathic College, the School of Pharmacy, and the Dental College
during the past year, which calls for special comment.
They have each enjoyed a good degree of prosperity. I
can only repeat what I have said in previous reports concerning the need of larger accommodations for the Dental

College, if it is to receive all the students who desire to
matriculate. Its rooms are now uncomfortably crowded.
In the Law Department the experiment of grading the
course has been successful in a gratifying degree. Both
teachers and students heartily approve of it. More thorough, systematic, and efficient work is secured by it. The
instruction is to be enriched during the coming year by
brief courses of lectures on various subjects by distinguished specialists. We may well believe, therefore, that
the reputation of the Law School, which had so prosperous
a life from its foundation, will be deservedly enhanced
during the coming year.
The Department of Medicine and Surgery has had a
fairly prosperous year. It has been somewhat agitated by
the discussion in the public press and otherwise of the
proposition to provide in Detroit for the chief part of the
clinical instruction.  Since a special committee of the
Board is charged with the consideration of the subject, I
refrain from a discussion of the proposition, but feel it my
duty to say that in my judgment the good of the school
requires that some decision should be reached by the Board
as early as possible. While the matter is under discussion,
the uncertainty concerning our future plans has an injurious
effect on the school.
The reports of the Curators of our Museums show a
steady, but not very rapid increase of some of our collections during the past year.  A very large accession of
plants from the Lake Superior region, the gift of Mr. Frank
E. Wood, a former student of the University, has been received. The Museum of Applied Chemistry has been increased by the addition of 417 specimens, chiefly articles
which illustrate the more important chemical industries.
There is a need of cases for the Materia Medica collections
of the Department of Medicine and Surgery, which are
now stored in closets in the Chemical Laboratory. The

Curator of the mineralogical collection repeats a suggestion
before made that a small sutm be annually placed at his
disposal for the purchase of specimens. It is much to be
regretted that we have so far been unable to purchase the
very valuable Rominger collection of paleontological
specimens. The Curator of the Art lMuseum reports tile
following additions to the art collection: a portrait bust
of the Hon. James McMillan, presented by himself at the
request of the President of the University; a full length
oil portrait of Dr. George P. Williamls, painted by A. 0.
Revenaugh and presented by him; an oil portrait of Professor Olney, presented by the last graduating class of the
Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts; an oil
portrait of Professor C. L. Ford, presented by students of
the Medical and Dental Departments; an oil portrait of
Dr. H. S. Frieze, presented by Win. E. Quimby, Esq., of
Detroit; a model in plaster of the Acropolis of Athens,
made by Eichler, of Berlin, purchased by Prof. D'Ooge
with an appropriation made by the Regents. We have received information that another installment of the Rogers
collection of statuary may be expected during the coming
year.
A few facts from the Librarian's report which will be
submitted to you may properly be given here. The total
number of works in all our libraries is now 62,39S volumes,
12,411 unbound pamphlets, and 2G64 charts. Nearly twice
as many volumes were presented last year as were purchased. The most important gifts were the GermanAmerican Goethe Library, containing now 760 volumes,
and the collection bequeathed by the late W. W. IMurphy,
Esq., formerly Consul-General of the United States at
Frankfort-on-the-Main, which is especially rich in cartography. The total number of books drawn last year was
89,445 volumes. Few, if any, libraries are so much used.
The revised card catalogue of authors is nearly completed,
and that of subjects is now to be undertaken.

The Williams Fund, raised by alumni and friends of the
University, primarily for assistance to the late Professor
George P. Williams, and then to establish some memnorial
for him, has by the action of the Alumni Association of
the Literary Department become a virtual addition to the
endowment funds of the University.  At the request of
that Association, the Regents voted in Mlarch to establish
an emeritus Williams Professorship on the plan set forth
in the following statement of the Association.
"It seems desirable that a Professor who may have
reached the period and condition for service at which Dr.
Williams had arrived when he received the proceeds and
income of this fund, should at the request of the Alumni
or Board of Directors be transferred from his own chair to
the Williams Professorship, which should be an emeritus
professorship, and should thereupon receive the income of
the said fund or so mnuch thereof as the Society of Alumni
should annually vote to him, or the Board of Directors
should deem advisable, and should there be more than one
needing the benefit of this fund at the same time, the professor first transferred or appointed should hold the professorship and the others in order, first, second, and third
assistants."
About fifteen thousand dollars have been paid to the
treasurer of the fund, and when other subscriptions thought
to be good are paid, the fund will reach the sum of at least
twenty thousand dollars. It is possible that the decision of
the Alumni and the Board to use it for this worthy purpose
may lead ultimately to the enlargement of the fund. We
have several Professors who have given more than a quarter of a century to the service of the University. It mlust
henceforth not unfrequently happen that of our large staff
of teachers, some by reason of disease or accident, or the
infirmities of years will be unable to discharge the full
duties of Professors, and will yet find that at least a partial
support for themselves and families must be had from some




156


OCTOBER MEETING, 18S7.


other source than from the increase of the scanty accumulation which meagre salaries have yielded. This fund will
be used to render them assistance when aid is needed to
cheer their declining years. It must be that so worthy an
object will appeal to the generosity of the graduates who
are inspired with affection and gratitude for their venerable
teachers.
The Legislature at its last session made appropriations
as follows, in aid of the University:  For repairs, 1887,
$5,000; 1888, $5,000; for contingent expenses, 1887, $6,250;
1888, $6,250; for books for libraries, 1887, $5,000; 1888,
$5,000; for the homceopathic college and hospitals, 1887,
$6,200; 188S, $6,200; for the university hospital, 1887, $5,000; 1888, $5,000; for the dental college, 188S, $8,000;
1888, $8,000; for apparatus for the department of natural philosophy, 1887, $2,000; 1888, $2.000; for defraying the expenses of transportation and placing of the
Rogers collection of statuary, 1887, $1,973.01; for reimbursing the University for expenses of transportation
and placing of the Chinese exhibit, 1887, $1,792.93; for
construction of a vault for the storage of chemicals,
1887, $400; for construction of rooms for forge and foundry
and equipment of the same, 18S7, $5,000; 188S, $4,250;
for machinery for engineering laboratory, 1887, $6,750;
for the construction of a building for scientific laboratories and equipment of the same, 1887, $35,000; for
the erection of a boiler house, the purchase of boilers
and of steam  heating connections, 1887, $15,000; for
additional salaries and teaching force, 1887, $5,000; 1888,
5,000. The entire appropriation is, 1887, $108,365.94; 1888,
$46,700. Total, $155,065.94.
By this generous action of the Legislature we are enabled not only to carry on our varied work as we have
done hitherto, but also to make much needed enlargements of our accommodations. The coimpletion of the
engineering laboratory, according to the original plan, will




OCTOBER MEETING, 1887.


157


enable us to provide for all our students of engineering the
instruction in mechanical processes needed by them. The
erection of a new boiler house makes it possible to furnish
heat economically and safely to the group of buildings
east and south of the library. The construction of the
buildings, which shall contain the physical laboratory and
the hygienic laboratory, will enable us to give in a more
efficient manner than before the instruction in physics and
hygiene. Our provisions for laboratory instruction in phlysics have been far inferior to those of many other institutions, and inferior to our provisions for instruction in other
branches of science. It will be our duty now to see that
our new laboratory is kept furnished with the appliances
needed for the best instruction in this fundamental scientific branch. Researches, which have proved of the very
highest importance to the public, have already have been
conducted by our Professor of Hygiene, and we may confidently expect that our new laboratory of hygiene will not
only be of great service in instructing our students, but
will also be instrumental in promoting the sanitary interests of the state and the country.
It having been found advisable to furnish in the medical building ampler accommodation for the physiological
and microscopical laboratories, we were forced to erect a
new building for our anatomical work, and to make large
changes in the medical building. This has entailed an expense for which no provision had been made by special
appropriation. But the necessity was so pressing that the
wisdom of the step taken cannot be questioned. We gain
the great incidental advantage of securing improved sanitary conditions for the medical building by the removal
from it of all the work of dissection. Never before was it
so well fitted for its purpose as it is now.
Discussions in the Legislature and in the public press
have called attention afresh to the question whether the
fees of non-resident students ought to be raised. The
Board has frequently considered this subject and has in

creased them from time to time. In my annual report for
1885, I set forth in detail the consequences of the increase
which had been made in the fees in 1881.  I may repeat
here the figures then given and add the statistics for the
last year.

The fees paid by non-resident students in 1881-2
amounted to $21,100. In 1884-5, the rate having for three
years been increased, the sum received from them   was
only $21,800. The number of non-resident students in
1881-2 has not yet been reached again, although the total
attendance has been greater during the past year. That
class of students numbered 65 less last year than it
did five years before. The following tabular statement of
students' fees for the past year is instructive in this connection. It comprises the matriculation an'd annual fees
alone, but omits the laboratory and graduation fees. These
two last are divided relatively between resident and nonresident students in substantially the same proportion as
the two former kinds of fees.

These statements make it very clear that we may
easily increase the fees of non-resident students so rapidly
as to incur not only a serious loss in attendance, but an
actual pecuniary loss. As a matter of fact, wherever instruction is given by lectures, as it is mainly in the
professional schools and to a considerable extent in the
Literary Department, the instruction of the non-resident
students adds little or nothing to the expense required
for thle instruction of the Michigan students alone. It
is well known that almost without exception for many
years the fees from the non resident students in the
Law School have more than met the entire cost of
instruction in the school.  Take the figures in that
school for the  last year as   an illustration.  The
fees of the non-resident law students amounted to $11,500,
and the total expenditure for salaries of instructors in the
Law Department was only $10,100. It will be observed,
also, that in the Department of Medicine and Surgery,
the fees paid by the non-resident students amount to
nearly twice as much of those of the Michigan students, in
the Law Depailrtment nearly four times as rimuch, a1nd in
the whole University seventy-five per cent more. It is
doubtful whether tile total expense of giving as good an
education as we now give, would be diminisled by ten
thousand dollars a year, if all the non-resident students
were excluded and the present number of Michigan students were in attendance. Since the fees received from
them last year were $34,980, it is clear that on0 tlie present
scale of fees they are a source of profit rather than loss to
the treasury.
Nor in considering this subject can we ever permit
ourselves to forget that our original and chief permanent
endowmlent was the gift of the United States, and that
therefore there rests on us the obligation to treat generously students from all parts of tlhe Union. Furthermore,
the presence of students from other States than our own,




160


OCTOBER 3EEETINVG, 1887.


contributes very greatly to the reputation of the University, and awakens a pride in it among our own citizens, and
so attracts to its halls many Michigan students, who would
otherwise go elsewhere for their education.  This cosmopolitan life which the presence of students from all parts
of the world gives to the University, is of inestimable
value to the Michigan student by giving him an acquaintance with men of so many varieties of early traiiing. In
this microcosm he acquires a breadth of culture and fulness
of experience which are of the greatest service in preparing him for his subsequent career.  If unhappily a policy
should ever be adopted which should deprive us of the
presence of non-resident students, the University would
then become a local school with a narrow reputation and
a restricted influence.
It may be thought, it has sometimes been said, that
we do not now charge the non-residents as much as other
institutions, and therefore that we may well raise our
fees. On examination of the facts it will be found that
we now charge higher fees than the other State Universities. Bearing in mind that our charges to non-residents
are as follows: Literary Department, first year, $55, each
subsequent year, $30; Professional Schools, first year, $t60,
each subsequent year, $35, let us notice the charges at
some other western universities.

161


It will be readily seen that in most of the above
institutions the fees are materially smaller than ours.
Any important increase in our charges must tend to prevent students from most of the States in which they are
established from coming to us.
But we are told that whatever are the facts in the
west, the fees in the eastern colleges are much larger than
ours. Let us notice what are the fees in a few representative institutions.
Cornell University                         $ 75 a year.
Williams College ___90 a year.
Brown University._..                      100 a year.
Amherst College......-~~~ 110 a year.
Yale College, Literary   --          -      125 a year.
"I    "   Law -.-                         100 a year.
" 'i      Medical                         125 a year.
Harvard University, Literary           --   150 a year.
iL 6" Law ---                     -       150 a year.
"        "    Medical --                200 a year.
These charges are indeed larger than ours. But it
must be remembered that all these institutions and the
eastern colleges generally have funds for the pecuniary
assistance of students and that in each of them a large
proportion of the students receive enough to pay for their
tuition, and in some cases more than that, while we have
no provision for remitting the fees to any student. Cornell University, for instance, has 512 state scholarships,
giving free tuition to the holders, nine university scholarships, yielding $200 a year, eight fellowships for graduates,
ielding $400 a year, and tuition is free to graduate
students. Williams College has funds which enable it to
give to each of fifteen or twenty men $150 a year, to each
of twelve more $105 a year, to each of eight more $120 a
year, and to fifty or sixty others the tuition, $90 a year,
About one hundred students of the entire number, two
hundred and seventy, more than one-third of all, are thus
aided. Other assistance is also given in certain cases.

OC'TO BER IfEETING, 1887.


Brown University has a fund of over $152,000, the proceeds of which are given in various ways in aid of students. Amherst College.distributes $8000 a year in
scholarships and over $1,600 a year in prizes. Yale University aids 120 students annually with scholarships,
yielding from $60 to $200, and 25 other students with
scholarships or fellowships conferred for proficiency in
studies, and yielding from $55 to $600 each9 and distributes $1,000 annually in prizes. Harvard- University
now distributes to students $66,000 a year, a sum larger
than our total receipts from students. The authorities of
that institution announce officially that no young man of
marked ability and good character need stay away from
Harvard on account of poverty. Every such person who
wishes to study there is assured that he shall receive the
aid needed to enable him to complete his course. It will
be seen from these facts that it is utterly misleading to
infer from the published rates of tuition in the eastern
colleges that they are receiving twice or thrice as much as
we from their students because their nominal fees are
twice or thrice as large as ours. It may well be that a
student who receives the income from some of the scholarships or fellowships in one of these colleges is subjected
to less expense than the average undergraduate here.
Upon consideration of all the facts 1 think we must conclude that if we have regard to the fees charged by other
colleges and Universities9 or to our own experience in
rai-sing the -fees of non-resident. students we cannot safely
ask more at present of our neon-resident students.
It is sometimes said that t[le University is the school
of the rich rather than of pupils in moderate circumstances. It is occasionally spoken of tauntingly by those not
familiar with its interior life as "aristocratic"'~ I made an
effort last autumn to gather statistics concerning the pu'rsuits of the parents of our students. I sent a circular to
each student asking him to inform me what was the occu

pation of his father.  I received answers from   1,406
persons. Of the pursuits most largely represented I give
the figures as follows: Farmers, 502; merchants, (the
term is used in the west to describe retail tradesmen as
well as wholesale dealers), 171; lawyers, (including six
professors), 93; physicians, 83; manufacturers, 52; mechanics, 54; clergymen, 51; real estate and insurance
agents, 33; bankers and brokers, 28; teachers, 26; lumbermen, 24; contractors and builders, 17; salesmen, clerks,
and book keepers, 17; druggists and chemists, 16; tailors,
15; dealers in live stock, 14; millers, 14; commercial
travelers, 14; dentists, 12; common laborers, 8.
Most persons will be surprised to see how greatly the
number of farmers' children exceeds every other class.
If we assume that the farmers gain their living by manual
toil, and add to them the other classes who unquestionably support themselves by physical labor, I estimate
that the fathers of 45 per cent. of the students who
reported may properly be considered as thus gaining their
livelihood. Of course the classification thus obtained is
only approximately correct. Some of the farmers probably are not subjected to strenuous toil. On the other
hand, many of those classed as merchants, retail grocers,
for instance, lead alife which is physically as fatiguing and
as truly devoted to manual labor as is the life of the carpenter. But certainly the figures do show what everyone
familiar with our students knows to be true, that the sons
and daughters of the rich do not form a very large percentage of the whole number. A very large proportion of
our undergraduates have by hard toil and great selfdenial earned the means to support themselves in whole
or in large part while here. Not a few continue to remain
here only by the practice of an economy which too often
endangers their health.
I desire to make grateful mention in this report of the
efforts which Christian churches are making for the spirit



164


OCTOBER MEETINGG,1887.


ual culture of our students. The churches in this city have
always manifested the warmest interest in the welfare of
the students, and have spared no pains to make this place
a home, in which wholesome and helpful, social and moral
influences should be extended upon the great company of
young men and young women who gather under our roof.
But recently there have been manifestations of a wider
and deeper interest in them. Large-hearted communicants of the Protestant Episcopal church have erected a
fine building to serve as a special religious home for
students and have provided for courses of lectures on
religious themes by eminent men. The Presbyterians
are making arrangements for occupying with a similar end
in view a comodious house, which a generous woman has
placed at their disposal. There is also good ground to
hope that the efforts to secure the funds for the erection
and endowment of a suitable building for the Students'
Christian Association are soon to be crowned with success
While we believe we are right in not compelling the
attendance of students on religious services, we are pro
foundly appreciative of all the assistance we receive in
furnishing them with the means of spiritual culture, which
is the crown of all culture. The conditions of life here
now are, as we think, most friendly to the moral and
spiritual growth of all connected with the University.
The semi-centennial celebration of the founding of
the University was a memorable occasion. The attendance of the alumni and friends of the institution equalled
our highest anticipations. A considerable number of the
most important American colleges and universities were
represented by delegate's. Most cordial greetings were
sent to us from the great universities beyond the sea. The
devotion and enthusiasm of the many friends of the University were so pleasantly manifested that we cannot see
her enter upon her second half century without new hope
and cheer. The progress of the arts and the sciences, the

fairly satisfactory manner. We have the fullest confidence.

On motion of Regent Whitman the Board listened to
the foliowing report of the Librarian:
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Mlchigan:
Gentlemen: I have the honor to submit for your consideraation my report on the Libraries of the University for theyear
1886-87.
The University possessed, Sept. 30, 1887, 62,398 volumes, 12,411 unbound pamphlets, and 264 charts.
Of these there are in the General Library, 48,971 volumes,
11,549 pamphlets, and 264 maps; in theLaw Library, 9,565 volumes; in the Medical Library, 3,447 volumes and 862 pamphlets; in the Library of the Dental College, 415 volumes.
THE GENERAL LIBRARY.
The additions to the General Library during the year have
been 1,804 volumes and 245 pamphlets.' Of these, 419 volumes
and 24 pamphlets were purchased; 1,093 volumes and 221
pamphlets were presented, and 292 were the result of binding
periodicals.
The expenditures, exclusive of bills of transportation which
do not reach me, have been $1,802.17. Of this sum, $902.64 were




166


OCTOBER MEETING, 1887.


paid for books and pamphlets, $4q3.93 for subscriptions to periodicals, and $306.55 for binding and mending. These sums were
paid out of the special appropriation of the Legislature for the
purchase of books for the year 1886. In addition there was paid
out of the current expense fund for catalogue cards, tickets for
readers, labels for books, etc., $129.05.
The sum at the command of the Library Committee for the
purchase of books during the year, was very small. The greater
part of the appropriation for 1886 was expended during the early
part of that year, and the appropriation for 1887 was not made
early enough to be of any use before the closing of college.
We owe it, therefore, entirely to the generosity of the friends of
the University that our acquisitions for the year have been at
all respectable in extent. Almost twice as many volumes were
presented as were acquired in all other ways. The more important gifts are the " German-American Goethe Library," and
the " Murphy Collection." The history of the Goethe Library
-its inception, and the progress made in securing funds-was
given in the report of last year. It numbers now 625 volumes,
and there are on the way from Germany a case containing 135
volumes more.
The "Murphy Collection " was bequeathed to the Library
by the late W. W. Murphy, Esq., formerly Consul General of
the United States at Frankfort-on-the-Main. The extent of the
collection is 154 volumes, 8 pamphlets, and 51 loose maps. A
great many departments of literature are represented. That in
which there are the most books is cartography, and in this direction the collection may fairly be called rich. A list of all the
persons who have made less important, but yet very valuable,
gifts, would be too long for this report. ~ If it were given, however, nearly all the names that have appeared in this connection
in former reports, would again appear, and there would also be
new ones.
I have in every case made that grateful acknowledgement
that the rules require and that one's feelings prompt. It is
proper to refer in this coilnection to what was revealed to the
Board last summlner-viz.-that the unknown friend whose:renerosity supplied the volumes that fill the cases in the East
Seminary Room, is Mr. James J. Hagerman, of the Class of '61.
This is not the first time that Mr. Hagerman has given substantial proof of his interest in Alma Mater.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1887.

The statistics show that the Library was used more this
year than last.
The number of books drawn and used in the Reading Room
was      ---------------- -           87,500
The number drawn out by Professors -------------   1,945
A total of -- ---------â€” 89,445 volumes.
Tickets of admission to the bookroom were granted to sixteen persons who made 388 visits to the shelves. In the course
of the year 247 students were admitted to the Seminary 'Rooms
-184 to the West Room for the study of English Literature,
Latin, Greek, and Art, and 89 to the East Room for the study of
History, Political Economy, Philosophy, and the Art of Teaching.
A few volumes have disappeared, but their reappearance is
hoped for. One of the seven reported missing last year, viz.:
Fairbairn's " Studies in the Philosophy of Religion and History," was found when the last annual inspection was made.
The books are, very generally, in good condition.
The chief work of the year, outside of what may be called
the routine of duties, has been on the catalogue. The new case,
authorized by the Board, was ready for the reception of cards at
the beginning of the year. The object to be gained by the construction of a new case, and by the transcription of the old
cards, was a better working catalogue. The changes that have
been made, both of a mechanical nature, and in the system,
promise very good results. The revision and transcription of
the catalogue of authors is nearly completed. In a few days we
hope to place the case in position for use.
The revision and transcription of the catalogue of subjects
will constitute the chief work of the present year.
The fact that this is thle semi-centennial year of the University will justify me, I think, in reviewing briefly the history
of the Library, in this report. I shall also present, as definitely
as I can, the present condition and needs of the Library, and
make some suggestions for the future.
The first period in this history of the Library was from 1837
to 1857., There were at the later date 6,000 volumes in the collection. It could hardly be said of them that they were shelved.
The use made of them was small. Students were allowed to
draw and have at one time ten volumes-provided, that the
faculty had "directly specified" that the books drawn were




168


OCTOBER MEETING, 1887.


suitable ones. It is on record that the members of the faculty of
that time were of the opinion that there were very few books
in the Library " which would be useful to students in their
collegiate course." As far-as this first period can be characterized, it was a period of accumulation-but not very rapid accumulation, even for the time. There was no Librarian, in the
proper sense of the word.
The second period extended from 1857 to 1864. At the
former' date the books were shelved in connection with a reading room, and the Library became one of reference. A librarian
with regularly defined duties was appointed, and the Library
opened for consultation every day. A voluntary use of the
books by the students that was large and gratifying, began at
once. Facilities for learning what was in the collection, however, there were none-no catalogue. This period may be characterized as a period of awakening. The librarians were Mr.
John L. Tappan, 1857-63, and Mr. Datus C. Brooks, 1863-64.
The library contained at the last date, 1864, 12,000 volumes.
The third period extended from 1865 to 1877 and covers the
time during which the librarianship was held by Professor Andrew Ten Brook. During this time a key to tie collection was
prepared-a card catalogue. This increased, as might be expected, that voluntary use of the books to which reference has
been made. It was in this period that the first important gift of
books was made to the Library by an individual-viz., the Rau
Library presented by Hon. Philo Parsons, and now known as
the Parsons Library. I characterize this period as one of general growth-growth in facilities for learning what was in the
collection-growth in use, and growth, in a moderate degree, in
extent. The number of volumes in 1877 was 23,500, and 7,000
unbound pamphlets.
The fourth period extends from 1877 to the present timejust a decade. It has been a period of accumulation. Care has
been taken to keep up and to improve the catalogue, and the
use of the books by the students has been in every way encouraged, but those charged with the interests of the Library have,
for reasons to appear immediately, regarded accumulation as the
duty lying most heavily upon them. The principal events of
the ten years have been the regular annual appropriations by
the Legislature of the State for the purchase of books; the erection of the Library building; large and valuable gifts of books




OCTOBER M3EETING, 1887.


169


from individuals, singly and associated; and the beginning of a
prescribed use of the books-a use required of the student by his
instructor. To supply books for this use is the great function of
a University Library.
This fourth period is identical with my own connection
with the Library as chief. Its history not only illustrates how
necessary accumulation, which I have said has been foremost in
our.minds, has been, but it illustrates also, how inadequate all
the additions we have been able to make, are, to keep the Library up with the demands upon it that have been created by
the growth of the University during this time. How great this
growth has been is apparent from the following facts: In 1879 a
"Chair of the Science and the Art of Teaching" was established;
in 1880 a " Department of Music "; in 1881 a " School of Political Science," and a " Department of Mechanical Engineering;"
and in 1885 a " Biological Laboratory " for experimental work.
The Post Graduate work which was contemplated when the
University began her career, and which has never been lost
sight of, had its beginning practically in this last decade. The
widest range is given to these students in their choice of work.
But limitations in that choice are reached, as soon as, in arrangemnent of details, an account is taken of books. In some
cases there is not a volume; in others only a few-in very few
cases are there all that are necessary. Of this class of students
there were resident in the city last year, twenty-four.
This decade has also witnessed a great change in undergraduate work. The student instead of learning his lessons
from one book which is his own property, learns it from a number of library books to which he is referred by his instructor.
This is true in a large degree of the undergraduate pursuing the
old prescribed studies, as well as true of him who pursues the
more recent elective studies.
Now there has been no proportionate increase of the library
fund.  The representatives of the new departments of Teaching, Music, Policical Science, Mechanical Engineering, and Biology, finding the literature on their subjects wanting, camne
one after the other to the Library Committee for books. The
Professors having in hand the work of the post graduates, and
those who have adopted the new methods of seminary instruction, pressed, all of them, for more material. The committee,
in consequence, has continually spread the fund over more and




170


OCTOBER MEEIING, 1887.


more ground, until it has become lamentably thin. Meanwhile,
the committee has studied laboriously to make the money go as
far as possible, and, I think, have performed miracles in that
direction. They have vastly increased the tale of bricks-to use
an old illustration-without much increase of clay and straw.
It is on account of this conscientious labor of the committee,
and its results, that I have characterized this period as one of
accumulation. Everything has been done, except to go out on
the highway with a pistol, and call on the passers-by to stand
and deliver. I confess that it has occurred to me to do this.
The needs of the Library at present are, in Literatnre, the
best editions of the standard authors, and the critical literature
that has grown up around the works respectively. Some authors we do not possess at all, of others only one or two works,
of a very few only, full representations. In History and Political Science we lack especially serial publications and documents.  Mr. Freeman, the eminent historian, says in his
" Methods of Historical Study "-" The one foundation of learning is the mastery of original texts. That must come first;
there is much for the student himself, much for the tutor and
professor, to add in the way of comment and illustration and
comparison of text with text. But knowledge of a man's books
is the beginning, the foundation, the absolutely needful thing,
without which all the rest is vanity."' He reiterates this, adding, satirically, that even all that the " newest German book"
can tell himr, will not much avail the student without a knowledge of original authorities. We have portions of some of these
authorities, but not the means of completing them. In the
Sciences, pure and applied, the case is much the same.
Now how shall our slender resources â€”slender for the demand that is made upon thern â€”be increased? I think a better
knowledge of us on the part of the people of the State would
help us. The general impression in regard to the Library at
present is that it is restricted in its use to the officers and students of the University-or, if others are admitted to its privileges, it is on the payment of a fee-things that are true of many
college libraries.  I think our treatment by the public, directly, and indirectly through the Legislature, will be more
generous if it is generally known that the Library is a free reference Library, and that it is open for consultation twelve out
of the twenty-four hours of the day. The inventor working to




OCTOBER IMEETING, 1887.


171


improve mechanical and chemical processes, needs access to the
Patent Office Reports of all countries. If he knows that the
Library is open to himn, and that he is welcome to the use of all
the Reports we have-all the books that we have that can help
him in any way,-he will feel a personal interest in the increase
of the number of them. This is true of all who work with
books for any purpose-and they are more or less numerous in
any community. Really, the University Library is the Public
Library of the State, for the increase of knowledge. The cooperation of all, in every effective way, is asked for making known
this true character of the Library. If this is done, I predict for
him who shall stand in my place fifty years hence, and report
on the Libraries of the University on her Centennial year-I
predict for him a pleasant duty, and for the Library under his
charge, a proud record.
THE MEDICAL LIBRARY.
During the year just ended, the Medical Library has had
only sufficient money to pay for its periodicals, its binding, and
for the series of works, such as the Sydenham  Society publications, and the Dictionnaire des Sciences Medicales, to which
it has long been a subscriber. The additions for the year have
been eighty-seven volumes and twenty pamphlets. Of these,
fourteen volumes were purchased, eight volumes and twenty
pamphlets presented, and sixty-five volumes were the result of
binding periodicals. The total of bills paid has been $377.38.
Classified, the sums of this were as follows:
For books-whole volumes and parts of volumes ----------- $103.30
Subscriptions to Periodicals. â€” --------------------  95.88
Binding -------------------------------              78.20
The members of the Board will retmember that they assigned $1,000 of the Legislative appropriation for the present
year, to this Library. With this we shall be able to extend and
strengthen the collection not a little.
The additions to the Law Library have been 315 volumes;
to the Library of the Dental College, 11 volumes.
Certain changes have taken place in the force e gaged in
the General Library. Mr. G. F. James, general assistant, has
been succeeded by Mr. F. N. Scott. Mr. A. J. Lovell and Mr.
G. W. Lacea, assistants in charge of the Seminary Rooms, have




172


OCTOBER MEETING, 1887.


been succeeded by Mr. P. M. Hickey and Mr. F. F. Lehman.
Mr. D. C. Worcester and Mr. F. F. Lehman, desk attendants,
have been succeeded by Mr. F. A. Waples and Mr. A. H. Hopkins.             Very respectfully submitted,
R. C. DAVIS, Librarian.
On motion of Regent Clark the report of the Librarian was accepted and ordered printed in the proceedings.
Regent Grosvenor, Chairman of the Medical Committee, presented and read the following communication
from the Faculty of the Medical Department:
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN:-At the meeting of the Medical Faculty, Oct.
5th, the following resolution was unanimously passed:
"Whereas the Science of Pathology is at present regarded as one.of
the most important branches of Medical Science, and, whereas instruction
in Pathology should be largely given as laboratory work, and whereas the
Department of Medicine and Surgery is greatly deficient in this branch,
Resolved, that this Faculty earnestly petition the Board of Regents to
establish and fill a chair of Pathology during the present school year."
Also the following resolution:
" Moved, that the Faculty ask the Board of Regents to 'appoint Dr
Heneage Gibbes of Westminster College, London, England, as Professor of
Pathology."
The following resolution in regard to the appointment of an
Instructor in Materia Medica was passed:
" Moved, that the Faculty recommend Dr. Conrad George for appointment as Instructor in Materia Medica for one year at a salary of $500."
At a meeting of the Faculty held Monday, Oct. 10th, the
following resolution was unanimously passed:
"To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN: Believing that the Science and Art of Medicine in its
present and prospective expansion, with the many specialties into which.
it tends to be divided, requires a much longer period of study and of college
and hospital instruction than is provided for by the common medical
schools of this country, and that even the extended course of instruction
in the Department of Medicine and Surgery of this University would, i
practicable, be improved by its extension to four years of nine months instead of three years as now, thus bringing it nearer to the standard of the
most advanced medical schools of Europe, we therefore respectfully request the Honorable Board of Regents to enquire into the possibility and
expediency of providing for a course of instruction of another year, to be
devoted chiefly to Clinical Specialties after the full three years course as
now established with its work and honors is completed. In this connection
we respectfully call attention to an inquiry into the facilities which may be
made available for this purpose in Harper Hospital, and other institutions




OCTOBER fMEETING, 188'7.


173


in the neighboring city of Detroit, with the view of utilizing these facilities
at an early date if it is deemed advisable."
Yours very respectfully,
WM. A. CAMPBELL, M. D.,
Secretary of the Medical Faculty.
The above communication was discussed by Dr.
Palmer and Dr. Herdman before the Board, after which
Regent Grosvenor moved that the matter be laid on the
table for the present. It was so ordered.
The President submitted the following report of the
Executive Committee:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
ANN ARBOR, Oct. 13, 1887. 
The Executive Committee respectfully beg leave to report
as follows:
At the July Meeting of the Board (see Proceedings p. 141),
this Committee were "authorized to select and appoint an
Assistant Professor of English and Rhetoric in place of Professor
B. C. Burt, resigned."
After careful inquiry the Cornmittee,on August 15, appointed
to the place Charles M. Gayley, A. B., who for several years has
been in the service of the University, first as Instructor and afterwards as Acting Assistant Professor of Latin. The salary was
fixed at $1600. Mr. Gayley, who was in Europe pursuing his
studies, has returned, accepted the position, and entered upon
his duties.
At the same meeting (Proceedings, p. 144) the Board voted
to establish an Instructorship of Hygiene and Physiological
Chemistry, and authorized this Committee to fill the office.
On July 9th, the Committee appointed Fred G. Novy, M. S.
at the usual salary, $900 for one year. Mr. Novy was last year
Assistant in Organic Chemistry.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
ANN ARBOR, Oct. 13, 1887. 
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
A short time ago Professor V. C. Vaughan of the Medical
Department wished to use a certain book that is possessed by
the Library of the Surgeon General's Office at Washington. A
communication addressed to the Surgeon General in regard to
loans from that Library was answered by a printed copy of the
conditions of loan, which is inserted here.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1887.


177


CONDITIONS OF LOAN.
"Books will be lent upon request of the librarian of a public
library or university, that officer being held responsible for the
safe return of the volumes within two weeks from the day of their
receipt. Packages must be sent and returned by express, carefully packed, and the charges, both ways, must be paid by the
borrower.
Where there is no public library through which the application can be made, books will be lent directly to the individual
upon his remitting to the librarian of this library a sum of money
sufficient to cover their value in case of loss or injury.
Certain valuable or rare books will not be permitted to leave
the library."
In a written communication forwarded at the samte time,
the Surgeon General further states that books will not be loaned
on the request of librarians of public libraries, or universities,
until the Board of Trustees, or Governing Board, has authorized
the librarian to borrow them and has made the library responsible for them, and this authorization has been filed in the Surgeon General's Office.
I present this matter at this time at the request of Dr.
Vaughan, who prefers that the Library should be the medium
of this loan, and any future loans that he or others might wish
to obtain from the Washington Library.
The letter of the Surgeon General on the subject is herewith
submitted, with other papers relating to the matter; and the
desire is expressed that the Board will, in authorizing the librarian to borrow books, as contemplated, also state what security
for the library, if any, the librarian, or other officer, shall exact
from the Professor for whose accommodation the responsibility
of borrowing is assumed.
Very respectfully,
R. C. DAVIS, Librarian.
Regent Clark submitted the following resolution
which was adopted:
Resolved, That the Librarian be and is hereby authorized
to borrow with consequent liability from the Surgeon General's
Office such works as may be desired by members of the Faculty
aud allow them the use of the same under the usual rules.
Adopted.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1887.


Regent Grosvenor, Chairman of the Finance Committee made the following report of the condition of the
Finances:
To the Board of Regents:
The Finance Cornmmittee herewith present the Treasurer's
statement of receipts and disbursements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1887, and their estimate of receipts and expenditures for the year ending September 30, 1888.
The books and vouchers of the Treasurer and of the Steward
have been examined in minute detail and the items included in
the Treasurer's report have been carefully verified and found
correct.
The net cash balance in the Treasury at the close of the year
is $21,929.09. But it appears by the Treasurer's report that a balance of $38,029.69 stands to the credit of special funds, which
must be used for the purposes for which the appropriations were
made; that three of the special funds are overdrawn $1,221.54;
and that the general fund, on which the Regents have to depend
to meet current expenses, is overdrawn $14,879.06.
During the year to come large expenditures will have to be
incurred. Several buildings are in process of construction, for
which provision was made by the liberality of the legislature.
But no provision was made for the Anatomical Laboratory, and
the cost of this building must be defrayed from the general fund,
and remain charged to that fund, until a reimbursement is obtained from the State. The estimated cost of this building is
between seven and eight thousand dollars.
The general fund will also have to bear the additional cost
of heating, lighting, and caring for the new buildings, and will
also have to carry the burden of all additions to current expenses
caused by the enlargement of the work of the University.
It is anticipated also that within the year additions and
improvements, costing at least $3,000.00, must be made to the
Dental College.
The estimate of $148,000.00 for salaries is no larger than is
needed to meet engagements already entered into. No provision has been made in this estimate for additions to the teaching
force, nor for any increase of salaries beyond what has already
been voted.
By the exercise of close economy on the part of the Board




OCTOBER MEETING, 1837.

of Regents, supported by a continuance of the praiseworthy
watchfulness over all expenditures, that has been maintained by
the Auditing Board, it is expected that the expenses of the
University for the year to come may be kept within its income;
but, as in previous years, the condition of the finances warns us
against all outlays except such as are needed to meet the most
pressing wants, that have not been provided for by special appropriations of the legislature.
All.of which is respectfully submitted.

The Medical Committee, through their Chairman, Regent Grosvenor, made the following report which was
adopted.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
Gentlemen,-The Committee on Medical Department to
whom was referred the matter of the division of the $5,000 remaining of the Legislative appropriation for Scientific Laboratories, would report, that after discussing the matter fully with the
Professors most interested, it was decided to set apart $2,000 for
the Department of Hygiene (Prof. Vaughan), for that of Physiology, (Prof. Sewall), $2,000, and for that of Histology and Microscopy, (Prof. Stowell), the sum of $600, leaving as a reserve of
this fund $400, to be applied under the direction of the Board of
Auditors, for the use of any of the three Departments within
mentioned, as in their judgment seems best for the interests of
these Departments, collectively.
As the Department of Physics (Prof. Carhart) has for
its exclusive use the appropriation of $1,000 for its equipment,
your committee has not deemed it expedient to allot any portion
of the above named sum of $5,000 to that Department.
All of which is submitted,

body for the degrees sought.
NELLIE BARTLETT HAIRE, for Bachelor of Arts.
GEORGE EDWARD FAIRBAIRN, for Bachelor of Philosophy.
LAURA DONNAN, for Master of Arts.
Respectfully submitted,
P. R. DE PONT, Secretary.
On motion of Regent Clark the Degrees indicated
were conferred upon the persons named in the above communication, in accordance with the recommendation of
the Faculty of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
Regent Clark presented and read the following communication from Prof. W. W. Beman:
ANN ARBOR, MICH., Oct. 13, 1887.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
For a long time the Mathematical Department has made
no request for any sort of apparatus. Several years ago an appropriation of $500 was granted to secure a full set of Crelle's Journal, the leading mathematical journal of the world, but before
your action was made public, the same amount was put into
Prof. Olney's hands for the same purpose by E. C. Hegeler, Esq.,
of La Salle, Illinois. With characteristic generosity Prof. Olney
turned your appropriation over to the General Library, and it
was distributed among the various Departments.
Inasmuch then as the Mathematical Department received
no benefit from the only appropriation made for its exclusive
use, it would seem that its present wants should have more than
ordinary consideration.
Just now it stands in urgent need of a full collection of
models for teaching purposes,similar to those possessed by Johns
Hopkins University, Cornell University, Wellesley College, and
other institutions.
I would respectfully request your Honorable Body to place
$500, the same amount as the one previously appropriated, at

were your Committee authorized to say what would be accept â€”
able to the University.
We were informed that the citizens of Detroit were anxious
that a Clinical Department of the University, or a post-graduate
Clinical School, as part of the University, should be established at
Detroit; that the citizens of Detroit, the Trustees of Harper's
Hospital, and the authorities of the Detroit Medical College,
would aid any effort which the Regents might make to give to
the University the clinical facilities which a considerable city
like Detroit furnished; but before they could say what they
would do for us, they must know what we required. In otherwords, if the Regents would advise then as to what would be
required from Detroit, they would at once reply whether they
could meet the demand. rThe impression ma(e upon the Committee is, that the persons in Detroit who are interested in the
matter are ready to meet us with generous hands in reference to
the matter in question.

Regent Blair presented the following memorial which
was adopted by the unanimous vote of the Board, and the
Secretary was directed to spread the same upon the

the deceased.
Intelligence having been received of the death, on the 30th
of January last, of Asa Gray, LL. D., first professor in this University, and afterwards Fisher Professor of Natural History in
Harvard University, the Board of Regents in view of the services rendered to this institution by Dr. Gray, in the judicious
selection of books for its library and in other ways, during the
period of his professorship here, desire to place on record such
an expression of respect and honor as is due to his memory.
Without attempting to recount his many contributions to
the stock of human knowledge during his long life of tireless
activity in the exposition of scientific truth, or to estimate the influence exerted by his profound knowledge and philosophical
acuteness, not only in his special department but also in the
discussion of those more difficult problems to which he so wisely
and generously contributed, we may be permitted, in common
with the wide circle that mourns his loss, to add our voice in
honor of this great leader in the intellectual development of
the period in which he lived.
Especially do we recall with grateful appreciation his reverent love of truth in every form, his broadly catholic spirit,
and the kindly helpfulness long to be remembered by so many
who have looked to him as master and friend. We lament his
unfinished work, but rejoice that such a man has lived, and we
wish to be numbered with those who sincerely mourn his loss
and rise up to honor his memory.
To his family and friends we extend our deepest sympathy
in this hour of their heavy affliction.
On motion of Regent Draper, the salary of Dr. J. N.
Martin, Lecturer in the Dental College, was increased to
$500.
Regent Draper presented the request of the Medical




SPECIAL MEETLNG, 1888.


201


Faculty, that Prof. Chas. H. Stowell's salary be increased

On motion of Regent Willett, the Board went into
Executive Session.
On motion of Regent (lark, B. A. Hinsdale, Ph.D.,
was appointed Professor of the Science and Art of Teaching, at the salary of $2,200, by the following vote:
Ayes -Regents Blair, Draper, Clark, Willett, Field, Whitman and Butterfield.
Nays.-None.
Regent Willett, chairman of special committee on
salaries, made the following report:
The special committee to which was referred the subject of
the re-adjustment of salaries in the Literary Department, respectfully report that, having given the matter careful consideration, they have found it surrounded by many difficulties, chief
of which is the money question. The past ten years has been a
period of special development of the University in all its developments. This has been obtained by changes in the method of
instruction, by widening out the course of study, and by such
other means as as have seemed wise in order to keep our institution in the front rank of American Colleges. During this period
also, the liberality of the legislature has added largely to the
buildings upon the grounds, and each new building creates an
annual expense. The extension of the course of study, and the
change in the method of instruction from the merely didactic to
the experimental, have called for a large increase in teaching
force. The result of this advance in methods, etc., upon the
pay-roll has been to increase it very largely; from $86,000, using
round numbers, in 1878, to $158,000, in 1883, or an increase of
$72,000. During the same period the stated income of the University has been enlarged, as follows: In students' fees, from
$47,000 to $70,000, in the 1-20 mill tax, from $31,000 to $47,000, or
a total increase of $39,000. Special appropriation, made from
session to session of the legislature, have in the past, helped
somewhat. An examination of the pay-roll as it exists now,
and its comparison with that of ten years ago, will disclose the
fact that the greater proportions of the present are dueto two
causes; Ist., the increase in force, being fromn 64 in 1878 to 137, in
1888; 2nd, the advance in rank and pay of instructors and
assistant professors. No doubt, the peculiar situation of our
institution, of which we are all so proud, as a leader in educational methods, has compelled, in a measure, the condition of
affairs as stated. It would seem, however, that the time had now
arrived to advance somewhat the pay of those who have given
their best years to the work on this Campus as full professors.
We would gladly urge liberal things all along the line, and in
this way, avoid difficulties which we do not wish to discuss in
this report, but our financial condition, which we have endeavored to set forth, in brief, will not permit it.




202


SPECIAL MEETING, 1888.


We recommend: First, that from and after the 1st day of
October next, the annual salary of Prof. Frieze shall be the sum
of $2,800.
Second, that the an nual salary of Treasurer Soule be the sum
of $2,200.
Third, that from and after the date last above mentioned,
there shall be added to the pay of those professors in the
Literary Department who have the full rank and pay, ($2.200),
the sum of $100 for each five years of such service and pay in
this or any other college, until the sum of $2,500 is reached,
which shall constitute a maximum salary, save as stated above.
And the date from which to compute the five year period shall
in all cases be the 1st day of October after appointment to the
full rank and pay ($2,200) of a professor.  This provision for increase shall not apply to the professor of Astronomy, as he is allowed, in addition to his salary, the use of house and grounds.
Fourth, that no personal applications for increase in pay, or
change of rank be received by the board, but that such changes
as are thought wise shall be suggested in writing by the President and referred to the proper Standing Committee.

sever my official connection with the University of Michigan at the close

Regent Clark presented the following communication
from Prof. J. W. Langley:
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, Feb. 17, 1888.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
Gentlemen.-I have been in continuous service at this University for
nearly thirteen years, during the first two of which I did virtually the work
of two men in two chairs.
The result is that for some time past I have greatly felt the need of
change and a rest from teaching, but have not seen my way clear to secure
it.
Recently I have been asked to head an important scientific and technical mission in Europe, and, since this will give me the change desired,
and also put in my way very unusual facilities for metallurgical study,
which, I think, will increase my abilities as an officer of instruction on my
return, I hereby ask for a leave of absence for one year from the first of
October next.
Owing to the necessary absence of President Angell, I have not been
able to consult with him fully in regard to nominating a temporary suec
cessor to my chair; I therefore refrain here from mentioning any name, but
I have gathered a list of several persons who may be available, and therefore I beg that, if you grant my request, you will do so definitely at the present meeting, and leave the selection of my successor to the President and
the Executive Committee.
I have a further request to make, which is not a necessary part of the
above.
I should greatly prefer to have the leave of absence date from the first
of next April, but recognizing that my leaving at that time might embar.
rass the instruction in my department, I am ready to remain to the end of
the college year, even at the expense of much personal inconvenience and
loss.
I now request that you empower the President and Executive Committee to confirm my leave of absence from April first next,provided, that
they can find a suitable substitute for the remainder of the present (2nd)
semester. This request is based strictly on the above condition.
Respectfully yours,
JOHN W. LANGLEY,
Prof. Gen. Chemistry,

taught, Quantitative Analysis and Metallurgy. The Committee decided
to ask Mr. Geo. W. Whyte, assistant of Professor Langley, to give instruction
in Metallurgy for the rest of the year; and Mr. F. C. Smith, assistant in the
Chemical Laboratory, to give instruction in Quantitative Analysis. The

R. W. BUTTERFIELD, 
The action of the Committee was approved by a full
vote of the Board.
The President presented and read the following communication:
PRESIDENT ANGELL,
Dear Sir:-In the summer of 1886, the Dowager Lady Vernon, through
Mr. Henry Frowde of London, offered to present to the Libraries of certain
selected Public Institutions of this country, among them the Library of the
University of Michigan, copies of the magnificent edition of the Inferno of
Dante, (3 volumes folio), compiled and arranged by George John Lord Vernon, and brought out two orthree years after his death by his son, Augustus
Henry Lord Vernon.
Lady Vernon also offered at the same time a copy of the large folio
reprint of the Prime Quattro Edizione della Divina Conmmedia, published by
George John Lord Vernon in 1858.
These offers were of course gratefully accepted by the officials of the
University Library.
On account of some necessary preparation of the volumes and on other
accounts they were not received here until last month. Their value is very
great but as they were printed for presentation and not for sale, it is hard to
represent their value in money.
Still another gift to the Library, made March 15th, is the check of Mr.
Edward C. Hegeler of La Salle, Illinois, for $275, which he wishes to have
applied on the purchase of a complete set of Liebig's Annalen for the Chei -
ical collection.
I think these gifts of sufficient value to merit special acknowledgment
by the Board of Regents. It gives me great pleasure to report them to you
at this time for the consideration of the Board.
Very Respectfully,
R. C. DAVIS, Librarian.
Regent Willett, moved that the donations be received
with thanks, and the communication be           spread on the
records of the meeting.
The motion was carried by a full vote.
Regent Whitman presented a communication from
the University Senate as to the annual Commencement
Dinner.    It recommended the essential features of the
plan adopted last year, and suggested that a charge of fifty
cents be collected from    each person for admission to the
dinner. Adopted by a full vote.

the Chemical Laboratory, Mrs. KATE C. JOHNSON has stated her purpose to
be released from this engagement. Her services have been of great value to
the Chemical Laboratory, in securing system in accounts with students
and in preserving economy in control of the supplies. For the year 1888-9 I
recommend the appointment of WILLIAM F. EDWARDS as Accountant and
Dispensing Clerk in the Chemical Laboratory, at the salary of the previous
incumbent, six hundred dollars a year. Mr. EDWARDS has been for one
year the assistant in qualitative chemistry.
(4) I recommend that DAVID H. BROWNE, Ph. B., (Univ. of Mich.,

dollars a year, to succeed to the duties of laboratory instruction of the
late Professor CHEEVER, leaving the lectureship of metallurgy to be otherwise provided for, without increase of expenditure in the total provision.
(5) I recommend, that ERVIN E. EWELL, Ph. C., be appointed as Assistant in Qualitative Analysis, for the coming year, to succeed Mr. EDWARDS
and at the salary of the previous incumbent.
The above named recommendations propose no change in expenditure.
Provision for continuing the present service of assistants in qualitative chemistry, pharmacognosy, organic chemistry, and physiological chemistry, will be recommended at a later date.
Respectfully submitted,
ALBERT B. PRESCOTT,
Director of the Chemical Laboratory.

The Matron claims there have been fewer patients this year than usual,

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 
ANN ARBOR, June 26, 1888.
HoN. JAMES B. ANGELL, LL. D., President of the University of Michigan:
Dear Sir: Having accepted a position in the service of the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, at Milwaukee, Wis., I hereby tender,
through you, to the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, my resignation of the position of Professor of Applied Mathematics, to
take effect October 1st, 1888.
In thus terminating my official connection with the University, I cannot forbear giving some expression to the feeling of sorrow with which I
turn aside from its service, and from the work in which I have been engaged
for fourteen years. It is with great pain that I break up relations that have
been uniformly harmonious and a constant source of pleasure.
I have been moved to take this step, that does violence to so many feelings, solely by a sense of duty, growing out of an opportunity to secure better financial returns for my services in other employment.
Respectfully yours,
C. N. JONES.
On motion of Regent Willett, the resignation of Professor C. N. Jones was accepted.

Carried by the unanimous vote of the Board.
MONROE, MICH., May, 1888.
To the Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN: It was the wish of my late husband, Dr.EDWARD DORSCH,
that at his decease, his valuable private library should not be separated, but
be given, as a whole, to some educational institution. Although in his last
will and testament Dr. DORSCI has made no request regarding this library,
in a conversation we had a few months before his sudden death, he indicated
the wish to me that the University of Michigan should be the heir to his
books. Therefore I am convinced that I carry out the spirit of his intentions
by giving this library to the State in which the Doctor passed a greater portion of his life, and in whose educational welfare 1he was always deeply interested. I ask you, therefore, gentlemen, to accept the Collection upon the
understanding that the books composing it shall be kept together and
known for all time as the "Dorsch Library."
Respectfully yours,
MRS. DR. E. DORSCH.
DR. EDWARD DORSCH.
EDWARD DORSCH was born January 10, 1822, of Protestant parents, at
Wiirzburg, in Bavaria. At the age of ten he was placed in a Catholic school
in Munich, and there received his preparation for the university, which he
entered in 1840. While a student of medicine at Munich he devoted much
attention to Natural History, especially to Botany, which remained a favorite pursuit with him throughout his entire life.
At the time of the revolutionary outbreaks of 1848, Dr. DORSCH was a
young practitioner of Vienna. Here, as he tells us in a brief autobiographical sketch, his professional labors had often to be carried on amid scenes of
carnage. Often he was awakened in the morning by the volley of musketry
which terminated the existence of some one who had made himself an object
of suspicion to the reactionary government. By nature and education a
liberal, Dr. DORSCH had no sympathy with the regime then dominant in
Austria; and when the horrors of military despotism were aggravated by




232


JUNE MEETING, 1888.


the breaking out of the cholera, he readily persuaded himself to join a company of emigrants that were just setting out for America, and were in need
of a physician. He arrived with his family in this country in the autumn
of 1849, and took up his abode in Monroe, Michigan.
At Monroe Dr. DoRSCH soon developed a lucrative practice, and became
one of the most prominent and respected citizens of that portion of the
State. As his income increased, he indulged freely his appetite for books,
and so accumulated gradually the fine private library which now passes into
the possession of the University of Michigan.
Although he had previously voted as a Democrat, Dr. DORSCH connected himself with the Republican party from the time of its organization.
He was a delegate to the Republican convention at Coldwater, in 1854, and
during the presidential elections of 1856 and 1860, he edited a Republican
campaign paper at Monroe. During the war he was a government examiner
of recruits and invalids. Later he was appointed a IU. S. Examining Surgeon, and in connection with his work for the Pension office he
invented and introduced a new chart for use in describing graphically the
course of a bullet through the human body. In the brief autobiography
above alluded to, he remarks with evident professional satisfaction, that his
invention is still used by the Pension office.
From 1872 to 1878 Dr. DORSCH was a member of the State Board of Education-the last public office, he says, that he held or cared to hold. During
his later years he took a somewhat gloomy view of the course of politics in
his adopted country. He was a man of wide and varied intellectual interests, read books omnivorously in half a dozen languages, and exhibited, in
writing his native tongue, a marked literary talent. In 1874 he published a
volume of poems, some of which give evidence of poetic gifts of a really high
order. He died in January, 1887.
On motion of Regent Butterfield, the Board went into executive session, after which the business of the open
session was resumed.
On motion of Regent Willett, the salary of C. G. Taylor was made $1.603, by the following vote:
Ayes-Regents Blair, Draper, Clark, Willett, Field, Whitman, and Butterfield.
Nays-None.
On motion of Regent Clark, the title of Prof. J. W.
Langley was changed to Professor of General Chemistry
and Metallurgy: George W. Whyte was appointed Lecturer on Metallurgy, to fill the temporary vacancy caused
by   Professor Langley's absence on leave, salary $900;
and David H. Browne, Ph. B., was appointed Instructor
in Quantitative Analysis for one year, salary $900.

240                 SPECIAL MEETING, 1888.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
GENTLEMEN: The Finance Committee herewith present their estimate of receipts and expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1889,
and also the Treasurer's statement of receipts and disbursements for the
time between September 30th, 1887-being the date of his last statement-and
June 30th, 1888, the latter date included.
The books and vouchers of the Secretary and Treasurer have been carefully examined and checked, and the Treasurer's account verified in detail,
and the same are substantially correct.
The balance on hand June 30th, 1888, is 88,327.57, but it will be observed
from the estimate of expenditures for the present fiscal year that, with a
continuance of the stated appropriations by the legislature, there will still
remain a deficit of $8,664.67. It will be noted also that the estimates are
based upon present charges, and consequently that the increase of current
expenses must swell the deficit.
One of the causes of this expected deficiency is the extra expenditure
for buildings, which it seemed impossible to avoid, and which has decreased
our present balance. We may well hope that the coming legislature will reimburse the General Fund for the amount drawn from it for the above purpose. It would seem wise, however, to exercise a careful economy, and so
guard against outlays, which are not indispensable, that if possible, the deficit may be less than estimated.
A large sum is still due from the State upon building appropriations,
but this will all be expended within the next few months in the completion
of the buildings now under construction.  It will be remembered also that
these are special appropriations and cannot be diverted.
While your committee regret that a deficit should appear in the estimates, and urge careful attention to the above suggestion as to economy, we
still believe that this should not be pressed so far as to cripple the University: its necessities must be provided.
Respectfully submitted,
CHARLES J. WILLETT, Chairman.

252


OCTOBER MIEETING, 1888.


On December 20,1887, Dr. A. B. Palmer died alter a
brief period of confinement to his house, though doubtless the fatal disease had been for some time making inroads upon his vigorous constitution. He had been a Professor in the Department of Medicine and Surgery since
1854. He had occupied different chairs in the Faculty, and
had for years been the Dean. A more devoted and industrious teacher has never been in the service of the University. The great purpose of his life seemed to be to secure
the prosperity of the Institution and especially of the Department, for which he labored so faithfully during all the
thirty-four years of his official connection with it.
On March 6, 1888, Byron W. Cheever, Acting Professor of Metallurgy, died after an illness of only a few days
duration. Dr. Cheever was a graduate of the Literary,
Medical and Law Departments of this University. It need
hardly be added that he was a man of varied attainments.
He was rapidly making an enviable reputation as a metallurgist by his explorations and his writings. IHe was an
exacting, faithful and successful teacher.
On May 3, 1888, Dr. Edward S. Dunster, who had
filled the chair of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and
Children since 1873, yielded to the power of disease
with which in one form or another he had for a long time
contended. As a medical lecturer he had few equals. A
charming personal address, a terse but graceful diction, a
generous literary culture, an abundant learning in his
profession, a lucid and systematic arrangement of his
thoughts, gave a singular attraction to his public instruction. His writings had given him a wide reputation in
his branch of the medical profession. In his mental constitution and his temperament he exhibited in a marked
degree the traits of his distinguished ancestor, the first
President of Harvard University.
On August 16, 1888, Elisha Jones, Associate Professor
of Latin, after an illness of several months, died in Colorado, whither he had gone in the hope that the climate




OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


253


might be beneficial to him. He had faithfully served his
Alma Mater for some fourteen years as a teacher of the
Latin and Greek classics. He was an accomplished
scholar and most successful instructor. His sincere, frank
and earnest character commanded the respect and won
the affection of his colleagues and his pupils. The text
books which he had prepared had made his name widely
and honorably known.
The University will hold in grateful recollection the
faithful services of these men who have fallen at their posts
of duty. Fortunate will she be, if she can make their
places good.
Professor C. N. Jones, who turns from academic to
business pursuits, had been connected with the Faculty
since 1874. He had the rather unusual gift of making the
study of mathematics agreeable even to pupils who had
not a special taste for that branch, while at the same time
he held them to effective work.
Professor Payne has accepted the very important
position of President of the State College of Nashville, an
Institution which by the aid of the Peabody Fund devotes
its energies largely to giving southern students a Normal
training of collegiate grade to prepare them for filling important positions us teachers in the Southern States. The
Chair of the Science and the Art of Teaching in this University, to which he was called in 1879, was, I think, the
first chair of the kind established in any American University. The Regents observed that we were annually graduating a considerable number of persons, who without having
had any special training in pedagogy, were called at once to
the responsible duties of principals of high schools or even
of superintendents of the public schools of cities. Our relation to the public school system of the State and to these
graduates seemed to lay on us the duty of giving them
some special and adequate preparation for the important
educational work which they were to undertake. In discharging this duty the Regents were singularly fortunate




254


OCTOBER MEETING, 1S88.


in securing the services of Mr. Payne as Professor. With
no precedents in American Universities to guide him, he
addressed himself to his new work with so much prudence,
skill and enthusiasm  that his instruction proved even
more beneficial to the students and to public education
than the Regents had expected such a course of teaching
would be. The nature and the usefulness of his work
have become widely known, and other leading Universities
have imitated us in establishing chairs for instruction
in pedagogics.
Professor Cady, who has resigned after a connection
of eight years with University, has rendered a most valuable service to us and to this community by elevating the
standard of musical taste and by awakening an enthusiasm for the study of classical music. Upon him fell the
somewhat difficult task of organizing the work of musical
instruction in the University and of convincing men that
such instruction was a proper and useful part of the work
of a University.
Assistant Professor John Dewey has left us to take
charge of the department of philosophy in the University
of Minnesota. He has shown by his ability, learning, and
skill as a teacher that his promotion to a full chair is well
merited, and our best wishes follow him to his new field.
Mr. Hennequin had been a member of the Faculty
since 1872. His linguistic talent and his familiarity with
the principles and the art of dramatic composition should
open to him a successful literary career.
The change in Professor Langley's title indicates an
important and useful change in the organization of the
work in general chemistry, physics and metallurgy. The
instruction in physics in the Literary  Department was
heretofore divided between the professor of physics and
the professor of general chemistry, and the instruction in
the latter branch was rather too limited in extent. On the
other hand the instruction needed in metallurgy does not
require the full time of a professor. Professor Langley,




OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


255


who has had large experience in metallurgy, being relieved of the duty of instructing in physics in the Literary
Department, and of lecturing on chemistry to the medical
classes, can give the needed instruction in metallurgy and
enlarge his work in general chemistry in the Literary Department, and the teaching of physics will be left wholly
in the hands of the professor of that branch. Provision
will have to be made for securing lectures on general
chemistry to the medical students. That work will naturally fall to one, who can also teach some of the applications of chemistry or electricity to the medical art.
Professor Sewall having leave of absence for the coming year on account of impaired health, and Professor
Langley, having permission to be absent in Europe on important scientific business, temporary provision has been
made by appointments above named, to supply their
places. Owing to these absences, to resignations of teachers, and to deaths, we have been called to make an unprecedented number of appointments. We trust however
that they have been made with so much care that there
will be no serious interruption of continuity in our work.
The degrees conferred were as follows:

The number who graduated with the Bachelor's degree from the Literary Department was 123, larger by
twenty-two than the number in the class of 1875, which
has heretofore borne the honor of being the largest graduating class. It numbered 101.
The number of students in attendance during the
year was as follows:

The number of students was greater than that in
1886-7 by 105. It exceeded that of 1885-6 by 276 and
that of 1884-5 by 382. The largest gain last year, as in
the previous year, was in the Literary Department, 60;
though there was an increase in every Department except
in the Department of Medicine and Surgery, in which
there was a loss of 8. The number of graduates stndying
for higher degrees either here or in absentia continues to
increase, having risen from 42 in the previous year to 59
in the last year.
The number of women in attendance in 1886-7 and in
1887-8 was as follows:

The relative as well as the absolute number of
women in the University continues to increase very
slowly. Last year they formed sixteen and eight-tenths
per cent, this year they form sixteen and nine-tenths per
cent, of the total attendance. Last year they constituted
twenty-five per cent, this year they constitute twenty-five
and seven-tenths per cent, of the entire attendance in the
Literary Department. Twelve of the fifty-three graduates studying for higher degrees during the year are
women.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


The five hundred and sixty-three candidates for bachelors' degrees in the Literary Department are divided as
follows in respect to their courses: Bachelor of Arts, 175 
Bachelor of Philosophy, 112; Bachelor of Science (Course
in General Science) 59; Civil Engineer, 61; Mechanical
Engineer, 33; Mining Engineer, 11; Bachelor of Science
(Course in Chemistry), 10; the same (Course in Biology,)
2; Bachelor of Letters, 100.
Of late years there has been a relative and absolute
increase of the number of studeuts in the English, Engineering and Scientific Courses, but the Classical Course
still attracts a much larger number than any other.
It may be of interest to see in what proportions the
men and in what proportions the women choose the different courses. The following table shows the percentage of
the men, and the percentage of the women, in both cases
candidates for degrees in the Literary Department, who
chose each course during the last year:
Percentage Percentage
of Men.  of Women.
The A. B. Course     -.-. ----      30.7       32.3
The Ph. B. Course                  16.3       31.4
The B. SCourse       -   -   --   13.         9.3
The B. L. Course  ------           15.        27.
The Engineering Courses --- â€”---    25.        None.
100.       100.
The women have of course no practical inducement
to enter on the engineering courses, though in years past
now and then one has completed one of those courses. It
will be observed that a larger proportion of women than
of men are taking by choice the full classical course.
They are led to this not alone by their literary taste, but
also by the consideration that there is a demand for their
services in teaching Greek in preparatory schools.  As
one fourth of' the men are drawn to the engineering work,
the women naturally form a larger proportion than the
men of the students pursuing the Ph. B. Course, which




OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


259


contains Latin and the Modern Languages, and of the B.
L. Course, which also contains the Modern Languages and
allows large liberty of choice in English Literature, History and the Sciences. The B. S. Course which is planned
to train teachers of science and scientific experts attracts a
larger proportion of men than women.
The general order and spirit of study have been, as
usual for some years, most commendable.   One new
offence has however been committed, of which a due regard for the friendly relations of colleges makes it wise to
speak. Three students came here from a reputable college, and received credit for advanced standing in mathematics on the strength of forged certificates, purporting
to be signed by the Professor' of Mathematics in that
Institution. After a few months the forgery was discovered and the offenders were of course expelled. These
cases show that precaution is needed in accepting students
from other colleges and that it may become necessary to
require the official seal of a college on papers that certify
the standing of its students.
During the year there has been a considerable increase
in the numbier of schools which are maintaining the " diploma relation" with us. In 1886-7 there were 43; in
1887-8 there were 58. Among these are ten High Schools
in Chicago and cities and towns adjacent to Chicago.
That is an important field from which we ought to draw
and may properly expect to draw a larger number of
students than we have received in the past. Every year's
experience adds strength to the conviction that few steps
more beneficial both to the University and to the schools
have been taken by the University authorities than the
establishment in 1870 of the "' diploma system" of receiving students. If that system has met with less success in
some other states, it is because the conditions under
which we work do not there exist, or because the precautions which are here observed in making use of the plan
have been there omitted.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


The very welcome pressure on us for instruction in
the studies pursued on the courses leading to higher degrees still continues. It adds a considerable burden to
some of our professors already heavily tasked in conducting the work of undergraduates. But one of the tests of a
successful teacher is found in his power to stimulate pupils
to push their studies beyond the limits of an undergraduate course, and one of his most gratifying rewards comes
from seeing them fired with a zeal to pursue into the
higher ranges the branches which he teaches.
In this connection grateful mention should be made
of the,action of the society of women graduates of various
colleges, known as The Association of Western Alumnae,
for assigning to this University for this year the use of a
Fellowship which they have endowed. The holder will
receive the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars to aid
her in pursuing advanced studies here during this academic year.
Could we have a few endowed fellowships, they would
be of the greatest service in retaining here some of our
most brilliant scholars for the pursuit of special studies.
The Regents of the University of Wisconsin have established eight, yielding four hundred dollars each. The
holders are required to teach certain branches in the
University, if asked to do so. There is some subordinate
work of instruction in which persons of such attainments as
the holders of fellowships ought to be could be made
useful. On this ground perhaps the use of our finds for
the establishment of fellowships could be justified. Fellowships have been endowed in most of the stronger
Universities of the country. They have been especially
useful in training students for professorial chairs in our
colleges. Our graduates have been for some time making
praiseworthy efforts to establish fellowships here. Those
who have been exerting themselves deserve more encouragement from other alumni and friends of the University
than they have received.




OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


261


The Engineering Laboratory is now nearly completed,
but a considerable addition to the equipment is needed.
The accomodations it affords for shop-work are none too
large for our present number of engineering students.
The new building erected for the Physical and Hygienic
Laboratories is now finished and occupied though not entirely furnished. It is with great satisfaction that we see
at last adequate provision for teaching Physics. The Ilygienic Laboratory is, I think, the first established by any
of our universities. We trust that it will prove of great
service to the State and to the wider public by the investigations, which will there be conducted, of hygienic and
sanitary problems. But already, at the very opening of
instruction in this Laboratory it proves that the lecture
room is not large enough to seat the students, who wish
to attend the lectures.
As our facilities for teaching science and its practical
applications especially to Civil, Mining, Mechanical, Electrical, and Sanitary Engineering have been enlarged, the
demand for such teaching has rapidly increased. Attention has already been called to the fact that one-fourth of
our candidates for degrees are pursuing courses in Engineering. It is probable that the ratio will increase rather
than decrease.
The Department of Medicine and Surgery, although
it has suffered the heavy loss of two of its older professors,
and although it has been somewhat agitated by the continuance of the discussion of the question, of transferring
a part of the medical instruction to Detroit. has had a
fairly prosperous year. But, as I suggested in my last
report, it is very essential to the good of the Department
that the question of removing the clinical teaching be
settled at an early day.  If the removal is wise, the
sooner it is effected the better. If it is not wise, the
sooner that is declared to be the deliberate opinion of the
Board of Regents, the better will it be for the internal
harmony and prosperity of the department. I ask your




262


OCTOBER MEETING, 1858.


indulgence, while I present some considerations on the
subject of the removal.
The substantial import of the proposition which has
been most strongly urged is, as I understand it, that our
medical students, after spending two years here in pursuing what are called the more didactic branches, shall
repair to Detroit where during the third year of their
course they shall receive clinical instruction in connection with the hospitals of that city.
At the outset it is obvious that there are very grave
objections to the plan, which can be outweighed only by
very great advantages to be gained. Let us notice briefly
some of the objections, and then inquire what are the
advantages.
1. It is clear that the administration of the Department will be made more complicated and difficult. There
must be a special organization for the conduct and supervision of the work in Detroit. A considerable number of
professors resident in Detroit, and not teaching on the
University grounds, must be added to the Faculty. Questions not altogether easy to answer, concerning relative
authority and power of resident and non-resident professors and concerning other points are not unlikely to
arise.
2. It will, I think, be more expensive for our students and certainly for such of our resident professors as
have clinical instruction to give. I doubt if students can
find comfortable homes and board at Detroit for the same
rates which are paid by them here, and their incidental
expenses are in my opinion certain to be larger there than
here. The resident professors could not be asked to go
to Detroit to teach without having their additional
expenses borne by the University.
3. The University would probably soon be called to
make more serious additions to its expenditures than that
just referred to. We have been told that Detroit physicians, who would be necessarily added to the Faculty, are




OCTOBER IMEETIG, 1838.


263


willing to serve for little or no compensation. Possibly
that would be the case at the outset. But we have a
pretty large and suggestive experience which indicates
that the University cannot be fortunate enough to secure
the services of competent men for any considerable time
on so favorable terms. Nor is this a fact to be complained
of. We can hardly ask eminent practitioners in Detroit to
take time from their remunerative professional work to
serve us for less proportionate compensation than our resident professors receive.
4. The students would be deprived of the use of the
University library and of the other incideutal advantages
of University life. With no desire to overrate these, I
believe that they have a very considerable value in enlarging and enriching the culture of the students. The undergraduates cannot as a class live here three years without
catching something of the breadth and spirit of a true
university training, which all will adcllit is far better than
a mere narrow, technical, professional training.
5. But what assurance'can we have that the students
will go to Detroit, if we make the proposed arrangement?
The opportunities proposed to be offered for clinical
instruction are now open to the students of the medical
college already established in Detroit. Do these opportunities now attract our students in any considerable
numbers? We know that they do not. Our students
who wish for larger clinical advantages than we have
offered pass by Detroit and go to New York or Philadelphia. Will they not continue to do so? Is there not good
ground to fear that the very object for which the proposed change is suggested will not be attained even if we
make the effort recommended?
6. It seems probable that if a part of the work of
the Department is carried to Detroit, and is successfully
prosecuted there, a strong pressure will be exerted on this
Board to transfer the whole work of the Department there.
The difficulties of divided administration, contrasted with




264


OCTOBER MEETING, 18S8.


the obvious advantages of concentration and unity, and
the larger opportunities for remunerative practice of the
professors in Detroit, the possibility, not to say the proba
bility, that at no distant day a majority of the Faculty
must be residents of that city, will inevitably produce a
strong influence in that direction. The discussion of the
subject would renew in the college the unrest which has
been caused during the last few years by the debate upon
the expediency of removing the clinical instruction to
Detroit. To some the transfer of the whole work of the
Department to that city may seem desirable in itself. To
me it seems most undesirable, whether we consider the
interests of the Department or of the whole University.
Statistics show beyond dispute that the Department by its
growth has contributed most powerfully to the growth of
the other Departments, as they have contributed to its
strength. Medical students who have pursued their course
here on the ground have been instrumental in turning
many students hither for work in other Departments as
well as in their own, and in turn the students in other
Departments have commended the Medical School to their
neighbors and friends. But if it should ever come to pass
that the medical students do all their work in Detroit,
they will have none of the pride or interest in the general
work of the University which now animates them and
leads them to urge men to come here for collegiate or legal
education. In fact they will have no opportunity to learn
from personal observation and experience anything of the
life and spirit of the University. On the other hand the
students in the other Departments have here become
familiar enough with the work of the Medical Department to direct the attention of their friends to it; but
their knowledge of it and interest in it would be far less,
if it were transferred to Detroit.
7. It must further be remembered that every argument which can be urged for removing the clinical instruction in the Department of Medicine and Surgery to De



OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


265


troit is equally valid for removing the Homoeopathic
Medical College there also. A large hospital, to be placed
in charge of Homoeopathic physicians, is in process of
erection in that city. We may be sure that there would be
a demand on us from friends of the Homoeopathic College
that their students should have facilities for clinical
instruction in Detroit, if the arrangement proposed should
be made. This would be urged, and with justice, on the
ground that both schools should be treated alike. The
result would be that for a time at least we should have
four medical schools or parts of schools to manage and
maintain. Indeed it is not certain that in due time there
would not be a demand by the dentists that a part at least
of the work of the Dental College should also be transferred to Detroit, since the work of the dental students is
closely associated with that of the medical students,
since they must receive some instruction in surgery, and
since also the Faculty could then be enlarged by the addition of Detroit practitioners who could assist in clinical
teaching. Does not all this mean a dangerous disintegration of life and calamitous diffusion of force?
8. At present there is not a little valuaole assistance
rendered by the Departments to each other, which would
have to be surrendered in large degree or altogether.
Professors in one Department give brief courses of lectures
in one or more of the other Departments, and so supplement or enrich the instruction. This would be much
more difficult, if it were at all practicable, in case of the
disintegration suggested.
9. There is danger that the branch in Detroit and
the fragment of the school here would soon come to have
rival interests. It would be natural that the Detroit
branch, having perhaps a larger number of professors
connected with it and and emphasizing the value of its
share of the work, which being clinical, impresses the
public and impresses students more than the dryer, but
not less important, didactic work, should claim more
2




266


OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


attention and more help from the Regents than the portion of the school which is here. At any rate, a stroug
and troublesome difference of opinion on that point and
on other points might easily spring up.
10. Is it not quite possible that if the Department,
either in whole or in part, should be planted in Detroit,
it might receive a less hearty support' from the State? Is
it not altogether conceivable that the legislators would
say? "Detroit has asked for the Department, Detroit is
quite able to support it. Let her take care of it." Small
and lacking in wealth as this city is, we have more than
once heard from legislators when we asked for help the
inquiry: "What has Ann Arbor done? Why does she
not show some interest in the University?" How much
more emphatically should we hear the inquiry concerning
the populous and wealthy city of Detroit?
These objections to the proposed scheme, I think it
must be confessed, are serious. Are they outweighed by
'the advantages which may be secured by the adoption ol
it? What are the advantages which are promised?
1. It is said that the hospitals of Detroit which
would be made accessible to our students, furnish more
cases and more valuable cases than our hospital to illustrate the instruction in surgery, gynecology and obstetrics.
This is true. But it is possible to overrate the advantages
which they offer in comparison with those offered here.
If I am correctly informed, the average number of
patients in Harper Hospital and in St. Luke's Hospital,
which are the principal ones on whose help we should
depend, is only two or three times as great as the number
the University Hospital accommodates, and a considerable
proportion of the persons in the Detroit hospitals are
private patients, who would not be brought before the
classes. When a committee of this Board visited Harper
Hospital at the invitation of citizens of Detroit some
months ago, they were surprised to find that it had not
then as many patients as the University Hospital. The




OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


267


statement which the President of the Michigan Medical
Association, a practitioner in Detroit, made in his address
at the last meeting of that body, indicates that the condition of the hospitals in that city leaves much to be
desired.  He said, "'there is no hospital in this city
(Detroit) which is properly equipped, or which has money
enough to pay its running expenses without financial
embarrassment.' It must be remembered also that the
Detroit hospitals cannot be placed under the control of
this Board. Is there not a possibility that under the
influence of some rival medical school embarrassments
might arise in our relations with one or more of the hospital boards?
2. It is argued that the transfer of a part of our
medical work to Detroit would awaken a deep interest
in the University in that city and would even secure large
benefactions fiom its citizens. The interest and the benefactions would be most acceptable, and we are glad to
say that the past generosity of some of the citizens of
Detroit to the University makes such a result seem not
improbable.  But thus far no distinct propositions of
assistance have been made to this Board.
3. It is predicted that the transfer would lead to the
dissolution of any medical schools now existing in Detroit,
and would prevent the establishment of new schools.
Thus concentration in medical teaching in the State would
be secured. It is also affirmed that the students who now
attend the Detroit schools would be added to our number.
I see no sufficient ground for assuming that there
will be no other medical schools than ours at Detroit,
especially if we do not remove the whole Department
there. Wherever there are aspiring physicians in a city
as large as Detroit, and particularly where medical
schools have existed for some years, certain practitioners
generally find it conducive to their own interests to
join in carrying on a medical school. We can hardly
expect that the accomplished physicians of Detroit, who




268          OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.
have had the enterprise to conduct two medical schools
for years, will refrain from maintaining a school because
of our giving clinical instruction in Detroit to our senior
class.
Nor do I see any good reason to expect that if the
schools in Detroit were abandoned, we should receive any
considerable number of their students. For their classes
are largely made up of those, who wish a short course in
medicine, and are not willing to take our three years'
coursp. They would be more likely to turn to somle school,
which gives a degree on the completion of a briefer course.
So far as I know, the advantages here considered are
all which have been suggested as likely to accrue from the
plan before us. It is for this Board to decide whether they
so far outweigh the objections named as to make the adoption of the plan wise. My own conviction is that they do
not, and therefore that it is inexpedient to transfer any
part of our work to Detroit.
The experience of the European Universities which
are established in comparatively small cities sustains the
view that it is not essential to the success of a medical
school that the clinical instruction should be given in some
great city, apart from the University. What. would be
thought at Tiibingen or Bonn or Jena or Wtirzburg or
Oxford of the proposition to divide the work in medicine
and carry a part of it away from the rest and from the
University? Yet these Universities and others situated
in small cities are not without a good reputation for instruction in medicine and surgery. So far as I have heard,
the experiment of making such a division of the medical
work as is here proposed has not been attempted anywhere. So unprecedented a step should not be made without far clearer and more cogent evidence than has yet
been presented that it will be beneficial to the Department
and to the University.
But meanwhile let the statement be emphasized, that
if we are to depend solely on our own hospitals for aid in




OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.             269
clinical instruction, we should have the means of making
them as good as possible. It is most desirable to have a
lying-in hospital. Our hospital buildings were not intended for long use. On every account we could wish that
new buildings for hospital purposes might be erected on
some site a little removed from the campus. If a suitable
hospital should be built by the State, many patients now
remaining in the county alms-houses, where they do not
receive the care of skilled surgeons and opthalmologists,
could be sent here for treatment, and soon restored to a
condition of self-support. It would doubtless be a real
economy for the counties, which may now be burdened
with the cost of maintaining through life persons who have
curable maladies, to send such patients here. To some extent they do this now. But with ampler accommodations
more patients could be cared for, and the interests of the
counties, of the patients, and of our medical school would
at one be subserved.
The Homceopathic Mledical College has had a prosperous year. It has enjoyed internal harmony and freedom from attack from without. We have reason to hope
that the profession in the State are now generally prepared
to give it that hearty support, which is essential to its
highest usefulness.
The work of the Law Department has been carried on
in a very satisfactory manner. The experiment of em
ploying a few non-resident lecturers for more or less extended courses of instruction has been tried with good results. Professor Hammond, Dean of the St. Louis Law
School, gave a course of fifteen lectures on the History of
the Common Law, Hon. H. B. Brown, United States District Judge, a course of twelve lectures on Admiralty Law,
and Professor M. M. Bigelow, of the Law School of the
Boston University, lectured during a large part of the second semester on Equity. These gentlemen will hereafter
continue their lectures. The standard of work required of
the students has been materially raised during the last




270


OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


two or three years, and the examfiinations for graduation
are more stringent than they ever were before.
The School of Pharmacy continues to deserve and to
enjoy its pre-eminent reputation for thoroughness. By
the courage with which its standard of work has been
maintained and from time to time raised, it has been
largely instrumental in elevating the standard of other
schools in the country.
For the accommodation of this school and of our
great number of students of chemistry, drawing from
every Department of the University except the Law Departmrnt, there is urgent need of another enlargement of
the Chemical Laboratory.
The Dental College in spite of the continual and rapid
increase of requirements for graduation, attracts larger
and larger classes every year.  Three years' study, a
longer course than that in any other Dental School, is now
essential to graduation. The course will be graded. This
elevation of our standard is warmly approved by the best
members of the Dental Profession in the country, and is
heartily commended in Europe, where the reputation of
the School is well established.
An enlargement of the building occupied by the Dental College can not much longer be delayed, unless we deliberately refuse to receive well prepared applicants for
admission. Serious inconvenience in giving instruction to
our students was caused last year by the inadequacy of our
accommodations. It is a most embarrassing, problem how
to care for the larger number in attendance now.
The most.important facts concerning the collections
in our Museums are these:
Another shipment of the Rogers Statuary has been
received from Rome. It consists of colossal figures, including the statues of Lincoln and Seward, those of Nelson and Lewis on the monument at Richmond, Va., the
symbolical figures of Michigan on the Detroit battle monment, America on the Rhode Island monument, Victory




OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


271


on the Worcester monument, and the Sentinel on the Cincinnati monument. The casts of the bronze doors of the
Capitol at Washington are yet to be sent. When they are
received the collection will be complete, a worthy monument to the genius and the generosity of the artist. The
value of these casts, especially of the casts of the statues,
busts, and medallions of the great historic characters of
the Civil War, will increase with the lapse of years. No
collection worthy to be compared with it in this particular is found in any other University, if indeed there is any
in the country. Our embarrassment in finding suitable
places for the colossal figures just received strongly suggest our need of a more spacious Art Gallery than we now
possess.
Our Museum of Zoology is about to receive some important additions, the fruits of a scientific expedition
which Professor Steere, accompanied by one of our recent
graduates and by two of our undergraduates, has made
during the past year to the Philippine Islands. It is believed that these naturalists have found a considera'ile
number of new species of birds and even some of miammals, and have obtained evidence which may materially
modify accepted theories concerning the distribution of
the fauna of that interesting group of islands.
From the Librarian's report it appears that the total
number of volumes in all the libraries is now 67,759, and
of pamphlets 13,892. During the year we have added to
our collection 5,361 volumes and 1,278 pamphlets. The
most important gifts were the Dorsch library, presented
by the widow of the late Dr. Dorsch, of Monroe, in compliance with his wishes, 1,676 volumes and 148 pamphlets;
a gift of 356 volumes and 90 pamphlets, mainly on Irish
history, by George C. Mahon; and a complete set of
Liebig's Annalen. presented by E. C. Hegeler. The total
number of periodicals regularly received is 242. The
volumes drawn during the year numbered 94,168. It is
doubted if any other library is so much used.




272


OCTOBER MEET1NG, 1888.


Our annual finance report shows how severely our
needs press upon our resources. It is only by the greatest
watchfulness anct economy, by the unpleasant refusal to
grant many reasonable requests for help from    various
departments of teaching, that we are able to accomplish
our work with so small an outlay. We greatly need some
provision for adding to our general fund.   No similar
institution of a magnitude comparable with ours is carried
on without a much larger outlay than we make. Now,
as always, we must rely on the State for aid. We entrust
our fortunes to her appreciation and generosity with
unabated confidence.
JAMES B. ANGELL.
On motion of Regent Field, the report of the President was accepted, and ordered printed in the minutes,
and it was directed that the usual number be printed in
pamphlet form for the use of the Board, and of the University.
A  call vote was taken on Regent Field's motion,
which resulted as follows:
Ayes-Regents Draper, Willett, Field, Whitman, and Butterfield.
Nays-None.
The following annual report of the Librarian was accepted, and, on motion of Regent Willett, it was ordered
printed in the minutes.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
Gentlemen-There were belonging to the University Sept. 30,
1888, 67,759 volumes, 13,892 unbound pamphlets, and 264 maps.
Of these there were in the General Library 53,837 volumes,
12,776 unbound pamphlets and 264 maps; in the Law Library
9,783 volumes; in the Medical Library 3,707 volumes, and 913
pamphlets; and in the Library of the Dental College 432 volumies.
During the year 245 periodicals have been regularly received,
as follows: In the General Library, 170; in the Medical Library,
55; in the Law Library, 7; and in the Library of the Dental
College, 13.

THE GENERAL LIBRARY.
The additions to the General Library during the year have been
4,866 volumes and 1,430 pamphlets. Of these 1,639 volumes and
203 pamphlets were purchased, 2,915 volumes and 1,430 pamphlets presented, and 312 volumes the result of binding periodicals.
The total amount of all bills certified to by me, or my assistant, for purchases made, was $4,718.24. Of this sum. 23,696.49
were for books and pamphlets, 576,6() were for subscriptions to
periodicals, and $445.15 for binding and mending. In addition
to these sums which were paid from the special Library fund,
$60.00 were paid from the current expense fund for catalogue
cards, tickets for readers, etc.
The year was an unusually fruitful one in gifts. Almost
3,000 volumes, (2.915); and 1,227 pamphlets were the gifts of individuals, of governments, and of learned societies. MoA(re than
two-thirds of the volumes and many of the pamphlets were given
by two persons, viz: Mrs. Dr. Edward Dorsch, in accordance
with the wish of her late husband, Dr. Edward Dorsch, of Monroe, Michigan, and George C. Mahon, Esq., a resident of Ann
Arbor when the gift was made, and now of Detroit.
I will not rehearse the history of the acquisition of the
"Dorsch Library." That history was fully set forth to you at the
meeting in June. No indication of the character of the collection was given then, however, or has been given at any other
time, and I think it proper that I should refer briefly to some
features of it in this report.
As might be expected from the nationality of Dr. Dorsch,
there are many books in the German language-very nearly, if
not quite, two-thirds of the whole number.  And, as might be
expected from a man of his linguistic acquirements there are
books in languages other than German and English-the languages of his native, and of his adopted country. WVorks in
French appear frequently: and occasionally, in purely literary
forms of composition, works in Italian and Spanish. The briefest inspection of the collection, however, shows that the doctoi
retained to the last a great fondness for his native tongue. Very
many of the books in the German are translations from the English and other modern languages with which he seems to have
been familiar.
All departments of literature are represented-most fully
those of pure Literature, (literature in the special sense of the




274


OCTOBER MIEETING, 1888.


word) and Art. In the former class there is a good representation of the best ancient authors. Here, too, the translations into
German are frequent. Homer appears in German hexameters,
and the page is a pleasant one to look upon.  There is, also, a
good representation of the best modern authors, in the original,
or translated into German, as already stated.
In Art the collection is especially strong. There are handbooks, treatises, histories, and catalogues with excellent reproductions, and descriptions, of the contents of great galleries.
The following are particularly worthy of mention: London Art
Journal, 1851-1854 inc., and 1865-1882 inc., H. Roux Aind's Herculaneum and Pompeii, 8vols., Jiennicke's Grundriss der Keramik, 1879.
Theology and Philosophy are represented, but not by the
volumes that ordinarily constitute collections of this kind in
libraries. They are largely discussions of venerable and " outworn creeds," and elucidations of ancient and mediaeval mysteries, Their value is great to the student of the origin of things.
Their presentation is a piece of great good fortune to us, for they
are both rare and costly.
In general Science the best modern writers are represented
to some extent.  One work of great value, but belonging to a
single department of science, is Brehm's Thierleben, 2nd. Ed.,
10 vols.
In Medicine, the Doctor's own subject, there are about 150
volumes. Besides the treatises required by the general practitioner, there are complete sets of two very important works, viz.:
Win. Wood & Co.'s, edition of Zieris-en's Cyclopredia of the
Practice of Medicine, 18 vols., and index, and Eulenburg's RealEncyclopcedie der Gesammten Heilkunrde, 15 vols.
There are a good many works of reference, of all descriptions,
that we have not hitherto possessed, and that will be very useful
to us. Two are specially important, viz:
llhlstrirtes Conversations-Lexicon, 8 vols., 1870-80, and Gesqhichte der Erfindungen, edited by Bollner, Mothes and Luckenbacher, 2nd edition, 7 vols., and Ergdnzgnys-Bland, 1872-75.
The Library is to be congratulated upon this large and very
valuable accession. We shall endeavor to justify the donor's selection of a repository for his books by a tender care of them,
and by conforming to his expressed wishes in the disposition
we make of them.
The books presented by Mr. Mahon, 355 in number, are




OCTOBER JMEETlVNG, 1SSS.


275


about equally divided between Irish History, and practical
works on Mining, Metallurgy and Geology.
As regards the collection on Irish History it will be hard to
match it in extent in this country, and harder yet to match it
in the intrinsic value of the particular works.
Mr. Mahon is a profound student of Irish History and Literature, and in the accumulation of books in these directions,
rejected all ephemeral matter. This is not the first gift from
Mr. Mahon. In 1882 there was received from him him a set of
the Transactions, and also of the Proceedings of the Royal Irish
Academy, to that date.
Other benefactors are E. C. Hegeler, Esq. of La Salle, Illinois, who, as reported to you at the March Meeting, contributed
$275.00 towards the purchase of a complete set of Liebig's
Annalen; Dr. L. (4. Doane, of New York City, a graduate of the
Medical Department, of the class of '71, who has contributed
very considerably to the dramatic collection, and has also given
many miscellaneous books and pamphlets; and Ex Professor C.
N. Jones, who, in leaving Ann Arbor, gave upwards of 100 vols.,
many of which are valuable additions to the library.
It would swell this report to vast proportions to name all
who have deserved, and have received, our thanks for timely
and valuable gifts. A record of all gifts, and their sources, is
kept, to which reference can at any time be made.
The various statistics that show the amount of reading done
during the year indicate a continuance in the growth of the use
of the Library.
The number of books drawn out and used in the Reading Room, was-                          ------  91,712
The number drawn out by Professors,.2,456
A total of,  -- -- -----     -      94,168
Tickets of admission to the book-room were granted to 46
persons, who made 783 visits to the shelves. During the two semesters 249 students were admitted to the Seminary Rooms189 to the west room for the study of English Literature, German Literature, Literary Criticism, and Art, and the Greek,
Latin, Gothic, and Sanscrit languages, and 60 to the East Room
for the study of History, Political Economy, and Philosophy.
The books are generally in good condition. The great use to
which many of the prescribed ones are subjected wears them
out rapidly. They are mended as long as mending will avail,




276


OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


and then they are laid aside. I look with a kind of pride on
those books worn out by constant and honest use.-They are in
the nature of trophies â€”indisputable evidences of achievement.
More than at any time before, the library force was last year
disabled by sickness. On this account much less work was accomplished than was planned. The transcription of the Author
portion of the Catalogue was completed, and the new Catalogue
case brought into use in the Reading Room. T The progress
made in the transcription of the subject portion, however, was
not great. It remains as the important work of the year upon
which we have entered.
It is with regret and much sympathy with her, personally,
that I report the serious illness of Miss Morrish, and her resignation of her position in the Library. Miss Morrish became
connected with the Library in June, 1884, and since June, 1885,
she has been the one on whom the clerical work mainly fell.
She found herself compelled to cease work early in the spring,
but left the Library with the hope of a restoration to health that
would enable her to return for a portion of the vacation, and for
the present year. The expected improvement did not come,
however, and in June her resignation was sent to the President.
I wish in this connection to express my hearty commendation
of her service. All her duties were performed with conscientious
care, and her spirit was excellent.
It has been apparent for some time that with the increase of
the material of the Library, and the extension of its field of
usefulness, there should come a readjustment of the work that
would better meet the new demands. With this end in view
the Library Committee of the Faculty propose that, in providing
for Miss Morrish's work, such a readjustment be effected. They
recommend that Mr. F. N. Scott of the class of '84, and last
year, and one year previously, general assistant, be made Assistant Librarian for one year at $900, and that a suitable person
be employed as general assistant at $300 per year. Inasmuch
as the salary of Mr. Scott is $600, and that of Miss Morrish was
$600, this arrangement will leave the cost of administration unchanged.
If this is done the skilled labor, and the responsibility, that
the necessities of the case had divided between two persons, will
be devolved upon one, with increased compensation, and the
unskilled labor that the same necessities had divided between




OCTOBER SMEETING, 1888.


277


the same two persons will be devolved upon one, with less compensation.
The changes that have already been affected in the library
force, for the year, are as follows:
Mr. F. A. Leslie, and Mr. W. G. Adams are desk attendants
in the place of Mr. F. A. Waples and Mr. A. H. Hopkins. Mr.
A. H. Hopkins and Mr. Yeijiro Ono have charge of the Seminary Rooms in place of Mr. F. F. Lehman and Mr. P. M. Hickey.
THE OTHER LIBRARIES.
The Medical Library had assigned to it for the year 1887,
$1,000.00 of the special appropriation for libraries, for that year.
This made it possible to buy some sorely needed books, as well
as to carry the periodicals and do the binding and mending.
The two last things are all that can be accomplished with the
usual, annual appropriation of $500.00.
The additions for the year were 260 volumes, and 51 pamphlets. Of these 160 volumes were purchased, 25 volumes and 51
pamphlets were presented, and 75 volumes were the result of
binding.
The total of bills certified to by the librarian for this year, is
829.08. The directions of the expenditures were as follows:
For books- -    - -  -          --â€”.-. ---- $ 524.40
For periodicals ------  ---. â€” --. ----__  227.03
For binding and mending -- ---------               77.65
Total --- â€”---------    -        --- $ 829.08
To the Law Library there have been added during the year
218 volumes, and to the Library of the Dental College, 17 volumles.
In my report last year I said that " the University Library
is the Public Library of the State for the increase of knowledge.'
I repeat it in this report. I do not mean-no one, I trust, will
understand me as meaning â€”that knowledge is not increased
by the other libraries, whether they are public, or proprietary
libraries. But I am sure that I am right in saying that the
especial purpose for which they exist is the diffusion of knowledge â€”the distribution of the general fund. That through facilities offered by them knowledge is increased, I do not doubt;
but it is for its diffusion that they are particularly equipped.
Now the especial purpose for which the University Library ex



278


OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


ists is the increase of knowledge â€”to add to the general fund by
discovery and appropriation â€”thisfirst, diffusion second.
In its equipment then, the University Library must differ
not a little from the Public Library. It needs especially the results of all investigation-investigation of mind and investigation of matter. It needs all the books which record the application of principles in the regulation of human society, and all
those which record the application of natural forces to production in the industrial world. And then there are the liberal
arts to be taught â€”the aesthetic spirit in man to be guided,
strengthened, cultivated. The modern University is a more
practical institution than that from which it is descended, but it
is still the seat of the literae humnaniores, as when the apostles of
the Renaissance taught humanism from the chairs of the nlediaeval Italian Universities, The University Library needs, then,
in addition to what I have already enumerated, the classics of all
the languages, the dead and the living â€”all the best things of
the world, said in the best way. These are "the True, the
Beautiful and the Good " â€”the food on which the aesthetic nature must feed if it would grow.
Therefore it would seem that to gather these is the peculiar
function of the University Library, both in general as regards all
Universities, and in particular as regards our own. Is our Library
equipped for a proper discharge of this function? No, it has
only the nucleus of such an equipment. The University, by its
phenomenal growth has won, and maintains, a place, in numbers in attendance, and in the variety of instruction, abreast of
the oldest and strongest Institutions of Learning in the Country.
But in this particular and most important point of the possession of books, it is behind all its comnanions â€”behind in the
number of volumes possessed, behind in the means of annual
increase. Neither have we great libraries in our immediate
neighborhood as Harvard and Columbia have. In the competition for students a comparison of library statistics hurts us,
therefore, but it is not that we suffer in this comparison that is
the grievous thing. The grievous thing is that every day, in
every department, in the work that is carried on, some book is
needed that we do not have, and for lack of money, cannot get.
Whence is to come our help? Is it to come from the Legislature? If the members of that body can be made to see with
clear vision, yes. Any plan that the Board may devise for securing an appropriation for the library larger than those recently




OCTOBER MEETING, 1888.


279


made, will be joyfully received here, and all effbrts to carry the
plan out to a successful issue cordially seconded.
And at a time when men and women of wealth are giving
money with a liberality hitherto unknown, in very many instances either to found, or to enlarge libraries â€”and when benefactors have begun to flow in upon ourselves, may we not hope
that help is to come from private sources also?
I am very confident that help from both of these sources
waits upon a fuller knowledge of our necessities.
I cannot believe that I am over sanguine or foolishly credulous in this. The teaching of experience as I read it, as I hear
it, and as I prove it, is that we must work wisely and diligently, and that as our faith is, so our reward shall be,
Respectfully submitted,

PITTSBURGH, PA., April 15th, 1889.
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
GENTLEMEN:-When I asked you for a leave of absence a
year ago, I expected to return to duty at the expiration of the

a line of professional work in this city that I have decided to do
so, and therefore I now tender you my resignation to take effect
June 30th, next.
While I make this request of you, I cannot do so without
also expressing my great personal regret at severing the ties
which have connected me with the University of Michigan for
nearly fifteen years and at leaving a field of work which has
been so long a source to me of both honor and pleasure.
Respectfully Yours,
JOHN W. LANGLEY.
Prof. Met, and Gen. Chem.

The joint committee to whom was referred the document relating to the endowment of a Classical Fellowship
in the University, submitted the following preamble and
resolutions which were unanimously adopted:
Whereas, Mrs. Catharine E. Jones proposes to endow a
Classical Fellowship in the University of Michigan, as a memorial to her husband, Professor Elisha Jones, on the terms and
conditions named in the following statement:
I, Catharine E. Jones, of the City of Ann Arbor, in the
County of Washtenaw, and State of Michigan, do hereby promise and covenant to and with the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, that I will establish in connection with said
University a Fellowship in memory of my husband, Elisha
Jones; said fellowship to be designated and known as the Elisha
Jones Classical Fellowship; it being my earnest purpose to encourage in my husband's name and memory as far as lies in my
power, patient, honest, accurate study of the Languages, Literatures, and Archaeology of Ancient Greece and Rome; and that
for the purpose of establishing and sustaining said Fellowship, I
do hereby pledge myself and my Estate to the amount of ten
thousand dollars as the principal sum of the Endowment, and
until the whole of said sum shall have been paid to the Board of
Regents, I further pledge myself and myEstate for the annual
payment of the sum of five hundred dollars, or such a sum as
with the income derived from the sum or sums that I may from
tinle to time pay to the Board of Regents, shall make the a, nual




304


ADJO URVNED MEETING, 1889.


income of five hundred dollars. And I will pay the said annual
sum in two equal semi annual installments at the beginning of
each semester.
When the Regents of the University shall have received
the whole of the Endowment Fund of ten thousand dollars, the
same shall be a perpetual and inviolable fund and be invested
and from time to time reinvested by said Regents in good interest bearing securities with interest payable annually or oftener;
said interest, and that only, to be devoted to and used by them
in support of said Fellowship as follows: ---There shall be a Board
of Examiners for the Elisha Jones Classical Fellowship consisting of the President of the University, the Senior Professor of
Greek, and the Senior Professor of Latin, and two other full Professors of the Academic Faculty, chosen by the above named appointees; the President of the University to be Chairman of the
Board and in his absence the Senior Professor of Greek, and in
the absence of both, the Senior Professor of Latin; a majority of
the members of said Board constituting a quorum to transact
business, and a majority of the votes of those present at any
meeting being necessary to the decision of any question. The
said Board of Examiners shall appoint candidates to the Elisha
Jones Classical Fellowship according to the following conditions
1. The candidate must have resided at the University of
Michigan as a student in the Academic Department at least
three entire semesters prior to the appointment; must have
made distinguished proficiency in the Greek and Latin languages, such proficiency to be ascertained by tests agreed upon
by the Examining Board; must be a Bachelor of Arts of not
more than two years' standing, and must possess an unexceptionable moral character.
2. The holder of said Fellowship must make the Greek and
Latin languages and literatures the special subjects of study during his, or her, incumbency, adding thereto such other branches
of study as may be chosen by the incumbent and approved by
the Examining Board.
3. The period of incumbency shall be limited to two academic years, but the incumbent may be removed by the Examing Board at-any time during this period, if said Board shall find
in his or her conduct or scholarship good and sufficient ground
for such removal; and therefore the incumbent shall at all timles
be liable to be called upon by the Board for examination or inquiry as to habits of life and study.




ADJO URNED MEETIVNG, 1889.


305


4. The two years of incumbency shall be spent at the University of Michigan unless at any time the Examining Board
shall see fit to allow the second year to be spent by the holder of
the Fellowship at Athens, or at Rome, or at some other place
deemed by the Board equally favorable to classical study, in the
systematic study of Classical Philology and Literature. If at
any period hereafter the degree of Master of Arts or any other
degree of the same significance shall take the place of Bachelor
of Arts in the University of Michigan, then in the above condition numbered 1 the limitation expressed by the words, " A
Bachelor of Arts of not more than two year's standing," shall be
changed so as to read, " A Master of Arts (or its equivalent) of
not more than two years standing." Of the candidates fulfilling
the requirements specified in article numbered 1 of the foregoing conditions the one best qualified in the judgment of the Examining Board to hold the Fellowship shall receive from the
chairman of the Examining Board a certificate of appointment
to the Elisha Jones Classical Fellowship, which shall entitle the
holder thereof to be paid one-half the annual stipend of said Fellowship, to-wit, two hundred and fifty dollars, on presentation
of the said certificate to the treasurer of the Board of Regents;
and thereafter on the first day of each semester the incumben t
shall be entitled to receive another installment of the same
amount as the first on presentation of a certificate of satisfactory
standing from the chairman of the Examining Board.
Furthermore, if the income of the Elisha Jones Classical
Fellowship shall at any time be applied otherwise than as specified in the foregoing conditions numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, then the
Fund shall revert to the said Catharine E. Jones, or, in case of
her death, to her heirs or legatees. But this forfeiture shall not
be incurred in consequence of any necessary diminution of the
semi-annual stipend under the circumstances hereinafter m-entioned or any necessary suspension of the Fellowship either on
account of the removal of the incumbent, or of the want of a
candidate properly qualified to hold it.
Furthermore, when the Elisha Jones Classical Fellowship
shall be fully established by the payment of the entire principal
sum of ten thousand dollars, the provision for an annual payment on the part of the donor, and other than the income from
the interest of the Endowment, shall cease and become forever
inoperative and void. In the event of my decease before the payment of said principal sum of ten thousand dollars, I do hereby




306


ADJOURNAED 3IEETING, 1889.


promise and agree that said sum or such part of said sum as at
the time of my decease may still remain unpaid shall be paid to
said Regents out of my Estate for the purpose and under the
terms and conditions above provided; and my Executor or Administrator is hereby directed to pay it accordingly.
Furthermore, when the annual income of said Endowment
shall exceed five hundred dollars, whatever excess there may be
shall remain in the hands of the Regents and be added to the
permanent Endowment Fund; and when the principal sum
shall furnish the income for a second Fellowship of the same
amount per annum as the first, a second Fellowship shall be established bearing the same name, organized on the same basis
and with the same conditions and control as the first Fellowship
already provided. In the event of the income from the Endowment Fund of ten thousand dollars exceeding the amount necessary to support the two Fellowships above mentioned, the surplus shall at the discretion of the Board of Regents either be
added to the principal sum and constitute a part of it or shall
be used to increase the semi-annual stipends of the two Fellowships; and if in the judgment of the Board of Regents the principal shall at any time have so increased as to justify, and provide for, the establishment of other Fellowships they shall be established, bearing the same name, organized on the same basis
and with the same conditions and control as the two Fellowships above mentioned. If at any time the annual income of the
Endowment Fund shall fall short of the amount necessary for
the semi-annual stipends above mentioned, then and only during the period of such deficiency shall such stipends be diminished in amount in exact proportion to the amount of such deficiency. This instrument is to become valid and effectual whenever the said Board of Regents of the University of Michigan
shall by vote at a meeting of their Board accept and ratify the
same and the terms thereof and not until then.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal in
the City of Ann Arbor aforesaid on the thirteenth day of April
in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eightynine.
CATHARINE E. JONES. [L. S.]
Witnesses:

Therefore, Resolved, That with gratitude for the donor's
generosity we accept the trust which she asks us to take, and
ratify the instrument above copied and the terms thereof.
Resolved, That the account of the. University with the
Elisha Jones Fellowship Fund shall be kept on the Treasurer's
books entirely distinct from the accounts with all other funds,

and maintenance of the Fellowship or Fellowships designated
in the statement above copied.
Resolved, That we avail ourselves of this opportunity to

funds which may be given us in trust for the endowment of
scholarships, fellowships, or professorships, or for the aid by any
means of the usefulness of the University.

student and as a teacher his work had awakened in the




OCTOBER MEETING, 1889.


349


minds of those most familiar with it high expectations of
his success in science. The impression made by his talent
was heightened by his great modesty, simplicity of character, and devotion to duty.
The University has rarely, if ever, been called to a
more serious loss than it sustained in the death on March
23, 1889, of George Sylvester Morris, Ph. D., Professor of
Philosophy. He was appointed Professor of Modern Languages in 1870, and held that position until 1879, when he
resigned to take a lectureship in philosophy in the Johns
Hopkins University. In 1884 he was elected to the chair
of philosophy in this University, and filled it until his
death.
In both chairs he taught with eminent success. His
learning in several fields was ample, in philosophy it may
be regarded as pre-eminent. By his writings he was well
and favorably known to scholars in philosophy on both
sides of the Atlantic. As a teacher he impressed his
pupils profoundly by his rich culture, the strength and
elevation of his character, his reverent devotion to truth,
and the inspiring ethical and religious spirit of all his
philosophic thinking. He was cut down suddenly in the
very prime of his strength, while large plans were yet
unexecuted. We had hoped, as he had, that many years of
his ripest and most fruitful work were before him. His
name and his memory will ever be cherished as one of the
choicest possessions of the University.
John W. Langley, S. B., M. D., Professor of General
Chemistry and Metallurgy, who has been a member of the
Literary and Medical Faculties for about fifteen years, has
resigned his office to engage in other pursuits in Pittsburg,
Pa. -Imbued as he is with the true scientific spirit, he has
by his skill as a chemist, a metallurgist, and a lecturer
rendered most valuable service to the University. Our
regret at his resignation is mitigated by the fact that he
is to give a brief course of lectures here on the metallurgy of steel.




350


OCTOBER MEETING, 1889.


Henry Sewall, Ph. D., M. D., has been compelled by
ill health to resign the chair of physiology, which he had
filled for seven years.  Bringing the best methods of
modern research and exposition to his work, he has by the
organization of the Physiological Laboratory and by his
lucid instruction awakened such an interest in his department that we greatly regret his resignation.
The Board of Regents have expressed in fitting terms
the appreciation which they and all connected with the
University have of the ability, learning and professional
skill of Professors Frothingham  and Maclean, who have
for many years been in the service of this institution.
The following degrees have been conferred:

The attendance this last year was jnst 600 larger,
(46.7 per cent.) than it was four years ago. The gain last
year over the preceding year by Departments was follows:

tal, 4; the Honoeopathic College lost one; total gain, 218.
Of candidates for higher degrees in the Literary Department the number has risen from 59 last year to 65 this
year.
At the time of the closing of this Report it is clear
that during the year just beginning the attendance will
be much larger than ever before, and will considerably
exceed 2000.
The number of women in attendance during the last
two years was as follows:

The proportion of women is smaller by nearly one
per cent. than it was last year. In 1887-8 they formed
sixteen and nine-tenths of the whole body of students; in
1888-9 not quite sixteen per cent. In the Literary Department they number twenty-five per cent. of the whole,
which is the same proportion as in 1886-7 and seven-tenths
of one per cent. less than in 1887-8. Of the 65 candidates
for higher degrees 13 were women.
The number of schools with which we have established the " diploma relation " continues to increase. Last
year there were 58. This year there are 71, of which 46 are
in Michigan; of those in other states, 19 are in Illinois, 3
in Minnesota, and one each in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and
Indiana. Several of the State Universities have imitated
our example in setting up this kind of connection with the
schools in their vicinity to their own great advantage and
to the advantage of the schools. No other system of
coaperation of school and university has been found,
which brings them into so harmonious relations and which

impresses both so deeply with the fruitful truth that their
interests are in large part identical, and that in order to
discharge their full duty to the public they must work
heartily together.
We have received this year one gift of peculiar interest and value. Mrs. Elisha Jones has placed in the hands
of the Regents as trustees the sum of ten thousand dollars for the endowment of one or more classical fellowships. The holder of the fellowship is to receive five hundred dollars a year. He is to be appointed by a Board of
Examiners, consisting of the President of the University,
the Senior Professor of Greek, the Senior Professor of
Latin, and two other Professors of the Academic Faculty,
to be chosen by the above named appointees. To be eligible to the fellowship the student must have been for three
semesters a member of the Academic Department, must
have made distinguished proficiency in Greek and Latin,
and must be a Bachelor of Arts of not more than two
years standing. When appointed he must make the Greek
and Latin languages and literatures his chief subjects of
study. The fellowship is tenable by one person for only
two years. The second year may, if the Board of Examiners permit, be spent in study at Athens or Rome. An
appointment to the fellowship has already been made.
We prize this gift by Mrs. Jones, because it is intended by her as a memorial of her husband, who gave so
large a part of his life to the service of the University in
instruction in the classics, because it will furnish such encouragement to advanced study of the ancient languages
and literatures, and because as the first instance of the
endowment of a fellowship in this University it may be
reasonably expected to stimulate other large-hearted donors to endow fellowships. The Regents desire it to be
understood, that as in this case they will whenever desired
as trustees accept funds for the endowment of scholarships, fellowships, professorships or for aiding the University in any manner, and keep such funds forever entirely

separate from all other funds of the University, and invest
them to the best of their ability, and administer them so
as to accomplish the objects of the donors.
It is a great mistake to suppose that we have not sore
need of private benefactions with which to enlarge the
usefulness of the University. There is not a penny at our
disposal for the aid in any way of a poor student, however
needy and meritorious he may be. The endowment of
some of our professorships, the establishment of a fund
for the more rapid increase of our libraries, the purchase
of a playground, the erection of a gymnasium, any or all
these modes of assistance would be most welcome to us
and most suitable for private beneficence. Our work so
grows upon our hands, the demands upon our resources so
rapidly multiply, we are now cramped at so many points
that notwithstanding the great and continued generosity
of the state, we cannot refrain from expressing the hope
that our alumni and other generous men and women will
from time to time supplement the legislative appropriations by donations for special purposes, as some of them
have already done.
The work of the various Departments has gone on
smoothly and successfully during the year. The unprecedented number of new students, who have joined us, about
four hundred, somewhat unduly crowded the sections in
the more elementary studies, especially those beginning
the modern languages and history. We have slightly increased the teaching force for the modern languages. It is
certain that we must soon add to our corps of instructors.
The completion of the Engineering Laboratory will now
enable us to handle more efficiently the increasing number of engineering students. But the rooms assigned to
the study of civil engineering in the south wing are inadequate to the proper accommodation of the large classes
crowded into them. We must soon find ample space for
them somewhere. The great interest in the application
of electricity to the arts of life has led us to establish a spec

ific course in electrical engineering, as most of the scientific schools in the country have done. The demand for
young men well trained in this branch is rapidly increasing, and we have regarded it as our duty to meet the call
which is made on us for thorough instruction in it.
We have also decided to make a change of some importance in the requirements for admission. We have
long desired to require some scientific training of students
entering on the courses leading to the degrees of A. B.
and Ph. B. We have delayed asking it, partly because
some schools were ill-prepared to give the necessary instruction in science, and partly because it was thought
difficult, if not impossible, for some schools which were
prepared to teach elementary science to add it to the instruction we asked in other branches without unduly
lengthening the period of preparatory study. But we
believe the time has arrived when by slight concessions
on our part in certain requirements and by some revision
of the school courses, the result can be accomplished.
Accordingly students entering as candidates for A. B. or
Ph. B. next year will be asked to present preparation in
physics and botany. Some of the advantages anticipated
from this change are the following: The classical students
will have had the disciplinary advantage of a little scientific training. They will be better fitted to make wisely
their elections between linguistic and scientific studies,
when the time for election comes. The elementary teaching of physics and botany can be dropped from the collegiate course, since the candidates for the degrees of B.
S. and B. L. are already required to have the preparation
in those branches now demanded of the students of Latin
and Greek. The classical courses will be made more popular in the schools. Many persons object to them now,
because they provide no instruction in science. For these
reasons we regard the modification of our requirements
as a marked improvement.
We have also altered the requirements for admission

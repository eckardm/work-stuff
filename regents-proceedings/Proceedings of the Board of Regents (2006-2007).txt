JULY MEETING, 2006

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
July 21, 2006
The Regents convened at 9:35 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and
Taylor. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov,
Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers,
Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent White participated by telephone.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She noted that the annual Ann
Arbor Art Fairs, a symbol of the vitality of the community, were underway, and that the
presence of this type of activity had played a key role in the recently announced
decision of Google to establish a corporate office in Ann Arbor. She welcomed them as
a new neighbor.
President Coleman reported that Allen Lichter, dean of the Medical School, had
announced his decision to step down from that position to become chief executive
officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncologists. She thanked him for his
excellent service as dean and as a faculty member, noting that he had played a key role
in the development of the Life Sciences Institute and the Biomedical Sciences Research
Building.
President Coleman also commented on the sudden death of former mayor Jerry
Jernigan, noting that he had also had a 30-year career at the University of Michigan.
Michigan Stadium Renovation. President Coleman reported that the stadium
renovation website had recently been enhanced and would soon include preliminary site
plans. Once the draft schematic designs have been completed, there will be a period of
public review and discussion, and the designs will be posted on the website for
comment and feedback.
2006-2007 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
President Coleman commented that the University appreciates the support shown
by the governor and the legislature in their decision to increase the its appropriation by
3%. However, she pointed out that the University would still be making up for previous
cuts in state funding. To this end, the proposed budget reflects more than $18 million in
cost cuts, including greater efficiency in energy use, renegotiated contracts with
vendors, and changes in purchasing and inventory management. The budget also
includes new funding for such important new initiatives as recruitment and retention of
faculty, modest salary increase for faculty and staff, and several new academic
initiatives. The budget provides for a modest tuition increase of 5.5% for the majority
of undergraduate students, and an increase in undergraduate financial aid of 7.7%,



July Meeting, 2006

pursuant to the University's long-standing commitment to provide financial aid for all
qualified resident undergraduate students.
Report of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Executive Vice President Slottow said that his report would provide context to the
proposed operating budgets by focusing on the University's balance sheet, which is a
measure of the University's overall financial health. He noted that two factors protect
the balance sheet: sound financial policies and a strong internal control structure. He
commended the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee for the progress it had made
over the past 18 months in strengthening the internal controls, noting that the committee
had completely restructured its charter to increase the transparency of internal controls
and best practices consistent with Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. He reported that as a
result, vice presidents, deans and department heads must sign certification letters
asserting to their financial controls, and this year's certification would include
additional requirements, including IT security, conflict of interest, and tightening of all
controls surrounding employment and pay.
Executive Vice President Slottow gave a presentation illustrating the strength of
the balance sheet, including charts that indicate the healthy relationship between assets
and liabilities and the relationship of financial assets to notes and bonds payable. He
pointed out liabilities that are not formally listed as liabilities, such as post retirement
health benefits and deferred building maintenance and noted that the majority of
non-hospital financial assets are in the form of endowment, which are subjected to use
restrictions. Other major threats to the balance sheet include the volatility of capital
markets, the state of the Michigan economy and rising costs for health care and energy.
Executive Vice President Slottow then reported on the University's efforts with
respect to short-term, non-endowment assets. He stated there has been a continued
focus on getting cash in faster, particularly with respect to the long term disability
program, in which the rate of long term disability payments has been decreased by 17%,
and by restructuring banking services. In the case of banking services, redundant
services are being consolidated and redundant cash handling is being eliminated
through remote deposit and electronic cash receipts.
Regarding the endowment, Executive Vice President Slottow reported that it is the
10th largest in the country and the distribution comprises about 6% of the University's
operating revenues. The endowment supports financial aid, faculty and academic
programs, and he said that the University will need to rely more heavily on private
giving and investment returns in the future than it has in the past.
Mr. Slottow then reviewed the University's physical assets and displayed a chart
showing the University's sustained commitment to renewal of the physical plant over
time, with about $150-$175 million per year in constant dollars allotted to renovate
existing structures. He also displayed a chart depicting the facilities condition ratio,
which is a measure of the cost of a building's infrastructure needs compared to the
building's replacement value. He said that a ratio is computed for each General Fund
building on the Ann Arbor campus, and the ratios illustrate continued improvement in
our facilities for recent years.

2



July Meeting, 2006

Executive Vice President Slottow described a new project being conducted jointly
by the provost's office and his office involving a multi-year, comprehensive effort to
enhance the operating efficiency and utilization of General Fund buildings.
Components include encouraging off-peak use of facilities, providing budgetary
incentives to increase productivity of space, and improving energy utilization, among
others.
Mr. Slottow noted that higher education is the most frequent target of IT system
hackers, and described some of the improved information technology security practices
that have been undertaken to improve the University's security in this area. He then
described some initiatives being taken to invest in the University's human capital,
noting that the University employs a higher percentage of minorities and women than
the state and region. Among the efforts underway in this area are the Healthy
Community Initiative, VOICES of the Staff, and implementation of the eMploy
applicant management system.
In the area of liability management, Mr. Slottow observed that the University
continues to enjoy the highest possible credit ratings from both Standard & Poor's and
Moody's.   The University undertakes aggressive interest expense management,
maximizes insurance coverage to obtain the lowest premiums, and takes management
actions to reduce post-employment benefits liability.
Executive Vice President Slottow concluded by noting that the proposed operating
budget is consistent with maintaining the University's overall financial health, and
quoted from Standard & Poor's that "UM is one of only three U.S. public universities
that have an 'AAA' rating from Standard & Poor's," and this rating is based upon
"strong financial liquidity,...solid financial performance,...modest debt burden,...manageable 10-year capital plan,...strong fund raising capacity, and...a national
reputation for excellence in academics and research."
Proposed Ann Arbor General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and
Fee Rates for FY 2006-07
Provost Sullivan commented that this budget includes an increase in the state
appropriation of 2.9% for the Dearborn campus, 3.0% for the Flint campus, and 3.0%
for the Ann Arbor campus. She displayed a slide summarizing the current fund budget
totals for all campuses, indicating that total revenues will equal $4,874,145,918 in
2006-07 and total expenditures will equal $4,817,317,644. She explained that the
budget is developed with three main objectives in mind: excellence, achieved by
recruiting and maintaining excellent faculty; access, achieved through the University's
policy of meeting the demonstrated financial need of all Michigan resident
undergraduate students; and innovation, achieved by providing funding for key
academic initiatives.
Provost Sullivan gave examples of cost savings that illustrate the University's
prudent management of the General Fund budget, including changes in procurement
processes, consolidation of administrative operations and service reductions,
elimination of duplication, and shifting costs from the General Fund to other sources.
She delineated the factors that comprise the $80.5 million budget challenge for
2006-07. These include cost increases of $52.7 million for continuing operations
including facilities, salaries, benefits, and general inflation, and $27.8 million for such

3



July Meeting, 2006

essential initiatives as faculty growth, academic program initiatives, information
technology, and compliance. The sources of funding to meet the $80.5 million
challenge will be derived from $62.2 million in net new revenue and $18.3 million in
reductions and reallocations.
Provost Sullivan observed that while the University is grateful for the increase in
state funding, this year's expected allocation of $326 million is less than the allocation
of $363 million that the University received in FY 2002. After providing for inflation,
the latter figure would now equal $413 million, leaving a gap of $87 million between
the current allocation and that received in FY2002. She displayed a graph illustrating
that as the amount of state appropriation has decreased, the percentage of the General
Fund budget provided by tuition and fees has increased.
Provost Sullivan reported that 2006-07 tuition for lower division resident LSA
students, which enrolls about 64% of the undergraduate population, will increase by
$510 per year (5.5%). Tuition for the Schools of Art, Music, Theatre & Dance, and
Nursing, will be equal to that charged by the College of LSA, but the increase will be
$600 (6.6%) because their rates had previously been lower. Tuition for the School of
Dentistry will increase by 5.5%, for the College of Engineering, 7.0%, and Kinesiology
by 5.5%. In the case of engineering, she explained that the additional funds will
provide for significant technology enhancements and the hiring of 27 additional faculty
in order to reduce the student faculty ratio from 16:1 to 15:1. In total, 76% of
undergraduate students will be subject to a 5.5% tuition increase.
Provost Sullivan displayed charts comparing tuition and fee increases among Big
Ten institutions, Michigan public universities, and select private universities, noting
that Michigan's figures are among the lowest in both groupings. She concluded by
recommending the proposed FY 2007 Ann Arbor Campus General Fund Operating
Budget, of $1,295,048,000, for approval.
Proposed Flint Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and
Fee Rates for FY 2006-07
Chancellor Mestas noted that the proposed budget coincides with the three pillars
outlined in the recently-adopted strategic plan:  academic excellence, student
centeredness, and engaged citizenship. The budget assumes a 3% increase in state
funding and a 2% drop in enrollment. The proposed tuition and fee increase for
resident undergraduate students for 2006-07 equals $240 per semester, a 7.9% increase.
The proposed increase for resident graduate students would be $130 per semester, or
4%.
Chancellor Mestas pointed out that this increase is significantly below the average
tuition increase for the past five years of $499 for all of Michigan's public universities.
The budget includes a 10% increase in institutional financial aid to help offset the
increase in tuition and fees. He noted that raising funds for student scholarships is a top
priority of the Flint Campus's capital campaign. The budget provides for a 3% faculty
and staff salary increase and addresses the issue of faculty salary compression by
proposing an additional 1% increase in the salaries of associate and full professors. The
Flint campus also plans to establish an equity fund meant to address individual cases of
compensation inequality among faculty and staff.

4



July Meeting, 2006

Chancellor Mestas noted that the generous support for higher education in 2006-07
provided by the governor and legislature have enabled the campus to limit the increases
in tuition and fees, even in the face of major increases in operational expenses caused
mostly by rising costs for energy and health care. However, he observed that the losses
inflicted through years of under-funding cannot be reversed in one year. For 2006-07,
state funding will comprise 33% of the campus's budget, compared to 50% seven years
ago. Even so, he noted that the combination of cost and quality provided at the
University of Michigan-Flint continues to make it one of the best educational values in
the state.
Proposed Dearborn Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition
and Fee Rates for FY 2006-07
Chancellor Little described the extensive, consultative processed used to derive
the budget. He acknowledged the 2.9% increase in state funding for 2006-07, but noted
that the campus is still left with $2.5 million less than it had in 2002 in real dollars. He
stated that the priorities for the Dearborn campus are preserving educational quality,
sustaining accessibility, and maintaining a positive and equitable work environment for
faculty and staff. The recommended tuition increase is 8%, with a 12.9% increase in
institutionally funded financial aid, and a 3% salary program for faculty and staff. In
addition, $200,000 will be earmarked to address faculty equity and compression issues.
The remaining funds will be used to cover new space operations, increased utility costs,
and a small number of new initiatives.
2006-2007 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Harper introduced Dr. Robert Winfield and other leaders of the
University Health Service (UHS) who were present. She noted that in addition to
supporting medical visits, laboratory testing, and other primary health care services
without additional out-of-pocket costs for students, the student fee also supports
extensive student health educational programs across campus in the areas of alcohol,
relationships and sexuality, and eating disorders. UHS also takes a leadership role in
other campus-wide health-related initiatives, such as the pandemic influenza
preparedness initiative.
Vice President Harper stated that while UHS continues to emphasize revenue and
cost containment measures, a rate increase of 5.5% ($8.11) per student per term is being
requested to provide funding for inflationary operating increases, utilities expense
increases, and public health and health promotion enhancements related to alcohol.
2006-07 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
Vice President Harper reported that no increase is being requested in the current
fee assessments of $7.19 per student per term for MSA, $6.00 per student per term for
SLS, and $1.50 per student per term for school and college governments. She pointed
out that MSA leadership works with staff in the Division of Student Affairs to ensure
the sound financial management of the funding provided by these student fees.



July Meeting, 2006

Michigan Student Assembly (MSA) Financial Report
Vice President Harper submitted the annual financial report for MSA for the
period December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and noted that MSA continues to be
a responsible steward of its Regentally-approved funding.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) FY2007
Operating Budget
Executive Vice President Kelch congratulated all faculty and staff at the
University of Michigan Health System for a remarkable year. He introduced Mr. Tony
Denton, chief operating officer, and Mr. Tom Marks, interim CFO. He introduced Mr.
Douglas Strong, director and chief executive officer designate of UMHHC, to present
the proposed budget.
Mr. Strong observed that the UMHHC has a well-deserved reputation for high
quality, innovative patient care. The institution is on sound financial footing and enjoys
a strong partnership with the Medical School and other schools at the University.
Mr. Strong reported that the UMHHC had originally budgeted an operating margin
of 4% for FY2006, but now has projected a margin of 5.5% due to the consistently high
level of performance of staff and faculty and a continued increase in inpatient and
outpatient activity and demand. He said that producing the necessary operating margin
requires a combination of achievement in activity levels, revenue per case, expense per
case, and managing capacity, and he described the ways in which the emphasis has
changed among these factors over time. For FY2006 and FY2007, there is a growing
pressure from payers to reduce the rate of growth in health care expenses, and the
UMHHC focus will turn to managing capacity, improving productivity, and continuing
to emphasize activity increases.
The objectives for FY2007 are to provide additional capacity to permit growth in
both inpatient and outpatient activity, to achieve a 4% operating margin, to maintain a
market-competitive pricing strategy, to provide a market-competitive salary program,
and to establish a leadership expectation that operations must be managed within a
volume-adjusted budget. Mr. Strong displayed a chart illustrating budgeted results for
FY2006 and expectations for FY2007 in the areas of discharges, outpatient cases, and
total adjusted cases. He noted that budgeted growth rates are more aggressive than for
the previous year. Regarding capacity issues, the emphasis for FY2006 and FY2007 is
to create capacity within existing bed resources, while in FY2008, inpatient capacity
will be expanded through the opening of the Cardiovascular Center and other
renovations. He also described the areas in which the UMHHC has added ancillary
capacity since 2005.
Mr. Strong displayed a chart describing the proposed FY2007 UMHHC budget,
which calls for total operating revenue of $1,549.6 million and total expenses of
$1,487.4 million, for an operating margin of $62.2 million (4.0%). He pointed out that
the institution is aggressively reinvesting its margin in its future so that it will be better
able to serve the population of the state and beyond. Major challenges for FY2007
include managing inpatient capacity and high occupancy rates, managing within the
volume adjusted budget, reacting to continued changes in the payer climate,
implementing an Orders Management Project, and start-up costs associated with the

6



July Meeting, 2006

opening of the Cardiovascular Center. He observed that the proposed budget is
assertive, but achievable, and is necessary to fulfill the mission, goals, and aspirations
of the Health System, and requested approval.
FY2007 University of Michigan Athletic Department Operating Budget
Mr. Bill Martin, athletic director, presented the Athletic Department operating
budget for FY2007. He said that his primary goal upon assuming his position had been
to stabilize the budget, and this goal was achieved largely through implementation of
the Michigan Stadium priority seating program. The current work plan includes
fundraising efforts on behalf of other capital projects, and, with regard to Michigan
Stadium, completion of the schematic design, developing a marketing plan for premium
seating, and developing major gift proposals in support of the project.
Mr. Martin discussed renewal rates for the preferred seating program, noting that
the increase in renewal rate that occurred in FY2006 is an indication of the success of
the program. Total donations received through this program increased from $6,046,270
in FY2005 to $11,262,075 in FY2006. He reported that the wait list for season football
tickets currently stands at up to 9,000 accounts, or a minimum of 18,000 seats.
Mr. Martin reported that projected total revenues for FY2006 are projected to total
$80,360,000, with expenses totaling $64,176,000. For FY2007, the revenue budget is
$76,015,000, and the expense budget is $68,844,000, for a total operating surplus of
$7,171,000. Capital expenditures are projected to total $5,135,000, yielding a net
margin of $2,036,000. He noted that the calculations are based on very conservative
budget estimates. He also pointed out that $4.5 million will be transferred into the
deferred maintenance fund. Mr. Martin also noted that financial aid for student athletes
will constitute $13,725,000 in FY2007. There will be a projected operating surplus of
$4,668,000.
Mr. Martin reported that the newly completed Academic Center has been
enthusiastically received by student athletes, and the new football locker room and
Junge Family Champions Center (an events center) are being used by all teams as well
as other University units for various functions. In the area of major capital initiatives,
funding needs to be identified for an indoor fieldhouse, a basketball practice facility,
and renovation of Crisler Arena. Crisler, he noted, has become a second-rate facility
that is in dire need of improvement.
President Coleman then called for discussion and vote on all of the budget action
requests.

governor of the Federal Reserve Board. He returned to the University in September
2005 as the Richard A. Musgrave Collegiate Professor of Public Policy and interim
provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, serving through May 2006.
As interim provost, he fostered emerging University initiatives, including long-range
financial planning, the China initiative, and the Graham Environmental Sustainability
Institute. Since June 2006 he has been serving as special advisor to the president in the
area of budget implementation during the transition to the new provost.
Professor Gramlich has written numerous books and articles on such topics as
macroeconomics, budget policy, tax policy, income redistribution, fiscal federalism,
and Social Security. He has made important contributions to the understanding of
complex public issues, providing both theoretical insight and guidance to policymakers.
His book, A Guide to Benefit-Cost Analysis, is a standard in the field, widely used as a
textbook. Professor Gramlich is also an accomplished teacher, highly regarded by
students. At the Ford School, he helped to initiate the applied policy seminar in which
students work with local governments on current policy concerns.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar, educator, and administrator by

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 2006

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
September 22, 2006
The Regents convened at 9:40 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Richner, and White.
Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Vice
President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President
Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Newman, Regent
Taylor, and Chancellor Little were absent. Regent Newman participated in part of the
meeting by telephone.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She thanked the Regents for
having hosted a reception for students the previous day.
President Coleman observed that the Stephen M. Ross School of Business M.B.A.
program had been named the best in the country by the Wall Street Journal, for the
second time in the past three years. She also called attention to the announcement of
the creation of the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy Institute, which will study the
generation and use of energy, as well as public policies about energy. She noted that
Vice President Stephen Forrest had spearheaded this effort, which would utilize the
resources of a number of schools and colleges.
Sale of M-CARE
President Coleman stated that she fully supports the plan for the sale of M-CARE
and its subsidiaries that is being brought forward by Executive Vice Presidents Kelch
and Slottow. She stated that the University would continue to offer a choice of high
quality, comprehensive health plans at a reasonable cost, and pointed out that
competitive benefits packages are essential in recruiting top faculty and staff. President
Coleman also assured employees that they could choose M-CARE with confidence
during the upcoming open enrollment period for 2007, and that the University would
retain control over the design and costs of its employee health plans. The new health
care plans that will take effect in 2008 will be designed by the University and will be as
similar as possible to the current plans with respect to cost and coverage.
Regent Deitch announced that he would be recusing himself from consideration of
the sale of M-CARE and would be leaving the room until the discussion and vote had
been concluded. President Coleman noted that Regent Taylor had also recused himself
from all of the discussions on this issue.
Regent Newman joined the meeting by telephone at this point.
Dr. Kelch presented the proposal for the sale of M-CARE with the aid of a slide
presentation. He stated that it is important that the Health System stay sharply focused

35



September Meeting, 2006

on its core mission, and to insure that its resources remain directed toward this mission,
which includes patient care, research, and education.
Dr. Kelch thanked all of the people who had worked on this proposal, but singled
out Zelda Geyer-Silvia, CEO of M-CARE, and Dave Morlock, project leader and
director of financial planning at the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health
Centers. He reviewed the history of M-CARE, noting it had been launched in 1986 as a
non-profit, University-owned and designed HMO, focused on prevention and active
management of health care choices and expenses.
Dr. Kelch reported that M-CARE is a successful entity, with more than 200,000
members, including 60,000 associated with the University of Michigan. It is one of the
very few university-affiliated plans that are open to other employers and individuals.
M-CARE serves 1,500 employer groups, includes 5,100 providers, and offers a variety
of health plan options. It has consistently received "excellent" ratings by national
ratings agencies in many categories. M-CARE utilizes evidence-based treatment
guidelines developed by University of Michigan physicians and offers its members
access to the University's top-ranked medical center, in addition to community
physicians and hospitals. M-CARE has offered a number of innovative programs and
services.
Nevertheless, due to the changing national health care climate and the significant
investments that would be needed to allow M-CARE to continue to flourish, Dr. Kelch
said it is the right time to consider the sale of this successful enterprise, bearing in mind
what is best for the Health System and the University. He reported that the University
first began exploring the viability of a transaction with Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Michigan (BCBSM) and Blue Care Network (BCN) in May 2006, and he reviewed how
the discussions, analyses, and due diligence had been conducted from that point until
today. Several consultants had been hired, including Cain Brothers, a Wall Street
investment banking firm, which had performed an independent valuation of M-Care and
assisted with the analyses and subsequent negotiations. He stated that the University
and BCBSM management teams had reached an agreement in principle regarding all
key elements of the transaction, and that the definitive transaction documents are now
ready for execution.
Dr. Kelch noted that the Health System had specific requirements that must be met
in order for the sale of M-CARE to be considered. These include the following:
* It must further our mission.
* It must allow us to provide the same high-level health care coverage for the
University community, at the same price as would be incurred with
M-CARE. He noted that the University will remain in charge of the design
of its competitive benefits program.
* It must ensure that health care coverage for all members be constant, with no
lapses.
* It must involve a company that shares our values and meets our needs. In
this regard, he pointed out that BSBSM, like M-CARE, is a non-profit,

36



September Meeting, 2006

Michigan-based organization and is committed to improving the health of
the state's citizens.
* It must allow good transition options for our employees. He noted that the
agreement calls for the University to maintain a seat on the BCN board.
* The University must have a role in the ongoing governance of the purchaser.
He then explained how this transaction meets all of these requirements. He also
described the joint venture to be created by the UM and BCBSM that will commission
projects and research studies to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and
appropriateness of health care in Michigan. The venture will be led by an 8-member
board consisting of 4 representatives from each entity in a 50/50 equity partnership,
with a capitalization of $7-$10 million plus likely additional funding to be provided by
BCBSM.
Dr. Kelch noted that a solid plan is in place to retain M-CARE employees through
the sale and to assist them in the transition period after the sale, and said that up to $10
million has been committed for the employee transition plan. Following approval of the
sale by the Regents, it is hoped that the governmental regulatory approval process will
be completed by late 2006 or 2007. He stated that the combined price for M-CARE and
its subsidiary M-CAID to Blue Care Network, and for Michigan Health Insurance
Company, M-CARE's subsidiary, to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, is $240
million, which is supported by a fairness opinion from Cain Brothers.
Dr. Kelch described the regulatory approval process that would occur following
approval of the sale. In response to a question from Regent Maynard regarding
concerns that had been raised by members of the public, Dr. Kelch commented that
each of the approximately 3 dozen communications he had received so far was
receiving an individual response. In general, people have expressed concerns about
changes in health care costs, about being able to keep their current doctors, and about
the large size of BCBSM.
Regent McGowan asked whether any employees who belong to AFSCME or other
unions would be affected by the sale. Dr. Kelch responded that no M-CARE employees
are members of any union. However, some of the positions that some M-CARE
employees will be offered at BCBSM or BCN are affiliated with the UAW.
Regent Richner asked what method Cain Brothers had used to reach the
conclusion that the price was fair. Executive Vice President Slottow commented that
the procedures followed by Cain Brothers are consistent with practices used in the
marketplace, in which multiple methodologies are employed to arrive at a range for
what would be an appropriate market fair price. One of the representatives from Cain
Brothers described the process they had used to arrive at their conclusion, which
included doing a financial analysis of M-CARE and using a number of valuation
techniques to arrive at independent valuation ranges to help guide management as to
what the expectations should be. He commented that the $240 million is at the high end
of each of the ranges and transactions, and based on these studies they delivered an
opinion that the transaction consideration is fair to the University.

37



September Meeting, 2006

Regent Maynard inquired about how soon the joint venture will be getting
underway. Dr. Kelch introduced Dr. Jack Billi, who has been the lead person in the
development of the joint venture. Dr. Billi stated that after the agreements are executed
and the joint venture is legally formed, the board members will be appointed and an
executive director will be selected who will lead the development of a business plan.
The business plan will state the priorities of the projects, and after it is adopted by the
board, individual projects will be commissioned. He noted that scope of the projects
will be state-wide.
Dr. Kelch stated that the board of BCBSM has approved the transaction.
Regent Brandon moved that the Board of Regents authorize the sale of M-CARE
and its subsidiary M-CAID to Blue Care Network and the sale of M-CARE's subsidiary
Michigan Health Insurance Corporation to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan for a
total negotiated price of $240 million, subject to final due diligence and review by
relevant government authorities; acknowledge the authority of the executive vice
president and chief financial officer to negotiate and execute a final purchase agreement
and all related documents; and authorize the EVPCFO to take appropriate actions
required of the University under the purchase agreement and such other actions as may
be necessary to complete the transaction, including, but not limited to, revising the
M-CARE bylaws and articles of incorporation to convert to a stock corporation to
facilitate this transaction, all in close collaboration with the executive vice president for
medical affairs.
Regent White asked whether the University had ever previously engaged in joint
ventures with BCBSM. Dr. Kelch responded that the University had collaborated with
BCBSM on multiple projects and the two entities had had a series of contractual
relationships. However, this 50-50 partnership would be a new entity, founded with the
hope that it would become one of the nation's leading health services quality
improvement research entities.
Executive Vice President Slottow corrected language in the 5th paragraph of the
Regents Communication. The word "valuation" should be replaced by "fairness
opinion."
Executive Vice President also recognized the efforts of others who had been
involved in this transaction, including Associate Vice President Laurita Thomas, Health
System Chief Human Resources Officer Deborah Childs, Associate Vice President
Marilyn Knepp, and others.
Regent McGowan seconded Regent Brandon's motion. The vote was then taken,
and it was approved unanimously, with six Regents in favor and Regents Deitch and
Taylor not participating.
Regent Newman disconnected from the meeting at this point.
Presentation: University of Michigan Law School
President Coleman introduced Evan Caminker, dean of the Law School.
Dean Caminker reviewed the history of the law school, noting that it is considered
to be one of the most outstanding law schools in the country and the world. It has
consistently been ranked between 6 and 8 in the U.S. News and World Report rankings,

38



September Meeting, 2006

and first among public law schools. The school enrolls about 350 new students per
year, and strives for the classes to be very talented and diverse in order to enrich the
academic and social climate of the Law School community. There is also a one-year
graduate program for lawyers from foreign countries.
With respect to faculty members, he said that the major focus of the faculty's
scholarship is to make contributions to topics that are of interest to the broader
community on the local, national, and international levels. He noted that Michigan's
law faculty differs from that of other institutions in three key areas, including its focus
on interdisciplinarity, on international issues, and on collegiality. He observed that the
interdisciplinary approach is grounded in the belief that the capacity to function in more
than one intellectual field, and to connect the work of one field to another, has both
intrinsic academic merit and is also very important in learning the complexities of the
larger world.
Dean Caminker said that the Law School is known for having one of the top
international faculty in the country. He also noted that the law school's faculty is
known internationally for having a collegial relationship, which is a unique
characteristic among law schools.
With respect to the school's educational mission, he said that the school is focused
on teaching students critical reasoning skills that will allow them to become great
lawyers no matter what they choose to focus on in their career. Students are taught
practical lawyering skills and collaboration skills, and are inculcated with a great sense
of ethics and morality.
Dean Caminker described the classroom and clinical experiences provided to
students, noting that faculty are encouraged to develop close connections with students.
Dean Caminker described some of the challenges faced by the school with respect
to faculty recruiting, spousal employment, recruiting and retaining single faculty
members, and student recruiting. He also commented that the Law School's facilities,
while beautiful, are old and outdated, ranking last among those of its peers with respect
to the amount of space per student outside of libraries. To continue to offer the best
education in the United States suited for a 21st century education, he said that the Law
School needs to be able to expand and improve its facilities.
Regent Richner pointed out that the Law School's facilities have been funded
mostly with private support, and asked how this compares with the funding of its
competitors. Dean Caminker responded that every other top law school in the country,
including public schools, has engaged in a major expansion or renovation in the past 10
years, although he does not know whether the funding has been from public or private
sources. He also noted, in response to a question from Regent Richner, that the tuition
for in-state residents is $3,000 less per year than it is for nonresidents.
President Coleman thanked Dean Caminker for his presentation and turned to the
committee reports.

She said that net assets had increased by $1.1 billion to $9.9 billion in 2006. The other

with these changes.

reported that Regents Newman and Maynard had attended the meeting along with
Associate Vice President Thomas and Provost Sullivan; Regent Taylor was unable to

also received an update on current dean searches.

September Meeting, 2006

Michigan Student Assembly Report. Nicole Stallings, president of the Michigan
Student Assembly, thanked the Regents for providing an opportunity the previous day
for students to meet with them. She reported that the first few weeks of school had
brought a lot of activity onto campus, with 1,207 student organizations having
registered with MSA. She reported on various projects and activities the MSA has
embarked on. President Coleman also commented on the energy she has observed
among students on campus.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May gave an update of the Michigan
Difference Campaign through June 30, 2006. On that date, the campaign total was
$2.182 billion; however, an additional $53 million has been added during July and
August 2006, so the total has now reached $2.235 million. Vice President May reported
that about 10,000 institutions and 283,000 individuals have contributed to the
campaign, and that more than half of the individual contributors are non-alumni.
Vice President May reviewed the chart in the agenda book denoting giving by
purpose of gift, noting that the area of faculty support has been lagging in reaching its
goal, and this would be an area of focus over the next two years. A second targeted
area will be need-based scholarships. In the "buildings" category, he pointed out that
the University has very ambitious goals in this area, and the goals for 12 of the 23
capital facilities projects have been reached to date.

Naming Guidelines. Regent McGowan asked Vice President May to review
naming guidelines for buildings. He stated that a donor would need to donate
approximately 50% of the cost of a new building in order for that building to carry the
donor's name. for an existing, unnamed building, the donor would need to donate about
50% of the replacement value to have it named. Vice President May noted that the gift
agreements state that the University will honor that gift as long as the building exists. If
the building is razed, the name will be carried forward in some appropriate way,
although not necessarily as the name of the new building. Most likely, a new donor's
name would go on the new building.
Vice President May stated that the guidelines are silent with regard to the
renovation of existing buildings that bear honorific names of iconic University
individuals. Regent McGowan asked why the same guidelines would not apply to
honorific names of existing buildings as to buildings named for a donor. Vice President
May responded that now that the University of Michigan and other public universities
are beginning to tear down buildings or do major renovations, there is a need to address
the issue of honorific names for buildings since the current guidelines are silent on this
issue.
Regent McGowan inquired whether it would ever be contemplated to change the
names of buildings that were named for legendary University of Michigan figures like
athletic coaches and presidents.      Vice President May     responded that such    a
recommendation would have to come before the Regents, should there ever be a desire

60



September Meeting, 2006

to change the names of these buildings. Regent McGowan said it would be advisable
for the Regents to discuss this issue on which the current guidelines are silent, and
suggested that the supposition would be that the same criteria would apply for buildings
named after donors: once named, always named.
Regent McGowan suggested that the Regents should have input into the
development of the overall naming guidelines, and expressed that she is particularly
concerned about any proposed changes in the names of existing buildings. Vice
President May agreed that this issue needs to be clarified, and said that a committee had
been charged with doing background work to assist the Regents in this endeavor.
Regent McGowan asked Vice President May to confirm that no action is currently
under consideration to change the name of any campus building that already bears the
name of an individual. Vice President May responded that nothing is being brought
forward at this point in time, and added that if any requests for name changes arise
which are not addressed in the existing guidelines, they would be brought to the
Regents for approval. At this time, he clarified, "we continue to try to make sure that
everybody feels good about the contributions that they're making, and the honorific
namings as well. We will not take any actions without bringing any of those things to
the Board."
Regent Deitch commented that he shares Regent McGowan's concerns and hopes
that the new guidelines will include the principle of retaining the names of buildings
with honorific names.
Vice President May continued with his report on the Michigan Difference
Campaign, noting that 77% of the goal has been reached for endowment funds. He also
pointed out that in 2005-06, for the second year in a row, the University had achieved
its highest annual giving record, having received more than $257 million in cash
beyond bequest intentions. He thanked the Regents, president, campaign volunteers,
and deans for their leadership in this effort.
Regent Deitch thanked Regent Brandon and Mrs. Brandon for their extraordinary
gift to the University, noting they have shown great leadership in their gifts to Mott
Children's Hospital as well as to other areas of the University.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted one retirement memoir,
for Edward J. Billy, D.M.D., clinical professor of dentistry.
Edward J. Billy, D.M.D., clinical professor of dentistry, retired from active
faculty status on July 31, 2006.
Professor Billy received his D.M.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh
School of Dentistry in 1966, and completed his internship (1966-67) and prosthodontic
residency (1967-69) at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Pittsburgh while also
serving as an instructor at the University of Pittsburgh. From 1969-92 he served in the
U.S. Navy, where he began as an assistant prosthodontic officer and was promoted to
many other roles, including an appointment as chair of the prosthodontic residency
program at the Naval Dental School from 1987-91. In 1991, he began serving as a
visiting lecturer in the prosthodontic residency program at the Naval Dental School, a
position he still holds. Professor Billy joined the University of Michigan faculty in
1992 as a lecturer and was promoted to clinical assistant professor in 1993, clinical
associate professor in 1997, and clinical professor in 2001.
In 2001, Professor Billy became the director of the Graduate Prosthodontics
Program in the School of Dentistry. As director, he greatly strengthened the program
by introducing new courses, improving the financial structure, and initiating
renovations to the clinic. Under Professor Billy's leadership, the success rate of
students in passing their specialty boards in prosthodontics increased significantly. A
popular teacher, he was twice named "Instructor of the Year" by the third-year dental
students (1996, 2001) and also received that honor from the fourth-year dental students
(2000). He was twice recognized as "Instructor of the Year" by the dental fraternity
Delta Sigma Delta, in 1999 and 2000.
Professor Billy is a diplomate of the American Board of Prosthodontics and serves
as an examiner for the North East Regional Board of Dental Examiners for the specialty
of prosthodontics. He is an interviewer for U.S. Navy scholarship programs, and is a
member of the University of Michigan School of Dentistry Admissions Committee. He
has published a number of articles in the leading professional journals.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Edward J.
Billy clinical professor emeritus of dentistry.

September Meeting, 2006

Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted a memorial statement for Gay
DeLanghe, professor of dance.
Gay Delanghe, professor of dance, died August 1, 2006, after a courageous battle
with cancer. A native of Detroit, Michigan, Delanghe attended Cass Technical High
School, and received her early training in ballet with Sandra Severo. She received her
BS and MA from the University of Michigan, continuing her dance studies with Esther
Pease and Jeanne Parsons Bostian. Upon graduation, Professor Delanghe moved to
New York City, where she worked as a principal dancer with Lucas Hoving, touring
nationally and internationally. In 1972, she returned to the University of Michigan as a
faculty member in the newly formed Department of Dance. She was chair of the
Department of Dance from 1995-2002.
A leading Michigan artist, Professor Delanghe was central to the development of
modern dance in Michigan for over four decades. She was a charismatic and brilliant
dancer who performed with seminal and avant-garde modern dance companies. She
was a masterful choreographer and a loving and challenging mentor who played a
central role in shaping the lives of her many students, colleagues, and friends.
Professor Delanghe began teaching at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in the
1970s, and served as chair of the modern dance program there from 1979-99, training
hundreds of young, talented dancers. She received numerous awards and honors,
including a Michigan Artist Award from the Arts Foundation of Michigan, a Lifetime
Achievement Award from the Michigan Dance Council, and a Distinguished Alumni
Award from Wayne State University. She was a founding member of Ann Arbor Dance
Works, formed in 1984, and presented her choreography with them nationally and
internationally. She also choreographed regularly for the University of Michigan Dance
Company.
Gay Delanghe is survived by her beloved mother, Lenore Delanghe, and many
other relatives and close friends. A devoted daughter and a true friend and mentor to
many, Gay had an enormous following and a wide circle of close friends and relatives
who will remember her for her wisdom, humor, enormous energy, and spectacular
dancing.

Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She commented on what a
pleasure it was to be on the Flint campus during the celebration of its 50th anniversary
and to have participated in the event marking this occasion a few weeks before. She
noted that the campus's mission of evolving to fit the educational needs of the
community would be bolstered by the proposal before the Board requesting creation of
the first on-campus student housing project on the Flint campus.
President Coleman also announced that preliminary designs for Michigan Stadium
have been released to the public and are available for viewing on the Michigan Stadium
website. She noted that Athletic Director Bill Martin would be giving a series of public
presentations about the stadium design in upcoming days, and that she and he both look
forward to receiving feedback from the public. Once the designs have been completed
they will be brought back to the Board for consideration.
President Coleman reviewed events that had taken place on campus since the last
meeting, including the dedication of Weill Hall, the groundbreaking for C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital, and a symbolic groundbreaking for the Ross School of Business.
She said that the School of Public Health would be dedicating its new Crossroads
Building the following week. She called attention to recent faculty appointments to the
Institute of Medicine, and announced that the Royal Shakespeare Company would
begin its 3-week residency next week.
Regent Maynard called attention to a letter of welcome from University of
Michigan-Flint faculty members that was being distributed to the Regents.
President Coleman then turned to the committee reports.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. The meeting was attended by
Regent McGowan (chair), along with Regents White, Deitch, and Maynard. Regent
Brandon was absent. Regent McGowan reported that the committee had received the
Annual Report of Investments for 2005, noting that it reflects "how our generous

91



October Meeting, 2006

donors, when matched by a favorable investment environment and a sound and steady
strategy, have served the University remarkably well."  She reported that the
University's investment pool had risen to $7.8 billion in FY 2005, up from $7 billion
the previous year, while the endowment had grown from $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion in
one year, a 16% increase. She thanked Chief Investment Officer Erik Lundberg and his
team for their efforts and said that the report is available to the public.
Regent McGowan reported that the second agenda item involved an update on
information technology security operations at the University.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor reported
that he and Regents Newman and Richner had attended the meeting. They first met
with Provost Sullivan and reviewed dean and major director reviews and searches that
had taken place during the past year. They also discussed policies with respect to
faculty salaries, noting that they are set by the deans with oversight by the provost's
office. The committee received an update on recruitment and staffing in the Life
Sciences Institute and learned that the institute is nearly at capacity in terms of faculty
recruitment. The committee also reviewed its calendar for 2007.
President's Salary. Regent Taylor commented that the committee had reviewed
data from a number of sources to determining an appropriate salary for President
Coleman for the 2006 academic year. Based on this review and subsequent discussion,
Regent Taylor moved that President Coleman receive a merit increase of 3% for
2006-07, retroactive to September 1, 2006. He noted that the motion acknowledges her
many accomplishments and the outstanding job she has done, and that the increase is
consistent with salary increases both within the University and at sister institutions
within the state. Regent McGowan seconded the motion. Regent Maynard called for
the vote, and the motion was approved unanimously.
President Coleman thanked the board and stated that "I am enormously
appreciative of this vote of confidence by the Board, and I have never had so much fun
in all my life. I love this place!"
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals on the topic of the
proposed University of Michigan-Flint student housing facility: Tim W. Herman,
citizen; Larry Atherton, staff; Manosha M. Dasanayaka, alumna.
MSA Report. Nicole Stallings, president of the Michigan Student Assembly, was
unable to attend, but she had made arrangements for Ms. Jelena Jovic, president of the
UM-Flint Student Government Council, to speak in her place. Ms. Jovic reported that
the student body on the Flint campus was ecstatic about the prospect of establishing
student housing on campus, and that this was especially important for international
students.
University of Michigan-Flint Student Housing Facility
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that in November 2004 the Regents
had approved a project to seek a developer/partner to design, construct, and manage a
student housing apartment facility on the UM-Flint campus. However, upon further
evaluation, it was determined that the desired outcome could more easily be achieved

92



October Meeting, 2006

by using standard project delivery and financing methods. It is believed that the current
project has a sound financial plan, based on gift funding, UM-Flint recurring operating
budget funding, reasonable rates and occupancy levels, and a backup fund balance that
would support the project in its early years if it didn't meet projected occupancy levels.
Chancellor Mestas commented that enrollment growth is a top priority for the Flint
campus, and student housing is a critical element for achieving the campus's strategic
goals. It is believed that the University's reputation for academic quality and individual
attention, when combined with the presence of residence halls, will provide the
competitive edge that is currently lacking. "Student housing is precisely what this
campus needs," he concluded.
Regent Maynard moved approval of the University of Michigan-Flint Student
Housing Facility revised project as described in the Regents Communication, and
authorized commissioning the architectural firm ofNeumann/Smith & Associates for its
design. Regent Newman commented that this has been a long time coming and is very
overdue, and that she is pleased that the vote could be taken in Flint. Regent Maynard
thanked Chancellor Mestas for his persistence in seeing this project come to pass. The
vote was then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously. An enthusiastic round
of applause and a standing ovation followed.
The Regents then turned to the consent agenda.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted 2 retirement memoirs,
for Paul K. Peterson, Ph.D., associate professor of philosophy, UM-Flint, and Raymond
W. Ruddon, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., professor of pharmacology.
Paul K. Peterson, Ph.D., associate professor of philosophy in the College of
Arts and Sciences at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status
on June 30, 2006.
Professor Peterson received his B.A. degree in 1964 and his Ph.D. degree in
1972, both   from  the University    of Minnesota.     He joined the University     of
Michigan-Flint faculty as a lecturer in 1969 and was promoted to assistant professor in
1972 and associate professor in 1976.
Professor Peterson served four separate terms as chair of the University of
Michigan-Flint Department of Philosophy. He also directed the Summer Institute for
Talented Students (1989-99), directed the Bachelor of Applied Sciences Program
(1995-1999), and held an additional appointment as faculty counselor for Academic
Support Services (1992-2000). As chair of the Ad Hoc Committee on General
Education (1981-2006), Professor Peterson guided an extensive reform of the general
education program.
During every semester of his 37-year career at the University of Michigan-Flint,
Professor Peterson taught the course, "Introduction to Logic," which developed an
excellent reputation as a result of his efforts. He received two special merit awards for
teaching and played a leading role in creating both the joint concentration in philosophy
and psychology and the minor in philosophy of the social sciences. He continually
shared his research interests, not only in the classroom but through local, national, and
international presentations on such topics as the philosophy of children's literature,
philosophical investigations into terrorism, human evil, and the rhetoric of violence.
The Regents now salute this distinguished philosophy educator for his dedicated
service by naming Paul K. Peterson associate professor emeritus of philosophy.

October Meeting, 2006

Raymond W. Ruddon, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., professor of pharmacology and senior
associate dean for research and graduate studies, Medical School, retired from active faculty
status on September 16, 2006.
Dr. Ruddon received his B.S. degree from the University of Detroit in 1958, and
his Ph.D. and M.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1964 and 1967,
respectively. He joined the University of Michigan as an instructor of pharmacology in
1964 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1967, associate professor in 1969, and
professor 1974. He resigned in 1976 to join the National Cancer Institute, but returned in
1981 as professor and chair of the Department of Pharmacology. From 1986-90, he was
associate director for basic science research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive
Cancer Center, and from 1988-90, he also held the title of Maurice H. Seevers Professor
of Pharmacology. In 1990, Dr. Ruddon joined the faculty of the University of Nebraska,
and in 1997 he became corporate director for science and technology at Johnson &
Johnson. Dr. Ruddon returned to the University of Michigan in 2004 as professor of
pharmacology and senior associate dean for research and graduate studies.
Dr. Ruddon's research focused on the biosynthesis, assembly, folding, and
secretion of glycoprotein hormones. His laboratory was the first to demonstrate the
folding pathway of a human protein inside an intact cell. He has authored more than
100 scientific papers and five books, including the widely used oncology text, Cancer
Biology. He was editor of the chemotherapy chapters of the ninth edition of the
pharmacology textbook, Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of
Therapeutics.
Within the Medical School, Dr. Ruddon created a task force on the research
enterprise, charged with developing a vision for research areas in which the University of
Michigan would assume a leadership role. His recent leadership as senior associate dean
has led to the establishment of two new centers, the Center for Computational Medicine
and Biology, and the Michigan Metabolomics and Obesity Center, both of which already
have a national presence.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher, researcher, and administrator
by naming Raymond W. Ruddon, Jr., professor emeritus of pharmacology.

Procedure for Handling Potential Conflicts of Interest Involving the President
Vice President Churchill commented that following adoption of the "Supplemental
Procedure to Bylaw 1.14 for Handling Potential Conflicts of Interest Involving a
Regent" in June 2005, it was decided to develop a corresponding procedure for
managing conflicts of interest involving the president of the University. Under this
supplemental procedure, the president would disclose potential conflicts of interest to
the vice president and secretary, who in turn would consult with the vice president and
general counsel, the chair of the Board of Regents, and the chair of the Regents'
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, as to how to manage the conflict
or potential conflict.
It was noted that upon approval by the Board, Bylaw 1.14 will be updated to
include a reference to the supplemental procedure for handling potential conflicts
involving the president.
Regent White moved approval of the "Supplemental Procedure to Bylaw 1.14 for
Handling Potential Conflicts Involving the President;" Regent McGowan seconded the
motion.    Regent Maynard called for the vote, and the motion was approved
unanimously. The following is the text of the supplemental procedure:

116



October Meeting, 2006

Supplemental Procedure to Bylaw 1.14
for Handling Potential Conflicts of Interest Involving the President
One of the fundamental fiduciary duties of the president is the "duty of loyalty," which is
defined as having a mandate to be faithful to an organization's best interest, and not to use the
position or knowledge gained as a president for personal advantage at the organization's
expense. Obligations under the duty of loyalty include disclosure of real and potential conflicts
of interest. State law defines what constitutes a real conflict of interest for a president and
prohibits the University of Michigan from entering into any transaction where such a conflict
exists. Under the applicable statute (MCL 15.301 et seq.) the University may not contract with a
vendor with which the president has a pecuniary interest of such substance that it would induce
the president to promote the contract for the president's own personal benefit.
Regents' Bylaw Section 1.14 further requires management of those situations where there exists
even the appearance of a potential conflict that might affect the independence of the president's
judgment. The Regents also require that the president makes the University his or her primary
professional commitment.
To ensure that the high standards expected of the president are met, the president must disclose
to the vice president and secretary of the University, with updates as needed, those activities and
financial interests that are or could potentially constitute situations where the independence of
the president's judgment or professional commitment to the University could be affected. The
chair of the Board of Regents and the chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance
Committee of the Board of Regents may request the vice president and secretary to obtain from
the president regular disclosures on forms developed for this purpose. The president may consult
with the vice president and general counsel as to which matters should be submitted to the vice
president and secretary for analysis and management.
The vice president and secretary will review these disclosures and, with advice and consultation
from the chair of the Board of Regents and the chair of the Personnel, Compensation and
Governance Committee of the Board of Regents, will consult with the vice president and general
counsel and the executive vice president and chief financial officer as to which matters may
require special University actions to avoid the appearance that a conflict of interest may affect
the University's actions on a matter. The president may request an opinion on the matter from
the vice president and general counsel. After consultation and advice, a committee consisting of
the vice president and secretary, the vice president and general counsel and the executive vice
president and chief financial officer shall determine if the University administration should treat
the situation as one that requires special University actions to avoid the appearance that a
conflict of interest may affect the University's actions on a matter. If the president does not
concur, the matter shall be referred to the full Board for action.
In situations where a conflict of interest as defined by the applicable statute is identified that can
not be appropriately managed to eliminate the conflict, the vice president and secretary will
notify the executive vice president and chief financial officer. The executive vice president and
chief financial officer will take all necessary steps, including issuing instructions as may be
appropriate under the circumstances to other executive officers or persons directly reporting to
the president, to ensure that the University of Michigan does not enter into any transaction
prohibited by statute with the organization from which the conflict arises.
In other situations, where a potential effect on the independence of the judgment of or potential
conflict of commitment involving the president is identified, the vice president and secretary
will consult with the chair of the Board of Regents and the chair of the Personnel, Compensation
and Governance Committee of the Board of Regents and with the vice president and general
counsel. The vice president and general counsel will also provide advice, on request, as to
options available to manage situations to avoid even the appearance of a potential conflict. The

117



October Meeting, 2006

vice president and general counsel will inform the chair of the Board of Regents, the chair of the
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee of the Board of Regents, the president
and the vice president and secretary of his or her recommendations.
Options that the vice president and general counsel will consider include requiring the executive
vice president and chief financial officer and/or other appropriate executive officers to manage
such items so that the president is not involved and requesting the president to refrain from any
participation or discussion of the matter. At any meeting of the Regents where the president
intends to abstain, the president will announce that there is a potential for the appearance of a
conflict and therefore he or she will not be participating in either the discussion or a
recommendation on the matter.
UM-Flint Report. Chancellor Mestas thanked the Regents for their approval of
the Flint campus housing project. He announced that former Poet Laureate Robert Hass
was visiting the campus as part of the Green Arts Project and that in honor of the
Regents' visit to the Flint campus he would be giving a poetry reading. He introduced
Mr. Hass, who described the project and his impression of the vitality of the Flint
campus. Mr. Hass then read a poem written by Sarah Spain, an 11-year-old girl from
Lafayette, Louisiana in 2002, "Let Morning Come," and then read one of his own
unfinished poems, "State of the Earth."
Following Mr. Hass's poetry reaching, there was a choral performance by the
UM-Flint Chamber Choir.
This concluded the formal business agenda, and a ten-minute break followed.
Public Comments
The Public Comments session began at 10:50 a.m. The Regents heard comments
from the following individuals on the topics indicated: Lynn Evans, alumnus, John
Borton, citizen, Patrick Massey, alumnus, Tyrone Wheatley, alumnus, David C. Bird,
alumnus, Gary Gillespie, alumnus, on Michigan Stadium renovations, and John Pollack,
citizen, on University decision-making and the need for public input.
Regent Newman stated that she takes exception to Mr. Pollack's comments that
the Regents did not look at alternative options for the stadium renovation. She noted
that alternative plans had been discussed and also had been provided to Mr. Pollack,
and that one of the alternatives proposed by the administration had ultimately been
adopted, albeit by a vote that was not unanimous.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:20 a.m. The
next meeting is scheduled for November 17, 2006.

President Wilbanks.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She noted that in the aftermath of
the passage of Proposal 2, the University remains fully dedicated to maintaining and
expanding its diversity, while obeying the laws of the state. She commented that she
and Provost Sullivan are working on an initiative for soliciting, generating, and putting
into action new ideas for fulfilling this goal, and that an e-mail address has been
established for those who have questions about programs or activities that may be
affected by the passage of this proposal.
President Coleman also called attention to notable achievements of faculty
members, including the fact that Professor William Bolcom had been awarded a
National Medal of the Arts and four faculty members had been named Fulbright
Scholars.
President Coleman called attention to agenda items that will have a far-reaching
impact, including the request to seek construction bids for the C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital and Women's Hospital and for the expansion of the Kellogg Eye Center. She
thanked Regent Brandon for his leadership as co-chair of the "Champions for Children"
campaign to benefit the children's hospital.
Finally, President Coleman pointed out that the board would be considering the
schematic design for renovations to Michigan Stadium. She reported that input from
fans and ticket holders had been taken into account, and she is thrilled with the
approach the architects have taken. "It is a stunning interpretation of Michigan's
tradition and leadership, has tremendous presence, and is deeply respectful of the
stadium's place in Michigan's history." She thanked Athletic Director Bill Martin and
his team for all of the work they have put into bringing this project to fruition.
President Coleman stated that she is strongly committed to this project because It
provides the financial resources necessary to fund critical renovations to the stadium,
and because it will provide a strong financial foundation for the competitiveness of
Michigan athletics in the coming decades. She also pointed out how the entire
University benefits from its renowned athletics program, making Michigan athletics an
important asset for the University as a whole. She stated that the intention is that the

119



November Meeting, 2006

project will provide support not only for the football program and the Athletic
Department, but also for the University's academic mission.
Presentation: School of Public Health
President Coleman introduced Dean Kenneth Warner to give a presentation about
the School of Public Health ("SPH"). Dean Warner thanked the Regents for their
support for the newly opened "Crossroads" building, noting that is already having a
huge impact on the school.
Dean Warner defined public health as "the set of activities a society undertakes to
monitor and improve the health of its collective membership," and elaborated on what
that means. He described the structure of the school, noting it is divided into five
departments and has a number of interdisciplinary research centers and initiatives that
link the school directly to other UM schools, colleges, institutes, and centers. The
Department of Health Management and Policy has been ranked the number one health
administration program in the United States by U.S. News and World Report since the
rankings were first begun.
Dean Warner reported that the school has 135 total faculty and is ranked fifth
nationally among schools of public health. The school enrolls 837 students (72%
female), with ~ of them in masters programs, and /4 in doctoral programs. Courses
taught are almost exclusively at the graduate level. He pointed out that among the
school's alumni are numerous CEOs of hospitals and health care systems, leading
government officials, and leaders in the public health profession.
Dean Warner reviewed some of the major contributions that have been made by
SPH faculty through their research efforts in the past, and described the efforts of
current faculty. He also highlighted a student-initiated group that works on public
service efforts such as Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.
Dean Warner concluded by describing some of the current and future initiatives
planned by the SPH, including developing a new UM Center for Global Health. He
commented that "public health is successful when you're not even aware that it's
there."
In response to a question from Regent Newman about whether the school has
considered offering more undergraduate classes, Dean Warner observed that the school
would love to do this, but is hampered by a lack of resources and faculty to support
such an initiative. Regent White expressed support for the school to "dream big" by
continuing to grow relationships around the world. Regent Taylor complimented Dean
Warner for his report and observed that the SPH is a "real jewel."
Annual Report of Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA)
Professor Charles Smith, chair of SACUA, presented the committee's annual
report. He commented that issues to be pursued during the current academic year
include improved communications between faculty involved in governance and
members of the Board of Regents, faculty involvement in the oversight of faculty and
staff benefit programs, challenges to tenure and their implications for academic and
intellectual freedom, improved faculty grievance procedures, recommendations on unit

120



November Meeting, 2006

faculty governance, the impact of the passage of Proposal 2, and evaluation of student
success in light of the Spellings Commission Report.
Public Comments on Agenda-Related Topics
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals on the topic of the
Michigan Stadium renovation project: William Dufek, Joey Lansing, and Todd J.
Anson, alumni; Steve Grafton, president of the University of Michigan Alumni Society;
Patricia Yocum, faculty member; and John Latus, student.
Michigan Stadium Renovation and Expansion Project
President Coleman called on Executive Vice President Slottow to introduce the
presentation of the schematic design for the Michigan Stadium Renovation and
Expansion Project. Mr. Slottow noted that this project had undergone the same
rigorous development and review process that every major capital project over
$500,000 is subjected to at the University of Michigan. He reviewed all of the elements
of this process, including programming, architect selection, schematic design, detailed
construction drawings, code and safety reviews, and detailed budget estimating and
reconciliation at multiple steps. This project will be subject to the same three votes that
are taken for every major capital project: for program and architect selection, for
schematic design, and for going to bid for construction contracts after completion of
detailed construction drawings.
Mr. Slottow noted that the stadium renovation project included significantly more
interim reports to the public than the average project, including market studies, fan
surveys, site plans, design concepts, elevations, preliminary renderings, computer
graphics, and shadow studies. In addition, public forums were held across the state and
input has been solicited via a website and e-mail address established to receive regular
suggestions and input.
Mr. Slottow reported that prior to approval of the project in May 2006, an
extensive amount of analysis, planning, and vetting of feasible alternatives had been
conducted, beginning in 2001. Four different alternative plans were vetted and
reviewed by the Regents and subsequently shared with the public prior to settling on the
plan approved in May 2006. In addition, in a number of meetings over the two years
prior to the May vote, the Regents' Finance, Audit and Investment Committee had
reviewed the Athletic Department's capital plans, including the financial feasibility of
the various stadium plans, and had discussed the implications of a stadium project on
the University's overall debt capacity. The results of the these discussions were
reported back to the full board each month after they occurred, and additional briefings
were also held for the full board on the project's principles, goals, impacts, and feasible
options.
Executive Vice President Slottow then called on Athletic Director Bill Martin.
Mr. Martin repeated President Coleman's earlier comments, noting that the additional
resources that this project will provide to the Athletic Department over the long term
will be used to further the academic mission of the institution, in keeping the
department's view of it's shared partnership with the larger institution.
Mr. Martin noted that during the past year he had made 15 presentations and read
more than 1,500 e-mails and letters about the stadium renovation plans, and has greatly

121



November Meeting, 2006

valued this input in planning the project. He commented that bringing this project to
fruition has not been easy, because everyone has memories and passions about the
stadium. However, the reality is that the stadium is functionally and economically
obsolete, and these issues need to be addressed without placing a financial burden on all
of the fans. Mr. Martin then called on Doug Hanna, University architect.
Mr. Hanna commented that two architectural firms have been involved in this
project: HNTB Michigan Architecture, the principal architectural firm with national
stadium design experience, represented by Michael Handelman, principal in charge for
the project, and Kallman McKinnell and Wood, represented by principal Michael
McKinnell.
Mr. Handelman introduced Mr. McKinnell, noting that he specializes in this
specific type of historic architecture. Mr. Handelman reviewed renderings of the
various sections of the stadium and pointed out features incorporated into the proposed
design. These include additional restrooms, a new facility for the Department of Public
Safety, and major additions to the east and west sides of the complex. The existing
main concourse will be widened, and there will be new levels outdoor and indoor club
seating and for suites, and on the opposite side of the stadium, to the west, a new
concourse will be added, along with additional suites and new areas for press and
broadcast media, and a photo deck.
Mr. McKinnell noted that in working in university settings, architects attempt to
extend the tradition of these settings that have created such strong, positive memories
and affection for students during their formative years. He described how his firm
attempted to address the iconic nature of Michigan Stadium and how it presents itself to
the world, which he characterized as having an engagement with the community. He
noted that the proposed facades are meant to represent the tradition of college stadia in
the architectural features of Roman arches, while reflecting the University athletic
campus in the brick and masonry facades of Yost Ice Arena and the Intramural
Building. He displayed several renderings of the proposed exterior of the renovation,
noting that the scale is similar to that of the Intramural Building.
Mr. McKinnell observed that the essence of the stadium as an experience on the
inside will not be changed. Mr. Handelman commented that the goal was to have the
new suites and media areas be as transparent a surface as possible to be able to view the
entire event. This will preserve the integrity and historic nature of the bowl while
creating an exciting architectural enhancement to the stadium. He displayed a number
of views from both the interior and exterior of the stadium. Mr. McKinnell concluded
by noting that three goals are being accomplished by the renovation: the stadium is
being brought up to current safety and occupancy standards, the architecture will be
rooted back into the physical environment of its immediate neighbors on the athletic
campus, and an "exciting new element" will be added.
Regent Brandon moved approval of the schematic design for the Michigan
Stadium Renovation and Expansion Project. Regent Taylor seconded the motion.
Regent McGowan made the following statement:
I said last spring that my concern with this project centered on "too much money spent on
too few people, a value that I do not share. " Over the past several months, though, President

122



November Meeting, 2006

Coleman and Bill Martin have expanded their conversations to include how a financially sound
athletic department, buoyed by strong performances by Michigan athletes, the enthusiasm of
their fans, and effective management, can return to the University substantial financial
resources to further strengthen our core mission--our academics.  From my ongoing
conversations with each of them over the months, I have come to fully expect that benefits that
stem from new opportunities will be directed in reasonable amounts to the president's
discretionary fund for her to direct as appropriate to strengthen the academic side of the
University's house.
We are one university, not a university and an athletic department which bears our name.
We have all, at this table and around the room, worked hard to secure a successful and
financially sound athletic department. Now the leadership has committed to growing a share of
those increasing resources to benefit the University's core academic mission. This is a value
that I am pleased has emerged during this process.
I have read every e-mail that you have sent me. I have considered every opinion that has
been offered as I move around Ann Arbor and the area. I respect how strongly you feel, one
way or the other. In the end, though, I have always reminded all of my Michigan constituents
that my job is to do what I believe is best for the University. Given this important commitment
from President Coleman and Mr. Martin, I am now prepared to vote to approve the schematic
designs for Michigan Stadium this morning-- and to wish this project well.
Regent White commented that the previous day the Regents had received
information from the Paralyzed Veterans of America alleging that the plans for the
Michigan Stadium renovation and expansion projects will be in violation of the
Americans with     Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Michigan building          codes for
accessibility. She said she had brought this to the attention of the Office of the Vice
President and General Counsel today, and they have not had an opportunity to review
the issue yet. Therefore, she moved to table the vote until the ADA issues can be
addressed. Regent Deitch seconded the motion.
President Coleman said that a disabled person has never been turned away from
Michigan Stadium, and the University plans to work very diligently on this issue.
Regent Newman agreed, stating that the University has been working very closely with
disabled individuals and with the paralyzed veterans group, and will continue to do so.
Therefore this issue does not constitute a reason to table the vote, she continued, as she
is convinced that the institution will work out the concerns to everyone's satisfaction.
Vice President Krislov reported that the general counsel's office staff has been
working with the Athletic Department and federal regulators on ADA issues, and stated
that the University is committed to complying with the law. However, because this is a
relatively new law, he pointed out, the regulations are not entirely clear.
The vote was then taken on the motion to table and it failed, with Regents White
and Deitch in favor and Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and
Taylor opposed.
Regent Deitch made the following comments:
In May, when the Board of Regents voted to retain architects to move the stadium
expansion project forward, I was one of 3 Regents to vote no. At that time, I offered lengthy
remarks articulating all of the reasons why I was opposed to the project - economic, cultural,
aesthetic. Today, my remarks will be much briefer and more focused. Since the action item at
hand is approval of the schematic design for the stadium, I will only offer comments on the
design and from an aesthetic standpoint.

123



November Meeting, 2006

In May, we were only presented with a very sketchy concept plan plus details on the size of
the additions (approximately 425,000 square feet) and the height (approximately 83 feet).
Without the renderings that we have today, it was possible only to imagine the impact that the
additions would have on our iconic "Big House. " Having seen the design, my opposition to the
plan is even more intense than it was in May. In my opinion, this is simply a failed design. I say
that because the administration has placed programmatic demands on these great architects
that cannot, in my judgment, be achieved in harmony with the existing stadium.
Since as we all know, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it is not enough to simply
criticize the aesthetics of the project, since many people think it is quite beautiful. In other
words, if one of the project's proponents calls it "beautiful" and I call it "ugly, " where are we?
Just a difference of opinion, based on a visceral reaction and personal taste, with no one
opinion being entitled to any more weight than any other.
Accordingly, I have spent hours analyzing what factors have caused me to find the design
to be so discordant and disturbing. I concluded that I could explain it in one word: SCALE.
The proposed massive additions are simply out of scale with the simple stadium design. They
overwhelm it and by doing so, in my opinion, will ruin the joy that so many people feel in
Michigan Stadium. As big as today's Big House is, its simplicity and elegance make it seem
almost cozy and certainly of human scale.
As I said in May, I never fail to say "wow" whenever I walk into the place. I am struck by
the stadium's modest outside appearance and its utter lack of grandiosity and pretense. In other
words, it is what it is: a big, largely underground bowl where over 110,000 people year after
year cheer on the winningest football team in America. As is, Michigan Stadium is the perfect
physical manifestation of a university that prides itself on providing an "uncommon education
for the common man. "
I am not alone in stating that the greatest thing about the stadium is its "modesty. " In
fact, at a closed meeting in September, Michael McKinnell stated how taken he was on first
seeing the stadium by its "modesty" on the outside, which then opened up into what he
described as "one of the greatest outdoor spaces" in the world. Similarly, in an October 21,
2005 article in the New York Times, entitled "Classic Stadiums, Classic Memories, " Douglas
Kelbaugh, dean of our A. Alfred Taubman School of Architecture and Design, said as follows:
"The most stunning thing about the Big House is how modest and unmonumental the
steel-frame structure appears from the outside. "
No matter what anyone ever says about the stadium in the future, no one will ever be able
to call it "modest and unmonumental" again, given its neo-Roman coliseum outside and its
suburban office building inside. Moreover, given the 2-sided enclosure caused by the huge
structures on both sides of the field, it will not be easy to describe the Big House as a "great
outdoor space" again. And I am also concerned about how these 2 large structures will block
the sun from both the fans and the players. That question has never been adequately addressed.
Many longtime fans, and longtime season ticket holders whom I have talked to are worried
about this as well.
I would also note that in campaigning hard for the proposal, on numerous occasions, its
proponents have stated that those of us who are opposed to the project as presented are "afraid
of change. " For me, that is not true. I acknowledge that change is inevitable, but I believe that
we have a stewardship responsibility to the public to ensure that additions to great buildings be
made in a way that is harmonious with the look and feel of the original structure. For me, this
addition fails that test. Again, the reason is SCALE, and there are alternative plans to improve
and modernize the stadium in a way that is compatible with its feeling and scale that should be
seriously considered.
This proposal adds huge, grandiose appendages to a simple, modest, tasteful structure.
With regard to the question of compatibility, I found another New York Times article, dated Oct.
30, 2005, entitled, "Lovely Museum. Mind if I Redesign it for You. " The article is an interview

124



November Meeting, 2006

with 2 great Pritzker- prize winning architects, Richard Meier and Renzo Piano. Meier had
designed the High Museum in Atlanta, one of the country's most highly regarded art museums.
Piano was asked to design a major addition. The potential for conflict between the 2 titans was
enormous. Yet, they spoke about how pleased they were with the outcome.
On change, Meier observed: "It's perfectly appropriate for one architect to add onto
another architect's work. That's the history of architecture, the way it's always been."
As for the importance of scale, the great Renzo Piano observed, "The most important thing
is scale. When you are wrong in scale, you are very wrong. "
I am opposed to this design because the scale is very wrong. The original structure and
the addition simply do not live together in harmony as do the work of Meier and Piano in
Atlanta. Mr. McKinnel is a distinguished architect and a peer of Meier and Piano. Yet, his
design is ultimately unattractive simply because he was asked to take on an impossible task,
given the administration's program demands.
In opposing the project I categorically state that I am not opposed to change at the
stadium. I would suggest that we all step back and consider how we can achieve the needed
renovations in a way that will live in harmony with the existing stadium, be less grandiose, and
less expensive. There are other alternatives that work, and I have presented them in prior
sessions of this board. The argument that only a project of this scale can produce required
revenues is simply untrue.
I again state my great respect for Bill Martin and his team. I acknowledge President
Coleman's sincere commitment to the project. I acknowledge that the majority of this board
believe in good faith that this is a good project. So be it, but I know that I speak for thousands
of people in the Michigan family. Finally, I note that when all is said and done, the reason that
so much energy and controversy have gone into the stadium renovation project is because of the
passion and love we, and our fans, feel for Michigan football and its unique traditions, and the
men who have made that tradition possible.
Regent Newman called the question. The vote was then taken, and the motion to
approve the schematic design for the Michigan Stadium Renovation and Expansion
Project as presented was approved, with Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan,
Newman, Richner, and Taylor in favor, and Regents Deitch and White opposed.
President Coleman then turned to the committee reports.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent McGowan, chair of the
committee, reported that the meeting was attended by herself, along with Regents White
and Brandon, Associate Vice President Peggy Norgren, and Controller Cheryl Soper.
The committee first conducted its annual review of the president's travel and hosting
expenses. She noted that there were no irregularities and that all expenses were
perfectly reasonable.    The second agenda item       was the regular review     of the
Sarbanes-Oxley gap analysis and implementation update, led by Associate Vice
President Norgren. The committee also reviewed the proposed committee calendar for
2007. Regent McGowan stated that all documents referenced in her report are publicly
available.
Regent McGowan pointed out that the committee's basic schedule of monthly
agenda items had been largely established by Regent Brandon in his role as founding
chair of the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, and thanked him for his many
contributions to this endeavor.

125



November Meeting, 2006

Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor, chair of
the committee, reported that he and Regents Newman and Richner had met the previous
day. Regent Maynard, President Coleman, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President
Churchill had also attended the meeting. The first agenda item was a review of the
annual report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs with the chair of
that group, Professor Charles Smith.
Provost Sullivan then reported to the committee on a number of issues: the annual
report on senior faculty recruitment and retention; an update on ongoing searches for
deans and other academic administrators; a report on compensation by the various
schools and colleges; and a report on faculty leaves of absence. The committee also
received a regular quarterly report on the Life Sciences Institute.
The Regents then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda

activities had been held for students with respect to issues that were decided during the
recent election. She reviewed the various prevailing attitudes about diversity held by
the student body, and noted that the MSA president and vice president were unable to
attend the meeting.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little reported that he had held
extensive conversations with campus constituencies about the passage of Proposal 2,
which banned the use of affirmative action in state-supported institutions. He said there
is a compelling need for universities to reach out and provide educational opportunities
to populations that have been traditionally underserved, and the Dearborn campus will
be working with Ann Arbor leadership and others to ensure that it will be able to
continue to be able to do so.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas reported that the Flint campus
shares the concerns expressed by Chancellor Little. He noted that there is a great deal
of confusion about the implications of the passage of Proposal 2.
President Coleman responded that she shares the concerns expressed by
Chancellors Little and Mestas and reiterated her pledge that no student will lose his or
her scholarship, nor will any employee lose his or her job, because of Proposal 2.

126

Sanford C. Bledsoe, Jr., Ph.D., research associate professor in the Kresge
Hearing Research Institute, Medical School, retired from active faculty status on July
31, 2006.
Professor Bledsoe received his B.S. degree from North Texas University in 1969
and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Texas Health Science Center in 1978(9?).
Following completion of postdoctoral studies at Louisiana State University Medical
Center, he joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1981 as an assistant research
scientist. He was promoted to associate research scientist in 1990 and senior associate
research scientist in 1997; his title was changed to research associate professor in 2003.
Throughout his career, Professor Bledsoe has pursued an interdisciplinary
approach to research in the auditory system. He made important contributions in the
study of the comparative actions of glutamate and related pharmacological substances
on the Xenopus laevis lateral line and extended these findings in the rodent to
generalize to the mammalian brain. During his career, he published seminal papers
demonstrating deafness-induced plasticity in the mature auditory system.
Professor Bledsoe has been very involved in the development of multichannel
stimulating and recording silicon neural probes, in collaboration with colleagues in the
College of Engineering. His work has played a major role in the technology transfer
and commercialization of these probes, which are now in use worldwide in the
neurophysiology community. In collaboration with Professor Kensall D. Wise in the
College of Engineering, he pioneered the development of drug-delivery probes that are
capable of recording multichannel neural activity while simultaneously delivering
pharmacological agents to adjacent regions. This work has the potential to lead to
significant improvements in the lives of patients with intractable neurological diseases
such as Parkinson's disease and tinnitus.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Sanford C. Bledsoe, Jr.,
research associate professor emeritus.

the preface of doctoral dissertations and faculty publications. In 1979, she co-authored
a book-length bibliography, Industrial Relations and Personnel Management: Selected
Information Sources. This bibliography filled a gap in the then-existing bibliographic
resources for this field. In 1999, she was recognized by the School of Business with a
Staff Recognition Award, based on her performance, innovation, and "can-do" attitude.
Ms. Sokkar has contributed to her profession by serving on committees of the

Resolution in Honor of Regent Brandon
Regent Newman read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend their heartfelt
appreciation and gratitude to their colleague and friend David A.
Brandon as he concludes eight years of exemplary service on the Board
of Regents.
An alumnus of the Class of 1974, Regent Brandon excelled both
in the School of Education, where he earned an A.B. degree and
teaching certificate, and on the football field, where he played for the
legendary Coach Bo Schembechler. Today, a major corporate leader as
chairman and CEO of Domino's Pizza, Inc., and member of a number of
corporate and non-profit boards, he still attributes much of his success
to his undergraduate years at Michigan.
Regent Brandon's tenure as a Regent has been marked by his
leadership in a number of key areas. He initiated amendments to the

151



December Meeting, 2006

Regents' bylaws that led to the establishment of a board leadership
structure and committee system, and served as founding chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. In this role, his experience
and acumen in financial matters have been invaluable in helping the
committee to develop its charter, establish its agenda, and carry out its
work. Under his guidance, the committee set up a comprehensive system
offinancial oversight that will benefit the University for years to come.
The Regents also salute Regent Brandon and his wife, Jan, for
their generous financial support of a number of University projects, but
most notably for their leadership of the "Champions for Children"
campaign to benefit the new C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. In addition
to being a person who "walks the talk, " Regent Brandon will be
remembered with fondness for his sense of humor and his ability to add
just the right note of levity to a discussion when it is most needed.
Regent Brandon has carried out his official duties with the
charm, grace, and class of a quintessential "Michigan Man. " With
gratitude and esteem for his many contributions to his beloved alma
mater, and with the expectation that he and Jan will continue to be
involved actively in University life, the Regents name David A. Brandon
Regent Emeritus of the University of Michigan.
A standing ovation followed.  Regent Brandon noted that he had left the
University as a better person after having received his undergraduate degree 30 years
ago, and was now leaving as a better person after 8 years as a Regent. "I see the world
a little differently and I've learned a lot," he said. "I've made some relationships that
are incredibly important to me. I respected this place a lot when I ran for Regent, and I
respect it even more, having served here and viewed up close and personal how truly
great this place is."
Regent Brandon thanked his colleagues, noting how hard the Regents work on
behalf of the University because they care about the institution and its future. He
commented on how honored he had felt to serve with President Coleman and to have
had the privilege of advancing the Mott Children's Hospital Project. However, he said
that "the most shining moment I had in my eight years was presenting Bo Schembechler
with an honorary degree."
A round of applause followed.   Regent McGowan commented on Regent
Brandon's many contributions to the board and especially to the Finance, Audit and
Investment Committee, noting that he has been "a remarkable leader."
Michigan Difference Campaign Update
Vice President May introduced Mr. Rich Rogel, volunteer chair of the Michigan
Difference Campaign, noting that his tireless efforts on behalf of the campaign have
been "wildly successful." He said that Ranny Riecker, honorary co-chair of the
campaign, and Paul Courant and Stephanie Pinder-Amaker, co-chairs of the
faculty-staff component of the campaign, would also be speaking.
Mr. Rogel described some of his efforts on behalf of the campaign, both in the
United States and around the world. He pointed out that in addition to raising money,
the campaign brings Michigan into focus for the rest of the world. He also noted that a

152



December Meeting, 2006

critical component of this campaign is financial aid for students, and that more than
$349 million has been contributed so far toward this effort. He reported almost $4
million has been received in response to President Coleman's donor challenge for
matching contributions to need-based undergraduate scholarships, and said that alumni
are eager to continue to help in the campaign effort. Mr. Rogel then introduced Ms.
Margaret Anne "Ranny" Riecker, honorary co-chair of the Michigan Difference
Campaign.
Ms. Riecker thanked the Regents for their leadership during the campaign, noting
that they are vital to its success. She commented that the University is "supremely
important" to the business and industry of the state, and said that increasing the number
of endowed professorships to retain and attract great faculty is an important campaign
goal. Ms. Riecker stated that 133 new endowed professorship have been added during
the Michigan Difference campaign, bringing the total number to 401, and that the
president's donor challenge has had a significant effect on funding these professorships.
Ms. Riecker stated that these funds and the $1 billion that has been contributed to
research support and programmatic support are crucially important to the state's
economy. She introduced Professor Paul Courant and Associate Dean of Students
Stephanie Pinder-Amaker, co-chairs of the faculty-staff campaign.
Professor Courant and Associate Dean Pinder-Amaker described their efforts in
the first University-wide campaign for soliciting support from faculty and staff. They
noted that faculty and staff appreciate working for such a high quality institution, and
that more than 12,000 faculty and staff - nearly 30% - have so far contributed more
than $87 million.
Mr. Rogel concluded the presentation with the announcement that as of September
30, $2.32 billion had been raised, representing 93% of the goal with 75% of the time
having elapsed. He said that "this has been a marvelous experience" and expressed that
it had been a privilege to serve as volunteer campaign chair.
Regent Maynard thanked all of the volunteers on behalf of the Regents for all of
their work on the campaign, noting that they have been a major factor in the success of
the campaign.
Residential Life Initiative
Vice President Harper noted that the Residential Life Initiative provides an
opportunity to provide students with high quality living/learning experiences that
contribute to their academic success, as well as the opportunity to attract new students.
She introduced Carole Henry, assistant vice president for student affairs and director of
University Housing.
Ms. Henry gave a presentation in which she reviewed progress that has been made
on Residential Life Initiative (RLI) projects that have been approved by the Board and
how they contribute to the president's vision of enhanced living and learning
environments. She reported that the RLI projects are proceeding within their projected
budgets, although some adjustments have been made in original plans.
Ms. Henry noted that the first renovation and renewal of a heritage residence hall,
Mosher-Jordan, is well underway, and a new dining center to serve all residence halls

153



December Meeting, 2006

on the hill is included in the project. These are scheduled for completion in 2008.
North Quad, the first new residence hall to be built in 40 years, is currently in the
design phase and is projected to open in the Fall of 2010. This innovative structure will
integrate academic programs with residential and dining facilities. In addition to the
dining facilities that are part of these two projects, a new, modern food emporium, The

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted retirement memoirs for
nine faculty members.
R. Ward Bissell, Ph.D., professor of history of art in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2006.
Professor Bissell received his B.A, M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from the University
of Michigan in 1959, 1961, and 1966, respectively. Prior to joining the University, he
was a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty in 1971 as associate professor and was promoted to professor in 1983.
Professor Bissell's research focused on Renaissance and Baroque art, with
particular expertise in Italian and Spanish Baroque painting. His abiding commitment to
informed connoisseurship is evident in his richly documented studies of the important
seventeenth century Italian artists Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, and in several
important catalogues raisonnes, including his joint authorship of the recently published
catalogue of Baroque art in the Detroit Institute of Arts. He is particularly noted for his
work on Artemisia Gentileschi, one of the most important European women artists of
the early modern period.
A dedicated and enthusiastic teacher of Renaissance and Baroque art, his courses
are warmly remembered by generations of students, including many who have gone on
to pursue careers in art history. He has been a role model for the study of the history of
art, a mentor for post-doctoral students, and a champion for the development of
individuals interested in understanding the deep influence of art upon world history and
culture. A firm believer in the pedagogical value of direct experience of works of art,
he has taught often in the department's program in Florence and has served as its
director. He was active in faculty governance and also served regularly on the graduate
and undergraduate committees, as undergraduate concentration advisor, as faculty
mentor to the graduate student instructors, and as a mentor to students at all levels. In
these roles and as department chair, director of graduate studies, and as a frequent
member of the executive committee, he has served the department with generosity and
unfailing esprit de corps.
The Regents salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming R. Ward
Bissell professor emeritus of history of art.

December Meeting, 2006

George J. Bornstein, Ph.D., C. A. Patrides Collegiate Professor of English and
professor of English language and literature in the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2006.
Professor Bornstein received his B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1963 and
his Ph.D. degree from Princeton University in 1966. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an associate professor in 1970 and was promoted to professor in
1975. He was appointed the C. A. Patrides Collegiate Professor of English in 1995.
Professor Bornstein is one of the most distinguished and admired scholars of
modernism in his generation. His decades of devotion to the study of the literature and
culture of the later 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries, highlighted by his
energetic teaching, tireless advising, work at conferences, service to the profession and
his prolific publication record, have furthered scholars' understanding of an
extraordinarily wide range of topics in the field of literary studies. He made Michigan a
congenial, challenging, and productive center for students of modernism-whether they
were undergraduates, graduate students, colleagues, or distinguished faculty from
institutions around the world. His many former students, now teachers and scholars
themselves, are continuing to shape the study of twentieth-century literature, profiting
by his training and his example.
In his courses and publications, Professor Bornstein has always encouraged
students and readers to cross intellectual, historical, and methodological boundaries,
whether it be to bring Romantic and Modern poets into conversation with one another,
to combine editorial theory with incisive interpretive approaches to poetry and prose, or
to rethink questions of the social and aesthetic constructions of race and ethnicity in the
light of a deeply historicized characterization of modernism. He has edited 12 books
and is the author of 7 scholarly monographs and 50 articles and reviews. Professor
Bornstein has lectured throughout the United States, Ireland, England, and Germany.
He service to the department, the college, and the University has been invaluable.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming George J. Bornstein
professor emeritus of English language and literature.
Don B. Chaffin, Ph.D., Richard G. Snyder Distinguished University Professor of
Industrial and Operations Engineering, G. Lawton and Louise G. Johnson Professor of
Engineering, professor of industrial and operations engineering, and professor of
biomedical engineering in the College of Engineering, and professor of occupational
health in the School of Public Health, will retire from active faculty status on December
31, 2006.
Professor Chaffin received his B.S. degree from the General Motors Institute in
1962, his M.S. degree from the University of Toledo in 1964, and his Ph.D. degree from
the University of Michigan in 1967. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
assistant professor of industrial engineering in 1968, and was promoted to associate
professor in 1970 and professor in 1973. He was appointed professor of occupational
health in the School of Public Health in 1984 and professor of biomedical engineering
in 1997. Professor Chaffin was named the G. Lawton and Louise G. Johnson Professor
of Engineering in 1993 and was honored with the Richard G. Snyder Distinguished
University Professorship of Industrial and Operations Engineering in 1994.
Professor Chaffin's research has emphasized the use of biomechanics to
understand and prevent occupational musculoskeletal injuries. He has published 6
books, more than 140 journal articles, and some 300 other publications. He led a team

169



December Meeting, 2006

of students and staff in developing a set of widely-used software programs for assisting
practicing engineers in the design of workplaces and vehicles that can accommodate
various groups of people and reduce overexertion injury risk factors. Professor Chaffin
has been elected fellow in six different international professional and scientific
organizations, including the Ergonomics Society of Great Britain and the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. He has received many national and
international awards for his work, including election to membership in the prestigious
National Academy of Engineering in 1994.
The Regents now salute this accomplished scholar for his dedicated service by
naming Don B. Chaffin the Richard G. Snyder Distinguished University Professor
Emeritus of Industrial and Operations Engineering, professor emeritus of industrial and
operations engineering, professor emeritus of biomedical engineering, and professor
emeritus of occupational health.

Bruce H. Wilkinson, Ph.D., professor of geology and mineralogy and research
scientist in the Museum of Paleontology, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2006.
Professor Wilkinson received his B.S. and M.A. degrees from the University of
Wyoming in 1965 and 1967 respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of
Texas in 1973. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in
1973, and was promoted to associate professor in 1979 and professor in 1986. Within
the Museum of Paleontology, Professor Wilkinson was appointed assistant research
scientist in 1974, and was promoted to associate research scientist in 1979 and research
scientist in 1986.
Professor Wilkinson's research spans the broad field of sedimentary geology,
seeking to decipher the processes and history of the modification of the earth's surface
and the temporal records of its environments and climate. His research extended from
studies of marine coastal processes into continental settings to examine records
archived in lake systems and then to sedimentary deposits of the marine realm. Later
studies combined empirical observations and analytical techniques to identify the
primary factors that control the character, distribution, and temporal patterns of
sedimentary rocks. Most recently, he has explored the role of humans as geologic
agents and their impact on the sculpting of earth's surface through processes of erosion.
Professor Wilkinson's teaching contributions are equally diverse and impressive.
In the late 1970s he developed mini-courses to provide short, intensive, introductions to
a broad variety of earth science subjects. His introductory-level field-based courses
culminated in the popular class, "Geology of the Rockies." Professor Wilkinson has
also taught advanced undergraduate and highly specialized graduate courses and is
known for his unrelenting mentorship of students. His appointment to the Museum of
Paleontology recognized his collaborative interactions with faculty in this unit and his
pivotal contributions to graduate education in this field.

December Meeting, 2006

Approval of Consent Agenda. On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by
Regent White, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
The Regents then turned to consideration of the regular agenda.
North Quad Residential and Academic Complex
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that this project had originally been
approved in January 2005, with Einhorn Yaffee Prescott (EYP) as the architect, and a
budget of $137 million. In March 2006, Robert A.M. Stern Architects was added as the
lead designer to incorporate the new objective of conceiving the structure as a signature
building that would serve as a gateway to the central campus. The additional goal of
creating an appropriate signature building has led to an increase in the project budget to
$175 million, due to the one-year extension and additional architectural fees, as well as
increased quality of the building design and materials. He also noted that the revised
budget is in line with internal and external benchmark studies for similar quality and
size buildings. He introduced Graham Wyatt, principal from A.M. Stern Architects,
Leila Kamal, from EYP, and Jeffery Povero, lead architect from A.M. Stern.
Mr. Povero presented the schematic design, beginning with a site plan illustrating
the site in relation to other buildings in the area. He then gave detailed descriptions of
how each of the building's functions will be incorporated into the design. He pointed
out that the facility will be totally wheelchair-accessible and that people will be able to
reach any spot in the building without walking outside. The academic and residential
portions will be located in separate areas to accommodate their different functional
needs.
Mr. Povero also pointed out that the facade of the Carnegie Library, located on the
site, will not only be preserved, but that the facade is integral to the design of the
residential tower. He then displayed a "fly through" video illustrating features of the
structure, and showed renderings of the exterior.
Regent McGowan moved approval of the schematic design and revised budget for
the North Quad Residential and Academic Complex Project as presented at the meeting.
Regent Newman seconded the motion and it was approved unanimously.
Fiscal Year 2008 Capital Outlay Submission for All Campuses
Executive Vice President Slottow reported on the capital outlay request and
five-year master plan for the Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint campuses that was
submitted to the state in November 2006. He noted that the first priority for the Ann
Arbor campus is for a new biology building, the second priority is for a renovation and
addition to the G.G. Brown Laboratory Building, and the third priority is for a new
health sciences education building. There is one project for the Dearborn campus, a

December Meeting, 2006 - Appendix

THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER POLICY
DECEMBER 2006
I.   APPLICABILITY AND SCOPE OF POLICY
This Policy implements Section 3.10 of the Bylaws of the Board of Regents.
The Policy further defines the ownership, distribution, and commercialization of
rights associated with Intellectual Property developed at or received by the
University of Michigan, and describes the general obligations associated with the
technology licensing process. Such implementing policies and procedures, as long as
consistent with Section 3.10 of the Bylaws of the Board of Regents, may be
modified from time to time by the Vice President for Research in consultation with
the President.
The University recognizes and supports technology transfer as an integral
component of the University's mission. Licensing of Intellectual Property rights to
parties outside the University is one significant manner in which technology transfer
is accomplished, and is the focus of this Policy. The objectives of technology
transfer include the following: to facilitate the efficient transfer of knowledge and
technology from the University to the private sector in support of the public interest;
to support the discovery of new knowledge and technology; to attract resources for
the support of University programs; to provide services to University Employees to
facilitate their efforts to carry out the University's mission; and to promote local,
state, and national economic development.
This Policy is applicable to all units of the University including its colleges,
schools, departments, centers, institutes, and hospitals, and to all of its Employees.
This Policy replaces the 1996 "Revised Policy on Intellectual Properties" (amended
2004) and, except as provided below, applies as of the date of this policy revision.
The Office of the Vice President for Research ("OVPR") and the Office of
Technology Transfer ("OTT") are authorized to administer this Policy and to
implement further rules and procedures within the framework provided herein to
facilitate technology transfer and compliance with this Policy. Applicable law and
the terms of specific sponsored research agreements and other contractual
arrangements undertaken by the University or one of its units in good faith will
govern where such agreements differ from the provisions of this Policy and have
been approved by authorized University representatives. The University reserves the
right to amend this Policy at any time, including with respect to current and former
Employees.
II.  OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
A. Intellectual Property made (e.g., conceived or first reduced to practice) by
any person, regardless of employment status, with the direct or indirect support of
funds administered by the University (regardless of the source of such funds) shall
be the property of the University, except as provided by this or other University
policy. Funds administered by the University include University resources, and
funds for employee compensation, materials, or facilities.
B. It is the obligation of Employees engaged in consulting and other
activities with outside entities to ensure that their activities and agreements with
third parties are not in conflict with the provisions of this Policy or other
commitments involving the University. OVPR shall set and administer rules
regarding the ownership of Intellectual Property made during outside employment
activities (e.g., consulting). Employees should inform those outside parties with
whom they make agreements of their obligations to the University..
C. The University generally will retain ownership of Intellectual Property
produced by Employees while participating in sabbaticals or other external activities
if they receive salary from the University for such activity. Exceptions to this rule
may be approved by the Vice President for Research. It is the responsibility of any
such Employee to seek review by his or her appointing department (or equivalent)
and OVPR in advance of entering into any intellectual property ownership

179



December Meeting, 2006 - Appendix

agreements that may be associated with these activities or where such Employee is
receiving partial salary.
D. The University will not generally claim ownership of Intellectual Property
created by Students. (A "student" is a person enrolled in University courses for
credit except when that person is an Employee.) However, the University does claim
ownership of Intellectual Property created by students in their capacity as
Employees or with direct or indirect support of funds administered by the
University. Such students shall be considered to be Employees for the purposes of
this Policy. Students and others may, if agreeable to the student and OTT, assign
their Intellectual Property rights to the University in consideration for being treated
as an Employee Inventor under this Policy.
E. All Intellectual Property made under sponsored research agreements and
material transfer agreements shall be owned by the University except where
previously agreed otherwise in writing based on the circumstances under
consideration. Such exceptions shall be approved and negotiated by OVPR;
Intellectual Property subject to such an exception shall nevertheless be subject to the
disclosure requirements of this Policy.
F.  Trade and service marks not incorporating previously-existing University
marks and that are related to University Intellectual Property and technology transfer
activities are within the scope of this Policy and will be managed by OTT.
University marks, including the University of Michigan Seal, are governed by other
University policy.
III. DISCLOSURE
A. In order to comply with federal law and to identify and assess University
Intellectual Property as an asset of the University, Employees have an obligation to
disclose any University Intellectual Property promptly and completely to OTT. A
disclosure of a summary of the Intellectual Property to OTT shall satisfy this
requirement unless additional information is requested by OTT. Employees shall use
their best efforts to disclose the names of all Inventors and persons that might have
contributed to the making of Intellectual Property as an Inventor, with questions
being directed to OTT. Employees and persons having knowledge of facts
concerning inventorship issues, problems, or questions (even if they do not know the
full implication of such facts) shall have a duty to raise such matters with OTT
immediately upon knowledge of the same.
B. Employees who believe that they have created patentable Intellectual
Property not owned by the University shall not commercialize such inventions or
file (or assist others to file) patent applications without providing at least thirty days
notice and a brief written summary of the inventions and the circumstances of the
inventions to OTT. Such disclosures shall not be required in situations where an
Employee has a reasonable belief that (a) the Intellectual Property is a scholarly
work (as defined in University Copyright Policy) or (b) the Intellectual Property is
the result of work that is clearly and demonstrably outside both the Employee's field
of work and the Employee's University responsibilities.
IV. COMMERCIALIZATION
A. It is the objective of OTT to diligently pursue the best opportunities to
transfer UM Intellectual Property consistent with the missions of the University and
for the public benefit. In consultation with Inventors, except as provided herein,
OTT shall have authority for decisions concerning the route of commercializing or
transferring a particular Intellectual Property, as well as the selection and use of
outside resources, including outside legal counsel, to assist in commercialization.
B. OTT generally shall have authority for those agreements that are
primarily transfer of University-owned (a) patent rights, (b) computer software and
other copyrightable materials (such as electronic materials, written materials, and
data) with any associated service agreements, and (c) Tangible Materials.
Responsibility for patent administration, including the retention of patent counsel, is

180



December Meeting, 2006 - Appendix

shared by OTT and the Offices of the Vice President for Research and the General
Counsel.
C. From time to time, parties may wish to donate intellectual property rights
to the University. Decisions as to whether to accept such donations will be made by
the Office of the Vice President for Development, OTT, and any involved
University unit. The University generally will accept donations of intellectual
property only where the rights are related to areas of technical or research interest
for the University. OTT will be responsible for the assessment, protection and
commercialization, as OTT deems appropriate, of intellectual property received by
the University.
D. Tangible property, including   models, devices, designs, computer
programs and other software, cell lines, antibodies, recombinant materials,
laboratory  animals, chemical compounds, compositions, formulations, plant
varieties, and records ("Tangible Materials") that comprise University Intellectual
Property may be distributed outside of the University consistent with applicable
laws, policies, and existing license agreements. OVPR shall set and administer rules
regarding transfers of Tangible Materials.
V.   REVENUE DISTRIBUTION
A. Revenues generated by the licensing of University Intellectual Property
provide a strong incentive for Employee participation in technology licensing and
support further investment in research and technology transfer. The University shall
share revenues received from commercialization efforts with all involved University
Inventors, except as may otherwise be provided. OVPR shall set rules for instances
where revenues are for the recovery of production expenses for applicable types of
Intellectual Property (e.g., Tangible Materials). This Section V shall apply to new
agreements entered into after the date of this Policy revision, though the percentages
defined below are unchanged. This Policy does not apply to funds received as gifts
or for sponsored research.
B. After recovery of University Expenses, aggregate revenues resulting from
royalties and sale of equity interests shall be shared as follows. The division of
revenues are subject to change through appropriate University procedures.
Up to $200,000:
50% to the Inventor(s)
17% to the Inventor's department
18% to the Inventor's school or college
15% to the central University administration
Over $200,000 (and up to $2,000,000):
30% to the Inventor(s)
20% to the Inventor's department
25% to the Inventor's school or college
25% to the central University administration
Over $2,000,000:
30% to the Inventor(s)
35% to the Inventor's school or college
35% to the central University administration
C. OVPR shall set and administer rules for determining the Inventor share of
revenues within the parameters outlined in this Policy. This Policy, including the
revenue sharing provisions, is subject to change with respect to both current
Employees and Employees that have left the University.
D. OVPR shall set and administer rules for cases where an Inventor changes
departments, is affiliated with a University institute or center, an Inventor does not

181



December Meeting, 2006 - Appendix

have a department or school/college affiliation, or when other unusual circumstances
apply. Although the University units described above shall have discretion for
distributing the revenue they receive, generally it is expected that revenues will be
used for research and educational purposes or for investment in further
commercialization activities, such as in the laboratories of Inventors.
E. An allocation from all revenues will fund patent expenses beyond the
annual base OTT Patent Budget. Each year, based on projections of license revenues
and patent expenses, a patent allocation percentage will be assessed on all revenues
as a University expense. Such funds will facilitate investment in new Intellectual
Property protection.
F.  Consideration for a license may include equity in a business. If equity is
liquidated, it shall be treated as revenues and distributed according to this Policy.
Equity will be held, liquidated, or directly distributed to Inventors (to the extent
permitted by law) at the discretion of the University. Neither OTT nor Inventors will
control the timing and terms of the liquidation of such equity received by the
University. The Office of the Treasurer of the University will manage the disposal of
equity held by the University. The holding of equity by Inventors may be subject to
University conflict of interest policies.
G. The Vice President for Research shall have authority to resolve any
unusual circumstances and may make exceptions to the distribution rules after
consulting the affected parties.
VI. GRANTING RIGHTS BACK TO INVENTORS
A. Upon request by one or more Inventors, the University may at its
discretion elect to assign or license its rights in University Intellectual Property back
to one or more Inventors when permissible under University policies, related
sponsorship agreements, and/or federal law, and where other commercialization
routes are not effective or available. Before taking such action, OTT should
reasonably attempt to seek unanimous approval of all the Inventors, but OTT need
not obtain approval of all Inventors.
B. OTT is not required to market, protect, and license the Intellectual
Property where rights have been granted back to Inventors. OTT may require other
terms as a condition of such an agreement. The Inventor(s) receiving an assignment
or license shall not share in University revenues.
C. Consideration to the University for assignment of ownership of
University Intellectual Property shall consist of recovery of any out-of-pocket
University expenses, plus 15% of royalties, equity, or other value received by the
Inventor(s) through subsequent use, licensing, or further assignment of the
Intellectual Property. Assignment may be subject to internal University conflict of
interest rules, which may limit the assignee's use at the University of the assigned
Intellectual Property.
VII. APPEAL PROCESS
A. If informal procedures and consultation do not provide resolution of a
dispute or policy issue involving the matters discussed in this Policy, any member of
the University community may resort to a formal procedure. Initially, such person(s)
must request in writing a review by the Executive Director of OTT. If this does not
result in resolution of the issue, then such person may file a request in writing for
formal dispute resolution or policy interpretation with the Vice President for
Research. The University typically shall rely upon outside University patent counsel
retained in conjunction with Offices of the Vice President and the General Counsel
for determinations of inventorship of patents and patent applications.
B. The Vice President for Research (or designee) shall diligently consult the
involved parties and other University administration officials as necessary, and shall
communicate the decision, which shall be final, in writing, to the appellant.

182



December Meeting, 2006 - Appendix

VIII. CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND COMMITMENT
A. Agreements entered into by the University and its Employees may be
subject to disclosure, review and approval under the University's Conflict of Interest
Policy(ies) and the Conflict of Interest policies of the University unit in which the
Employee is appointed.
B. Agreements, such as license, option, materials transfer, and assignment
agreements, between the University and Employee(s) or between the University and
a company in which University Employee(s) hold a financial or management interest
may fall under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. This Statute may
permit such agreements if certain disclosure, approval, and reporting requirements
are met.
IX. DEFINITIONS
"Employee" means a person who receives a salary or other consideration from
the University for performance of services, part-time or full time. A University
employee with less than a full year (e.g., 9-month) appointment shall be considered
an "Employee" for acts during a period of appointment. A student that is
compensated (e.g., financially through a stipend, tuition, etc., including graduate
student research assistants and graduate student instructors) is considered an
Employee under this Policy.
"Intellectual Property" means inventions, processes, compositions, life forms,
computer software, copyrighted works, mask works, research tools and data, certain
defined trade and service marks, Tangible Materials, and legal rights to the same.
"Inventor," with respect to patentable subject matter, means an Employee who
has made an inventive contribution to the Intellectual Property as defined under U.S.
patent laws, meaning that an Inventor must have contributed to the conception of
ideas claimed in a patent.
"Inventor," with respect to software and other copyrightable materials and
associated trade and service marks, means an Employee who has participated (a)
materially in the conception of the idea of the operation or design thereof (e.g., the
operation of software) or (b) extensively in translating an idea into a fixed medium.
"Inventor," with respect to unpatented biologic and chemical materials or
laboratory animals (e.g., plasmids, vectors, cell lines, mice, etc.), means an
Employee who has taken part (a) in the conception of the idea of the specific
material that is to be made and/or (b) significantly in making the material but only
where making the material was not a routine or known practice. A person providing
material to a second person that uses the material to produce a new material
generally will not be considered hereunder to be an Inventor of the new material.

JANUARY MEETING, 2007

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
January 18, 2007
The Regents convened at 3:20 p.m. in the Regents Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov,
Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice
President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Taylor and
Chancellor Mestas were absent; Provost Jack Kay attended for Chancellor Mestas.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She welcomed Regent Julia
Donovan Darlow to her first board meeting.
President Coleman announced that the Biomedical Sciences Research Building
("BSRB"), designed by Polshek Partnership, had received the Institute Honor Award
from the American Institute of Architects (AIA). This is the highest honor that the AIA
bestows. President Coleman also pointed out that the BSRB had come in under budget
and ahead of schedule, and offered congratulations to all involved.
President Coleman commented on wide array of activities taking place as part of
the University's annual commemoration of Martin Luther King Day, and noted that this
marks the start of the year-long "Arts on Earth" celebration, which is a series of events
examining the relationship between humans and the arts throughout the world.
President Coleman noted that this would be the final Regents' Meeting for Vice
President Lisa Rudgers, who is stepping down from her position as vice president for
communications as of February 1, 2007. She called on Regent Maynard.
Resolution in Honor of Lisa Rudgers
Regent Maynard read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan salute Lisa M
Rudgers as she steps down from her position as vice president for
communications to establish her own communications practice.
Appointed in May 2000 as the University's first vice president for
communications, Vice President Rudgers bounded into the role with her
trademark energy and enthusiasm.     She assembled a talented
communications team, developed a creative, ambitious communications
strategy, and built a communications operation that is the envy of our
peers.
Vice President Rudgers played a crucial role in developing the
public outreach messaging and related strategies surrounding the
University 's defense of the admissions lawsuits as they wound their way

185



January Meeting, 2007

to the U.S. Supreme Court. Other efforts included revamping the UM
web gateway and developing the "En Espanol" portion of the website,
and  helping  to  develop  the  "Michigan  Difference"  campaign
communications strategy and expanding it to apply to all elements of the
University. Under her direction, the University 's radio and television
stations were brought under one umbrella with a more unified identity,
as were the University's two independent marketing and design units.
Lisa's impact will also be felt in her successful efforts at creating a new
wordmark and fostering a more unified look for the myriad of materials
emanating from the hundreds of units in this highly decentralized
institution.
With her creative, bold, and proactive approach, Vice President
Rudgers has been a crucial force both in advancing the University's
presence and reputation, and in knitting together diverse elements from
within the University. The Regents express their gratitude and respect
for Vice President Lisa M. Rudgers and wish her well as she moves on to
this new phase of her career.
A round of applause followed, after which Vice President Rudgers thanked the
Regents for their support, noting that it had been an honor to work on behalf of the
University, and especially alongside President Coleman and the executive officers. She
also thanked the entire communications staff and the senior managers in the Office of
the Vice President for Communications, and noted that Associate Vice President Julie
Peterson would be serving as interim vice president for communications.
President Coleman then introduced Douglas Kelbaugh, dean of the A. Alfred
Taubman College of Architecture & Urban Planning.
Presentation: A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture & Urban Planning
Dean Kelbaugh played a portion of a video that had been put together to
commemorate the college's 100th anniversary. He reported that the college consists of
about 700 people, including 83 faculty members. About 25% of the faculty are
involved in urban planning and the remainder are in architecture. Among those in the
architecture discipline, about half are designers and the remainder are engineers and
other technicians. This makes for a very diverse group of faculty.
Dean Kelbaugh described the college's student body, faculty, and degree
programs, pointing out that the college has established one of the nation's first doctoral
programs in architecture.  He described the college's main themes that have
characterized it during the past few years: creating sustainable buildings and cities, the
information revolution, developing the American city, with special emphasis on Detroit,
widening the international experience, and developing the real estate program. He said
that the college has a vibrant, but small, research program.
Dean Kelbaugh noted that during his tenure, the college has been improving in the
national rankings and the endowment has seen significant growth, from $8 million to
$64 million. He said that one of the school's most pressing challenges is the need for
additional space for offices, studios, classrooms, and other uses. He also reviewed
some of the intellectual challenges facing the college and the campus in general, and
announced that the college has established an "Arts on Earth" program, along with the
School of Music, Theatre and Dance and the College of Art & Design.

186



January Meeting, 2007

President Coleman then introduced Vice President Forrest to present the Annual
Report on Research.
Annual Report on Research
Vice President Forrest commented that his report would focus on three areas:
research numbers, the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy Institute initiative, and the
challenge of developing partnerships with industry.
Vice President Forrest observed that in terms of research expenditures, the
University ranks among the top five nationally, with annual expenditures of nearly $800
million. However, he expressed concern over the long term prospects for growth in
federally-funded research. He reviewed breakdowns of research expenditures by
sponsor and by unit, noting that he plans to focus his efforts on increasing the industry
sponsorship proportion from the current 4.2% to as much as 10%.
Vice President Forrest distributed an issue of Search and Discovery, a new
publication meant to communicate the University's research accomplishments to the
outside world. Other accomplishments of the Office of the Vice President for Research
in 2006 included promoting and strengthening research in arts and humanities by
establishing the position of associate vice president for social sciences and humanities,
and establishing an arts and humanities funding group.
Vice President Forrest reviewed the goals and purpose of the newly established
Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy Institute (MMPEI), which was formed to support
and grow research and education for a clean, affordable energy future. He said that the
University's established strengths, in automotive, nuclear, and other engineering
disciplines, constitute the core of the institute.  Priority areas for growth and
coordination include focusing on the policy, economic, and societal impact of the
energy challenge. He also described a number of initiatives currently underway in the
institute.
Regarding the need to develop industry partnerships, Vice President Forrest said
that this not only comports with the University's academic mission, but it provides
resources that supplement and enable other sources of funding, while also helping to
create new jobs in a changing economy.
Vice President Forrest provided an update on technology transfer performance,
noting that while licensing income has increased during the past year, this is not a clear
indicator of success with industry partnerships. He pointed out that industry research as
a percent of total research at the University has been declining, and this trend needs to
be reversed. The OVPR has been focusing on alleviating barriers and taking advantage
of opportunities in this area. To that end, the division will focus on changing the
internal culture, making  long  term  strategic investments, becoming   more
entrepreneurial, measuring success, and managing resources.
He concluded by recognizing that solutions to the challenges he described require
a multifaceted, long-term effort, aimed at defining how the research enterprise
exemplifies the "Michigan Difference."
Regent Maynard commented that she and the other Regents are pleased that the
University plans to enhance its efforts at working with industry to support and grow the

187



January Meeting, 2007

economy in the state. Regent McGowan concurred, noting that during a conversation
with Vice President Forrest that morning, the Board had expressed its full support of his
effort to emphasize industry-funded research as a means of reducing the reliance on the
federal government for funding.
Annual Parking and Transportation Services Update
Executive Vice President Slottow introduced Mr. Dave Miller, director of Parking
and Transportation Services.
Mr. Miller stated that the department strives to provide mobility and transportation
options for faculty, staff, students, and visitors, and not just to add parking capacity.
Key elements of the department's success are its partnership with the Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority (AATA), developing alternative transportation options, and
maintaining existing parking structures.
Mr. Miller reported that in 2006, University buses had carried 5.6 million
passengers, a 36% increase since 2000. The UM/AATA program, "MRide," along with
other partnership programs, have led to significant increases in AATA passengers and
University passengers since it was introduced in 2005. He noted that utilization of the
vanpool program has more than doubled since 2004, and reported that the University
had recently engaged Zipcar, a private company that rents cars by the hour, for use by
University personnel and community residents.
Mr. Miller reported on recently completed and renovated parking structures and on
structures planned for the future. He described a proposed addition to the Thompson
Street structure that is planned for completion in 2008 and displayed a map indicating
the proposed general vicinity for construction of a parking structure on North Campus.
It was noted that the structure would be situated close to the Walgreen Drama Center,
although the exact siting has not yet been determined. The structure would service
special events at the Walgreen Drama Center, Arthur Miller Theatre, and other School
of Music, Theatre & Dance venues, as well as general faculty and staff parking for a
variety of North Campus facilities. He pointed out that visitor parking for events would
be of key importance in making North Campus a vital destination for visitors. Current
plans call for this structure to be constructed in 2008 and opened in 2009. He said that
his staff is working with staff from University Productions and the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance to ensure that adequate parking will be provided for special events
until the new structure opens.
A discussion then followed about where the new North Campus parking structure
would be situated on the site. Regents White and McGowan expressed concern that the
structure not be placed at a location that would be better suited for an academic facility.
Associate Vice President Hank Baier commented that planners had been guided by
previous discussions which urged that the structure be situated as conveniently as
possible for patrons of the Arthur Miller Theatre and North Campus Auditorium. He
pointed out that the area highlighted on the diagram is large enough to accommodate
two large buildings in addition to a parking structure. Regents White and McGowan
asked that consideration be given to placing the structure in a spot that would be
unsuitable for any other kind of building, perhaps built into a hillside.

188



January Meeting, 2007

Executive Vice President Slottow said that thought is also being given to possibly
combining a parking structure with some other needs. He pointed out that last year the
Regental feedback on this issue had been that the structure should be located as close as
possible to the performance facilities and that construction of the structure should be a
high priority. Mr. Baier reported that there is a process in place under which potential
development sites for parking and other facilities are discussed with all interested
academic stakeholders, and North Campus deans have been involved in site planning
discussions. Mr. Baier said that the next discussion of this issue would indicate
potential locations for a parking structure, along with other development zone
opportunities. It was suggested that space might be provided for valet drop-off of
theatre patrons.
Mr. Miller then displayed diagrams indicating the potential site for a parking
structure on Wall Street to serve the needs of the expansion of Kellogg Eye Center. The
plans also provide for an additional structure, as well as a "transportation hub" in that
area. Regent McGowan observed that Wall Street development plans have not been
fully vetted with the board, and requested that plans not be solidified until further
discussion has occurred.
Mr. Miller noted that the parking system is financed primarily by the purchase of
annual parking permits, and the financial model indicates that a 5% increase per year
will be required for the next 3 years. He concluded by giving a demonstration of the
"Magic Bus" real-time, on-line tracking system for bus routes.
The Regents then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of December 14, 2006.

Wolff, former dean of the School of Music, and Takeshi Takahara, professor of art.
Lawrence R. Kuhns, M.D., professor of radiology in the Medical School, retired
from active faculty status on December 31, 2006.
Dr. Kuhns received his B.S. degree from the University of Alaska in 1961 and his
M.D. degree from the University of Washington in 1965. He completed additional
medical training, including a residency and fellowship in pediatric radiology, at the
University of Michigan in 1973, and then joined the University faculty as an instructor.
He was promoted to assistant professor in 1974, associate professor in 1976, and
professor in 1980. In 1981, he left the University to take a position as a staff radiologist
at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital and in 1984 he moved to the Children's Hospital of
Michigan. He returned to the University of Michigan as professor of radiology in 1993.
An outstanding pediatric radiologist, Dr. Kuhns has focused his research on
musculoskeletal radiology in children, especially trauma and applications of ultrasound.
He has published 138 peer reviewed publications and is lead author on four textbooks,
one of which, Decision Making in Imaging, is considered to be a seminal contribution
to the field of radiology. He is noted for the high quality of his patient care and
innovative investigations, and serves as a role model for medical students, radiology
residents, fellows in pediatric radiology, and other faculty in the Department of
Radiology. Dr. Kuhns is a diplomate of the American Board of Radiology and obtained
a sub-certification in pediatric radiology in 1995.
The Regents now salute this distinguished pediatric radiologist for his dedicated
service by naming Lawrence R. Kuhns professor emeritus of radiology.
Jon N. Rush, M.F.A., professor of art in the School of Art & Design, retired from
active faculty status on December 31, 2006.
Professor Rush received his B.F.A. and M.F.A. degrees from the Cranbrook
Academy of Art in 1958 and 1959, respectively. From 1959-62, he served as an
instructor at the Columbus College of Art and Design in Columbus, Ohio. He joined
the faculty at the University of Michigan as an instructor in art in 1962, and was
promoted to assistant professor in 1964, associate professor in 1968, and professor in
1973.
A widely respected sculptor and educator, Professor Rush's innovations have had
a continuing impact on students. He was among a handful of artists to learn the secrets
of lost wax bronze casting and to introduce this technique at American art schools.
Building on his experiences at the Columbus College of Art and Design, Professor Rush
co-designed the School of Art & Design's first truly professional foundry. He
developed an extensive metal fabrication area as well, bringing industrial metal cutting
and forming machines to the school for the first time.
Throughout his career at the University of Michigan, Professor Rush has been an
active citizen of the University and an impassioned advocate for faculty governance. He
served as a representative of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs and
as a member of the Senate Assembly's Academic Affairs Advisory Committee. He was
the director of the Slusser Gallery from 1994-95 and designed the Wallenberg Medal,
awarded annually to outstanding humanitarians. Three of his sculptures can be found
on the Ann Arbor campus.

changed to assistant research scientist. She was promoted to assistant professor of health
planning and administration in 1979, associate professor in 1985, and professor in 1995.
Professor Simmons' career has been devoted to the improvement of public sector
health systems in developing countries through teaching, research, and policy and
program development in family planning and related aspects of reproductive health. Her
early studies on India pioneered institutional and organizational approaches to the
analysis of family planning programs.    This work expanded to Bangladesh,
demonstrating the impact of these programs on fertility and women's lives. Professor
Simmons played a leading role in the development and implementation of the
WHO-sponsored "Strategic Approach to Strengthening Reproductive Health Policies and
Programs," now used in 25 countries. In recent years she has broken new ground in
advancing the science and practice of scaling up in an effort to ensure that health and
development initiatives progress beyond the limited impact of pilot, demonstration or
experimental projects. This endeavor has resulted in major publications as well as the
creation of the learning community "ExpandNet," and initiatives in Brazil, Bolivia,
Chile, Paraguay, and Kyrgyzstan. Professor Simmons and her colleagues have also
collaborated with the Chinese government and research institutions to introduce quality
of care and a reproductive rights perspective into the Chinese family planning program.
The Regents now salute this accomplished scholar and teacher for her dedicated
service by naming Ruth S. Simmons professor emerita of health behavior and health
education.

January Meeting, 2007

Professor of Biological Chemistry and professor of biological chemistry in the Medical
School, and research biophysicist in the Biophysics Research Division. Professor
Ludwig died on November 27, 2006, at age 75.
Professor Ludwig received her B.A. degree from Cornell University in 1952, her
M.A. degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1955, and her Ph.D. degree
from Cornell University Medical College in 1956. One of the most distinguished
scientists on campus, Professor Ludwig joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
assistant professor in 1967 and maintained an active research program until her death.
Professor Ludwig was a stellar x-ray crystallographer, whose research program is
nationally and internationally recognized for its contributions to our understanding of
the B vitamins and their mode of action. She served as a mentor and teacher for many
younger crystallographers and her teaching was known for its rigor and depth, as well
as for its ability to challenge the student. Professor Ludwig was one of the most
accomplished faculty members in the history of the Department of Biological
Chemistry. She was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a fellow of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, and had recently been elected
to the Institute of Medicine. In 1986 she received the University's Distinguished

A remarkably broad scholar, he published lasting work on the Japanese economy,
international trade, economic history, law and economics, and economic development.
His early worked focused on technical diffusion in the Japanese cotton spinning
industry. By focusing on the causes and consequences of Japan's adoption and
innovation of western technology, he was able to understand the causes for Japan's
rapid rise, develop important lessons for other developing countries, and deepen our
understanding of the rise of unique labor market practices such as permanent
employment.
He received many honors for his work, including fellowships from the Guggenheim
Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences, the Institute for Advanced Study, and a coveted residency at
the Bellagio Center of the Rockefeller Foundation. He was a recipient of the Faculty
Fellowship Enhancement Award from the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies and the Excellence in Undergraduate Education Award from the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts.
In addition to his scholarship, Professor Saxonhouse played an active role in
public affairs. He served as a senior staff economist at the President's Council of

219



January Meeting, 2007

Economic Advisors and as a consultant to a number of U.S. government agencies. He
testified on numerous occasions before Congressional committees and served on several
Congressional advisory panels. In Japan, he was a member of the American advisory
board of the Japan Foundation and the academic advisory committee of the Policy
Research Institute in the Ministry of Finance. He also schooled many elite members of
Japan's civil service, who would spend a year at the University of Michigan, away from
their high-profile careers, to learn from him.
Professor Saxonhouse will be greatly missed by his colleagues and friends and
will be remembered as an inspiration and visionary by all those whose lives he touched.
As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our condolences to his
wife, University of Michigan Professor Arlene Saxonhouse, his children, Lilly, Noam,
and Elena, two grandchildren, and his brother, Jack.

The Regents approved a materials transfer agreement with NanoBio Corporation
(the "Company") involving provision of proprietary nanoemulsions made by the
Company to the University for use in various projects to be mutually approved from
time to time. No transfer of funds is involved. Because the part owner, president, chief
operating officer, chairman of the board, and chief science officer of the Company, James
R. Baker, Jr., is also a University of Michigan employee, this agreement falls under the
State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and NanoBio Corporation.
2.   The terms of the proposed master agreement conform to University policy and will be
for a 5-year period. The agreement anticipates that additional projects will be described
and added to the work statement from time to time subject to review and approval of the
relevant conflict of interest committee. The initial project will be directed by Dr.
Nicholas Lukacs, associate professor in the Department of Pathology, over a 12-month
period using internal discretionary funds. Provisions in the research agreement are
consistent with University policy.
3.   James Baker's pecuniary interest arises from his position as part owner, president, chief
operating officer, chairman of the board, and chief science officer of NanoBio
Corporation.
Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and Biotectix, LLC
The Regents approved a research agreement between the University of Michigan
and Biotectix, LLC that allows Biotectix, LLC and the University to mutually define
projects from time to time that will be conducted by University employees. Because
David Martin (faculty member), Sarah Richardson-Burns (post-doctoral student), and
Jeffrey Hendricks (Ph.D. student) are also partial owners of Biotectix, LLC, this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Biotectix, LLC.
2.   The terms of the proposed master agreement conform to University policy and will be
for a 5-year period. The agreement anticipates that additional related projects will be
described and added to the work statement from time to time subject to review and
approval of the relevant conflict of interest committee. The initial project will be
directed by Dr. Yahoash Raphael of the Department of Otolaryngology over a 12-month
period at an estimated cost of $220,215. Provisions in the research agreement are
consistent with University policy.
3.   The pecuniary interest of David Martin, Sarah Richardson-Burns, and Jeffrey Hendricks
arise from their status as partial owners of Biotectix, LLC.
Change in Name of Joel D. Tauber Manufacturing Institute
On   a motion    by  Regent Deitch, seconded      by  Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved changing the name of the Joel D. Tauber Manufacturing Institute
to the Joel D. Tauber Institute for Global Operations.
A ten-minute break followed.

FEBRUARY MEETING, 2007

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
February 15, 2007
The Regents convened at 3:05 p.m. in the Regents Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Darlow, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and Richner. Also
present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice
President Harper, Acting Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice
President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Interim Vice President
Peterson, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regents Deitch, Taylor, and White were absent. Regent White participated
in a portion of the meeting by telephone.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She welcomed Julie Peterson,
interim vice president for communications, to the Regents' Meeting.
President Coleman commented on the death of Jon Cosovich, former vice
president for development, who had played a critical role in the Campaign for Michigan
in the 1990s.
President Coleman noted that the University and the city had been working with
other local entities to absorb and respond to the recently announced closing of the Pfizer
Corporation. She stated that the community's first priority is to provide employment
opportunities for Pfizer workers who wish to stay in Washtenaw County, while also
exploring opportunities presented by the high quality facilities that Pfizer will be
vacating.
President Coleman also commented on an energy symposium that had recently
been held on campus, organized by the Office of the Vice President for Research and
the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Research Institute, and featuring an address by the
U.S. Secretary of Energy, Samuel Bodman.
Presentation: Life Sciences Institute
President Coleman introduced Alan Saltiel, director of the Life Sciences Institute.
He described the challenges that the institute has faced since its inception, including
attracting talented faculty from diverse fields, developing hubs that can serve as centers
through which people can collaborate on their research projects, providing a means for
faculty to work together on the same projects from different perspectives, and
establishing programs and activities which enable faculty and students to build up
relationships and trust among each other. He gave a number of examples of how all of
these challenges have been addressed, noting that the building is nearly at capacity,
with 25 faculty and about 500 individuals, including 110 students, working in the
institute. Numerous papers have been published in prestigious journals, and the faculty
has obtained about $15 million in external funding.

227



February Meeting, 2007

Professor Saltiel commented that the institute is now focusing on maintaining its
role as an agent of change at the University for the life sciences. It will accomplish this
by continuing to support the institute's collaborative centers and, by educating students
in the new, collaborative method of scientific discovery, through which students go
outside their disciplines to pursue their experiments. Continuing challenges will
include obtaining sufficient funding for programmatic initiatives and other needs, and
inculcating a culture of collaboration into the fabric of the institute as it matures.
Professor Saltiel responded to questions concerning the process through which
students learn about research opportunities and join researchers as members of their
teams. There was also a discussion of the fundraising challenges inherent in entities
such as the Life Sciences Institute.
Committee Reports
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. In Regent Taylor's
absence, Regent Newman reported that the committee had received an update on
ongoing dean searches and discussed retention and recruitment of faculty with Provost
Sullivan, and reviewed Human Resources and Affirmative Action strategic goals with
Associate Vice President Laurita Thomas. The committee also confirmed its agenda for
the remainder of the year.
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent McGowan, chair of the
committee, reported that the committee had met with Executive Vice President Kelch,
Executive Director Doug Strong, and Health System CFO Dave Morlock for a review
of the Hospitals and Health Centers 10-year strategic capital plan, and also received
from them a report on the final financial close-out of the sale of M-CARE. The
committee reviewed the FY 2008 General Fund budget outlook with Provost Sullivan
and Associate Provost Hanlon, and received a bimonthly update of internal audits from
director of internal audits, Carol Senneff. The committee also received the annual lease
portfolio report for FY 2006 from Mary Krasny, associate director for real estate and
design, and Associate Vice President Henry Baier.
The Regents then turned to the consent agenda.

February Meeting, 2007

Regent White joined the meeting by telephone at this point.

agenda includes a request for life safety upgrades for the Betsy Barbour and Helen
Newberry residence halls. She pointed out that these are historic halls that house
women students.
University of Michigan-Flint. There was no report from the Flint Campus.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little described efforts being
made to put the campus's "Metropolitan Vision" into practice, including working to
reduce the resistance by displaced workers to pursuing additional education, focusing
on environmental issues, and the continuing sponsorship of the "difficult dialog" series
which focuses on issues of race. He also noted that the campus is making diligent
efforts to increase enrollment.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. MSA President Nicole Stallings reported
on activities being pursued by MSA in two areas: high textbook prices and improving
the internal organization of MSA.        She also praised the efforts of the Diversity
Blueprints Task Force.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted the Report of Voluntary
Support for January 31, 2007. He noted that due to strong fundraising during the past
few months, the campaign has just reached $2,410,000,000, which is $90,000,000 short
of the goal. He called attention to the generosity of alumni Fred and Judy Wilpon, who
have made a number of generous commitments in a variety of areas.
Vice President May also commented on the career of former vice president for
development, Jon Cosovich, who died on January 24, 2007. He noted that he had
helped Michigan build a fundraising program that now leads the nation among all
public universities in giving from individuals, and he was also a dedicated mentor to
development staff across the University.

M. Haskell Newman, M.D., clinical professor of surgery in the Medical School,
retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2006.
Dr. Newman received his B.S. degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1959
and his M.D. degree from the University of Tennessee in 1962. He then came to the
University of Michigan, where he trained in general surgery (1963-64), and completed a

Army Medical Corps (1968-71), he returned to the University of Michigan as an
assistant professor in otorhinolaryngology until 1975. He then elected to train in plastic
surgery, completing a residency at the University of Michigan and a fellowship in
craniofacial surgery at the University of Toronto in 1977. He rejoined the University
of Michigan faculty as assistant professor in the Section of Plastic Surgery in 1977. He
became a clinical assistant professor in 1981 and was promoted to clinical associate
professor in 1991 and clinical professor in 1998.
During the course of his outstanding and distinguished career, Dr. Newman gained
a national reputation for his expertise in the areas of pediatric plastic surgery, cleft lip
and palate surgery, adult maxillofacial surgery, and aesthetic surgery. He has been the
associate editor of the Cleft Palate Journal, and has served as president of the Michigan
Academy of Plastic Surgeons, the Plastic Surgery Otorhinolaryngology Society, the
Michigan Cleft Palate Association, and most recently, the Rhinoplasty Society. He has
given numerous presentations nationally and internationally and has published on a
wide variety of clinical topics.
A revered member of the teaching faculty in the section of plastic surgery, Dr.
Newman has been recognized, without exception, by every graduating resident as a
major influence on their clinical training. His patient, thorough approach in the
operating room has contributed to the large number of highly skilled, conscientious, and
thoughtful plastic surgeons throughout the country that cite Dr. Newman as their
biggest influence. In honor of this lasting legacy, the department plans to establish an
endowment for resident education in Dr. Newman's name.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and clinician for his dedicated

of the following items:
Approval of Payment for Equilibrium
The Regents approved a payment to Equilibrium for the rental of bass chimes by
the University of Michigan Symphony Orchestra. Because the owner of Equilibrium,
Michael Udow, is also a University of Michigan employee, this payment falls under the
State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and its Symphony
Orchestra and Equilibrium.

Immunotherapeutics, Inc., and Lycera
The Regents approved an assignment agreement that would allow the University
of Michigan to license intellectual property licensed to GMP Immunotherapeutics
("GMPI") to Lycera or other third parties. Because Gary Glick, Anthony Opipari, and

253



February Meeting, 2007

agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan, GMPI, and
Lycera.
2.   GMPI will assign all of its rights in the GMPI intellectual property ("IP") to Michigan.
Michigan will share a percentage of revenue it receives from licensing the GMPI IP
and Michigan patents with GMPI.     Standard disclaimers of warrantees and
indemnification apply, and the contract may be amended by consent of the parties.
University procedures for approval of these changes will be followed and additional
conflict of interest review will be done as appropriate.
3.   The pecuniary interests of Drs. Glick, Ferrara and Opipari arise from their ownership
interest in Lycera.
Subcontract Agreement between the University of Michigan and T/J Technologies,
Inc.
The Regents approved a subcontract agreement between the University of
Michigan and T/J Technologies, Inc., for funding of a research project in the College of
Engineering under the direction of Dr. Levi Thompson, Jr., a University of Michigan
employee. Because Dr. Thompson is a majority shareholder in T/J Technologies, Inc.
("T/J"), and his wife, Maria A. Thompson, is president and CEO of T/J, this agreement
falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.          The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and T/J Technologies, Inc.
2.   The terms of the agreement conform to University policy regarding publication and

$445,028 with full indirect costs at the federal rate. The agreement contains a
provision allowing amendment by mutual agreement by the parties. University
procedures for approval of the changes will be followed and additional conflict of
interest review will be done as appropriate.
3.   Dr. Thompson's pecuniary interest arises from his status as majority shareholder in T/J
Technologies, and his wife's status as president and CEO of T/J. He will only
participate in the project in his capacity as an employee of the University.
License Agreement between the University of Michigan and SensiGen, LLC
The Regents approved a license agreement between the University of Michigan
and SensiGen, LLC, for licensing of the technology entitled "Sensitive Detection in
Body Fluids of Human Papilloma Virus for Analyses of Cancer and Dysplasia" (UM
File No. 2909). Because Dr. David Kurnit is a University of Michigan employee and
also partial owner of SensiGen, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and SensiGen,
LLC.
2.   License terms include giving SensiGen an exclusive license with the right to grant
sublicenses. SensiGen will pay a royalty on sales and reimburse patent costs. The
University will retain ownership of the licensed technology and may continue to
further develop it and use it internally. No use of University services or facilities, nor
any assignment of University employees, is obligated or contemplated under the
agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees and indemnification apply, and the
contract may be amended by consent of the parties. University procedures for
approval of these changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest review
will be done as appropriate.

254



February Meeting, 2007

3.   The pecuniary interests of Dr. Kumit arise from his ownership interest in SensiGen.
He has waived any personal participation in the sharing of revenue received by the
University.
Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and Ascenta Therapeutics,
Inc.
The Regents approved a research agreement between the University of Michigan
and Ascenta Therapeutics, Inc., to support a research contract for further development
of the inventions made by Drs. Marc Lippman, Shaomeng Wang, and Dajun Yang.
Because Drs. Lippman, Wang, and Yang are partial owners of Ascenta Therapeutics,
and Drs. Lippman and Wang are also directors and members of the company's scientific
advisory board, and R. Yang is an employee and officer of the company, this agreement
falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.   The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Ascenta Therapeutics, Inc.
2.   The terms of the proposed agreement conform to University policy regarding
publication and intellectual property. Dr. Shaomeng Want will direct the project over
an initial three year period at an estimated cost of $1,900,586. The contract includes a
provision allowing extension and modification of the project upon mutual agreement
of the parties (collectively "Agreement"). University procedures for approval of the
changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest review will be done as
appropriate.
3.   Drs. Lippman's, Wang's, and Yang's pecuniary interest arises from their status as
partial owners (Lippman, Wang, Yang), directors and members of the company's
scientific advisory board (Lippman and Wang), and employee of the company (Yang).

has authorized the acquisition, construction, installation and equipping of the capital
improvements described in Exhibit A (collectively, the "Project"), all of which are or
will become part of, or otherwise will benefit the Hospital; and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties, and in order to
prudently control and direct expenditures from the University's funds, the Issuer
determines it is necessary and desirable to authorize the issuance of one or more series
of hospital revenue obligations (the "Bonds") to provide funds which, together with
other available funds, may be used to pay all or a portion of the costs of the Project, to
pay all or a portion of the costs of refinancing all or a portion of the Series G Notes,
and to pay certain costs incurred in connection with the issuance and sale of the Bonds,
and the refinancing; and

257



February Meeting, 2007 - Appendix

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1.  The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery, in one or more
series, of the Bonds of the Issuer to be designated as shall be determined by an Authorized
Officer (but which designation shall include the words "HOSPITAL REVENUE BONDS"
or "HOSPITAL REVENUE NOTES") with appropriate series designation, in the aggregate
original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but not to exceed the
principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of $160,000,000, to be dated as of the date
or dates established by an Authorized Officer, for the purpose of providing funds which,
together with other available funds, may be used to pay all or a portion of the costs of the
Project, to pay all or a portion of the costs of refinancing all or a portion of the Series G
Notes, and to pay costs incidental to the issuance of the Bonds, and the refinancing,
including capitalized interest, if any for such period as an Authorized Officer may determine
appropriate, and bond insurance premiums, if any. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to
determine (a) the specific amount of the cost of each component of the Project to be financed
from the proceeds of the Bonds, and (b) the portion of the Series G Notes to be refinanced
with the proceeds of the Bonds.   The Issuer may subsequently approve additional
components of the Project and specify that such additional components shall be financed in
whole or in part from the proceeds of the Bonds, upon which occurrence such components
shall thereupon become components of the Project hereunder. The Bonds shall be serial
Bonds or term Bonds, which may be subject to redemption requirements, or both, as shall be
established by an Authorized Officer, but the first maturity shall be no earlier than December
31, 2007 and the last maturity shall be no later than December 31, 2038. The Bonds may
bear no interest or may bear interest at stated fixed rates for the respective maturities thereof
as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the weighted average yield (computed
using the stated coupons and the stated original offering price) for the Bonds shall not
exceed 7.0% per annum, and the Bonds may be issued in whole or in part as capital
appreciation bonds, which for their term or any part thereof bear no interest but appreciate in
principal amount over time at compounded rates (not in excess of 7.0% per annum) to be
determined by an Authorized Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds may bear
interest at a variable rate of interest, determined on the basis of an index or through market
procedures, or both, for all or a portion of their term, and the variable rate of interest shall
not exceed the lesser of the maximum rate permitted by law or the maximum rate, if any, to
be specified in the Series Indenture. In addition, all or part of the Bonds may be issued in
related series, one of which bears interest at a variable rate and one of which bears interest at
a residual rate determined by subtracting the variable rate from the fixed rate paid by the
Issuer, but the combined rate on such Bonds, taking the two related series together, which
shall be determined by an Authorized Officer, shall not exceed 7.0% per annum. The Bonds
may be subject to redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the times and prices
and in the manner as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but no redemption
premium shall exceed 3% of the principal amount being redeemed, unless the redemption
price is based on a "make whole" formula, in which case no redemption premium shall
exceed 10% of the principal amount being redeemed. Interest on the Bonds shall be payable
at such times as shall be specified by an Authorized Officer. The Bonds shall be issued in
fully registered form in denominations, shall be payable as to principal and interest in the
manner, shall be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be executed and authenticated,
all as shall be provided in the Series Indenture. The Bonds shall be sold to the Underwriter
pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement for a price to be established by an Authorized
Officer (but the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of original issue discount, shall not exceed
0.7% of the principal amount thereof) plus accrued interest, if any, from the dated date of the
Bonds to the date of delivery thereof.
In relation to the debt service on the Bonds, or in relation to the debt service on any
outstanding Revenue Obligations, any of the Authorized Officers may, at any time, on
behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into an interest rate swap, cap, forward starting
swap, rate lock, option, swaption or similar agreement or agreements (collectively, the
"Swap Agreement") with a counter-party or counter-parties to be selected by the Authorized
Officer. Such Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the Issuer and the
counter-party related to interest on all or a portion of the Bonds, or to indexed or market
established rates. If the Swap Agreement is entered at approximately the same time as the
issuance of the Bonds, the expected effective interest rates on the Bonds, taking into account
the effect of the Swap Agreement, shall be within the limitations set forth herein. Any Swap
Agreement in the form of an option, swaption, rate lock or forward starting swap, may,

258



February Meeting, 2007 - Appendix

under certain circumstances, be required to be terminated, with a possibility of a resulting
termination payment due by the University.
Any or all of the Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the option of
the holder thereof. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any Bonds subject to tender
options may be made payable from Hospital Gross Revenues (as defined in the Master
Indenture), from available cash reserves of the University, subject to such limitations as may
be specified in the Series Indenture, or from a letter of credit, line of credit, standby bond
purchase agreement or other liquidity device, or one or more of the same, or any
combination thereof (collectively, the "Liquidity Device"), all as shall be determined by an
Authorized Officer. Any reimbursement obligation for draws under the Liquidity Device
shall be a limited and not a general obligation of the Issuer, payable from Hospital Gross
Revenues, and may be secured by a pledge of Pledged Hospital Gross Revenues (as defined
in the Master Indenture), and may, additionally or alternatively, be payable from General
Revenues and may be secured by a pledge of General Revenues, as an Authorized Officer
shall determine appropriate. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver at

MARCH MEETING, 2007

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
March 15, 2007
The Regents convened at 3:10 p.m. in the Regents Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Darlow, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, and Richner. Also
present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice
President Harper, Acting Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice
President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Interim Vice President
Peterson, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regents Deitch, Taylor, and White were absent. Regents Deitch and Taylor
participated in a portion of the meeting by telephone.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order.
Diversity Blueprints.  President Coleman announced that the report of the
Diversity Blueprints Task Force, chaired by Provost Sullivan, would be announced
today. She expressed her gratitude to the task force for the many hours its members
spent developing recommendations for building a more diverse campus. She stated that
this report is vital to the future academic strength of the University, which owes its
strength to the tremendous diversity of its faculty, students, and staff. The Diversity
Blueprints Task Force report, she said, "sets the foundation for a wide-ranging campus
plan that builds upon this academic excellence and finds new ways to attract and retain
individuals of all backgrounds who contribute to our community." However, it is only
one of the ways in which the University will strive to continue to be an accessible and
welcoming campus for all.
President Coleman also commented that the official opening of the Arthur Miller
Theatre would occur in two weeks with the production of the Arthur Miller drama,
"Playing for Time." She also called attention to a three-week series of events on the
theme of "arts and war" being sponsored by the Arts on Earth initiative in conjunction
with the opening production of the Arthur Miller Theatre.
Presentation: School of Dentistry
President Coleman introduced Dr. Peter Polverini, dean of the School of Dentistry.
Dr. Polverini gave a presentation describing the School of Dentistry's educational
programs, research, and patient care and community outreach programs. He noted that
the school enrolls about 105 students per year out of an applicant pool of about 3,000,
and its advanced educational programs run the entire gamut of dental specialties. More
than 45% of Michigan dentists are graduates of the school.
Dr. Polverini reported that through its clinical outreach programs, the School of
Dentistry has become a major provider of oral health care to underserved populations
throughout the state, and noted that a significant portion of the graduates each year set
up practices in these communities. Dr. Polverini said that the school is noted for its

263



March Meeting, 2007

research excellence and is ranked number one nationally in research funding among
U.S. dental schools. He described some of the technology transfer and other clinical
research initiatives underway in the school. He concluded by noting some of the
challenges the school faces in developing a sustainable plan to maintain its excellence
while continuing its clinical and educational missions to the state and beyond.
Following the presentation, Dr. Polverini responded to questions regarding the
school's leadership in exploring the link between oral health and systemic health,
leading to the observation that oral health care is an important part of total health care
includes.
Diversity Blueprints Task Force Report
Provost Sullivan presented the report of the Diversity Blueprints Task Force,
which she co-chaired along with Senior Vice Provost Lester Monts. She noted that the
purpose of "Diversity Blueprints" is "to maintain the University of Michigan's status as
one of the nation's premier educational institutions while adhering to changes resulting
from the passage of Proposal 2 in November, 2006." The scope of the task force, as set
forth by President Coleman when it was established on December 13, 2006, was to
focus only on issues specifically raised in Proposal 2: the use of race, ethnicity, gender,
color, and national origin in admissions and financial aid.
She described the composition of the task force and said that it had sought input
from other state university systems that had been affected by similar legislation as well
as from the University of Michigan community. Provost Sullivan stated that a central
proposition of the task force was that diversity is more than a demographic goal,
pointing out that diverse campus constituencies foster the development of intercultural
skills, which are important for all members of the campus community to attain.
Provost Sullivan reported on the strategies gleaned from discussions with people
from institutions in other states where similar propositions had been enacted. She said
the report contains two types of recommendations: immediate and on-going actions,
and longer-range steps to be developed and refined. The major recommendations cover
six areas:
* Establish a centralized educational outreach center to coordinate educational
and community outreach and engagement with Michigan's K-12 school
system.
* Maintain and improve student admissions, conversion, and retention
practices within the new legal parameters. A number of specific suggestions
are made in this area.
* Address the University's interpersonal climate by providing structured
interactions, facilitated  dialogue, and  opportunities to work  across
boundaries. Diverse encounters should be an integral part of learning and
working at the University.
* Dismantle structural impediments and increase structural support for faculty,
staff, and students, especially those working on diversity-related issues.
This includes providing enhanced support for research and teaching in these
areas.
* Ensure campus-wide buy-in, engagement and transparency with diversity
efforts.

264



March Meeting, 2007

*Increase accountability and sustainability mechanisms for all units and
departments across the university.
Provost Sullivan explained that the president and the executive officers have the
preliminary responsibility for implementing the report, recognizing that other
constituencies, including faculty, staff, students, and alumni, will all be involved. The
fall Diversity Summit could be used as an occasion to provide a progress report on the
efforts at implementation.
President Coleman thanked Provost Sullivan, Senior Vice Provost Monts, and
their colleagues for their efforts in developing and compiling this report, providing the
University community with concrete ways in which to effectively confront these issues.
Regent Maynard expressed her support of this initiative and her gratitude to the
task force for its work. She noted that the most important aspect of the report is that it
"embraces that diversity is an essential part of our university and of our higher
education mission." She said that the report is just the beginning, and that "as a
university, we must have a long-term and energetic commitment to diverse faculty and
students. She concluded that "This university must continue to be a leader, and failure
is unacceptable."
Regent Darlow stated that she agreed with Regent Maynard's comments and that
she is looking forward to reading the report and to learning about implementation and
successes as the recommendations are implemented. Regent Richner also said that he
looked forward to reading the report.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent McGowan, chair of the
committee, reported that she and Regent Richner had attended the meeting and Regent
Maynard had been there for part of the meeting. Committee members Deitch and White
were absent. Also attending were Executive Vice President Slottow, Associate Vice
President Peggy Norgren, Executive Director of University Audits Carol Senneff, and
Controller Cheryl Soper. The committee covered three agenda items. The first topic
covered Sarbanes-Oxley work plan tasks and follow-up, which is a continuation of
ongoing work focusing on internal controls. Regent McGowan reported that the
committee members who were present were entirely satisfied by the progress made to
date in implementing the work plan and followup tasks.
The committee also reviewed the results of the A-133 audit for FY2006 and the
overall plan for the FY2007 audit with its external auditors, Pricewaterhouse-Coopers
(PWC). This portion of the meeting was also attended by, Dave Morlock, University of
Michigan Hospitals chief financial officer, and PWC partners John Mattie, Richard
Stover, and William Stulginsky. The committee also received the bi-monthly internal
audit report and met privately with internal auditor Carol Senneff.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. In Regent Taylor's
absence, Regent Newman reported that the committee, comprised of she and Regent
Darlow, reviewed salaries and compensation, received an update from Provost Sullivan
on the status of ongoing dean searches, and also discussed with Vice President Krislov
the idea of establishing an institutional conflict of interest policy. The committee also
discussed possible topics it might pursue over the course of the next year.

265



March Meeting, 2007

The Regents then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of February 15, 2007.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report, the
Plant Extension Report, and the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report. Vice President Forrest submitted the Report of Projects
Established, February 1 - February 28, 2007.
University of Michigan Health System. There was no report from the University
of Michigan Health System.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper reported that MSA would be
holding elections next week for officers for the coming year. She thanked current
president Nicole Stallings for her service, noting that she would be graduating next
month, and praised of her accomplishments as MSA president.
Vice President Harper also described measures that University Housing takes to
ensure the safety of students living in residence halls, in light of the recent apparent
murder of EMU student Laura Dickinson in a residence hall at Eastern Michigan
University and the sexual assault of a UM student on a campus-area street. She
described the educational, advocacy, crisis intervention, and mental health services in
place at the University to deal with sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, and
domestic violence.
Vice President Harper also described the safety mechanisms in the University
residence halls that limit access by nonresidents, and noted that halls and apartments are
patrolled by security officers on a 24-hour schedule, and that each hall is assigned a
dedicated safety officer every evening. Staff also continually promote safety and
security awareness among students. Recent life safety and fire safety improvements in
the residence halls have also led to reduction in crime and a safer residence hall
environment.
Vice President Harper commented that the request for approval of the 2007-2008
residence hall and Northwood Community Apartments rates is being withdrawn from
the March agenda. However, a project requesting major renovations to Stockwell Hall
is being submitted for consideration.

associate research scientist in 1990 and research scientist in 2003. Since 1990, he has
also held an additional appointment as a lecturer.
Dr. Hughes is best known for his work in the numerical simulation of jet flows in
extragalactic objects. His success in computing theoretical models for relativistic jets in
active galactic nuclei provided quantitative agreement with structure and polarization
measurements in observed sources, and quickly convinced workers in the field of the
importance of internal shocks in these high speed relativistic flows. He went on to
develop computer algorithms which permit hydrodynamic calculations involving
shocks when the flows are highly relativistic. This was an important advance in the
understanding of the relativistic flows in the jets of active galactic nuclei. He also has
made significant contributions to the statistical analysis of variable phenomena.

APRIL MEETING, 2007

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
April 19, 2007
The Regents convened at 3:10 p.m. in the Regents Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Vice President Harper, Acting Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice President
Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Interim Vice
President Peterson, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent Taylor was absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order.  She commented that the
University shares the sorrow and disbelief of colleagues and students at Virginia Tech
University in the wake of the horrific tragedy that had occurred earlier in the week on
that campus. She noted that the University takes many steps as an institution to
discourage and prevent violence and dangerous behavior and works continually to
identify the best practices for preventing and responding to any public health or safety
crisis. There are also many campus resources available to students, faculty, and staff.
She asked the assembly to pause for a moment of silence in memory of the victims.
President Coleman highlighted the first ever student housing facility on the Flint
campus and the 2007-2008 residence hall rates that are to be considered at this meeting.
She also noted that as part of the on-going Residential Life Initiative, Stockwell Hall is
to be closed beginning in the summer of 2008 for a deep renovation.
Presentation: Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies
President Coleman introduced Janet Weiss, dean of the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies. Dean Weiss gave a presentation describing the graduate
school and its role in supporting the University's graduate education program. She
noted that of the approximately 14,000 graduate and professional students at the
University, about half are in Rackham programs. She explained that the graduate
school serves as an umbrella organization that works collaboratively with the various
faculties to ensure that students have a first rate experience at Michigan. It provides a
policy framework that insures consistency across programs in different disciplines,
provides basic administrative support for graduate programs, and provides support for
students.
Dean Weiss described the important contributions made by graduate students in
the areas of research, teaching, and faculty recruitment and retention. She pointed out
that the University invests many resources in preparing graduate student instructors
(GSIs) for their roles as faculty members, and that as a result, these GSIs offer some of
the most innovative and exciting instruction on the campus. Dean Weiss reported that
Rackham has an excellent record of placement for the graduates of its programs. The

287



April Meeting, 2007

main focus of the school's fundraising efforts is to provide financial support for
graduate students.
Among the school's challenges are the change in the mix of international
applications since 9/11, the intense competition for the best students both in the U.S.
and abroad, and the need to alter selection criteria for certain scholarships in the wake
of the passage of Proposal 2. She explained that the school is taking active steps to
develop the pipeline for potential students in the U.S. and abroad.
Benefits Update
President Coleman called on Associate Vice President Laurita Thomas to present
the annual update on the University's benefits programs. Ms. Thomas described the
benefit strategies and principles involved in choosing which programs to offer and
reviewed policy changes and results of strategies implemented in 2005 and 2006. She
noted that the Michigan Healthy Community Initiatives, launched in 2006, are aimed at
creating a culture of health within the University. She noted that the shift to generic
drugs has resulted in a savings of millions of dollars. Vice President Thomas reported
that the University is committed to solving the challenge of finding a legal way to
provide same sex domestic partner benefits for its employees.
Ms. Thomas said that the University has stayed below national trends in health
insurance rate increases for the last several years, but the rates are now beginning to
climb, which is a major concern. Over the next several years, the focus will be on
exploring multiple strategies to manage future benefit cost increases, and decisions in
this area will be driven by the commitment to a culture of health, as developed by the
Michigan Healthy Community initiative.
It was noted that the savings derived from generic drug incentives are likely to
improve as generic versions of popular prescription medications become available.
Environmental and Energy Initiative
Associate Vice President Hank Baier reported that while the University has done a
lot of work in recent years to improve efficiency and implement energy conservation
measures, more needs to be done. To that end, he was announcing a six-point plan to
improve environmental performance.  This plan emerged from   the President's
Environmental Task Force, co-chaired by Deans Bierbaum and Kelbaugh, that was
charged with planning for the University to develop a more sustainable future. The
six-point plan would engage the entire University community and would reduce our
energy footprint.
Mr. Baier noted that the University had received a number of national awards and
recognition for its environmental and energy conservation performance, and that a
major incentive for conserving utilities is to reduce the costs of natural gas, electricity,
and water and sewer. Every year, the University identifies energy conservation
measures that would provide on-going savings in these areas, and recently the Institute
for Social Research (ISR) conducted a pilot study on energy behavior of faculty, staff,
and students in four buildings. This study concluded that through behavioral changes,
there is a potential for significant energy savings.

288



April Meeting, 2007

Mr. Baier described a six-point plan for achieving energy savings, which includes
the following commitments:
1.   Preparation of an annual fiscal year environmental and energy report which will
examine energy consumption trends, research activities and operations efforts;
2.   Increased efforts to purchase electricity produced from renewable sources;
3.    Maintenance and expansion of alternative transportation options;
4.    Strengthening of procurement offerings to ensure that environmentally friendly
products are prominently promoted;
5.   Increased attention on construction and renovation projects to improve energy
efficiency;
6.    Creation of "Wolverine Teams," consisting of operations and facilities management
personnel who would engage building occupants in specific efforts to improve energy
and environmental conservation. Teams would be activated in 30 buildings per year
for each of the next 3 years.
Mr. Baier noted that every 1% in energy savings yields a cost saving of $600,000
to the General Fund. He said that a project manager will be hired to coordinate the
Wolverine Teams, and that a pilot project, which will include the Fleming
Administration Building, will begin over the summer.
There was a discussion about various energy conservation issues in buildings
around campus. It was noted that an awareness and a culture around these issues needs
to be developed on campus, along with insight into how individual buildings are used
by their occupants. Regent White commended Mr. Baier, Executive Vice President
Slottow, and their associates, for their efforts in these areas.
Committee Reports
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. In Regent Taylor's
absence, Regent Darlow reported that the committee reviewed faculty recruitment and
retention efforts, and while the committee appreciates the challenges in this area, they
are pleased with the success of the efforts. The committee also considered a more
regularized format for its meeting agendas.
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent McGowan, chair of the
committee, reported that all committee members were present.       The committee
reviewed the Athletic Department 5-year strategic operating and capital plan with
Athletic Director Bill Martin and Chief Financial Officer Jason Winters, and the
department is doing very well. Next, the committee met with Associate Vice President
Peggy Norgren and internal audits director Carol Senneff regarding implementation of

meeting of March 15, 2007.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report and
the Plant Extension Report. He also submitted the Regents Report on non-competitive
purchases over $5,000 from single sources for the period December 16, 2006 through
March 15, 2007, and the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report.

University of Michigan Health System. There was no report from the University

Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper introduced Zach Yost,
newly-elected president of the Michigan Student Assembly, and Mohammed Dar, vice
president.
Vice President Harper also called attention to the request for approval of the
residence hall and Northwood Community Apartment rates for 2007-2008. She noted
that the rates for the former reflect general cost increases including inflation, an amount
for annual capital improvements, and a percentage directed toward the Residential Life
Initiative, and for the latter, will be dedicated mostly toward facility enhancement. In
recognition of the effect that cost increases have on students and families, the request
has been set at the minimum amount needed to maintain the facilities and to continue
ongoing programs.

that the Virginia Tech tragedy had on the Dearborn campus community. This included
a review by campus leadership of emergency procedures in order to learn from the
experience in Virginia.

number of activities the assembly has planned for the coming year, including a
leadership training program, working with the City of Ann Arbor about the leasing
process for off campus student housing and campus safety, and addressing other
campus issues as they arise. He commented on the assembly's commitment to fiscal
responsibility, and expressed support for the campus's commitment to diversity.
Finally, he noted that MSA had scheduled a vigil for the following night in
remembrance of the Virginia Tech tragedy.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted four faculty retirement
memoirs.
Marylee Dalton, A.M.L.S., librarian in the Law Library, will retire from active
faculty status on April 27, 2007.
Ms. Dalton received her A.B. and A.M.L.S degrees from the University of
Michigan in 1969 and 1970, respectively. She joined the University of Michigan
faculty in January 1972 as a librarian III in the Law Library, and was promoted to
assistant librarian in September 1972, associate librarian in 1973, senior associate
librarian in 1977, and librarian in 2001.
Throughout her career, Ms. Dalton's excellence and expertise in cataloging the
most complex material, including rare books and incunabula, has served the Law
Library's patrons, and especially the students, faculty, and staff of the Law School, by
enabling them to easily find material in this large, complex library through its online

302



April Meeting, 2007

catalog. Recently, she helped plan the project for reclassifying the entire Law Library
collection into the Library of Congress subject arrangement classification system.
Ms. Dalton twice served as interim head of the technical services department, in
1998 and again in 2003-04. As interim head, she demonstrated leadership and
management skills that helped the library move through difficult periods of transition.
She has been a member of the American Library Association and the American
Association of Law Libraries.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Marylee
Dalton librarian emerita.
Jack R. East, Ph.D., research scientist in the College of Engineering, retired from
active faculty status on November 30, 2006.
Dr. East earned his B.S.E., M.S.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering at
the University of Michigan in 1969, 1970, and 1986, respectively. He began his career
at the University of Michigan in 1974 as a senior research associate in the Department
of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In 1979 he joined the faculty as an
assistant research scientist and was promoted to associate research scientist in 1982 and
research scientist in 1993. He also held appointments as a lecturer in 1977 and 1984.
Dr. East is a highly talented and productive scientist. His research focused on
microwave and millimeter wave semiconductor devices, and he has made outstanding
contributions in these areas that have resulted in semiconductor devices that have
pushed the limits of performance. His innovative work led to a metal semiconductor
field effect transistor with the highest maximum oscillation frequency. He was also a
major contributor to the development of nonlinear models for devices used in
microwave and millimeter wave electronics. Most recently, he explored devices for
mobile communications and computing, where low power consumption is a critical
requirement for long battery life.  He played a central role in several large,
multi-disciplinary, research centers that focused on low power electronics for mobile
communication systems and low energy communication systems.
In an unusual role for a research scientist, Dr. East served as the sole supervisor
for a number of graduate students. An excellent mentor, he served on more than 15
Ph.D. committees and helped many students grow into mature researchers. He taught
courses on microwave semiconductor devices, solid state device fabrication laboratory,
and microwave circuits and co-authored numerous articles and book chapters. He has
made important contributions to the research and educational programs in the
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
The Regents salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Jack R. East
research scientist emeritus.
Stephen A. Ernst, Ph.D., professor of cell and developmental biology in the
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on February 28, 2007, after a most
productive career.
A native of New York, Professor Ernst received his A.B. degree from Brown
University in 1962, his M.S. degree from Syracuse University in 1964, and his Ph.D.
degree from Brown University in 1968. Following completion of postdoctoral studies
at Rice University (1968-71), he was a faculty member at Temple University School of
Medicine from 1971-78. Professor Ernst joined the faculty at the University of
Michigan as associate professor in the Department of Anatomy in 1978, and was
promoted to professor in 1981.

303



April Meeting, 2007

Professor Ernst taught medical histology and dental histology throughout his years
at Michigan. He was the course director of the department's graduate level cell biology
course from 1981-2003. During that time, the course grew in popularity from an
enrollment of a few students in 1981 to 30-40 students throughout the mid-eighties to
mid-nineties. After being chosen as one of three core courses for incoming graduate
students in the Medical School's Program in Biomedical Science (PIBS), the enrollment
grew to 80 students.
During much of his career, Professor Ernst's research focused on structural and
functional aspects of electrolyte transport in renal epithelium and in osmoregulatory salt
secretory tissues. He developed the first cytochemical method for the microscopic
localization of the sodium pump at the light and electron microscopic levels. His
laboratory carried out extensive physiological and morphological studies on salt
secretion and its regulation, using the osmoregulatory avian salt gland as a model salt
secretory tissue. In more recent years, his research has focused on localization of
proteins involved in regulation of vesicular trafficking and targeting to the plasma
membrane, and of digestive enzyme secretion in exocrine pancreas. Professor Ernst has
served on the editorial boards of the American Journal of Physiology: Cell Physiology
and the Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry, and has published 95 papers and
review articles in peer-reviewed journals.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated service
by naming Stephen A. Ernst professor emeritus of cell and developmental biology.
Barbra Morris, D.A., senior lecturer in English, Residential College, and senior
lecturer in English, Sweetland Writing Center, College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts, retired from active faculty status on October 31, 2006.
Dr. Morris received a B.A. degree from the University of Delaware in 1956, and
M.A. and D.A. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1970 and 1974,
respectively. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as a teaching assistant in
1973 and was promoted to lecturer in 1974, lecturer II in 1994, lecturer III in 1997, and
lecturer IV in 2003.
Dr. Morris taught in the Department of English Language and Literature and the
Residential College for thirty-two years. She was among the founding faculty of the
English Composition Board and helped to build programs in writing across the
curriculum as the English Composition Board became the Sweetland Writing Center.
She served as associate chair of the English Composition Board from 1978-81. Dr.
Morris was the longest-serving instructor in the Residential College's First Year
Writing Seminar and led the development of a second-semester intensive writing course
for students experiencing difficulties with prose in their first year. She also taught
courses in her field of specialization, the analysis of television news, in the Department
of Communication and the Residential College. She was an exemplary classroom
teacher who received consistently high evaluations, and was much beloved by her
students. Dr. Morris was the recipient of the LSA Excellence in Education Award
(1994) and the Matthews Underclass Teaching Award (1999), and in 2002, in
recognition of her superlative teaching and other contributions, she was awarded a
Senior Lectureship by the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
An active scholar, Dr. Morris' books include a study of disciplinary perspectives
on thinking and writing and a handbook for teaching writing in the disciplines. She has
published forty articles, mainly on the analysis of television news, and has presented

304



April Meeting, 2007

over eighty conference papers on four continents. She was a fellow at the East/West
Center of the University of Hawaii and directed the University of Michigan's Study
Abroad Program in Dublin. She has lectured widely in the United States and at
universities in England, Germany, Ireland, France, Ghana, and Hong Kong. She was a
Fulbright Scholar from 1992-93, and worked for many years with English teachers at
Mackenzie High School in Detroit helping to develop writing programs.
The Regents salute this distinguished teacher and scholar by naming Barbra
Morris senior lecturer emerita in English.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill announced that Barbra Morris, whose
retirement memoir appears in this month's agenda, had died earlier this month. A
memorial statement will be included with next month's agenda. She submitted
memorial statements for Saroja Adusumilli, clinical assistant professor of radiology,
and Andrew Ladd, assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science.
Regent McGowan noted that Frank Allen, dean emeritus of the Law School, had
died 10 days ago, and commented on the extraordinary service he had provided to the
University of Michigan as well as to other law schools and the legal profession.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Saroja Adusumilli, M.D., clinical assistant professor of radiology in the
Medical School. Dr. Adusumilli died on Saturday, March 3, 2007, in a motor vehicle
accident.

April Meeting, 2007

As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our heartfelt
condolences to her parents, Drs. Surendranath and Swatantra Adusumilli, and her sister,
Kalyani Sundararajan.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Andrew Ladd, Ph.D., assistant professor of electrical engineering and
computer science in the College of Engineering, who passed away March 4, 2007 at
University Hospital in Ann Arbor. He was 28.
Professor Ladd received his B.Sc. degree from McGill University, Quebec,
Canada in 2000, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Rice University, Houston, Texas
in 2003 and 2006, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in
December 2006 as a visiting research scientist December 1, 2006 and was appointed
assistant professor on January 1, 2007.
As a new faculty member in the College of Engineering, Professor Ladd was on
the threshold of an outstanding career in which he was poised to make great
contributions. His research focused on algorithmic robotics, which broadly studies how
computers reason physical systems. This field is inherently multi-disciplinary, using
and developing tools from algorithms, artificial intelligence, computational geometry,
graphics, numerical computing, and systems. Professor Ladd authored or coauthored
20 papers, had several invited papers and talks, and was a reviewer on numerous
conference, workshop and transactions publications.
Throughout his academic career, Professor Ladd was known by peers, mentors,
and faculty as a man of inventive intellect, keen wit, outstanding intelligence and
overwhelming kindness, who approached everything he did with passion and intensity.
He was an extremely gifted computer scientist whose intellectual drive and humor were

UM-Flint Student Housing Facility
Acting Chancellor Jack Kay reported that faculty, staff, and community members
have been working with the architect and University facilities staff to create a
functional, attractive design that will create a pleasing green space on the site of what is
now a parking lot. He said, "I am very sorry that Chancellor Juan Mestas could not be
here, as it was his outstanding leadership and his total and absolute passion for the
UM-Flint that has made this possible."
Executive Vice President Slottow introduced Gene Carroll, principal with
Neumann/ Smith & Associates, who presented the design. Mr. Carroll displayed
diagrams of the site plan and of the footprint of the structure on the site. He noted that
it will be a four-story building with one primary entrance that will incorporate safety
features for building access and monitoring. He reviewed the floor plans, noting that
each 4-bed suite (either 4 bedrooms or 2 bedrooms) would include bathrooms, kitchen,
and common area. The building will also include function areas, study areas, and
multipurpose space. He displayed renderings of the exterior of the building as it will
appear from the street.

308



April Meeting, 2007

A discussion followed about what "green" standards have been applied to this
building. Mr. Carroll noted that as much as possible is being done in this area within
the limitations of the modest budget. Executive Vice President Slottow commented that
energy efficiency measures are built into the University's standards for any new
construction. Mr. Baier noted that a major factor in this project is cost, but that typical
new construction at the University would achieve a LEED rating of "certified," if it
were to undergo the formal certification process.
Regent Maynard observed that the siting of this building will eliminate issues that
had been raised previously about a greenhouse located near the new structure. Regent
Deitch commented that it is a handsome building that will be a major addition to the
campus and the community. He moved the item, "in honor of and reference to Juan
Mestas. I wish he [could have been] with us today because this is his vision and his
baby, and we would not be bringing this motion to approve this building today without
his indomitable commitment and belief that this project will be a catalyst for the health
of the campus and the health of the Flint community. So in honor of Juan, I move
approval." Regent Maynard said, "As someone who lives in the Flint community, I
second the motion." The vote was then taken, and the motion to approve the schematic
design for the UM-Flint Student Housing Facility Project, as presented at the meeting,
was approved unanimously.

in one vote, except for the first, which will be considered separately from the others.
Sublease Agreement and Lease Agreement for property located at 2900 Huron
Parkway
Regent McGowan recused herself from voting on this matter due to a conflict of
interest. Vice President Forrest commented that the agreements for use of this property,
known as "Traverwood," constitute a collaboration between the University of Michigan
and the private sector, establishing a foundation on which to build new biotechnology
companies in Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County, and the region. Twelve thousand square
feet of the property will be dedicated to startup companies under the management of
SPARK, and 24,000 square feet will be used by the University of Michigan Medical
School. On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
approved the following agreements with respect to property located at 2900 Huron
Parkway. They approved an eight-month sublease agreement with Parke, Davis &
Company for approximately 7,000 square feet of this property, to be used as office/wet
lab space for the Department of Pathology. Upon expiration of the sublease agreement,
the Regents approved a five-year lease agreement from Traverwood II LLC for

309



April Meeting, 2007

approximately 34,400 square feet of this property, a portion of which will be utilized as
office/wet lab space for the Department of Pathology. Upon commencement of the
five-year  lease  agreement, the    Regents   approved   a   sublease  agreement for
approximately 12,000 square feet of this property to sublease to SPARK.
Because William C. Martin, a University of Michigan employee, is also an owner
of Traverwood II LLC, and Stephen Forest and Kenneth Nisbet, University of Michigan
employees, are also members of SPARK's executive committee, these agreements fall
under the State of Michigan Contracting with Governmental Employees Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.    The parties to the 2007 sublease agreement are the Regents of the University of
Michigan and Parke, Davis & Company and Traverwood II LLC. The parties to the
lease agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Traverwood II LLC.
The parties to the subsequent sublease agreement (2008-2013) are the Regents of the
University of Michigan, SPARK, and Traverwood II LLC.
2.    The service to be provided is the sublease from Parke, Davis & Company of
approximately 7,000 square feet in a building at 2900 Huron Parkway for eight months,
beginning May 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007, at a monthly rental rate of $0 for
the term. Subtenant (the University of Michigan) is responsible for gas and electric
usage and all other operating expenses, estimated at $11,667.00 per month.
3.    Upon termination of the sublease agreement, the service to be provided is the lease
from Traverwood II LLC of approximately 34,400 square feet in a building at 2900
Huron Parkway for five years, beginning January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2012,
at a monthly rental rate of $35,890.00 for the first year, $35,190.00 for the second year,
$34,469 for the third year, and $55,900.00 for the remaining two years. The University
of Michigan will be responsible for gas and electric usage and all other operating
expenses, estimated at $37,333.00 per month.
4.    Once the five-year lease agreement commences, the service to be provided is a sublease
with SPARK of approximately 12,000 square feet in a building at 2900 Huron Parkway
for five years, beginning January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2012. Under a
separate early termination agreement, Parke, Davis & Company has paid Traverwood II
LLC the base rental rate for the first three years on the SPARK space. SPARK will not
be charged a base rental rate until January 1, 2011. For the remaining two years, the
University of Michigan will charge SPARK a monthly rental rate of approximately
$19,500. SPARK will be responsible for their utility and operating expenses.
5.   In addition, no leasehold improvements will be needed.
6.    The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that William C. Martin, a University of
Michigan employee, is the owner of Traverwood II LLC and Stephen Forrest and

April Meeting, 2007

Approval of the 2007-2008 University Housing Residence Hall and Northwood
Community Apartments Rates
Regent Maynard moved approval of average rate increases of 4.9% for residence
hall room and board and 2.0% for Northwood Community Apartments, as described in the
Regents Communication. Regent Deitch seconded the motion.
In response to a question from Regent Newman, Vice President Harper stated that
there were about 400 vacancies in the residence halls during the current fiscal year, and
she explained the factors that contributed to this. Christine Siegel, senior associate
director for housing services, further explained measures being undertaken to make
students want to return and thereby improve the occupancy rates. These measures include
making improvements in programming and amenities to provide a more attractive
experience for students. She said it is anticipated that the numbers will be down
somewhat next year.
Regent Newman expressed concerns that the University is not competing well with
the private market, and is especially concerned with the prospect of increasing rates in the
face of increased vacancy rates. Vice President Harper said that there is no relation
between the room rates and the vacancy rates. But Regent Newman suggested that the
number of vacancies indicate that the University may not be competing effectively with
the private market and may be pricing itself out of this market.
Vice President Harper responded that it is not possible to solve this dilemma without
making the improvements that the fee increase will allow.
Regent Darlow stated that she supports the increase as being necessary for making
improvements, but she is concerned about the impact of the steady fee increases on
students and their families.
Regent Richner inquired whether discounts for returning upper class students have
been considered; Ms. Siegel responded that our pricing is not set up in this fashion.
However, she noted that students move off campus for reasons other than price,
including a desire to experience the independence of apartment living.
Executive Vice President Slottow observed that over time, the University can adjust
its housing stock to the size of the demand. Regent Deitch said that while he supports the
increase and believes it is necessary for the reasons expressed by Vice President Harper,
he believes the vacancy rate is an interesting statistic that ought to be noted. He noted that
the University's housing stock is old, and is different from what today's students are
expecting and may be willing to pay for. He associated himself with Regent Newman's
remarks about the private sector and pointed out that the problem will only be magnified
once North Quad comes on line, as this will point out the deficiencies in the traditional
halls.
Regent Newman reiterated her belief that raising prices is not the way to solve the
problem of increasing vacancy rates. It was noted that most of the vacancies are in the
North Campus facilities.
The vote was then taken, and the motion to approve the proposed rate increases was
approved, with Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, and White in favor and
Regents Newman and Richner opposed.

degree program in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and the School of
Natural Resources and Environment, to allow faculty to hold joint appointments in the
Program in the Environment.
University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) Washtenaw Community Health
Organization (WCHO) reappointments to the WCHO Board of Directors
Executive Vice President Kelch stated that the WCHO is one of the best examples of
collaboration between county government and a university in the country, and is a
wonderful model of totally integrated health care for the mentally indigent and mentally
disturbed.
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the reappointment of Gene Brown and Michael Dabbs to the
WCHO Board of Directors for the period April 1, 2007-March 31, 2010.
A five-minute break followed.

from the following individuals, on the topics indicated: David Boyle, alumnus, on the

MAY MEETING, 2007

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
May 17, 2007
The Regents convened at 3:10 p.m. in the Music Room, Henry Ford Estate-Fair
Lane, on the campus of the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and
Taylor. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Vice President Harper, Acting Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice President
Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Interim Vice
President Peterson, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent White was absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She thanked Chancellor Little and
colleagues for hosting the meeting, and noted how important a factor the University of
Michigan-Dearborn is in the economic, social, and civic health of southeastern
Michigan. She commented on the extraordinary commencement exercises that had
recently taken place on all three campuses, and on recent recognition received by
faculty members.
President Coleman commented on the extension of the appointment of Executive
Vice President Robert Kelch to 2009, noting that the UM Health System, a $2 billion
enterprise, is one of the most successful academic medical centers in the world and that
his guidance has been essential for its success. She also expressed gratitude to Vice
President Cynthia Wilbanks for being willing to assume the additional appointment of
interim vice president for communications. Finally, she congratulated Vice President
and General Counsel Marvin Krislov on his recent appointment as president of Oberlin
College, and Interim Vice President Julie Peterson on her appointment as vice president
for communications at the University of Chicago.
Resolution in Honor of Julie Peterson
President Coleman recognized Regent Taylor, who read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan salute Julie A.
Peterson as she steps down from her position as interim vice president
for communications on June 8, 2007 to assume the position of vice
president for communications at the University of Chicago.
Interim Vice President Peterson began her University of Michigan
career in 1994 as director of News and Information Services. In July
1998  she  was   appointed  acting  associate  vice president for
communications, and in December 2000 she was appointed associate vice
president for media relations and public affairs. In these roles, she served
as the University's primary spokesperson and senior adviser to the

319



May Meeting, 2007

president and executive officers. She was appointed interim vice president
for communications on February 1, 2007.
Widely viewed as one of the nation's leading academic
communications professionals, Julie has provided critical leadership for
the University throughout a number of formidable challenges. Perhaps
nowhere has the University benefited more from her guidance than in her
contributions to the University's defense of its admissions policies.
Beginning early in the process, and over a six-year period, she coordinated
an extensive, innovative, national public information and awareness
campaign about the importance of diversity in higher education. During
the period of intense public scrutiny surrounding the Supreme Court
rulings, she managed all of the University's communication efforts. This
strategy has become a national model for effective communications
campaigns.
With her cheerful, unflappable demeanor, Interim Vice President
Peterson is a consummate professional whose work, while often done
under the radar, has had a powerful impact on the University, enhancing
its prominence on the state, national, and world stages. The Regents
express their sincere respect and appreciation to Julie A. Peterson for her
service as interim vice president for communications and for her
distinguished, 13-year career at the University of Michigan, and convey to
her all best wishes in her new role.
A round of applause followed. Interim Vice President Peterson responded that it
had been a privilege to represent the University to the public and the media, and that
she treasured every minute of her tenure at the University.
Presentation: UM-Dearborn School of Education
President Coleman introduced Paul Zionts, dean of the UM-Dearborn School of
Education. Dean Zionts noted that the School of Education is committed to the
"scholarship of engagement," with the goals of making a difference in the lives of
children and adolescents and helping solve the problems of Southeast Michigan. He
described some of the collaborative projects and partnerships that faculty members are
engaged in with area school districts and other organizations that further these goals.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent McGowan, chair of the
committee, noted that she and Regent Richner met first with Carol Senneff, executive
director of internal audits, regarding the office's FY08 work plan. They then met with
Steve Schram, director of Michigan Public Media, along with Ms. Senneff and
Associate Vice President Peggy Norgren, regarding the WFUM/WUOM FY2006
external audit. She praised Mr. Schram's accomplishments since having assumed his
position at Michigan Radio last year. The meeting concluded with an update on the
status of the FY 2008 General Fund budget, during which the committee was joined by
the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor reported
that the committee had received an update on various searches that are underway. It

May Meeting, 2007

Professor Campbell is a distinguished scholar of comparative public policy with
particular emphasis on Japan. He has published widely in several languages and has
authored or co-authored numerous books and articles. His research centered attention
on important topics such as budgeting and administration politics in Japan, and he did
pathbreaking work on the politics of the development and implementation of policy
directed toward aging populations in Japan and other countries. His work has been
recognized with numerous awards and honors, including Fulbright-Hays awards in
1976-77 and 1989-90. Professor Campbell was director of the Center for Japanese
Studies from 1982-87, and he played an important role in the Department of Political
Science, within the University, and in the larger scholarly community. Throughout his
career, Professor Campbell remained very dedicated to the promotion of Asian studies,
and maintained a visible and active role in professional associations.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming John C. Campbell
professor emeritus of political science.
Charles R. Cowley, Ph.D., professor of astronomy, College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, will retire from active status on May 31, 2007.
Professor Cowley received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of
Virginia in 1955 and 1958, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of
Michigan in 1963. From 1963-67 he was a faculty member at the University of
Chicago. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1967 as an assistant
professor, and was promoted to associate professor in 1970 and professor in 1977.
Professor Cowley became one of the world's experts on elemental and isotopic
peculiarities in the spectra of stars and their implications for nucleosynthesis. His early,
pioneering analyses of peculiar A stars represented significant contributions to
unraveling the mysteries of their anomalies. Critical to Professor Cowley's success was
not only his deep understanding of model stellar atmospheres and abundance analysis
techniques, but his commitment to a thorough vetting of the basic laboratory
astrophysics data critical to accurate determinations. Among Professor Cowley's more
than 220 publications is a highly regarded textbook, Cosmochemistry. This book is
notable for exploring a wide range of geological and astronomical aspects of chemistry,
as seen in rocks in our solar system and gas chemistry in other galaxies. This type of
broad focus ties together chemical phenomena seen in the Universe.
Professor Cowley has been a member of the National Research Council on Line
Spectra, chair of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group on Ap
Stars, president of the XXIII IAU Colloquium on chemically peculiar stars, and a
member of the Scientific Organizing Committee for IAU Commission 29.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Charles R. Cowley
professor emeritus of astronomy.
Ellwood S. Derr, A.Mus.D., professor of music (theory) in the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2007.
Professor Derr received his B.M. degree from the Eastman School of Music at the
University of Rochester in 1954, and his M.M. and A.Mus.D. degrees from the
University of Illinois in 1958 and 1968, respectively. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1962, and was promoted to assistant professor in 1968,
associate professor in 1971, and professor in 1977.
Characterized by his love of all things cultural, his generosity of spirit, and his
ebullient sense of humor, Professor Derr is a highly revered faculty member who has

339



May Meeting, 2007

taught a wide range of undergraduate and graduate students of all musical backgrounds
for over 40 years. He is known for his incredible familiarity with all repertoires, his
deep working knowledge of eighteenth-century compositional, pedagogical and
performance practices, his facility with the contents of historical treatises on many
topics, his extensive expertise in the German language, and his steadfast devotion to his
students.
Many of Professor Derr's compositions, particularly his song cycle, "I Never Saw
Another Butterfly," have been recorded and performed throughout North America and
Europe. He is a frequent lecturer in North America and abroad, and his articles and
essays, many of which concern eighteenth- and nineteenth-century composers'
treatments of preexistent musical materials, have appeared in a wide range of American
and European journals as well as in the new Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.
Professor Derr's critical editions of music, among them Debussy's Piano Trio in G (the
lost autograph of which he discovered), have been published by the G. Henle Verlag of
Munich. This edition of the Trio, which includes a sizeable passage restored by
Professor Derr, has been used frequently for performances and recordings.
The Regents now salute this distinguished professor for his dedicated service by
naming Ellwood S. Derr professor emeritus of music (theory).
Gary D. Fenstermacher, Ph.D., professor of education in the School of
Education, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2007.
Professor Fenstermacher received his B.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Cornell
University in 1961 and 1970, respectively. From 1969-77 he held a number of faculty
and administrative positions at the University of California, Los Angeles, and from
1977-85, he was a professor and administrator at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University. In 1985 he joined the faculty of the University of Arizona, Tucson,
where he served 6 years as dean of the College of Education and was professor of
education until 1996. Professor Fenstermacher joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1996 as professor of education in the School of Education.
Professor Fenstermacher is a philosopher of education whose research interests
include the nature of knowledge and reason in teaching, the moral development of
teachers and learners, and the politics of schooling and teaching.  He is an
internationally recognized scholar and is well known for the exceptional quality and
quantity of his work. He loves to teach, and he teaches with great sensitivity to the
reactions and learning of his students.
Professor Fenstermacher has published extensively in his areas of interest,
authoring more than 125 articles and several books. He is past president of the
American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education and a former senior associate
with the National Network for Educational Renewal.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Gary D.
Fenstermacher professor emeritus of education.
Richard I. Ford, Ph.D., Arthur F. Thurnau Professor, professor of anthropology,

340



May Meeting, 2007

respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1969 as an assistant
professor of anthropology and curator of ethnology. He was promoted to associate
professor of anthropology and appointed associate professor of botany in 1972, and was
promoted to professor of anthropology and professor of botany in 1977. He was
honored with the Arthur F. Thurnau Professorship in 1993. He also served as assistant
director (1972-75) and director (1975-83 and 2002-05) of the Museum     of
Anthropology, chair of the Department of Anthropology (1989-96), and associate dean
for research and computing in the College of LS&A (1987-89).
As one of the world's preeminent ethnobotanists, Professor Ford has made
immense contributions to our understanding of the ways in which native peoples of
North America managed and utilized plants as foods, medicines, and cultural symbols.
Over the years he has produced a remarkable corpus of studies documenting patterns of
plant use by prehistoric Native Americans, and he published a series of landmark papers
that have had a lasting impact on the practice of ethnobotany. Professor Ford is an
outstanding teacher and mentor who taught a wide range of courses, including a
capstone seminar for undergraduate honors students. His many honors include election
to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996, and selection by the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts to deliver the Distinguished Senior Faculty Lecture for
2004-05.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Richard I. Ford,
Arthur F. Thurnau Professor Emeritus, professor emeritus of anthropology, professor
emeritus of botany, and curator emeritus of ethnology.

and was promoted to associate professor in 1997.
Professor Harrington has played a major role in the area of teacher education in
the Educational Studies Program. She has developed key individual courses and
provided guidance in the development of the teacher education programs. Her research
focuses on the pedagogical processes and techniques that are incorporated into
pre-service teacher education programs to provide educational opportunities which

May Meeting, 2007

The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Julian T. Hoff, M.D., the Richard C. Schneider Professor of Neurosurgery
and professor of neurosurgery, and former chair of the Department of Neurosurgery.
Dr. Hoff died on April 16, 2007, at the age of 70, after a courageous battle with acute
leukemia.
Dr. Hoff received his B.S. degree from Stanford University in 1958 and his M.D.
degree from Cornell University in 1962. Following completion of a general surgery
residency and two years of service with the U.S. Army in Japan, he trained at New York
Hospital in neurosurgery, completing that program in 1970. His first academic position
in neurosurgery was at the University of California-San Francisco, where he quickly
rose to the rank of professor. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1981 as
professor of neurosurgery and head of the Section of Neurosurgery.
Dr. Hoff's outstanding academic background included research fellowships at the
Cardiovascular Research Institute at the University of California-San Francisco and at
the Institute of Neurological Sciences at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. He had a
long interest in cerebral circulation and metabolism, focusing on intracerebral
hemorrhage. Dr. Hoff received research funding from the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) continuously since 1971, and was honored
twice by NINDS with the Senator Jacob Javitz Award.
Under Dr. Hoff's leadership, the neurosurgery section evolved from a section in
the Department of Surgery with 3 neurosurgeons, to an independent department in the
Medical School with 14 full-time clinical faculty and five research faculty. Throughout
his tenure, Dr. Hoff gained a reputation for providing the best patient care, assembling
the finest faculty, and training the most talented neurosurgeons. He was elected to the
Institute of Medicine in 1999, was president of the American Association of
Neurological Surgeons (AANS) (1993-94), and received the Cushing Medal from
AANS in 2001. He was an Honored Guest of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons,
and a recipient of the Grass Prize from the Society of Neurological Surgeons.
As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our heartfelt
condolences to his wife of 45 years, Diane; his three children, Paul (Donna) Hoff,
Allison Hoff, and Julia (Michael) Haughey; and his five grandchildren, Lauren Hoff,
Kiersten Hoff, Kathryn Haughey, Kelly Haughey, and Charles Haughey.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Barbra Morris, senior lecturer in English, Residential College, and senior

Dr. Morris received her B.A. degree from the University of Delaware in 1956, and
her M.A. and D.A. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1970 and 1974,
respectively. She taught in the Department of English Language and Literature and the
Residential College for thirty-two years. She was among the founding faculty of the
English Composition Board and helped build programs in writing across the curriculum
as the ECB became the Sweetland Writing Center. She was the longest-serving
instructor in the Residential College's First Year Writing Seminar and led the
development of a second-semester intensive writing course for students experiencing
difficulties with prose in their first year. She also taught courses in her field of
specialization, the analysis of television news, in the Department of Communications
and the Residential College. She was an exemplary classroom teacher, much beloved

348



May Meeting, 2007

by her students. She received the LSA Excellence in Education Award (1994) and the
Matthews Underclass Teaching Award (1999), and was honored with an appointment as
senior lecturer in 2002.
Throughout her career, Dr. Morris was an active scholar in the areas of writing and
the analysis of television. Her books include a study of disciplinary perspectives on
thinking and writing, and a handbook for teaching writing in the disciplines. She
published forty articles, mainly on the analysis of television news, and gave more than
eighty conference papers--on four continents--on the media, television news, and
writing. She was a fellow at the East/West Center of the University of Hawaii and
director of the University of Michigan's Study Abroad Program in Dublin. She was
active in the development of writing programs for secondary education, working for
many years on a Ponting Foundation grant with English and journalism teachers at
Mackenzie High School in Detroit.
Dr. Morris's deep commitment to her students, her cheerful good humor, her
spirited love of travel, and her determined defense of principle were contagious. Her
courage and abiding love of life had a profound effect upon her wide circle of friends
and colleagues, who join with her three sons Kevin, Kyle, and Keith in thanking her for
teaching us so much for so many years.

further develop it and use it internally. No use of University services or facilities, nor
any assignment of University employees, is obligated or contemplated under the
agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees and indemnification apply, and the
contract may be amended by consent of the parties. University procedures for
approval of these changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest review
will be done as appropriate.
3.   The pecuniary interest of Dr. Almantas Galvanauskas arises from his ownership
interest in Arbor Photonics, LLC.
Patent Option Agreement between the University of Michigan and Uptech, Inc.
The Regents approved an option agreement with Uptech, Inc., for licensing of the
technology "Biphasic Nanoparticles" (File No. 2932). Because Professor Joerg Lahann
is both a University of Michigan employee and a partial owner of Uptech, Inc., this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:

Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and Lycera, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Richner, the Regents
unanimously approved a research agreement with Lycera. Regent McGowan did not
participate in the vote due to a conflict of interest. Because Gary Glick, Anthony
Opipari, and James Ferrara are University of Michigan employees and are also partial
owners of Lycera, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.   The following    information  is provided   in  compliance with    statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Lycera, Inc.
2.   The terms of the proposed agreement will conform to University policy. Dr. Anna
Mapp, associate professor of chemistry, who has no financial interest in the company,
will direct the project over an initial six month period at an estimated cost of $25,656.
The agreement will include a provision allowing extension and modification of the
project upon mutual agreement of the parties.
3.   The project does not involve human subjects.
Museum of Anthropology Deaccession of Two Collections of Botanical Materials
Vice President Forrest informed the Regents that the University of Michigan
Museum of Anthropology was in possession of two collections of botanical materials that
had been obtained from two rock shelter sites in Kentucky. It has been determined that
these collections do not legally belong to the museum, and the museum intends to
deaccession the materials and return them to the University of Kentucky.
Non-tenure-track Clinical Appointment Sequence in the Gerald R. Ford School of
Public Policy
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved a non-tenure-track clinical appointment sequence in the Gerald R.
Ford School of Public Policy, as described in the Regents Communication.

JUNE MEETING, 2007

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
June 21, 2007
The Regents convened at 3:15 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White.
Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Harper,
Acting Chancellor Kay, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,
Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Vice President Forrest and Executive Vice President Kelch were absent. Regent
McGowan was absent except as noted below when she joined the meeting by telephone.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order.
Survival Flight incident. President Coleman commented that on June 4, 2007 the
campus had experienced a tragedy "unlike any we have known in our history:" the loss
of all six members of a Survival Flight transport team. "That six people would perish
while on a lifesaving mission," she stated, "makes the loss almost incomprehensible."
President Coleman said that the Survival Flight loss calls attention to the many
high-risk steps that are taken by many individuals to extend life to another human
being, and also reminds us of the importance of organ donation. She asked people to
remember the lost men, Dr. David Ashburn, a resident in thoracic surgery; Richard
Chenault, a transplant donation specialist with the UM Transplant Program; Dennis
Hoyes, a Marlin Air pilot; Rick Lapensee, a transplant donation specialist; Bill Serra, a
Marlin Air pilot; and Dr. Martin Spoor, a cardiac surgeon on the University faculty.
She noted that a campus-wide memorial service is being planned.
President Coleman called on Regent Maynard, who read the following statement:
Statement by the University of Michigan Board of Regents
The Regents of the University of Michigan express their profound sadness at
the death of the six men who perished on June 4, 2007 while on a Survival Flight organ
procurement mission for the University of Michigan Transplant Center.
David Ashburn, M.D., Richard Chenault II, Rick Lapensee, Martinus (Martin)
Spoor, M.D., Dennis Hoyes, and Bill Serra were extremely dedicated professionals
whose death during a mission to save a life brings grief to the entire University of
Michigan community. With condolences coming in from across the United States and
around the world--from Sri Lanka, Sicily, Germany, Africa, India, Australia, and
Canada-this tragedy shed light on the profound impact these selfless professionals
have made by devoting their careers to serving their fellow human beings.
As the Regents mourn the loss of these members of our University family, we
take comfort in the knowledge that their legacy will be carried forward through the
efforts of their colleagues in the Cardiovascular Center, the Transplant Center,
Survival Flight, and the entire Health System. These fallen heroes were leaders. And
they were the best.

355



June Meeting, 2007

President Coleman called for a moment of silence to honor the Survival Flight
crew.
President's Opening Remarks. President Coleman commented that in the eight
months that have passed since she issued a challenge to donors to increase our level of
need-based aid, more than 3,500 donors have contributed over $12 million in student
aid. When combined with matching gifts from the President's Office, an additional
$24.4 million in aid has been made available for students. Additional funding and
matching gifts have enabled the creation of 20 new endowed professorships.
President Coleman also commented about the University's innovative new
Spanish language podcasts that provide broadcasts of health news that can be
downloaded from the Internet.
Public Comments on Agenda-Related Topics
The Regents heard comments from the following people, all on the topic of the
Michigan Stadium expansion and renovation project: Jeff Cohen, alumnus, John
Leppiaho, alumnus, Stan Edwards, alumnus, James S. Reece, faculty, and Mark Pascoe,
alumnus.
Presentation: College of Engineering
President Coleman called on David Munson, Jr., Robert J. Vlasic Dean of
Engineering. Dean Munson noted that the college has about 5,000 undergraduate
students and about 2,500 graduate students. He said the intense competition for
recruitment of under-represented minority students and women makes it difficult to
achieve desirable numbers of these students. He reviewed enrollment by program,
noting that the fastest growing disciplines are biomedical, mechanical, industrial, and
aerospace engineering. He pointed out that computer engineering and computer science
enrollments have dropped in recent years, but are starting to rebound.
Dean Munson commented that all but one of the college's programs are in the top
10 nationally, and the University is also one of the top 5 or 6 nationally in terms of
degree output. He also noted that the majority of the college's revenues are derived
from grants and contracts and tuition and fees, with only 6.5% from the State of
Michigan.
Dean Munson described some of the college's new, sophisticated facilities, and
discussed some of the many large, interdisciplinary student teams that work on
competitive projects. He pointed out that these student project teams are being
expanded to include low cost projects for the Third World and projects for local social
service agencies, and to include projects that will involve students from outside the
College of Engineering. He also reported on international partnerships that have been
developed with a number of international institutions, noting that enrollment in these
programs has increased 256% over the past five years.
Dean Munson commented on the extensive research efforts of engineering faculty
and described several new and proposed research initiatives, including the possible
development of health engineering as a research focus. He called attention to efforts
being made to enhance the college's technology transfer activities. Finally, Dean
Munson reported that the College of Engineering is collaborating with the deans of the
School of Music, Theatre & Dance, College of Art and Design, and School of

356



June Meeting, 2007

Architecture and Urban Planning on the design of a major new project for the North
Campus, with the goal of creating a new environment for that area.
Financial Aid Overview
Provost Sullivan gave a presentation about undergraduate financial aid on the Ann
Arbor campus. She noted that there are federally-funded grants, work-study programs,
student loans, and private loans with interest rates subsidized by the federal
government. The General Fund budget for 2006-2007 includes almost $60 million for
financial aid (mostly need-based), and the schools and colleges have an additional $30
million (mostly merit-based). Financial need is determined by a federal formula that is
prescribed by Congress and used by every educational institution.  The formula
incorporates the "cost of attendance" and the "expected family contribution," and
"financial need" is determined by subtracting the expected family contribution from the
cost of attendance.
Provost Sullivan pointed out that the Board of Regents has mandated that the
University meet the full demonstrated financial need of all resident undergraduate
students who apply on time and accept the entire financial aid package, and the
University attempts to maintain a good balance between the amount of grant aid and
loans in a student's package.
The presentation was temporarily suspended at this point to allow Regent
McGowan to participate by telephone in the discussion and vote on the Michigan
Stadium Renovation Project.
Michigan Stadium Renovation and Expansion Project
Executive Vice President Slottow reviewed the history of this project, noting that
the project includes no material changes from the schematic design that has already
been approved, and that the budget remains at $226 million. He said that the seat
counts have been finalized, the number of non-revenue suites has been verified, and
marketing materials, premium seat license documents, and pre-marketing activities have
been completed to verify the price ranges for the premium seats, yielding a net increase
of approximately $600,000 per year in seat revenue. In addition, less debt will now be
necessary to support this project compared to estimates made in November because
there are now $6 million in signed gift agreements, along with an additional $8 million
in equity reserves. Thus the required debt will be reduced by $14 million, reducing the
originally projected annual debt service by about $900,000 in interest per year. He
reiterated that this is a fully self-supporting project, which will enhance the Athletic
Department's ability to address major infrastructure, deferred maintenance, and
building requirements.
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the stadium project and North
Quad project together will create 400 new FTE skilled trades construction jobs.
Together with other recently approved projects, 1700 new FTE construction jobs for
non-University employees will be created over the next three years.
Athletic Director Bill Martin made the following comments:
The Athletic Department is pleased to present the Michigan Stadium
expansion project resolution to let bids and award a contract for your review.
Throughout the multi-year planning and design process, the goals of the stadium

357



June Meeting, 2007

expansion project have remained unchanged: Improve the safety and game day
experience as well as the accessibility for all fans, make the project financially
self-sustaining, and respect the quality, character, and tradition of Michigan Stadium.
As with any large public works project, community input and dialog are
essential elements of our planning process.  The Athletic Department conducted
extensive research when developing the expansion plan, including surveys of fans,
ticket holders, and focus groups, and market research. We will continue to engage and
inform the public as the project moves forward.
As you just heard from Tim Slottow, the financial viability of the expansion
project is sound. The project is financially self-supporting. In fact, over time, revenues
from the new seating will be available to support improvements to other athletic
facilities.  The project will be financed through private donations and Athletic
Department resources, primarily the revenues generated by the new seating. The
expansion will not affect ticket prices for the average ticket holder. The expansion
project addresses the aging infrastructure of the stadium and improves fans' overall
game day experience. The design increases the number and quality of restrooms,
increases the number of concession stands, and adds a greater variety offare, with 44
new points of sale. It more than triples the number of wheelchair-accessible seats,
from 90 to 282, including adding 72 new accessible seats along the west sideline of the
existing bowl, and increases the number of entry and exit points for improved crowd
circulation and safety.
Ifeel a great responsibility toward all current and future Michigan fans. The
expansion project is the best and most financially responsible way to address the
infrastructure upgrades needed. Thank you.
Regent Newman moved to authorize issuing the Michigan Stadium Renovation
and Expansion Project for bids and awarding construction contracts providing that bids
are within the approved budget. Regent Maynard seconded the motion.
Regent McGowan, who had joined the meeting by telephone, requested that
Regent Maynard read her previously-prepared statement into the record. Regent
Maynard read the following comments from Regent McGowan:
I regret missing today's meeting, but if I were with you, I would vote today as
I did last November, in support of the Michigan Stadium renovation and expansion
project recommended to us by the administration.
I understand from each that President Coleman and Athletic Director Martin
have acted on fulfilling the values articulated last fall when, together, they committed
to sharing some of the resources of a successful and financially sound athletic
department to benefit the University's core academic mission. We have learned this
week that the Athletic Department will begin - immediately - to contribute monies to the
president for discretionary uses which she has elected to apply to her M-Pact Program.
This decision will add important additional funds to this major effort to provide
need-based financial aid to a number of the University's most solid students. I am
particularly pleased that this agreement will affect students now.
Additionally, I am gratified that the stadium renovation project will further
bolster resources for our academic mission by generously providing the University
with ample space in the renovated stadium for the president and the provost to engage
the University's devoted friends and supporters.
The discussions about the stadium renovation project have been long and
arduous; the need for some details to be worked out remains. That is for the
administration to see to and I have every confidence that the people involved will do
good work. Our responsibility is to allow this project to go forward - or not. My own

358



June Meeting, 2007

responsibility is to express what I think is the better course for the University. I
support the renovation effort, and wish it and the people directly involved the best.
Regent Taylor noted that Mr. Martin is well aware of issues that have been raised
regarding accessibility in ongoing litigation. He requested that Mr. Martin speak to this
issue so as to reassure the Regents going forward.
Mr. Martin responded with the following comments:
As you know, the University is deeply committed to diversity and to creating a
welcoming environment for all people. Accessibility for persons with disabilities is a
fundamental right. The University's commitment to accessibility is absolute, and long
predates the Americans with Disabilities Act. Every patron who requests accessible
seating in Michigan Stadium is, and has historically, been accommodated. The
Athletic Department's commitment goes beyond ensuring the availability of accessible
seating. Parking is reserved for disabled in close proximity to the stadium, shuttles are
available for patrons with mobility impairments, accessible routes, restrooms, and
concessions are available, and well-trained stadium ushers closely monitor the
accessible seating areas to assist our patrons who have special needs.
The issue of accessibility for Michigan Stadium has been the subject of
considerable and thoughtful discussion within the administration and the members of
the board. The expansion project offers the best opportunity to increase the number,
location, and amenities for accessible seating in the stadium. This has been a priority
from early stages. The expansion design exceeds ADA regulations, and adds 192 new
accessible seats - more than tripling the current number - at some of the very best
viewing locations in the stadium, with elevator access on the new accessible concourse
and covered seating. The expansion project allows us to add 72 new accessible seats
plus 72 new companion seats to the existing bowl, bringing the total number of
accessible seats in just the bowl to 162, plus another 162 companion seats. On the east
side of the stadium, the design adds 24 new accessible outdoor seats, plus companion
seats, and 14 new accessible inside club seats, plus companion seats. There will also
be one accessible seat in every one of the suites.
Repair of the concrete in the bowl has been going on for 16 years and will be
completed this year. The project you have been voting on today is the expansion
project. To be clear, the legal matters to which you refer take place in the context of
the concrete repair in the bowl. The University has developed a plan, apart from the
expansion project, that will enhance accessible seating in the existing lower bowl. The
plan, which offers flexibility despite the structural limitations of the bowl, has been
proposed to the Department of Education and to the litigants in the pending federal
court case.  Because we are in negotiations and have signed a confidentiality
agreement, and out of respect for this process, I cannot go into greater detail at this
time. I am, however, very encouraged by the ongoing discussions we've had with the
Department ofEducation and the plaintiff in the lawsuit.
Regent Darlow made the following statement:
I will vote in favor of this motion. I wish to give a brief explanation of my
reasoning for this vote. I also wish to state publicly the direction that I believe this
University must take with respect to the question of accessibility of the stadium to
persons with disabilities.
Lengthy discussions I have had with athletic and finance department
representatives and extensive information I have reviewed since I took office have
convinced me that the stadium project is sound from a business point of view. While I
have serious reservations about building "luxury boxes" in Michigan's current
distressed economy, I believe that the stadium suites are important to ensuring that the
project will pay for itself

359



June Meeting, 2007

No one disagrees with the University's position that the 80 year old structure
is physically obsolete and needs renovation. Regarding the planned architectural
changes, I respect both the concern of those who fear potential damage to the
treasured qualities of the old and the enthusiasm of those who envision the benefits of
the new. However, I have not found good reason to seek to reopen the basic decisions
that this Board has already made concerning these issues.
Accordingly, I believe that the stadium project should go forward as soon as
possible. One consideration is critical for me: the fact that the stadium project will
create many good jobs. In present times, we should proceed with a sound project such
as this in a timely manner because of the benefits it will create for Michigan workers
and our economy.
In addressing the issue of accessibility of the stadium for persons with
disabilities - wheelchair users, specifically - I am mindful of the legal proceedings
pending before the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Education and in
federal court.  I had hoped, and urged, that a reasonable plan demonstrating
accessibility for persons with disabilities would be presented to the Regents and the
public before our vote today. The administration has decided not to proceed with such
a presentation at this time, for the reasons stated by Athletic Director Bill Martin. I
wish to emphasize that I have spent considerable time speaking with President
Coleman, Director Bill Martin, and others close to the project, and I trust entirely their
personal commitments to accessibility.
Nonetheless, I believe that the Board of Regents has a responsibility to
address the accessibility issue now, as the project moves into the contracting phase, in
order to provide assurance to the public of our commitment to the rights of persons
with disabilities.
One reason for voicing such commitment is that our silence seems likely to
cause misunderstanding and dismay among persons with disabilities and others
committed to their rights and dignity. Certainly, some confusion already exists. On the
one hand, when addressing the desirability of the project as a whole, the University has
made expansive statements about how there will be significant renovations to the
Michigan Stadium, ranging from handrails and wider seats to improved crowd
circulation and safety, which will improve the Michigan Stadium experience for every
ticket holder. On the other hand, when addressing the specific topic of accessibility, it
has sometimes focused on narrow technical issues, such as whether the work to be
done to the existing bowl of the stadium constitutes repairs or triggers the legal
requirements applicable to alterations.
For a great public university that has proven its deep commitment to diversity
time and again, demonstrating its commitment to the rights ofpersons with disabilities
should be second nature. On issues of minority rights, has the University focused on
narrow legal issues? Has it been silent in its support ofsuch rights?
As we go forward with contracts for the stadium, this major public project, let
us assure ourselves and the public that our plans will embrace both the letter and the
spirit of the law. We should do so in furtherance of the public trust we hold. We
should do so in the University's great tradition of generous-hearted and respectful
commitment to diversity.
I hope that my fellow Regents will express their support for this commitment.
Regent Taylor and Regent Maynard expressed support for Regent Darlow's
comments.      Regent Maynard      commented     that she   believes a    commitment to
accessibility should apply to the whole University, not just to the stadium. She thanked
Athletic Director Martin for his recognition that accessibility is a fundamental right.
She observed that the Regents had had more discussion of this project than for any

360



June Meeting, 2007

project she's been involved in, but believes that this is a positive thing. She said that
her original concerns about issues affecting people with disabilities have been allayed
by the thoughtful discussions that have occurred and she is confident that plans will
continue to move forward in a positive way. She therefore stated that she would
support the project, noting that it would "bring wonderful jobs to a tough economy and
will improve the fan experience."
Regent White associated herself with Regent Darlow's comments about
accessibility for people with disabilities. She also pointed out that this project is for the
Athletic Department, not specifically for the football program, and that it is the
responsibility of the Athletic Department, the president, and the administration--not the
football program--to ensure its success.
Regent Newman called the question. The vote was then taken, and the motion was
approved, with Regents Darlow, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and Taylor in
favor, and Regents Deitch and White opposed.
Financial Aid Overview, Continued
Provost Sullivan continued her presentation with an explanation of how financial
aid packages are put together based on expected family contributions. She concluded
that because of the University's need-based aid package, which is based on its
commitment to meet the demonstrated financial needs of all resident undergraduate
students, "It is more affordable to go to the University of Michigan than any other
public university in the state, or any public university in the Big Ten." She noted that
students with greater levels of financial need receive a higher percentage of their
financial aid package in the form of grants than in other loans or other forms of
assistance.
Provost Sullivan reported that the Scholar Recognition Award and the Michigan
Scholar Award have been discontinued as a result of the passage of Proposal 2, but
these have been replaced by two new scholarships, the Michigan Tradition Award and
the Michigan Experience Award. Schools and colleges also award scholarships, which
reduce loan amounts and Work-Study amounts in the package developed by the Office
of Financial Aid.
Provost Sullivan concluded that despite the challenges inherent in continuing to
meet the full need of resident students and the growing unmet need of nonresident
students, the University offers one of the most significant financial aid programs of any
public university in the United States.
Regent White thanked Provost Sullivan for providing a clear understanding of all
of the various aspects of financial aid at the University of Michigan. Regent Taylor
urged the president to educate state leaders and opinion-makers about how the
University meets the demonstrated financial needs of resident students and about other
aspects of the financial aid program.
Regent Darlow observed that despite our financial aid program, students in middle
income categories often end up carrying a heavy debt burden, and she urged officials to
continue to work on improving the ratio between grant funding and debt.

361



June Meeting, 2007

Report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty - Ann Arbor
Campus
Professor Fred Askari, chair of the Ann Arbor Campus CESF, reported that his
committee had met that morning with the Regents' Compensation, Personnel and
Governance (CPG) Committee. Regent Taylor noted that the CPG Committee had
thoroughly reviewed the reports of all three campus committees and had held an
in-depth discussion with the three CESF chairs, and that the committee values this
annual opportunity to review issues raised by the faculty.
Report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty - Flint Campus
Professor Steve Turner, chair of the Flint Campus CESF, commented that his
committee had highlighted the "loyalty tax," or salary compression, affecting long-term
employees, especially full professors. He also noted that salaries for faculty on the
Dearborn campus are higher in all categories than those on the Flint campus, and the
committee would like to see this discrepancy addressed.
Report of the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty - Dearborn Campus
Professor Lee Redding reported on the major concerns of Dearborn faculty, which
include establishing a merit pay pool. He expressed appreciation to the Regents' CPG
committee for reviewing the report and to the Dearborn administration for working with
the committee.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White reported that she and
Regent Richner, along with President Coleman and Executive Vice President Slottow,

Health Centers (UMHHC) budget (with executives Doug Strong and Dave Morlock)
and the FY2008 Athletic Department budget (with Director Bill Martin and Jason
Winters, executive director of business operations). She noted that the UMHHC is in
excellent financial condition, as is the Athletic Department.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor reported
that the committee had spent most of its time meeting with the CESF committees from
the three campuses and then had met briefly with Provost Sullivan for an update on
pending issues.
The Regents then turned to the consent agenda.

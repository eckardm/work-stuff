JULY MEETING, 1994


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, July 14, 1994
The Regents met at 1:15 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power,
Varner, and Waters. Interim Secretary Johnson was also present, as were Executive Vice President Womack, Provost Whitaker, Vice Presidents Cosovich and
Harrison, and Chancellors Kugler and Renick. Vice President Hartford was
absent; Vice President Neal arrived at about 2:00 p.m.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and welcomed Interim
Secretary Harold R. Johnson to the table. He stated that the meeting would
begin with a presentation on revenue and expenditure budgets, then proceed to
the regular business agenda, then to Public Comments. The vote on the budgets
would not occur until after Public Comments.
1994-95 General Fund Operating Budget
Provost Whitaker observed that the budget is actually one of a series of
policy instruments that represent the University's dual objectives of being a first
rate research university of the highest quality which is committed to a quality
undergraduate education, and second, being financially accessible to admitted
Michigan undergraduate students. Annual budgets are simply devices to apply
resources for meeting University and societal challenges and for setting annual
fees consistent with those objectives. He noted that the state, through its appropriations decisions, had decided implicitly in recent years that the proportions of
university costs born by students and parents will increase.
Provost Whitaker reported that over the last four years, units have been
made increasingly responsible for revenues by managing enrollment and being
accountable for costs. Through "innovation by substitution," they are also
expected to fund portions of salary increases and new initiatives by reducing
costs in other areas. During the last four years, major strides have been made in
renovating old buildings and building new facilities, while also making inroads
into deferred maintenance. He described a joint collection strategy with CIC
institutions that will enhance student/faculty access to library materials without
every library having to own every item. He also described several initiatives in
undergraduate education which are beginning to show results.
Provost Whitaker stated that the fundamental budget objectives were to
maintain and enhance the quality of instructional and research programs;
increase the quality of the undergraduate educational experience; maintain and
enhance access for Michigan undergraduates; move toward racial and gender
distributions more closely reflecting their proportions in the population; mount a
reasonable compensation program; increase investment in the maintenance of
the infrastructure and continue to reduce the deferred maintenance backlog; and

provide reserves against potential revenue shortfalls so as to avoid imposition of
mid-year reductions on individual units.
The incremental General Fund revenue budget of $37.1 million (5.5 percent), is comprised of an increase of $6.3 million in state appropriation, $30.4
million in student tuition and fees, $0.0 increase in indirect cost recovery, and
$0.6 million in "other" (primarily interest income on fund balances). The infrastructure maintenance fee, which will not increase, will generate an additional
$0.2 million. The recommended total General Fund revenue budget for FY 94-95
is $708.8 million. Provost Whitaker displayed a graph illustrating the historical
makeup of the General Fund budget, noting that in the proposed 1994-95
budget, 53.0 percent will be funded by student tuition and fees, 37.0 percent by
state appropriation, and 10.0 percent by indirect cost recovery and other sources.
This is in contrast to the situation that had existed prior to about 1990 in which
more than   half of the General Fund budget was derived from        state
appropriation.
Provost Whitaker said that the proposed incremental funding, will be in the
areas of compensation ($12.7 million), student support ($6.8 million), faculty
hiring for diversity ($1.7 million), undergraduate initiatives ($1.8 million),
critical academic needs ($2.9 million), fixed costs ($5.8 million), infrastructure
maintenance ($0.2 million), "pass through" revenue ($2.0 million), and flexible
reserve ($3.2 million).
Regarding tuition and fees, Provost Whitaker noted that other Michigan
public universities had approved increases in tuition and fees ranging from 3.5 to
17.7 percent, while other Big Ten public institutions had approved increases
ranging from 3.5 to 11.0 percent. He also displayed a chart comparing the
increased tuition cost to a Michigan first-year undergraduate at selected national
peer universities, which ranged from a high of $1,994 (Duke University) to a low
of $336 at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus, and showed another
chart comparing the 1994-95 UM tuition cost for a Michigan first-year undergraduate compared to the cost of tuition at other top universities ($5,215 at UM
to a high of $20,100 at MIT).
The recommended student fee rate increase is 6.9 percent for full-time, fullterm resident undergraduates, with special increases for some programs and an
increase of 5.0 percent for all other fill-time, full-term students (exact rates are
detailed in the Regents Communication).
Provost Whitaker explained why the incremental budget of $9.0 million of
proposed new expenditures in excess of inflation is necessary to maintain the
University's intellectual vitality. He pointed out that $9.0 million for academic
and educational programs represents only 1.3 percent of the $708.8 million
budget. About 35.0 percent of the incremental budget is to be used for faculty
and staff compensation, with 65.0 percent for increased student support, operation of new space, specific program improvements, and the creation of a reserve
against revenue shortfalls. Given the modest increase in state support and the
recommended tuition increases which are less than the high levels of recent


2




July Meeting, 1994


years, he concluded that this was a responsible budget and he recommended
approval.
1994-95 UM-Dearborn General Fund Budget
Chancellor Renick stated that the budget priorities for the Dearborn campus
focus on teaching and learning. Expenditures include funding for an additional
three faculty lines, computer technology and literature activity, a modest salary
program of about 2.5 percent, and classroom innovation. Revenue is derived
from state appropriation (47 percent), and tuition (53 percent), with a proposed
tuition increase of 4.3 percent.
1994-95 UM-Flint General Fund Budget
Chancellor Kugler reported that two strong factors motivated the budget for
the Flint campus: 1) a three percent decline in enrollment during 1993-94 and a
projected additional decline for 1994-95, both of which negatively affect tuition
revenue; and 2) the opening of the new Frances Willson Thompson Library,
which will require additional operating funds.
The proposed tuition increase for the Flint campus is 6.3 percent, with a corresponding increase in the General Fund scholarship fund. Chancellor Kugler
indicated that one reason for the enrollment decline is a national decline in interest in the area of business. To offset this, the Flint campus is building its
programs in the health sciences, particularly physical therapy and nursing, which
are the areas experiencing strong student interest. A portion of the additional
revenues will be allocated to the nursing program, as well as an internal reallocation from business areas to nursing, in order to meet student demand.
Comments by President Duderstadt
President Duderstadt observed that the Ann Arbor campus had received the
lowest increase in state appropriation of any of the 15 public institutions (2.2 percent), which has been the case for most of the past 10-15 years. He displayed a
graph illustrating that the state appropriation increase had not exceeded the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the past 8 years. He also displayed charts illustrating the declining share of state appropriations for the University of Michigan
Ann Arbor campus and Michigan State University as compared to the share of
the "Little Twelve" public universities. President Duderstadt also pointed out
that while the state of Michigan ranked significantly below the national average
in state support of public higher education, it ranked first in public support of
private higher education, with almost 10.0 percent of the higher education appropriation budget going to private institutions.
Finally, he observed that while Fortune magazine had recently recognized
Ann Arbor as one of the centers of the knowledge-driven industry that will be
key players in America's economic future, public policy, as represented by higher
education funding trends, is moving in the opposite direction from the future
direction of the state's economy. This has undermined the capacity of the larger
institutions (UM-Ann Arbor, Michigan State, and Wayne State) to play the role
that they are expected to play in Michigan.

July Meeting, 1994


There followed a discussion about the budget proposal and the president's
observations. Provost Whitaker and President Duderstadt responded to comments from Regents Varner and Baker about the nature of the reallocation
process. Regent Baker observed that many attempts have been made to educate
policy makers and citizens about the public policy issues surrounding the higher
education appropriation, and that things haven't changed. President Duderstadt
responded that the appropriations process itself has to be re-examined. In addition, because the state's three research universities will play a key role in the
knowledge-driven economy of the 21st century, the state needs to recognize this
and begin to view these institutions as an investment in its economic future,
perhaps through devices other than the higher education appropriation.
Regent Deitch commented that within the framework of current realities,
the budget proposal was responsible and well-thought-out. He noted that the
state's prison system has benefited financially at the expense of educational institutions, and that citizens need to be aware of the ramifications of "investing in
the failures of our society as opposed to building for our success."
Regent McFee observed that the state has made substantial physical investments in institutions located in areas of minimal population that are having difficulty maintaining an adequate student population, at the same time decreasing
its investment in the research institutions. Meanwhile, the University has relied
increasingly on its own resources to meet its needs, which has increased the
burden on instate students, causing them to carry an ever higher percentage of
the cost of their education. Regent McFee suggested that the Board and the
institution as a whole should focus attention on this problem and see what could
be done to change ito
Regent Power recounted his experience with the Research Excellence Fund
some years ago, in which the legislative process made it politically unfeasible to
allocate to the University of Michigan the percentage of the available money that
corresponded to the amount of its sponsored research compared with that of
other state institutions, which would have equaled about 80 percent of the fund.
This illustrates the political unfeasibility of specifically allocating resources to the
institutions where they would do the most good for Michigan's citizens. Regent
Power also pointed out that although the state currently spends 5 times more per
capita on prisoners than on students in kindergarten through 12th grade, many
citizens believe this is entirely appropriate.
In response to a question from. Regent Power, Chancellor Kugler reported
that there had been a 15 percent decrease in enrollment in business programs in
the last three years, but a dramatic increase in the physical therapy and nursing
programs, with 500 applicants for 36 available slots for the last physical therapy
class. If the number of available openings in physical therapy and nursing
program could have been increased, the campus would not have experienced an
overall enrollment decline. It is very difficult to adjust quickly to changes in
supply and demand on a campus such as Flint with limited physical and
programmatic facilities.

July Meeting, 1994


Further discussion ensued regarding whether the University has been able
to document increased levels of productivity over the past few years, with Provost
Whitaker and Executive Vice President Womack agreeing that certain measures
do indicate that productivity levels have increased.
In response to a question from Regent Brown about the issue of higher education appropriations being allocated to private institutions, President Duderstadt indicated that the amount equals about $110 million. Several of the
Regents pointed out that this practice increases the financial burden on students
who attend the state's public institutions. Regent Power asked that the Regents
be presented with an analysis of the programs by which public funds are allocated to private institutions. Further discussion ensued about the sensitivity of
this issue and its importance in the overall picture of higher education funding.
Regent Deitch pointed out that because major changes in public policy do
not happen overnight, the Regents' responsibility as stewards charged with
maintaining the institution's excellence requires provision of adequate resources
while managing the institution as efficiently and with as much self-reliance as
possible.
1994-95 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
Executive Vice President Womack gave a slide presentation describing the
1994-95 revenue and expenditure operating budgets. He noted that the University's operating budget is comprised of four funds: the General, Designated,
Auxiliary Activities, and Expendable Restricted Funds. The 1994-95 revenue
budget is $2.375 billion; the expenditure budget is $2.250 billion; these figures
represent increases of 5.3 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively. The revenue
budget is made up of the Auxiliary Activities-Medical Fund (40.0 percent); the
General Fund (33.0 percent); the Expendable Restricted Fund (18.0 percent); the
Auxiliary-Other Fund (6.0 percent); and the Designated Fund (3.0 percent).
Executive Vice President Womack displayed diagrams illustrating each revenue fund by source as well as ten-year comparisons of the amount of each fund.
It was noted that revenues from the Auxiliary Activities-Medical fund comprise
63 percent of the entire Auxiliary Activities Fund and about 46 percent of the
entire revenue budget.
Following this presentation, President Duderstadt announced that he would
not call for action on the student fee and operating budget action requests until
after Public Comments. Executive Vice President Womack introduced staff
members on his budget team who had participated in preparing the budget
material.
There followed a ten-minute recess at 2:45 p.m., after which the meeting
reconvened, at 2:55 p.m.
Minutes
May 1994 Minutes. Regent McGowan moved approval of the minutes of
the meeting of May 19 and 20, 1994. Regent Power seconded the motion.

July Meeting, 1994


Regent Baker stated that he did not agree with some of the assertions and
conclusions that were made at that meeting and requested that his suggested
corrections to the minutes be placed on file in the Office of the Secretary of the
University. The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved, with
Regents Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor,
and Regent Baker opposed.
June 1994 Minutes. Regent Deitch moved approval of the minutes of the
meeting of June 16 and 17, 1994. Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it
was approved unanimously.
Consent Agenda
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports of investments, plant extension, litigation, personnel-labor relations, and non-competitive
purchases over $2,000. He responded to comments from Regent Baker about the
Investment Report and the Litigation Report.
Vice President Neal submitted reports of projects established, and summaries of a selection of current research. He announced that the University had received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities for completion
of the Middle English Dictionary Project.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Cosovich reported that due to the
timing of the meeting with the ending of the fiscal year, the Reports of Voluntary
Support for June and for fiscal year 1993-94 would both be submitted at the
September Regents' Meeting. However, preliminary figures indicate that the
year-end total for private gift support will equal $118,700,000 for 1993-94, which
is an all-time record.
President Duderstadt observed that this would be Vice President Cosovich's
last meeting as vice president for development; as of September 1, he would be
assuming the role of deputy to the president. His accomplishments in the area of
development over the past ten years will present an extraordinary challenge for
his successor. Regent Baker expressed gratitude to Vice President Cosovich on
behalf of the Regents for all of his efforts and accomplishments in his role as vice
president for development.
Personnel Actions. Provost Whitaker submitted personnel actions, highlighting recommendations for four distinguished professorships, along with several other personnel actions. Chancellor Kugler noted the recommendation
regarding the David M. French professorship.

Retirement Memoirs. The following retirement memoirs were submitted:
Theodore T. Curtis, assistant professor of sociology at the University of
Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1994, after a distinguished career as a teacher and department leader.
A native of Utah, Professor Curtis received his B.S. degree from the University of Utah in 1951 and his AM. degree from the University of Michigan in
1956. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan-Flint as a lecturer in
1965 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1971.
Professor Curtis has played an important role in the development of diverse
programs on the Flint campus, including sociology, criminal justice, AfricanAmerican studies, and social work. He has been especially effective as a teacher
and student advisor. He served as chair of the Department of Sociology/Anthropology from    1979-82 and served as well on numerous departmental and
University committees.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Theodore T. Curtis assistant professor emeritus of sociology.
Harry A. Douthit, Jr., professor of botany in the Department of Biology,
retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1994, following 27 years of service
at the University of Michigan.


14




July Meeting, 1994


After serving in the U.S. Army from 1956-59, Professor Douthit received his
AB. degree in 1961 and his Ph.D. degree in 1965, both from the University of
Texas. Following three years as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of
Wisconsin, Professor Douthit joined the University of Michigan Department of
Botany as an assistant professor. He was promoted to associate professor in
1973 and professor in 1975.
Immediately upon his arrival at the University, Professor Douthit initiated
the general microbiology course that still forms the core of the undergraduate
microbiology concentration. The courses he has taught range from microbiology
to introductory biology, for both majors and non-majors, to advanced courses in
microbiology and biochemistry.
Throughout his career, Professor Douthit's research interests have centered
on the nature of the bacterial spore and the mechanisms that release and activate
it from dormancy. Beginning with studies of the structure of DNA in bacterial
endospores, Professor Douthit went on to study the capacity of spores for protein
synthesis and the mechanisms by which spores emerge from dormancy. The
results of his research have been published in widely-disseminated, broad-based
journals such as Science.
In 1973, Professor Douthit received the University's Distinguished Service
Award. Other honors include visiting professorships at the Institute for Microbiology in G6ttingen, Germany, and in the Department of Biochemistry at Michigan State University. Professor Douthit's generosity with his time is also
evidenced by his collaborations with colleagues in the Department of Biology, as
well as by his service on a large number of doctoral committees in four different
colleges within the University of Michigan.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his many contributions to
the Department of Biology and the University community by naming Harry A
Douthit, Jr., professor emeritus of botany.
Robert Wo Heywood, professor of history at the University of MichiganFlint, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1994, after a distinguished
career as a teacher, scholar, and department and campus leader.
Professor Heywood received his AB. degree from the University of Massachusetts in 1955 and his M.A and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois
in 1956 and 1959, respectively. He joined the faculty of the University of
Michigan-Flint as an associate professor in 1965 and was promoted to professor
in 1968.
Professor Heywood has inspired many cohorts of students in the study of
history at all levels-from the western civilization survey course to upper division
courses in modern Europe, European intellectual history, German history, and
Russian history. His own interest in contemporary Europe resulted in the publication of the book, European Community: Idea and Reality in 1990 (which is also
being published in Hungarian and Russian). He is currently working on a companion volume, European Community in Its Global Setting.
Professor Heywood's faculty leadership has included work as academic dean
and four terms as chair of the Department of History, as well as service on the
Faculty Assembly, College of Arts and Sciences Executive Committee (three
terms), and on every standing committee of the college.  A voice for the


15




July Meeting, 1994


University, Professor Heywood frequently has brought European history and
contemporary events to community organizations.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service and many accomplishments by naming Robert W. Heywood professor
emeritus of history.
John F. Kolars, professor of Near Eastern studies and geography, retired
from active faculty status on May 31, 1994, after a distinguished career as a
scholar, teacher, and social scientist.
A native of Washington, Professor Kolars received his B.S. and M.A degrees
from the University of Washington in 1952 and 1958, respectively, and his Ph.D.
degree from the University of Chicago in 1963. From 1961-64, he served on the
faculty of Rutgers University. He came to the University of Michigan in 1964 as
an assistant professor of geography; he was promoted to associate professor in
1966 and professor in 1971. In 1981, he received the additional appointment of
professor of Near Eastern studies. From 1984-85, and again in 1989, he served
as distinguished visiting professor at the U.S. Air Force Academy. Since 1977, he
has regularly lectured on the topic, "The Middle East as an Ecosystem," for the
U.S. Department of State Foreign Service Institute.
Professor Kolars is a consummate geographer who has combined scholarship with practical applications. His early works are widely referenced in the
cultural geography literature for both content and methodological example. For
the last two decades, his scholarship has focused on water issues in the Middle
East, especially the Euphrates-Tigris and Litani river basins. Professor Kolars
has offered a neutral voice in this volatile region, allowing him to act as a
go-between on sensitive issues that divide the hostile parties. He is effective in
this turbulent arena because his geographical approach combines deep
knowledge and insight about the area's diverse cultures with an understanding
of the physical and environmental processes that characterize the region.
One of the more memorable teachers in recent University history, his
"Introduction to Geography" course, filled with poetry and performance,
regularly attracted 250-500 students per term, some of them sons and daughters
of former students. As an academic advisor, he helped undergraduates chart
their way through the University, giving humane and personal counsel to each of
them. His contributions in these arenas were recognized by his receiving the
Class of 1923 Teaching Award in 1968 and the Ruth M. Sinclair Award for
student counseling in 1983. His service has enriched the University, and he has
enhanced its best traditions.
The Regents now salute this distinguished geographer for his dedicated
service by naming John F. Kolars professor emeritus of Near Eastern studies
and geography.
Martin L. Norton, M.D., professor of anesthesiology and associate professor of anesthesiology in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, retired from
active faculty status on June 30, 1994, after a long and productive career as a
clinician, teacher, and researcher.
A native of New York, Dr. Norton received his B.S. degree from the College
of the City of New York in 1949, his M.S. degree from the University of North

the University of San Diego Law School and undertook formal legal training,
receiving his J.D. degree from the Suffolk University School of Law, Boston, in
1979. Between 1980-82, Dr. Norton served on the faculties of the Case Western
Reserve University School of Medicine and the Cleveland Marshall School of Law
in Cleveland, Ohio.
Dr. Norton came to the University of Michigan as professor of anesthesiology in 1982, and in 1984, received a second appointment as associate
professor of anesthesiology in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology. He was
admitted to the Michigan State Bar in 1983 and has also been admitted to the
bars of several U.S. district courts and to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Sixth
Circuit. In 1980, he was admitted to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
and in 1984 to the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1987, Dr. Norton
co-founded the University of Michigan Medical Center Difficult Airway Clinic,
which received a commendation for health care innovation from the American
College of Physician Executives in 1992.  Dr. Norton also made major
contributions to the Towsley Center for Continuing Medical Education, where he
organized and taught courses on medical applications of laser physics and
management of the difficult airway. Dr. Norton's special expertise in both medicine and law has achieved national and international recognition. He has
lectured throughout the world and has published extensively in both the medical
and legal literature.
The Regents now salute this distinguished medical educator for his dedicated service by naming Martin L. Norton professor emeritus of anesthesiology
and associate professor emeritus of anesthesiology in the Department of
Otorhinolaryngologyo
Vincent C. O'Keeffe, associate professor of music at the University of
Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1994, after a distinguished career as a teacher, scholar, conductor, performer, and campus leader.
Professor O'Keeffe received his B.Mus. degree from Boston University in
1950 and his AM. and Ed.D. degrees from Columbia University in 1951 and
1969, respectively. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan-Flint as
an assistant professor in 1975 and was promoted to associate professor, with tenure, in 1980.
Professor O'Keeffe's outstanding teaching ability was manifested by the
large number of students who elected to take his courses. He played saxophone
and clarinet for most of his years at Flint, and was a member of the nationally
recognized professional ensemble, "The New Reformation Dixieland Band." He
also conducted the Jazz Ensemble and developed the entire music theory
curriculum.


17

Professor O'Keeffe has published in a broad range of music periodicals and
has arranged music for Dixieland bands and orchestras which has been performed throughout Michigan and in other states. He has served on numerous
University committees and has provided numerous workshops and instrument
clinics for Flint area high schools.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service and many accomplishments by naming Vincent C. O'Keeffe associate professor emeritus of music.
Frank E. Rose, associate professor of physics at the University of
Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1994, after an outstanding career as a teacher and campus leader.
Professor Rose received his B.S. degree from Greenville College in 1949, his
AM. degree from the University of Michigan in 1957, and his Ph.D. degree from
Cornell University in 1965. He joined the faculty of the University of MichiganFlint as a lecturer in 1963 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1964 and
associate professor, with tenure, in 1968.
Professor Rose developed the astronomy program and has been its mainstay
for many years. He has contributed greatly to students' academic, intellectual,
and personal development. Professor Rose has also served his department and
the campus in a wide variety of ways, including service as secretary pro tern of
the UM-Flint faculty during an important reorganization period. He has also
made significant contributions to the numerous professional societies with which
he is affiliated.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by

18




July Meeting, 1994


Vincent G. Zannoni, professor of pharmacology in the Medical School and
professor of environmental and industrial health in the School of Public Health,
retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1994.
A native of New York City, Professor Zannoni earned his B.S. degree in
1951 at the College of the City of New York, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, in
1956 and 1959, respectively, at George Washington University. From 1954-63,
he conducted research at the National Institutes of Health, and in 1963, he
joined the faculty of New York University Medical School in the pharmacology
department. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1974 as a
professor of pharmacology.
While working at the N.I.H., Professor Zannoni made several major contributions in the analysis of the hereditary enzymatic deficiencies underlying the
metabolic disorders of phenylketonuria, alcaptonuria, and histidinemia. He also
discovered a new polyphenol oxidase which seems to be involved in the formation
and deposition of an abnormal pigment in the connective tissues of alcaptonuric
patients.  Professor Zannoni's later research, which was internationally
recognized, focused on the role of vitamin C in drug metabolism. He developed a
chemical method which is still the best available to measure the content of
vitamin C in biological tissues, and his group showed how this vitamin is
involved in the metabolism of alcohol (ethanol) in man. He is currently conducting important, ongoing investigations on the protective effects of vitamin C
against the types of cancer produced by environmental chemicals.
Within the Department of Pharmacology, Professor Zannoni spent many
years directing the graduate program in pharmacology. He was recognized as an
excellent teacher, whose lectures were known for their clarity, superb
organization, and humor. Professor Zannoni has always taken great pride in the
development and accomplishments of his graduate students, many of whom are
now conducting research in the pharmaceutical industry and in academia.
Professor Zannoni enjoys an international reputation as a productive
scientist, a devoted and caring teacher, and a distinguished editor, who has
brought credit to the Department of Pharmacology and the University of
Michigan.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and noted scientist by
naming Vincent G. Zannoni professor emeritus of pharmacology.
Memorials. No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees. Provost Whittaker submitted the final degree lists for the April,
May, and June, 1994 commencements, the August 1994 Doctoral Degree List,
and changes to previously approved degree lists.
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by
Regent Waters, the Regents unanimously approved the consent agenda.
Real Estate Policy
Executive Vice President Womack submitted an item for information that
clarified some issues regarding the University's real estate policy that had been
raised at the November 1993 meeting. Complete details are contained in the
Regents Communication.


19




July Meeting, 1994


Real Estate Investment (Hearthstone Multi-State Homebuilding Partners, L.P.)
Regent Baker moved approval of the commitment of $10 million of the University Endowment Fund to Hearthstone Multi-State Homebuilding Partners,
L.P., pending the general counsel's review of the partnership agreement for legal
acceptability. He also asked to receive a copy of the partnership agreement to
review. Regent Waters seconded the motion, and it was approved on a vote of
7-0-1. Regent Deitch abstained from voting due to a conflict of interest.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Campus Support Services Facility
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the budget for the UM-Dearborn Campus Support Services facility and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding a construction contract, provided the project is within budget.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Environmental Interpretive Center
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved a project for construction of an Environmental Interpretive Center at the UM-Dearborn and appointment of Luckenbach/Ziegelman and
Partners, Inc., as architects.
University of Michigan-Dearborn Museum of Art
Vice President Womack called on Mr. Frederick Mayer, university planner,
to give a presentation on the proposed design of the University of MichiganDearborn Museum of Art. Mr. Mayer displayed maps and diagrams indicating
the location of the museum site and the placement of the building on the site, as
well as a floor-by-floor plan of the building and an architectural model.
Following some discussion, Regent Power moved approval of the design, as
presented, for the University of Michigan-Dearborn Museum of Art. Regent
Brown seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regent Power announced that he had to leave the meeting at this point
(3:35 p.m.), and that he wanted to go on record as being in support of the proposed 1994-95 operating budget.
UM Hospitals East Medical Campus Project
Regent Brown moved authorization for the appointment of Albert Kahn
Associates, Inc., as the architect for the East Medical Campus concept design, as
well as the specific designs of the facilities that will be sited there in the first
phases of development. Regent Vamer seconded the motion.
Vice President Womack responded to concerns expressed by Regent Baker
about coordination between the architect and the firm that will be preparing the
site plan for the property. Executive Vice President Womack noted that Johnson
Johnson & Roy/Inc. had been retained to design the site plan, and that JJR and


20




July Meeting, 1994


Albert Kahn Associates would be working closely together. The vote was then
taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved the following projects: 1) Upgrades and additions to the
University's electrical distribution system; 2) School of Education gymnasium
renovation and mezzanine floor addition; 3) Installation of a third chiller in central chiller plant; and 4) University of Michigan Hospitals Human Applications
Laboratory renovations,
Issuance of Hospital Revenue Bonds, Medical Service Plan Revenue
Bonds, Hospital Revenue Refunding Bonds, and Medical Service Plan
Refunding Bonds
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that the University
currently has an opportunity to exercise the option of an interest rate swap,
which could result in a savings to the University of at least 55 basis points when
compared to conventional fixed rate debt (which equals a present value savings of
$3.6 million for a $50 million, thirty-year bond).
Executive Vice President Womack called on Treasurer Norman Herbert,
who gave a detailed description of how interest rate swap transactions work and
how such transactions would apply to the University's debt. He and Executive
Vice President Womack then responded to further questions from the Regents
about interest rate swap transactions.
Reassignment of University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual Property (Walter J. Loesche, D.M.D., Ph.D.)
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Varner, all seven
Regents present unanimously approved a reassignment agreement between the
University of Michigan and Walter J. Loesche, D.M.D., Ph.D.      Because Dr.
Loesche is both a party to the agreement and a University employee, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Walter J. Loesche,
D.M.D., Ph.D.
2.   Terms of the contract include payment to the University of 20 percent of total
consideration received by Dr. Loesche; no use of University facilities or services;
Dr. Loesche assumes all University responsibility toward Salam A. Syed with
respect to royalty distribution; and the University maintains its responsibility
towards Barbara E. Laughton with respect to royalty distribution.
3.   Dr. Loesche's pecuniary interest arises from his right to receive royalties when
this technology is licensed. This is in lieu of participation in the sharing of
royalties received by the University in accordance with University policy.
The meeting then recessed to hear Public Comments.


21




July Meeting, 1994


Public Comments
The Regents assembled in the Anderson Room of the Michigan Union and
heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics indicated: Aaron
Williams, citizen, on the proposed tuition increase and on the Textbook Reporting Service; and Julie A Neenan, president of MSA, on the proposed tuition
increase.
The Regents then returned to the Regents Room at 4:15 p.m. to complete
the business portion of the meeting.
Eisenhower Corporate Park West
Executive Vice President Womack presented the request for purchase of Eisenhower Corporate Park West, a research/office facility at the northwest corner
of South Industrial Boulevard and Eisenhower Parkway, and distributed a separate map showing its location.  Regent McFee moved that the University
purchase Eisenhower Corporate Park West at a price of $7.65 million. Regent
Varner seconded the motion.
Executive Vice President Womack responded to questions about the proposed use of the facility. Regent Baker commented that the price for the building seemed excessive and that access to the building was difficult. There being
no further discussion the vote was then taken and the motion to purchase Eisenhower Corporate Park West was approved on a vote of 6-1, with Regents Brown,
Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Varner, and Waters in favor and Regent Baker
opposed.
Loan Guaranty for the Industrial Technology Institute
Vice President Womack reviewed the history of the University's affiliation
with the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI), noting that ITI owns the building
situated on University-owned land on North Campus. He reported that in 1992
ITI had borrowed $4.36 million in operating financing from Comerica Bank, and
now it needs to borrow additional funds because of a shortfall in expected revenues. However, Comerica Bank is not willing to make an additional loan without a guaranty for the total amount of credit (not to exceed $6.5 million) it has
extended to ITI. The Michigan Strategic Fund (MSF) is willing to provide such a
guaranty. If ITI were to default on its debt after a six-month period, MSF could
foreclose on the mortgage and take possession of ITI's building, but could not
lease or sell the building without the University's prior written approval. To
obtain MSF's guarantee, the University needs to agree to waive its right, in the
event of default, to terminate the lease with ITI. This is a request for approval in
advance of MSF as assignee of the bank with respect to the credit facility and
assignee of ITI for lease purposes. However, the University would have the right
of first refusal to purchase the building if MSF, as assignee under the lease, were
to sell the building.
There followed extensive discussion about this proposal, with several
Regents expressing concerns about the terms of the proposed lease agreement
and the role and intentions of MSF. Regent Baker commented that ITI had


22




July Meeting, 1994


never been a successful enterprise and that he believed the proposed agreement
should be renegotiated so that the University would own the land and the building. At the end of the discussion, it was decided to table the item pending further
negotiations with the Michigan Strategic Fund. Regent McGowan did not participate in the discussion because of a conflict of interest.
Helicopter Hangar, Ann Arbor Airport
Regent Baker moved that the University enter into a 20-year paid-up lease
for 10,000 square feet of space in a helicopter hangar facility to be constructed by
Bijan, Inc. at the Ann Arbor Airport, in accordance with the terms described in
the Regents Communication. Regent Varner seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities
In Vice President Hartford's absence, Dean of Students Royster Harper
responded to questions about the statistics contained in the quarterly summary
of judicial activity under the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities.
Bachelor of Arts Degree in Communication at the University of
Michigan-Dearborn
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved the creation of a new degree program, "Bachelor of Arts
Degree in Communication," to be offered by the College of Arts, Sciences, and
Letters at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, in collaboration with Henry
Ford Community College.
Change in Name of Office of Professional and Continuing Education
(PACE) at the University of Michigan-Dearborn
The Regents were informed that the Office of Professional and Continuing
Education at the University of Michigan-Dearborn had changed its name to the
Center for Corporate and Professional Development (CCPD).
1994-95 Student Fee Rates, UM-Ann Arbor, UM-Dearborn, UM-Flint
Regent Deitch moved approval of the 1994 student fee rates for all three
campuses, as described in the respective Regents Communications. Regent
Varner seconded the motion. Regent Baker requested that in the future, the
infrastructure fee appear with the student fee rate request. The vote was then
taken, and the motion to approve the 1994 student fee rates for all three campuses was approved unanimously.
1994-95 General Fund Operating Budgets, UM-Ann Arbor, UMDearborn, UM-Flint
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved the 1994-95 General Fund operating budgets for all three
campuses.

1994-95 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the 1994-95 revenue and expenditure operating budgets
for all three campuses, as described in the Regents Communication.
1994-95 Fee Assessment for Student Legal Services
Executive Vice President Womack explained that this is a recommendation
to continue the 1993-94 fee of $3.93 per student per term for Student Legal Services (SLS) until discussions can be completed with the Law School regarding
supervision of SLS. Regent McFee moved continuation of the separate Student
Legal Services fee at the 1993-94 rate of $3.93 per student per term until a final
decision is made regarding the supervision of SLS. Regent McFee seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Interim Chancellor Kugler
President Duderstadt praised Chancellor Kugler for the wise leadership he
had provided the Flint campus since assuming the position of interim chancellor
in January 1994 and expressed appreciation on behalf of the Board. There followed a round of applause.
Adjournment
There being no firther business, the meeting was adjourned at about 5:00

Regent Waters seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

27




September Meeting, 1994


paragraph on the Report of Independent Auditors, dated August 17, 1994, that
states:
"In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
University of Michigan at June 30, 1994, and the changes in fund
balances and the current funds revenues, expenditures, and transfers
for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles."
He noted that the independent auditors would be present at the October
meeting to respond to any questions the Regents might have about the audit. He
then called on Associate Vice President Chandler Matthews, who introduced Mr.
Robert Moenart, controller and director of financial operations, to present the
year-end financial informationo
Year-End Financial Information for 1993-94
Mr. Moenart gave a presentation which illustrated comparative expenditures and revenues in current funds and general funds between 1984-85 and
1993-94. During that period, total revenue for current funds educational and
general components, (comprised of General, Designated, and ExpendableRestricted Funds) has increased from $579 million to $1,222 million, while total
expenditures have increased from $576 million to $1,213 million. Excluding the
Auxiliary Activities category, salaries and wages expenditures have decreased
from 52 percent of the total to 46 percent, while staff benefits have increased
from 11 percent to 14 percent of the total and scholarships and fellowships have
increased from 7 percent to 9 percent. Auxiliary Activities expenditures have
increased from almost $400 million to nearly $1,100 million.
In 1984-85, 50 percent of General Funds revenues was derived from state
appropriations and 42 percent from student fees, whereas these proportions
changed to 39 percent and 51 percent, respectively, in 1993-94. Total General
Funds revenues during that period increased from $375 million to $759 milion.,
while total expenditures and transfers increased from $371 million to $758
million. During that period, the proportion of the General Funds expended on
salaries and wages decreased from 56 percent to 48 percent, while supplies and
scholarship/fellowship expenditure percentages increased by 3 points each and
utilities decreased by 3 points. With the exception of scholarship/fellowship and
supplies categories, most expenditures have held fairly steady over the past few
years when adjusted for inflation.
Following the presentation, Mr. Moenart responded to questions from the
Regents and thanked members of his staff who had helped prepare the presentation materials. Then, there being no further discussion, Regent Baker moved
adoption of the Annual Financial Statements for 1993-94. Regent Waters seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. Regents Deitch, McGowan,
and Power were away from the table when the vote was taken.

have contributed       to the achievement of this milestone.
With respect to the Plant Extension Report, Regent Baker requested that
the Regents be permitted to review         plans for the UM      Hospitals East Medical

Retirement Memoirs
Walter A. Castelli, D.D.S., professor of anatomy, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1994, after a productive and balanced career of teaching, research, and administration at the University of Michigan Medical School.
Dr. Castelli completed his D.D.S. degree at the University of Chile in 1957
and his M.S. degree (anatomy) at the University of Michigan in 1964. From
1964-66, he was an instructor in the Department of Anatomy at the University of
Concepcion in Chile. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1966 as an
assistant professor of anatomy and was promoted to associate professor in 1970
and professor in 1977.


66




September Meeting, 1994


In the anatomy department, Dr. Castelli conducted research on periodontal
disease, taught medical and dental gross anatomy, and was director of the
Inteflex gross anatomy course for many years. He has also been active in
numerous professional societies, including the American Association of Anatomists and the International Association for Dental Research, and he continues to
review articles for the Journal of the American Dental Association and The Cleft
Palate Journal. His research has been reported in numerous peer-reviewed
journal articles and book chapters.
Dr. Castelli has been the recipient of many distinguished teaching awards
throughout his career at the University of Michigan. He received the Kaiser
Permanente Award for Excellence in Teaching of the Basic Sciences in 1988 and
most recently was awarded the Council's Choice Award by the Inteflex Medical
Student Council.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated
service to the University of Michigan by naming Walter A Castelli professor
emeritus of anatomy.
James E. Crowfoot, professor of natural resources and urban and regional planning and former dean, School of Natural Resources and Environment, retired from active faculty status on July 31, 1994, following 29 years of
distinguished service.
Professor Crowfoot received his B.A degree from Knox College (1961), his
B.D. degree in theology from Gettysburg Lutheran Theological Seminary (1965),
and his M.A and Ph.D. degrees (1971 and 1972, respectively) from the University of Michigan. From 1965-70 he served as assistant project director and
program assistant at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research,
and in 1970 he was named project director of the Educational Change Team,
School of Education. He joined the School of Natural Resources and Environment in 1972 as an assistant professor of natural resources and urban and
regional planning. He was promoted to associate professor in 1975 and professor
in 1981.
Professor Crowfoot served as dean of the School of Natural Resources and
Environment from 1983-90, guiding it through a challenging period of change
and reorganization. During that period, he oversaw the design and implementation of major curriculum changes at all degree levels and presided over a budget
reduction and downsizing of the school. He also established a new research
division and fundraising program.
From 1989 until his retirement, Professor Crowfoot was director of the Pew
Scholars Program in Conservation and the Environment. He was also a
co-founder and active participant in the Program in Conflict Management
Alternatives. In addition, Professor Crowfoot represented the School of Natural
Resources and Environment on numerous University-wide committees and
served in a great many capacities within the school.
Professor Crowfoot's teaching and research centered on conflict management in environmental and other social-change organizations; environmental
education; and social inequities and justice. His writing and his extensive
involvement with organizations have focused on the process of change in an


67




September Meeting, 1994


effort to increase diversity and multiculturalism and to promote the means for
fostering a more sustainable future.
The Regents now salute this dedicated faculty member by naming James E.
Crowfoot dean emeritus and professor emeritus of natural resources and urban
and regional planning.
Wllliam  R. Dawson, the Dugald E. S. Brown Professor of Biological
Sciences and research scientist in the Museum of Zoology, retired from active
faculty status on August 31, 1994, following 41 years of service at the University
of Michigan.
A native of Los Angeles, Professor Dawson received his AB. degree (1949)
from Stanford University and his M.A (1950) and Ph.D. (1953) degrees from the
University of California at Los Angeles. He came to the University of Michigan
in 1953 as an instructor in zoology; he was promoted to assistant professor in
1956, associate professor in 1959, and professor in 1962 and has held his collegiate professorship since 1981.
The esteemed status Professor Dawson enjoys in his field is reflected in his
numerous awards, honors, and society memberships; his scientific productivity;
and his reputation for research of the highest quality, all of which have been
achieved in addition to his considerable administrative responsibilities, first as
chair of the Department of Biology (1974-82) and then as director of the Museum
of Zoology (1982-93). Moreover, he managed to do much of the research with his
own hands, a rare accomplishment, indeed.
As a result of Professor Dawson's vision, energy, and administrative skils,
the University's Museum of Zoology was the first in the world to have a modern
laboratory for the application of the latest methods of molecular analysis to problems in systematics and evolution. As a teacher, Professor Dawson's many contributions are reflected in his teaching awards and in the long list of graduate
students he has trained, most of whom have gone on to enjoy distinguished
careers of their own. His reputation as a teacher, mentor, and scientist is
reflected in the fact that he presently chairs thesis committees of two Ph.D.
students, both of whom came here specifically to work with him despite knowing
that he would retire from active duty before they could finish their studies.
There are many ways in which one can contribute to research and scholarship at the University: by engaging in it oneself, by training one's students to
engage in it, and by providing the intellectual leadership that stimulates and
directs the energies of one's colleagues. Professor Dawson has managed to
contribute magnificently in all of these ways.
The Regents salute this educator and scientist by naming William R. Dawson the Dugald E. S. Brown Professor Emeritus of Biological Sciences and
research scientist emeritus.
William  F. Howatt, M.D., professor of pediatrics and communicable
diseases, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1994.
Dr. Howatt received his B.S. degree from the University of Maine in 1951
and his M.D. degree from Boston University in 1955. After completing an
internship at Ancker Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota, Dr. Howatt came to the
University of Michigan, where he completed his pediatric training in 1959 and


68




September Meeting, 1994


then joined the faculty as an instructor in the Department of Pediatrics and
Communicable Diseases. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1962, associate professor in 1966, and professor in 1975.
Dr. Howatt specialized in the respiratory diseases of childhood and contributed to the emerging specialty of pediatric pulmonology by determining widelyused standard values of pulmonary function tests for young children. To date,
this is the only study in which the growth of distinct elements of pulmonary
function in normal children was followed longitudinally in a single cohort. He
published widely and was elected a member of the Society for Pediatric Research.
During 1963-64, Dr. Howatt was a post-doctoral fellow at University College in
London, England, where he studied the lung physiology of newborn infants.
Other scholarly work addressed the effect of passive smoke inhalation on
children, control of breathing in newborns, and fetal lung development.
Dr. Howatt's interest in the care of children with cystic fibrosis led to the
establishment of the Cystic Fibrosis Center at the University of Michigan
Medical Center. He also recognized the importance of providing care for the
increasing number of patients reaching adulthood and helped establish a
transition program which became the Adult Cystic Fibrosis Clinic. He directed
the Pediatric Pulmonary Function Laboratory at Mott Children's Hospital and
served as the program director of pediatric pulmonology. Dr. Howatt also served
the Medical School for many years as the chair of the Inteflex Admissions
Committee, carrying out this responsibility with diligence and concern. The
success of the students in this unique program and the quality of the graduates
were a source of great satisfaction to him.
The Regents salute this distinguished clinician, scholar, and teacher, by
naming William F. Howatt professor emeritus of pediatrics and communicable
diseases.
David Y. Hughes, professor of humanities in the College of Engineering,
retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1994.
Professor Hughes received his B.A. degree from the University of CaliforniaBerkeley in 1951, his MA. degree from Columbia University in 1955, and his
Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois in 1962. After serving as an instructor in English at the University of North Carolina from 1961-64, Professor
Hughes came to the University of Michigan in 1964 as an assistant professor in
the Department of English, College of Engineering. He was promoted to associate professor in 1969 and to professor in 1978.
In the Department of English (later renamed the Department of Humanities), Professor Hughes served as secretary to the faculty, chair of the Curriculum
Committee, and as a member of the Administrative Committee. He also chaired
a committee that undertook a five-year review of the department and made
major recommendations for the future. In addition, he served on the Engineering College Sesquicentennial Committee, Humanities Lecture Series Committee,
the Committee on University Scholarships, and the Henry Russel Award
Committee.
Professor Hughes' principal scholarly interest over the years has been H. G.
Wells and his work.  He has published a substantial number of articles and
reviews on Wells, and for some years has been an editorial consultant for


69




September Meeting, 1994


Science-Fiction Studies. With co-editors, he has published two books: H. G.
Wells: Early Writings in Science and Science Fiction (1975); and A Critical
Edition of The War of the Worlds, H. G. Wells' Scientific Romance, with
Introduction and Notes (1993). For the department, he originated the popular
course, "Science Fiction," and taught it for many years.
The regents now salute this faculty member for his many years of dedicated
service by naming David Y. Hughes professor emeritus of humanities.
Robert P. Kelch, M.D., professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases, left the University of Michigan on August 14, 1994, to assume the position
of dean of the University of Iowa College of Medicine.
After receiving his Ph.B. degree in 1964 from Wayne State University, Dr.
Kelch began his association with the University of Michigan, where he graduated
cum laude from the Medical School in 1967 and completed his pediatric residency
in 1970. He served as an NIH trainee in pediatric endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco, from 1970-72, but returned to the University as
assistant professor of pediatrics in 1972. He was promoted to associate professor
in 1975 and professor in 1977.
Dr. Kelch's accomplishments as a scholar, clinician, educator, and administrator are extraordinary. His scholarly work in developmental endocrinology has
contributed greatly to our understanding of the hormonal regulation of puberty.
Despite the specialized nature of his research, he has maintained a comprehensive command of clinical pediatrics, enabling him to influence the professional
growth of hundreds of young pediatricians.
In 1981, Dr. Kelch was appointed chair of the Department of Pediatrics and
Communicable Diseases. Under his leadership, the department has experienced
unprecedented growth in grant funding and expansion of subspecialty programs
and has become one of the most respected academic departments of pediatrics in
the nation. Dr. Kelch also served on the UM Hospitals Executive Board and as
chief of clinical affairs from 1989-92.
Dr. Kelch has been elected to membership and held offices in numerous
professional organizations, including the American Pediatric Society, the Lawson
Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and the Society for Pediatric Research, which he serves as president. He
also served as president of the Association of Medical School Pediatric Chairmen
and was recently named chair-elect of the American Board of Pediatrics. To
these positions, he brings insight, imagination, and wisdom as he continues to be
the voice and conscience of pediatrics and academic medicine.
In recognition of his distinguished accomplishments, the Regents now name
Robert P. Kelch professor emeritus of pediatrics and communicable diseases.
Gordon L. Nordby, associate professor of biological chemistry, will retire

a senior scientist at the Fels Research Institute and professor of psychology at
Antioch College. He came to the University of Michigan as professor of psychology in 1970, and he also served as chair of the Biopsychology Program from
1980-91.
A world-renowned scholar, Professor Valenstein has made major contributions to our understanding of the physiological basis of emotion and motivation
and the influence of hormones on brain and behavior. He has also written extensively on the history of somatic treatments for mental illness and is author of
more than 140 scientific articles and four books. His first book, Brain Control
(1973), inspired many students in the fields of physiological psychology and
neuroscience. His latest book, Great and Desperate Cures (1986), was widely
acclaimed and has been translated and published abroad.
Among his many honors, Professor Valenstein has been elected president of
the Comparative and Physiological Psychology Division of the American Psychological Association and a fellow at both the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences and the National Humanities Center. He received the
Kenneth Craik Research Award from Cambridge University, England, and was

Professor Valenstein's contributions also include service to numerous
professional and honorary societies, scientific advisory panels, and editorial
boards. He has participated in public forums on ethical and social issues in
science, including William Buckley's "Firing Line," and has worked as well with
the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical
and Behavioral Research.
The Regents now salute this distinguished psychologist and neuroscientist
by naming Elliot S. Valenstein professor emeritus of psychology.
Phyllis S. Weikart, associate professor of kinesiology, retired from active
faculty status on May 31, 1994, after a most productive career spanning 28 years.
Professor Weikart earned her B.S. degree in 1952 from Beaver College and
her M.A degree in 1957 from the University of Michigan. She joined the faculty
in 1966 as an instructor and was promoted to assistant professor in 1972 and
associate professor in 1986.
Active as both a player and administrator in women's field hockey, Professor Weikart served for five years as president of the U.S. Field Hockey Association. In 1979, she was inducted into the Michigan Amateur Sports Hall of Fame.
She taught a variety of sports skill classes in physical education and for many
years directed the U-M's Adult Lifestyle Program, a series of non-credit activity

the nation.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for her contributions as
a teacher, administrator, curriculum developer, workshop leader, choreographer,
and author by naming Phyllis S. Weikart associate professor emeritus of kinesiology.
Memorial Statement
The Regents acknowledge with profound sadness the death of James J.
Gindin, Professor of English Language and Literature, who passed away on
July 30, 1994.
Born in Newark, New Jersey, on May 23, 1926, Professor Gindin served in
the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II. After the war, he received his
B.A degree from Yale University and his Ph.D. degree from Cornell University.
In 1954, he was a member of the staff of The New Yorker magazine. He came to
the University of Michigan Department of English in 1956 and became a full
professor in 1968. A dedicated and extremely popular teacher, Professor Gindin
was active in many departmental and University activities and for 25 years was
chair of the English Honors Program.


72




September Meeting, 1994


Professor Gindin had a distinguished career as a literary scholar and critic
of moder British fiction. During his long career here, he was internationally
recognized for his scholarly accomplishments and was the recipient of a Fulbright lectureship, a National Endowment for the Humanities Senior Fellowship,
and Guggenheim Fellowship. He is the author of numerous books, including
Postwar British Fiction: New Accents and Attitudes; Harvest of a Quiet Eye: The
Novels of Compassion; John Galsworthy's Life and Art: An Alien's Fortress; and
most recently, British Fiction in the 1930s: The Dispiriting Decade.
Professor Gindin's remarkable breadth of learning made him ever-ready to
learn about and read new literature. Few scholars were as widely read and as
willing and able to critique the work of their peers and of students. A summer
spent teaching in New Zealand gave him a new enthusiasm —the literature of the
Antipodes. Colleagues all remember him as being exceptionally willing to take
on the burdens of committee work, to participate actively in all of the more onerous tasks of running a large department, and to provide extra help for students.
He loved teaching and learning. As we mourn the loss of this distinguished
faculty member, we extend our condolences to his wife, Joan, and two children,
James Frederic and Katherine Joan.
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded
by Regent Brown, the Regents unanimously approved the consent agenda.
1994-95 Budgets
Executive Vice President Womack submitted a separately-bound book containing the University's revenue and expenditure budgets for the fiscal year
1994-95.
State Auditor General Report and Responses - Selected            State
Universities' Reporting of Enrollment and Other Higher Education
Institutional Data Inventory (HEIDI) Data
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
approved the recommendations of and the University's responses to the State
Auditor General Report - Selected State Universities' Reporting of Enrollment
and Other Higher Education Institutional Data Inventory (HEIDI) Data.
Alternative Asset Investments
Executive Vice President Womack presented a recommendation for a
change in the asset allocation policy for the University Endowment Fund and the
Long-Term Portfolio (details can be found in the Regents Communication).
Following some discussion, Regent McFee moved that:
1)  The asset allocation policy for the University Endowment Fund
and the Long-Term Portfolio be amended, setting the target ratio
for equities to fixed income investments at 75/25 within a range of
65/35 to 85/15;
2)  Alternative fixed income investments be viewed as equity investments, due to their risk and return characteristics; and


73




September Meeting, 1994


3)  The policy for alternative asset investments be amended, removing
the limits for the individual categories and setting an overall 25
percent target for alternative asset investments.
Regent Varner seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Alternative Asset Investments
Executive Vice President Womack described the proposed actions with
regard to alternative asset investments, noting that at the current time only 11
percent of the target of 25 percent of the value of the University Endowment
Fund had actually been invested in alternative assets. Regent Varner moved the
following University Endowment Fund commitments, pending a favorable
review of the documents for their legal acceptability by the general counsel's
office:
1)  Up to $10 million in Oak Investment Partners VI, Limited
Partnership;
2)  $20 million in Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Fund V, Limited Partnership; and
3)  $25 million in a Fisher Francis Trees & Watts, Inc. "clone"
account.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regents Deitch and McGowan were away from the table when the vote was
taken.
Executive Vice President Womack called the Regents' attention to a listing
of all of the alternative asset commitments of the University Endowment Fund
as of June 30, 1994, that was appended to the Regents Communication, noting
that as the number of these commitments increases, the risk decreases. Regent
Power suggested that the Regents receive a report on these partnerships periodically as they mature, with a column indicating their capital distributions.
Acacia Housing Fund III
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that the University
would not be proceeding with a previously authorized $10.0 million investment
in Acacia Housing Fund III, due to a proposed change in the fund's strategy and
the timing of the closing.
Weber Real Estate
The Regents were informed that Government Lot 4, Section 17, T47N,
R30W, Republic Township, Marquette County, Michigan, bequeathed to the University in the will of Helen F. Weber in 1973, had been sold at a price of $11,000.
471-473 Village Oaks, Ann Arbor
The Regents were informed that the University had accepted an offer of
$235,500 for its property located at 471-473 Village Oaks in Ann Arbor, and that
the net proceeds had been credited to the School of Music's Donald R. Shepherd
Chair in Conducting.

September Meeting, 1994


The University of Michigan Visitors Center Project
Mr. Douglas Hanna, university architect, gave a presentation on improvements that could be made to the exterior facade of the existing Student Activities
Building, to which the previously approved Visitors Center will be attached. This
was done in response to the Regents' request when they had approved the design
and budget for this project in April 1994. Following the presentation, Regent
Power moved issuing the project for bids and awarding a construction contract,
provided that the bids are within the approved budget. Regent Brown seconded
the motion. Regent Power commented that the proposed improvements would
enhance the appearance of the project. Following some discussion, the vote was
taken and the motion was approved unanimously.
State Special Maintenance Projects
On motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved proceeding with infrastructure maintenance projects with
state funding that the University had received as a part of the legislature's
"Special Initiative for State Universities." Regent Brown was away from the
table when the vote was taken.
Ann Arbor Township Sanitary Sewer Line Easement
Regent Waters moved that the executive vice president and chief financial
officer grant a sewer line easement to Ann Arbor Township, as described in the
Regents Communication. Regent McFee seconded the motion. Regent Baker
inquired whether the University would retain access to the sewer without cost if
at some time in the future, its properties were to be developed. Executive Vice
President Womack responded that he would determine whether that is the case.
The vote was then taken and the motion was approved unanimously. Regent
Brown was away from the table when the vote was taken. Regent Baker stated
that he had supported the motion on the condition that the University would
have access to the easement in the future.
City of Ann Arbor Huron Parkway Bikepath Easement
Regent Baker observed that easements ought not to be granted in perpetuity, but rather should have a time limit. On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded
by Regent Waters, the Regents unanimously approved authorizing the executive
vice president and chief financial officer to grant three small easements and a
temporary construction permit, as described in the Regents Communication, to
the City of Ann Arbor for construction of the Huron Parkway bikepath. Regent
Brown was away from the table when the vote was takeno
University of Michigan-Dearborn Campus Support Services Facility
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved the total revised budget for the UM-Dearborn Campus
Support Services Facility, and award of the construction contract to AIM Systems, Inc.

September Meeting, 1994


Renovations
The Regents next considered a request for approval of the following projects:
1) Replacement of selected Mott Hospital air handling units; 2) the UMH Mott
Catheterization Lab power upgrade project; 3) the University Hospital Main
Entrance Project; 4) Medical Science I Building chiller and electrical power
upgrade; 5) Medical Science I building remodeling for the Robert Wood Johnson
Clinical Scholars Program, Medical School classrooms, and infrastructure
renovations; and 6) Northwood V Stone Road replacement. Regarding project
#5, Executive Vice President Womack pointed out that the name of the Clinical
Scholars Program had been spelled incorrectly on the Regents Communication.
He also requested that an item in the supplemental agenda, regarding funding
for the Medical Science I remodeling and renovation project, be considered
concurrently with the above projects. He then called on Mr. Hanna, who gave a
presentation describing the University Hospital Main Entrance Project.
Mr. Hanna observed that in the entry to the Hospital atrium, there is a lot
of air infiltration caused by the design of the vestibules. He described the
proposed solution, which would involve replacement of the automatic doors with
two sets of automatic revolving doors that would prevent outside air from coming
into the building. During the discussion that followed, several Regents pointed
out that this is a serious problem, for which the expense of the various alternatives should be secondary to choosing the one that will be most appropriate for
the function at hand.
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved the renovation projects, as described in the Regents
Communication.
Medical Science I Remodeling and Renovation Project
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
unanimously adopted the following Resolution, authorizing the Robert Wood
Johnson Clinical Scholars Program, Medical School classrooms and infrastructure renovations as an approved project in the Hospital Revenue Bonds, Medical
Service Plan Refunding Bonds:
RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AMENDNG RESOUTIN AUHORIZING R OTHE ISSUANCE AND DELIVERY
OF HOSPITAL REVENUE BONDS AND MEDICAL SERVICE PLAN REVENUE
BONDS, AND PROVIDING FOR OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO
WHEREAS, on September 24 1993, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the
"Issuer") adopted its Resolution Authorizing the Issuance and Delivery of Hospital Revenue
Bonds and Medical Service Plan Revenue Bonds, and Providing for Other Matters Relating
Thereto which Resolution was amended on December 17, 1993, and February 18, 1994 (as
amended, the "Resolution"); and
WHEREAS, it is necessary and desirable to further amend the Resolution as provided
herein:
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Regents of the University of Michigan,
as follows:


76




September Meeting, 1994


1.  The second "Whereas" clause of the Resolution is hereby amended to include within the definition and description of the "Projects", the remodeling and
renovation of Medical Science I and the acquisition and installation of furnishings
and equipment related thereto.
2.  As amended hereby, the Resolution is hereby ratified and confirmed. All
resolutions or parts of resolutions or other proceedings of the Issuer in conflict herewith be and the same are hereby repealed insofar as such conflict exists.
Reassignment of University's         Ownership     Interest    in Intellectual
Property
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Deitch, all seven
Regents present unanimously approved reassignment of an invention entitled
"Self-Centering and Zero Flush Mechanism for Hood Fitting and Decklid Fitting
Processes in Auto-Body Assembly (TMO file #855) to the inventors, Jixn Sha,
Dariusz Ceglarek, and Jianjun Shi. Regent Waters was away from the table when
the vote was taken.
Because the inventors are also University employees, this agreement falls
under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Jixin Sha, M.E.;
Dariusz Ceglarek, M.S.; and Jianjun Shi, Ph.D.
2.   Contract terms include payment to the University of 15 percent of total consideration received by Jixin Sha, Dariusz Ceglarek, and Jianjun Shi, and no use of
University facilities or services without the appropriate approvals.
3.   Jixin Sha's, Dariusz Ceglarek's, and Jianjun Shi's pecuniary interests arise
from their right to receive royalties when this technology is licensed. This is in
lieu of participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University in
accordance with University policy.
Recommendations for Medical Staff Appointments
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved several recommendations for appointments to medical
staff membership.
The meeting then recessed from 2:55 to 4:10 p.m.
Public Comments
Nobody had signed up to address the Regents this month.
Revision   of Regents' Bylaw       Section   1.14 (Regental and Executive/
Senior Officer Conflict of Interest Policy)
President Duderstadt observed that in July the state legislature had modified the state's conflict of interest act, and this had led some board members to
call for a re-examination of the University's own conflict of interest policies to reaffirm the University's values and fundamental principles. This re-examination
had led to a proposal to amend the University's conflict of interest policy.


77




September Meeting, 1994


General Counsel Cole explained that the legislature's actions had addressed
a matter regarding a Regent's membership in a professional corporation on
which the Regents' conflict of interest policy is silent, and the proposed revision
to that policy addresses the change in the state law.
President Duderstadt read the proposed revision, which consists of minor
editorial changes and the addition of the following paragraph:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in state law, it shall be a
conflict of interest for a Regent in any capacity to be employed by or associated
with a professional service firm which directly or indirectly provides services to
the University. In accordance with Op.Atty.Gen. 1979, No. 5489, in the event that
a firm is providing services to the University prior to one of its employees becoming a Regent, it may complete all work in progress for the University but may not
be engaged for any additional work until the Regent is no longer employed by or
associated with the professional service firm.
Regent McGowan moved adoption of the proposed amendment to Bylaw
Section 1.14; Regent Power seconded the motion.
In response to a question from Regent Baker, Ms. Cole stated that existing
contracts with a professional service firm of which a newly elected Regent is a
member could continue, but no new contracts could be entered into.
Regent McFee observed that in her opinion, the current policy already
covers the situation referred to in the proposed amendment, and that the amendment would be merely a clarification of the existing policy. Regent Baker commented that the proposed amendment was not thoroughly thought through and
needs further study before being adopted. He moved that the matter be laid on
the table until January 1, 1995. That motion failed for lack of a second.
Regent Deitch called the question; Regent Baker stated that he intended to
abstain from voting for the reasons already noted. Regent Power noted that the
desired outcome is to make clear that the ethical and moral standard set forth in
the bylaw on conflict of interest adopted unanimously in April 1993 would be
maintntaed as it was prior to the legislature's amending of the state's conflict of
interest law in July 1994. He said that the proposed amendment is "reasoned,...precise, and it reacts to a specific piece of legislation that was adopted by the
legislature and corrects a loophole introduced into the state conflict of interest
law by the legislature."
Regent Baker responded that the amendment also has a political
component.
Regent McGowan seconded Regent Deitch's motion to call the question. The
vote on Regent McGowan's original motion to approve the proposed amendments to Regents' Bylaw 1.14 was then taken and it was approved, with Regents
Brown, Deitch, McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor and Regents
Baker and McFee abstaining. The text of the revised bylaw follows:


78




September Meeting, 1994


Sec. 1.14. Regental and Executive/Senior Officer Conflict of Interest
Policy
Regents and executive officers of the University of Michigan, and the senior
officers of the University at Dearborn and at Flint, shall at all times act in a
manner consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities to the University and shall
exercise particular care that no detriment to the University results from conflicts
between their interests and those of the University. If a Regent or an
executive/senior officer believes that he or she may have a conflict of interest, the
Regent or executive/senior officer shall promptly and fully disclose the conflict to
the secretary of the Board of Regents and shall refrain from participating in any
way in the matter to which the conflict relates until the conflict question has been
resolved. The minutes of a Regents' meeting where a disclosure of conflict or possible conflict of interest is made shall reflect the disclosure and that the Regent or
executive/senior officer having such abstained from participation in the matter.
A Regent or executive/senior officer is considered to have a conflict of interest
when the Regent or executive/senior officer or any of his or her family or associates, either (i) has an existing or potential financial or other interest which impairs or might appear to impair the Regent's or executive/senior officer's
independence of judgment in the discharge of responsibilities to the University, or
(ii) may receive a material, financial, or other benefit from knowledge of information confidential to the University. The "family" of a Regent or executive/ senior
officer includes his or her spouse, parents, siblings, children and, if living in the
same household and sharing expenses, other individuals. An "associate" of a
Regent or executive/ senior officer includes any person, trust, organization, or
enterprise in or with which the Regent or executive/ senior officer has knowledge
that he or she or any member of his or her family (i) is a director, officer,
employee, member, partner, or trustee; or (ii) has a financial interest that
represents 5% or more of his or her assets or any interest that enables him or her,
acting alone or in conjunction with others, to exercise control or to influence policy
significantly, or (iii) has any other material association.
The secretary shall consult with the president and general counsel regarding
all conflict questions of which the secretary is informed and shall report regularly
to the Board of Regents regarding any unresolved conflict questions. This policy
statement is to be interpreted and applied in a manner that will best serve the
interests of the University. In some cases it may be determined that after full
disclosure to those concerned the University's interests are best served by
participation by the Regent or executive/senior officer despite the conflict. The
University will assist the Board in determining if such proposed participation
violates the state conflict of interest laws. The general counsel will provide a
Regent or executive/senior officer, upon his or her request, a written opinion as to
whether a conflict of interest situation exists.
This policy is in addition to any obligations imposed on a Regent or
executive/senior officer by the state law on conflicts of interest, P.A. 1968, Nos. 317
and 318, as amended.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in state law, it shall be a
conflict of interest for a Regent in any capacity to be employed by or associated
with a professional service firm which directly or indirectly provides services to
the University. In accordance with Op.Atty.Gen. 1979, No. 5489, in the event that
a firm is providing services to the University prior to one of its employees becoming a Regent, it may complete all work in progress for the University but may not
be engaged for any additional work until the Regent is no longer employed by or
associated with the professional service firm.
The secretary shall distribute annually a copy of this policy statement to each
Regent and executive/senior officer.

September Meeting, 1994


Resolution in Honor of Robert Forman
President Duderstadt called on Regent Brown, who read the following
resolution:
The Regents of the University of Michigan gratefully salute and
commend Robert Go Forman as he concludes a distinguished,
28-year career as executive director of the University of Michigan
Alumni Association.
Bob Forman earned his B.A. degree from Michigan State
University in 1953 and his M.P.A. degree from the University of
Michigan in 1959. He first joined the University of Michigan staff in
1955 and then left in 1957 to join the newly-formed Bendix Systems
Division in Ann Arbor. In 1964, he returned as associate director of
the Alumni Association. Two years later, he became its executive
director, embarking on a career in alumni work that is unparalleled,
both in terms of its accomplishments and its contributions to the
profession.
The University of Michigan has been the grateful beneficiary of
the efforts of this talented, dedicated champion of alumni service to
higher education. Bob Forman has introduced countless innovations
in  alumni programming, has written    extensively about his
experiences in alumni administration, and has served prominently
in national and regional associations of his peers, which have
honored him on numerous occasions with their most prestigious
awards.
The  University's alumni association  has also prospered
tremendously during Bob's tenure. It has built its own campus center
from  contributions, has developed a far flung alumni camp
operation, publishes an award-winning alumni magazine, has
established over 200 alumni clubs in every corner of the state and the
world, and operates an extensive travel and continuing education
program. And each of these programmatic achievements is carefully

OCTOBER MEETING, 1994


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, October 20, 1994
The Regents met at 10:15 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan,
Power, Varner, and Waters.  Secretary Johnson was also present, as were
Provost Whitaker, Executive Vice President Womack, and Vice Presidents
Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal. Chancellors Nelms and Renick were
absent.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Regent
Varner, who made the following motion:
Executive Session Motion
Pursuant to Sections 8(e) and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in
closed session on October 20, 1994, for the purposes of consulting with
our attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection with
specific pending litigation [Sec. 8(e)]; and considering material exempt
from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information
Act [Sec. 8(h)]. Such exempt material consists of written opinions from
the Board's legal counsel.
Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting resumed in public session at 1:30 p.m. in the Regents' Room.
Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee,
McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters. Secretary Johnson was also present, as
were Provost Whitaker, Executive Vice President Womack, and Vice Presidents
Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal, and Chancellors Nelms and Renick.
Ernst & Young Management Report and Responses
Executive Vice President Womack introduced Mr. Bob Emde and Mr.
Harold Miller, of Ernst & Young, to present the report of the University's
external auditors. Mr. Emde stated that the firm's report, which had been
completed on August 17, 1994, expressed an unqualified opinion on the
University's financial statements, which had been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.  In addition, the firm  had also
conducted audits of the University's constituent units, each one of which had
resulted in the expression of unqualified opinions.
Mr. Emde observed that the management letter noted that the firm's review
of the University's internal control structure and policies and procedures
disclosed no material weaknesses, and that the control procedures that are in
place throughout the University continue to be very sound and very well thought
out. The recommendations in the management letter are intended to be
"constructive suggestions" for improvements in procedures and policies."


83




October Meeting, 1994


Mr. Emde concluded by stating that the firm had received excellent cooperation from University staff, and that it appreciated the opportunity to serve as the
University's independent auditors. Regent Baker observed that the Regents are
always available to meet personally with the auditors if they have any concerns
they wish to disclose in private. Mr. Emde responded that the firm did not have
any concerns at the present time that warranted such a discussion.
Presentation/Discussion: Technology Transfer and Economic Development
Vice President Neal stated that the purpose of the discussion was to deepen
the dialogue about the University's activities in support of economic development
and technology transfer. He described recent events in which the University is
involved that are designed to foster these activities. Vice President Neal defined
"technology transfer" as the conveyance of information, know-how, materials,
patents, or copyrights from academe to industry. He also noted that the Regents'
bylaws and policies express three purposes in support of technology transfer
activities: to provide services to faculty and staff; to facilitate the efficient
transfer of knowledge and technology from the campus to the private sector in
service of the public interest; and to attract resources for the support of University programs. He also noted that the president had appointed an economic
development council within the University of Michigan to serve as a focal point
for future planning and action.
Vice President Neal turned to Executive Vice President Womack, who said
that the presentation would focus on two areas: the Technology Management
Office, as an example of a university-wide service which supports this mission;
and the Office of Technology Transfer in the College of Engineering, as an
example of a unit-based effort. He introduced Mr. Jay Hartford, executive
director of the Office of Technology Transfer in the College of Engineering, who
also chairs the newly-constituted University of Michigan President's Economic
Development Council; and Mr. Robert Robb, director of the Technology Management Office.
Mr. Hartford gave a slide presentation describing current and planned
technology transfer activities within the College of Engineering. Mr. Robb then
described the mission, role, objectives, and current activities of the Technology
Management Office and led a discussion of the challenges and opportunities
related to increasing the amount of technology transfer that emanates from the
University of Michigan.
Following the presentation, Executive Vice President Womack reported that
an advisory panel has been established, similar to the Investment Advisory
Committee, with the objective of trying to attract venture capitalists to support
the University's technology transfer efforts. Regent McFee pointed out that
these efforts emphasize the importance of the University's role in enhancing
economic development in the state.
Following further discussion, Mr. Hartford described the President's
Economic Development Council, a coordinating body of 14 faculty members and
administrators whose overall goal is to help the University realize its potential
for fostering regional economic development. A progress report is due to the


84




October Meeting, 1994


president and executive officers in which the council will outline its vision and its
strategy for achieving its goal. Regent Power suggested that the progress report
be presented to the Regents as well.
1995-96 State Budget Request
Provost Whitaker observed that over the years, the proportion of General
Fund revenue derived from state appropriations as compared to tuition has been
steadily declining, so that at the current time the General Fund consists of 37
percent state appropriation, 53 percent tuition, and 10 percent from other
sources,
Over the past seven years, there has been a decline in the real value of the
state appropriation of nearly $36 million. The 1995-96 state budget request will
include an additional $17.9 million to fund half of that loss, plus an additional
$9.0 million to cover the expected increase in the Higher Education Price Index
(HEPI) index of 3.2 percent, for a total requested increase of $26.9 million. If
granted, this amount would increase the General Fund budget by 3.8 percent.
Following some discussion, Regent McFee moved approval of the 1995-96
State Budget Requests, as submitted, for all three campuses. Regent Waters
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan Medical Center East Medical Campus Project
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Richard Rigterink, of
Johnson Johnson & Roy, the University's planning consultant, to present a
proposed master plan for the Medical Center's East Medical Campus.
Mr. Rigterink used a number of maps and diagrams to describe the site's
location, physical characteristics, and size in relation to existing developed
campus sites. He stated that the East Medical Campus would be divided into
zones, with the "Central Zone", located near the corner of Plymouth and
Earhardt Roads, to be developed as Phase I and devoted solely to ambulatory
care clinics. The development of future phases would depend on changes in the
health care industry in future years.
Following the presentation, Mr. Rigterink, Executive Vice President
Womack, Dean Bole, and Mr. Forsyth responded to questions and comments
from the Regents about the development of the East Medical Campus. Then,
there being no further discussion, Regent Baker moved approval of the East
Medical Campus Master Plan. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
1995-96 State Budget Request, UM-Dearborn
President Duderstadt called on Chancellor Renick, who observed that the
1995-96 UM-Dearborn budget request was similar to that of last year, with the
two highest priorities being an inflation component of $615,000 (3.2 percent) and
funding for the Environmental Education Center of $1.2 million.


85




October Meeting, 1994


1995-96 State Budget Request, UM-Flint
President Duderstand then called on Chancellor Nelms who stated that an
important priority for the Flint campus is to work on retaining students through
graduation, which is a complex undertaking that involves resources in a number
of different areas.      The incremental request of $1,982,000 is directed toward
student retention efforts ($150,000); reducing reliance on part-time faculty
($250,000); diversity enhancement ($100,000); enhanced academic programs
($300,000); equipment/libary acquisitions and operations ($350,000); collaboration  with   K-12 and      other higher education        institutions ($100,000); and        3.2
percent inflation increase for salary and non-salary operations ($732,000); as
part of a four-year phased approach to position the UM-Flint at the midpoint of
class IIA institutions in the state.
President Duderstadt pointed out that the previous vote on the state budget
request had encompassed the requests from            the Dearborn and Flint campuses.
Minutes
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the minutes for the September 1994 meeting.

Retirement Memoirs
Lyubica Dabich, M.D., associate professor of internal medicine, retired
from active faculty status on June 30, 1994.
A native of Michigan, Dr. Dabich obtained her B.S. degree in chemistry at
the University of Michigan in 1950 and her M.S. degree in biochemistry at the
University of Wisconsin in 1951.     She worked at the Parke Davis Research
Laboratory in Detroit until 1956 and then enrolled in McGill University Medical
School in Montreal, where she received her M.D. degree in 1960. Dr. Dabich
then returned to the University of Michigan for her internship and residency
training (1960-64). She was an Elsa U. Pardee Fellow in Hematology at the
Simpson Memorial Institute from 1964-65 and a research associate from 1965-66
before joining the Medical School faculty as an instructor in 1966. She was
promoted to assistant professor in 1968 and associate professor in 1973.
The main thrust of Dr. Dabich's work has been the diagnosis and treatment
of adult patients with leukemia or lymphoma. She was principal investigator for


99




October Meeting, 1994


a number of studies that were carried out in the Southwest Oncology Group by a
consortium of university medical schools. Dr. Dabich was also involved in
studies of progressive systemic sclerosis, and her work has contributed to our
knowledge of the natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of this
disorder.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for her dedicated
service by naming Lyubica Dabich associate professor emeritus of internal
medicine.
Allan G. Feldt, professor of urban planning in the College of Architecture
and Urban Planning, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1994.
Professor Feldt received his B.S., AM., and Ph.D. degrees in 1954, 1958,
and 1963, respectively, all from the University of Michigan. From 1962-71, he
served on the faculty at Cornell University and also held visiting professorships
at several other universities. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in
1971 as an associate professor of urban and regional planning and was promoted
to professor in 1973.
In addition to teaching graduate level courses in urban and regional
planning, Professor Feldt has served as chair of the Program in Urban and
Regional Planning and as director of the Program in Urban, Technological, and
Environmental Planning. He has also been an active member of many program,
college, and University committees. In 1983, he was awarded the Sol King
Award for Excellence in Teaching, and in 1989 he was honored by the Urban
Planning Alumni Society with its highest award-the Award of Professional
Distinction-given for leadership and achievements in the planning profession.
Throughout his career, Professor Feldt has also been a leader in interactive
gaming. The Detroit Area Growth Game (DAGG), later renamed the Metropolitan Area Growth Game (MAGG), is one of a series of games he developed. This
game combines twenty-five years of experience with planning games, such as the
Community Land Use Game (CLUG) (Cornell University, 1965), ten years of
experience with computer conferencing using Confer II, and seven years of
experience with high school students playing the Middle East Conflict Simulation
(University of Michigan School of Education). Professor Feldt's introduction of a
specialized version of DAGG for middle school and high school students in
Detroit gives these youngsters an understanding of urban development issues at
an early age.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Allan G. Feldt
professor emeritus of urban planning.
John J. Gannon, professor of public health engineering in the Department
of Environmental and Industrial Health and research scientist in the Institute of
Environmental and Industrial Health, School of Public Health, retired from
active faculty status on August 31, 1994.
A native of New York City, Professor Gannon served in the U.S. Army
during World War II, after which he received his B.C.E. degree from Manhattan
College. He earned his M.P.H. degree from the University of Michigan in 1952,
while working part-time as a resident lecturer. He was appointed assistant
professor in 1952 and was promoted to associate professor in 1957 and professor


100




October Meeting, 1994


in 1964. He has been a research scientist in the Institute of Environmental and
Industrial Health since 1974.
A licensed professional engineer in Michigan and New York, Professor
Gannon is a well-known scholar in the field of public health engineering. His
academic achievements include the establishment of the water quality program
in the School of Public Health and the Water Resources Management Program in
the Rackham School of Graduate Studies. He is an effective educator and his
teaching ability has been admired by generations of students.
Professor Gannon is nationally and internationally known for his research
on water pollution and water quality management, and he has published over 50
papers and numerous reports for government and international agencies. He is
a diplomat of the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and a life
member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Water Pollution Control
Federation, and the American Water Works Association.
In recognition of his outstanding contributions, the Regents now name John
J. Gannon professor emeritus of public health engineering and research scientist
emeritus.
Robert B. Zajonc, director of the Institute for Social Research, Charles
Horton Cooley Distinguished University Professor of Social Sciences, Department of Psychology, College of LS&A, and research scientist, Research Center for
Group Dynamics, retired from active faculty status on August 31, 1994, after an
extraordinary, 40-year career as a researcher, teacher, and administrator.
A native of Poland, Professor Zajonc immigrated to this country after World
War II and received his B.A (1950), M.A (1952), and Ph.D. (1955) degrees at the
University of Michigan. He has been associated with the Research Center for
Group Dynamics since 1954, beginning as a research associate and eventually
serving as its director (1983-89). He was named assistant professor of psychology
in 1957 and was promoted to associate professor in 1961 and professor in 1965.
He was named the Charles Horton Cooley Distinguished Professor in 1983 and
director of ISR in 1989.
Professor Zajonc is regarded as one of the premier psychologists in the
world; there are textbooks that include more references to his work than to that
of any other psychologist. He has contributed to many areas of psychology, but
his most original and important research shows that "mere familiarity" with an
object is sufficient to cause one to have a more positive attitude toward it; family
size and birth order within the family have very systematic effects on intelligence; and emotional appraisal of an object and cognitive appraisal of an object
are essentially independent processes.
For his extraordinary research contributions, Professor Zajonc has received
the highest awards in his field, including the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished
Scientist Award of the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, in addition to
visiting professorships and Guggenheim, Fulbright, and Rockefeller fellowships,
among others. Professor Zajonc is a member of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, is the only foreign member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and
holds honorary degrees from the University of Louvain (France) and the University of Warsaw.

University of Michigan Financial Report for Year Ended June 30, 1994
Executive Vice President Womack submitted, under separate cover, the
University of Michigan Financial Report for the Year Ended June 30, 1994. He
complimented staff members on the excellent quality of the publication, and
pointed out that it had been produced entirely within the University.
Ann Arbor Technology Park
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that the only parcel
of vacant land in Ann Arbor Technology Park remaining to be purchased, Parcel
P, had had an environmental assessment conducted on it. The assessment had
revealed the existence of underground storage tanks, from which no release had
been detected. This report is available for review in the Treasurer's Office. He
noted that the University intended to close on the acquisition of parcel P by the
end of October.
Alternative Asset Investments
Regent Deitch moved that $10 million of the University Endowment Fund
be committed to the Fidelity Galileo Fund, L.P., pending a favorable review of
the documents for their legal acceptability by the general counsel's office. Regent
Power seconded the motion, and following some discussion, it was approved
unanimously.
Tactical Asset Allocation
Regent Power moved that First Quadrant be appointed as a tactical allocation manager for the University Endowment Fund and the Long-Term Portfolio.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion.   Executive Vice President Womack
explained that the purpose of this action would be to replace The Common Fund
with one of The Common Fund's managers as the University's tactical allocation
manager. This more direct relationship would strengthen oversight and control.
Following some discussion, the vote was taken, and the motion was approved
unanimously.
Issuance of Hospital Revenue Bonds, Medical Service Plan Revenue
Bonds, and Medical Service Plan Refunding Bonds
Regent Brown moved that the Regents adopt the following Resolution
authorizing the use of bond options when issuing the Hospital Revenue Bonds,
Medical Service Plan Revenue Bonds and Medical Service Plan Refunding Bonds.

On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a proposed option agreement and resulting license
agreement between the University of Michigan and Nephros Therapeutics, Inc..

105




October Meeting, 1994


2.   Contract terms are as follows:
The contracts to be completed between the University and Nephros include the
option, the license to be executed upon exercise of the option, as well as
documents covering stock transfers, materials bailments, limited further
University developments, and other related matters. Detailed summaries of the
relationship between the University and Nephros, and the proposed option
agreement, are attached to this action request for the Regents' reference. The
basic elements of the arrangements are restated here:
The option agreement provides that Nephros may exercise an option to an
exclusive license to the technologies, once it has obtained at least $1,000,000 in
outside investment funding. Upon exercise, a predetermined license will be
executed by the parties, with terms including the following:
The license will provide the University with a modest royalty (1 to 1.5%) of
Nephros' sales of products and services, a portion (20%) of any sublicensing
revenue, a $60,000 license fee to help cover expended patent costs, and a 10%
equity interest in Nephros, to be calculated at the point at which Nephros has
obtained $2,000,000 in outside funding;
The duration of the license agreement will be the longer of the last to expire of
any patents that issue covering the technologies, ten years from the date of the
agreement, or seven years from the date that Nephros begins sales of products
or services;
The University will retain ownership of the technologies and patents, granting
an exclusive commercialization license to Nephros. The University will retain
internal research use rights, as well as the right to provide the United States
Government with non-exclusive licenses, as required under sponsorship
agreements. As Dr. Humes is both a University faculty member and a VA staff
member, the license will further clarify that only the proprietary rights of the
University, and not of any other party, are licensed; and
Nephros will use its best efforts to develop products, obtain governmental approvals, and make the benefits of products available to the public. Nephros will
further agree to make reasonable attempts to locate its production and research
facilities initially in Michigan.
No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University
employees, is obligated under the option agreement or the resulting license
agreement.
3.   Dr. Humes' pecuniary interest arises from his ownership interest in Nephros
Therapeutics, Inc. In accordance with University policy, he will waive any
personal participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University
from Nephros.
Proposed Subcontract between the University of Michigan and Aeromover Systems Corporation
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved a proposed subcontract between the University of Michigan and Aeromover Systems Corporation for a project funded by NASA through
the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Pilot Program.
Because Neil D. Gerl and Judith 0. Gerl are both employees of the University of Michigan and officers of Aeromover Systems Corporation, and Neil Gerl
also owns 50 percent of the company's stock, this subcontract falls under the
state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:


106




October Meeting, 1994


1.   Parties to the agreement will be Aeromover Systems Corporation and the
Regents of the University of Michigan.
2.   The proposed agreement is a standard university research subcontract. There
are no restrictions on publication or openness of the research. The subcontract
will cover partial salary costs for Johann Borenstein and a graduate student
and equipment use charges, all totaling $23,304 over a six-month period. No
indirect cost will be charged since this is an STTR Pilot project.
3.   Neither of the Gerls is an employee of the company. They serve as officers
without compensation. Neil Gerl owns 50 percent of the company's stock and
may be reimbursed by the company as a technical consultant. No other
University employee has an interest in the company's NASA contract or in the
University's subcontract.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and
Sysma, Inc.
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved a license agreement between the University of Michigan
and Sysma, Inc.
Because Professor Edna Coffin holds an equity interest in Sysma, Inc. and is
also a University employee, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance
with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Sysma, Inc., a
company in which Professor Edna Coffin holds an equity interest.
2.   Terms of the contract include payment to the University of 7 percent of the net
sales of the programs by Sysma, and 20 percent of any sublicensing revenues
generated for the programs (these rates may be reduced by one half, under certain circumstances, beginning in 1998). Beginning in 1995, minimum payments of at lease $500 to the University are required.
The agreement remains in effect until terminated by Sysma, Inc.
The University will retain ownership of the programs, granting an exclusive
commercialization license to Sysma. The University will retain internal use
rights, as well as the right to produce and commercialize similar programs for
other languages.
Sysma will use its best efforts to effectively commercialize the programs.
No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University
employees, is obligated under the agreement.
3.   Professor Coffin's pecuniary interest arises from her ownership interest in
Sysma, Inc. In accordance with University policy, she will waive any personal
participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University from Sysma.
Agreement      between     the   University     of  Michigan      and   Michigan
Materials and Processing Institute
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved an agreement between the University of Michigan and
Michigan Materials and Processing Institute (MMPI), under which MMPI will
sponsor two University research projects.


107




October Meeting, 1994


Because Dr. Pankaj K Mallick is both a member of the board of directors of
MMPI and a University employee who will direct the projects, this agreement
falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreements will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Michigan Materials and Processing Institute (MMPI).
2.   Terms of the agreements will be consistent with University policy. The first
project is proposed over a three-year period at a total of $177,396. The second
project is proposed over a two-year period at a total of $153,432. Both budgets
include salary support for Dr. Mallick and two graduate students.
3.   Dr. Mallick has no proprietary interest in and will receive no compensation
directly from MMPI.
Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and Public
Data Queries, Inc.
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved a research agreement between the University of Michigan
and Public Data Queries, Inc. (PDQ).
PDQ has received a research grant through the Small Business Technology
Program (SBTP) to fund a project, and SBTP requires that a university participate in a funded project at a minimum of 30 percent of the total costs. The
agreement between the University of Michigan and PDQ fulfills this requirement. The University's work in PDQ will be under the direction of Barbara A.
Anderson, who has no proprietary or other interest in PDQ and is no relation to
the officers of the company. However, because three officers of PDQ (Albert H.
Anderson, Paul H. Anderson, and William Frey) are also University employees,
this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Paul H. Anderson, a University employee and officer and shareholder in PDQ,
will contribute personal time to the project without compensation and outside
his full-time University duties as a system research programmer. Albert F.
Anderson, a University faculty employee, is also an officer of PDQ and will
receive consulting compensation through PDQ for this project. William Frey is
an officer of PDW and an employee of the University but will not be participating in this project.
2.   Terms of the proposed agreement are acceptable and conform to University
policy. The amount of the subcontract to the University from PDW is $29,562
and the period of performance is one (1) year. As stated above, none of the
University employees who are officers and/or shareholders in PDQ will play any
role in the University's performance of this agreement.
Reassignment of the University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual
Property (William J. O'Brien)
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved a reassignment agreement between the University of
Michigan and William J. O'Brien, involving the intellectual property, "Colorimetric Determination of the Colors of Teeth' (TMO file #999).


108




October Meeting, 1994


Because William J. O'Brien is both a University employee and a party to the
agreement, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1,  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and William J.
O'Brien, M.S., Ph.D.
2.  Contract terms include payment to the University of 15 percent of total consideration received by William J. O'Brien, and no use of University facilities or
services without appropriate approvals.
3.  William J. O'Brien's pecuniary interest arises from his right to receive royalties
when this technology is licensed. This is in lieu of participation in the sharing
of royalties received by the University in accordance with University policy.
Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities
Vice President Hartford submitted a summary report of judicial activity
stemming from the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities for the
period January 1, 1993, to October 1, 1994.
In response to a question from Regent Power, Vice President Hartford
reported that progress is being made in the University's efforts to fulfill the
requirements for assembling the required number of student board members to
be able to consider amendments to the Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities.
UM-Flint Student Rights Policy
Chancellor Nelms informed the Regents that the University of MichiganFlint had revised its Student Rights Policy to make it consistent with the Ann
Arbor campus' Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities. A copy of the
revised policy was included with the Regents Communication.
Recommendation for Appointments to Medical Staff Membership
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Deitch, and on the recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board, the Regents unanimously approved several appointments to medical staff membership.
Naming of the Undergraduate Library
Regent Power observed that the Undergraduate Library was currently
undergoing a total renovation, and that it had never been named for anyone. He
noted that Harold and Vivian Shapiro had served the University for many years
with great love and great distinction, Vivian as a clinical researcher in the
Department of Psychiatry and faculty member in the School of Social Work, and
Harold as a professor of economics, chair of the Department of Economics,
provost, and then president. Given the Shapiro's enormous contributions to the
University of Michigan, Regent Power moved that the Undergraduate Library be
named in honor of Harold T. and Vivian B. Shapiro. Regent Varner seconded
the motion, and it was approved unanimously.


109




October Meeting, 1994


M-Quality Expo
Executive Vice President Womack and Provost Whitaker invited the
Regents to visit the M-Quality Expo in the Michigan Union following the
meeting. Executive Vice President Womack observed that the exhibits are "a
splendid example of what happens to an organization when employees, many of
whom heretofore felt little empowerment, begin to feel that empowerment and to
take into their own hands the responsibility for improving the job they have."
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 3:40 p.m.
The next meeting will be held on November 17 and 18, 1994. Regents expenses
for the month of September 1994 totalled $285.26.

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1994


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, November 179 1994
The Regents met at 1:15 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee, McGowan, Power,
Varner, and Waters. Secretary Johnson was also present, as were Provost
Whitaker, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents Harrison,
Hartford, and Kinnear, and Chancellor Nelms.   Vice President Neal and
Chancellor Renick were absent; Associate Vice President Steven Kunkel and Vice
Chancellor Robert Behrens, respectively, attended in their stead.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and introduced Regents
Elect Daniel D. Homing and Andrea L. Fischer, who were observing the meeting. He then called on Ms. Jean Loup, chair of the Senate Advisory Committee

Regents.
SACUA Report
Ms. Loup began by reviewing the structure of faculty governance at the
University. She noted that most of the work is done by the various Senate
Assembly committees and described the activities of several of them. She then
reported on the concerns of SACUA, noting that there had been several "skirmishes" between SACUA and the administration during the past year. She said
that during the remainder of her tenure as chair, she intended to do all that she
could to find a middle ground between the two parties.
Ms. Loup reported that SACUA had requested that she raise two concerns:
the suspension of faculty governance in the Department of Communications and
the use of opinions of the general counsel to develop policy. On the positive side,
she said that SACUA applauds initiatives being made to improve the undergraduate experience and is pleased to be working with the provost on reviewing
and improving the faculty grievance process and on examining the need for
appropriate faculty accountability.
Following her report, the president thanked Ms. Loup for her efforts on
behalf of SACUA, and she responded to a question from one of the Regents.

Retirement Memoir
Warren T. Norman, professor of psychology, retired from active faculty
status on October 31, 1994, after a distinguished career as a teacher, scholar, and
researcher.
Professor Norman received his B.S. degree in 1952, his M.A degree in 1955,
and his Ph.D. degree in 1957, all from the University of Minnesota. He joined
the University of Michigan Department of Psychology in 1957 as an instructor
and was promoted to assistant professor in 1959, associate professor in 1963, and
professor in 1966. Professor Norman served as acting chair of the psychology
department from 1967-68 and chair of the psychology department from 1976-81.
Among Professor Norman's honors are visiting appointments at the Oregon
Research Institute (1965-66, 1987), the University of Birmingham in England
(1972-73), the University of Western Australia (1973), and the University of
Queensland, Australia (1980). His professional service has focused on elevating
standards for the quality of tests and assessment devices. Among the many APA
committees on which he served are the Committee on Test Standards (1961-62),
the Division 5 Committee on Test Reviewing (1964-67), the Committee on
Psychological Tests (1966-67), the Committee on Assessment (1968-69), and the
Board of Scientific Affairs (1982-85).
Professor Norman will be well remembered for his lasting contributions to
the structure of personality and for the use of innovative statistical procedures in
personality assessment. He has written several seminal articles in these areas,
works that continue to grow in significance for the field of personality research.
For example, an article he published in 1963, which presented a compelling
theoretical rationale and empirical evidence for the "five factor model" of
personality, has become a citation classic, with citations continuing to increase
even three decades after its publication. Professor Norman has trained many
generations of personality students and has generously helped many other
psychology students navigate through the technical difficulties of statistical and
psychometric procedures.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scientist, scholar, teacher, and
administrator for his dedicated service by naming Warren T. Norman professor
emeritus of psychology.
Degrees
Provost Whitaker submitted final degree lists for the August 1994 commencements and final degree lists for the Law School for May and September,
1994. He also submitted the August 1994 Doctoral Degree List and changes to
previously approved degree lists.
Honorary Degrees. The president submitted recommendations for the
following individuals to receive honorary degrees: George B. Dantzig, mathematician; Thomas M. Graber, orthodontist and anatomist; and Antonia C. Novello,
former surgeon general of the United States.


122




November Meeting, 1994


Henry Russel Lecturer.     The president nominated Vincent Massey,
professor of biological chemistry, as the Henry Russel Lecturer for 1995.
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded
by Regent Brown, the Regents unanimously approved the consent agenda.
University of Michigan 1994 Financial Report Supplemental Schedules
for the Year Ended June 30, 1994
Executive Vice President Womack submitted the University of Michigan
1994 Financial Report Supplemental Schedules for the Year Ended June 30,
1994.
Six Month Report on University Audits
Mr. Carl Smith, director of university audits, submitted the regular six
month report on Office of University Audits activities for the period April 1, 1994
through September 30, 1994.
Alternative Asset Investments
Executive Vice President Womack submitted a request for approval of two
real estate and one venture capital investment opportunities. He indicated that
alternative asset investments currently constitute about 12 percent of the
University Endowment Fund, with the target being 25 percent.
Following some discussion, Regent Power moved that the following University Endowment Fund commitments be made, pending a favorable review of the
documents for their legal acceptability by the general counsel's office: 1) $20 million (plus interest on the initial $6 million from November 1 until the funds are
transferred to TCW) in TCW Special Credits Fund VI; 2) $20 million in AEW
Asset Recovery Partners, L.P.; and 3) up to $5 million in Matrix Partners IV,
L.P.
Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Sale of Sanilac County, Michigan, Property
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that a parcel of 40
acres of vacant land in Sanilac County had been sold at a purchase price of
$46,000.
Sale of Pasadena, California, Property
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that the net proceeds from the sale of the Donald R. Shepherd property in Pasadena, California
had been divided to benefit the Varsity Tennis Complex and the Elbel
Club/Marching Band. It had originally been reported that the proceeds would
benefit the Donald R. Shepherd Professorship in Music.


123




November Meeting, 1994


Intercollegiate Athletics South Ferry Field Development and Football
Stadium Restoration
This is a request for approval of two projects: one to develop South Ferry
Field into permanent practice-competition playing fields, primarily for women's
varsity sports teams, and the other to continue with the next phase in the
ten-year plan to restore the deteriorated concrete and replace seating in the
football stadium.
Regent McGowan said that she had read about the approval of the two
projects by the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics (hereafter referred to
as the "Board in Control") in the paper the previous evening, and questioned
whether it should have been reported in the newspaper before being approved by
the Board of Regents. Executive Vice President Womack responded that the
Board in Control, like any other body, approves such projects as recommendations to the Board of Regents, and under the Regents' Bylaws, no one has the
authority to commit a building or land without the specific authorization of the
Regents. Vice President Harrison, a member of the Board in Control, commented that this was indeed the understanding of that board when the vote was
taken, and that the newspaper report was premature.
Further discussion followed about the relationship between the Board in
Control and the Board of Regents regarding what types of contracts can be
approved by the Board in Control without coming before the Board of Regents.
Regent Deitch questioned agreements related to use of the University's seal and
logo, specifically referring to the licensing agreement that had been negotiated
between the Board in Control and Nike Corporation granting Nike the right to
be the exclusive supplier of athletic equipment for the University's sports teams.
Executive Vice President Womack responded that the Board of Regents had
delegated to him the authority to enter into contracts, and that contracts are not
routinely brought before the Board.
Further discussion ensued about the issue of the Nike contract and about
which contracts come before the Board and which ones do not. Vice President
Harrison pointed out that the Nike contract involves two separate issues: 1) the
use of the University's seal and logos; and 2) the authority to approve contracts.
He noted that the use of the seal is controlled by the secretary of the university,
as stated in the Regents' Bylaws, and that approval for commercial and
non-commercial use of the University's other symbols is under the domain of the
Athletic Department.
Regents Brown and Baker commented on the history of the relationship
between the Board in Control and the Board of Regents, noting that there is a
long history of independence on the part of the Board in Control that has created
a culture that is resistant to change.
Following further discussion, Provost Whitaker reported that his office had
been reviewing the Regents' Bylaws and said that at some point he would be
coming to the Board with suggestions for making changes in the bylaws that
would increase the importance of items brought before the Board in order to


124




November Meeting, 1994


allow the Board to concentrate on the real consequential items for decisionmaking. It was decided that the administration would conduct a review of the
following issues: a) licensing of the University seal and registered trademarks;
b) the lines of authority that govern the relationship between the Board of
Regents and the Board in Control, as well as between the Board of Regents and
other University boards and entities; and c) the policies that govern the execution of contracts.
There being no further discussion, Regent Baker moved approval of the
development of South Ferry Field and the next phase of restoration of the
football stadium, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent Power
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved the following projects: renovation of unfinished space in
the Allan F. and Alene Smith Law Library Addition for creation of a rare book
room, and Fuller Road electrical power line relocation.
Consulting Agreement with Anjoy Research, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved a consulting agreement with Anjoy Research, Inc.
Because both the president of Anjoy (Claes G. Fornell), and chairman of the
board (Michael J. Ryan) are also professors in the School of Business Administration, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan conflict of interest statute.
The   following  information  is  provided   in  compliance  with   statutory
requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Anjoy Research,
Inc.
2.   The terms of the contract include that Anjoy Research, Inc., design questionnaires; conduct written surveys; provide customer satisfaction reports; use
unique proprietary model and statistical processes to measure and diagnose
customer and employee satisfaction; interpret results; and deliver the written
reports to the dean of the School of Business Administration.
3.   The contract will be for the years 1993 and 1994 ($48,000 for 1993 and $77,000
for 1994); total payment of $125,000.
Proposed License Agreement with Clark-MXR, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a proposed license agreement between the University of
Michigan and Clark-MXR, Inc. Because one of the shareholders in Clark-MXR,
Gerard Mourou, is also a University employee, this agreement falls under the
state of Michigan conflict of interest statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Clark-MXR, Inc.
2.   Terms of the contract include an exclusive license to Clark-MXR, Inc. (CMXR)
with a duration for the life of any patent which might issue on the invention.


125




November Meeting, 1994


CMXR will pay all patent expenses and will pay to the University a royalty of
$650.00 for each device sold and, starting in 1995, a minimum annual royalty of
$2,500.00. CMXR will also pay the University 50 percent of any revenues from
sublicenses. The University retains ownership of the invention and the right to
practice the invention for research and educational purposes. The University
also retains the right to grant a license to the United States government, as
may be required under the research sponsorship agreement. CMXR agrees to
use its best efforts to develop products and make the benefits of the invention
reasonably available to the public. There is no use of facilities or services of the
University included in the contract and no assignment of University employees
for fulfillment of the contract.
3.   The pecuniary interest is that Gerard Mourou owns 8.2 percent of the
outstanding shares of Clark-MXR, Inc. Professor Mourou has waived participation in royalties under the Regents' policy and will receive his return, if any,
solely through his ownership interest in the company.
Proposed License Agreement with Selective Technologies, Inc. (STI)
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved a proposed license agreement between the University of
Michigan and Selective Technologies, Inc. (STI). Because two University professors, Mark Meyerhoff and Glenn Martin, hold an equity interest in STI, this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan conflict of interest statute. The
following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and STI, a company in
which Professors Meyerhoff and Martin hold an equity interest.
2.   Contract terms include the following: payment to the University by STI of 4
percent of the net sales of products which incorporate selected technologies.
STI shall also pay to the University 15 percent of all gross sublicensing
revenues for revenues under $50,000 and 25 percent of all gross sublicensing
revenues once these revenues exceed $50,000. Beginning in 1997, an annual
license maintenance fee will be imposed which requires payment to the
University by STI of $1,000 for the first two years, and a fee of $2,000 imposed
for every subsequent year during the term of the agreement.
The agreement remains in effect until the latest patent expires or ten years after the first sale of product, whichever is earlier.
The University will retain ownership of the technology, granting an exclusive
commercialization license to STI. The University will retain the right to use
the technology internally.
STI will use its best efforts to effectively commercialize the programs and will
make reasonable attempts to manufacture all products within the United
States.
No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University
employees, is obligated under the agreement.
3.   The pecuniary interest of both employees arises from their ownership interest
in STI. In accordance with University policy, Professor Meyerhoff, as a coinventor, will waive any personal participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University from STI.


126




November Meeting, 1994


Capital Outlay Request, 1995-96, All Campuses
Executive Vice President Womack submitted a request for approval to
submit to the state of Michigan a number of projects for the 1995-96 capital
outlay request. Following some discussion, Regent Varner moved approval of the
1995-96 Capital Outlay Request for the Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint campuses. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Establishment of Instructional Departments in the School of Management at the University of Michigan-Dearborn
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved the establishment of two instructional departments in the
School of Management at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. The two departments are the Department of Accounting and Finance and the Department of
Management, Marketing, Information Systems and Decision Science.
Implementation of Regents' Bylaw Sec. 14.06
Regent Baker observed that he had been informed by the secretary that as
part of the implementation of Regents' Bylaw Sec. 14.06, the University would
begin offering benefits for same sex partners of University faculty and staff, effective January 1, 1995. He had asked to have this issue brought before the Regents
before the task force recommendations were implemented, and asked that the
benefits offering be delayed until such time as the Regents could review the
matter.
Provost Whitaker observed that following the meeting at which the bylaw
change was approved, the administration had proceeded to implement it, based
on the understanding that approval of the bylaw change meant that discrimination against groups included in the bylaw should cease as soon as legal issues
could be resolved.
Regent Baker said that he had not seen the general counsel's report on the
matter until he'd asked for it, and that the matter should have been fully
discussed by the Regents. Regent McGowan responded that with the Board's
approval of the bylaw change, the president and the administration had been
given the responsibility for implementing the nondiscrimination and affirmative
action policy. They had proceeded accordingly, as the Regents had directed, and
she appreciated the president's leadership on this issue.
Regent McFee stated that she stands by her original decision to approve the
bylaw, but had raised specific questions about the implementation when the
Regents had received the task force report in May 1994. She believed that there
had been an understanding that all of the Board would be kept apprised of the
implementation process as it developed. She said that she had not been apprised
by the administration that implementation had been moving forward, but rather
only learned it via a telephone call after letters had already been sent to staff
describing the new benefits policy. Regent McFee said that she had questions
about the legal opinion that the implementation had been based on and would
have appreciated having had an opportunity to discuss the matter prior to


127




November Meeting, 1994


implementation. Regent McFee said that because of the controversial nature of
the policy, implementation required a ful buy-in on the part of all of the Regents
as it went forward. The lack of communication between the administration and
the Board meant that this did not occur.
President Duderstadt agreed that communication was not handled
appropriately and accepted responsibility for the situation.
Regent Brown stated that he had not been informed in advance of the
implementation progress, either. His understanding was that the matter was to
have been brought back to the Board. He said that he supports the bylaw, but it
was not his understanding that it would extend to extension of benefits.
Regent McGowan pointed out that throughout the discussion, as indicated
in the minutes of the September 1993 and May 1994 meetings, it had been made
clear that the responsibility for implementation of the bylaw fell to the president
and his administration. Regent Deitch compared this issue to that of the Nike
contract that had been discussed earlier in the meeting, in which case the
Regents had not been involved in setting the policy regarding how the University
markets itself and how it defines its linkages with the private sector. In the case
of the bylaw, however, the Regents had been fully involved in setting the Board's
nondiscrimination policy and had left it to the president to implement.
Further discussion ensued, with Regent Baker stating that he had requested
that the issue be brought back to the Regents and that the matter should have
been discussed with all of the Regents prior to implementation. President
Duderstadt responded that he and all of the executive officers all believed that
they had been given the authority to move forward with implementation. There
was general consensus that there the issue of communication between the Board
and the administration needs to be addressed.
President's Salary
Regent Brown observed that under the Constitution of the state of Michigan, the Regents are obligated to set the salary of the president. He recalled that
last year the Regents had approved an equity adjustment for the president of
$16,666 per year for each of three years, and that this is the second year of that
program. For the merit portion of the president's salary increase, Regent Brown
moved an increase of 4.7 percent, which is equivalent to the average faculty
salary increase for 1994-95. Regent Deitch seconded the motion.
Regents Power and Brown pointed out that the equity adjustment is derived
from the Auxiliary Activities fimd, which does not include tax dollars. The vote
was then taken, and the motion was unanimously approved.
Public Comments
It was decided to hold the Public Comments session at 3:00 p.m., since there
was to be only one speaker, and she was in attendance at the meeting.


128




November Meeting, 1994


The Regents heard comments from Julie Neenan, president of the Michigan
Student Assembly, on the topic of student representation on the Board of
Regents. Regent McFee urged consideration of Ms. Neenan's proposal for
submission of a written report to be included with the Regents' monthly
agendas.
Adjournment
There being no further discussion, the meeting was adjourned at 3:10 p.m.
The next meeting will be held on December 15 and 16, 1994. Regents expenses
for the month of October 1994 totaled $238.21.


Harold R. Joh\json
Interim Secretary of the University

DECEMBER MEETING, 1994


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, December 15, 1994
The Regents met at 11:10 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, McGowan, Power, and
Varner. Secretary Johnson was also present, as were Provost Whitaker, Executive Vice President Womack, and Vice President Harrison. Vice Presidents
Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick, were absent.
Regents Deitch and Waters arrived shortly after the start of the meeting.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called on Regent McGowan, who made the following
motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed session on
December 15, 1994, to consider material exempt from discussion or
disclosure by the Michigan Freedom Information Act [Sec. 8(h)]. Such
exempt material consists of a written opinion from the Board's legal
counsel.
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously. The
meeting then continued in executive session.
Public Meeting
The Regents met in public session at 1:30 p.m. in the Regents' Room.
Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Deitch, McFee,
McGowan, Power, Varner, and Waters. Secretary Johnson was also present, as
were Provost Whitaker, Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents
Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal, and Chancellors Nelms and Renick.
Annual Report on Research for FY 1994
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Neal to present the Annual
Report on Research. Vice President Neal gave a multimedia presentation during
which he described the various kinds of research being conducted at the University, discussed issues related to funding, described the relationship between
research and instruction and what it is like to be a faculty researcher, and
addressed how the University will be affected by changes in research priorities
and funding occurring at the national level.
Vice President Neal reported that for the fourth consecutive year, the
University of Michigan is ranked first among all public universities nationally in
total research and development expenditures ($385,957,402 for FY1994), and
that since 1991, it has ranked second among all colleges and universities


131




December Meeting, 1994


nationally in these expenditures. He described efforts both on a national level
and at the University of Michigan to develop a national research philosophy and
policy.
Vice President Neal displayed graphs and charts showing trends in research
expenditures and breakdowns of these expenditures into various funding source
categories. After detailing recent accomplishments of the Office of the Vice President for Research, he concluded by showing a videotape in which researchers
around the University described their current projects.
Following his presentation, Vice President Neal thanked outgoing Regents
Brown and Waters for their support over the years and responded to comments
from the Regents.
Michigan Health Corporation
President Duderstadt called on Executive Vice President Womack; Mr. John
Forsyth, executive director of the University of Michigan Hospitals; and Dr. Giles
Bole, dean of the School of Medicine, to discuss the establishment of a subsidiary
health corporation. Executive Vice President Womack described the corporation
as a vehicle through which the University can participate in the development of a
managed care delivery system so as to both maintain and enhance the education
and research missions of the institution. He noted that this proposal was being
made in response to the reforms taking place in the health care delivery system
as well as in recognition of the fact that the current tertiary care system would
not be able to provide the kinds of training experiences needed by medical
students.
Mr. Forsyth pointed out that this proposal is rooted in the University's
academic mission and is consistent with the leadership position that the
University has traditionally held in relation to other academic health centers
nationally. The establishment of a separate corporation provides a platform for
adjusting to future change, as the nation moves from a fee for service to a
managed care health care delivery systems, while at the same time continuing to
serve the needs of the people of the state and the medical school. The separate
corporation will provide the structure and flexibility needed for the Hospitals to
continue to be a national leader in health care delivery.
Dean Bole observed that this proposal is unique and, combined with the
new Medical School curriculum and new East Medical Campus, will allow the
University to move forward in a time of uncertainty. He described the proposal
as "revolutionary," one that has no counterpart at any other institution, and that
is intimately tied to positioning the University to be the "last survivor" of the
academic health system.
Regent Varner moved approval of the concept, plan, and process for
establishing and operating a University of Michigan Subsidiary Health
Corporation to pursue managed care interests for the Medical Center, as outlined
in the Regents Communication. Regent Brown seconded the motion. Executive
Vice President Womack pointed out that the list of officers shown in the Regents


132




December Meeting, 1994


Communication should be corrected to show John Forsyth as "president and
treasurer," not "treasurer" as stated, since he will be the principal operating
officer.
Regents Baker and McFee expressed support for the proposal, noting that it
will enhance the University's service function by helping to improve health care
for citizens state-wide.
Regent McGowan read from a prepared statement, in which she expressed
support for the due diligence that the administration had pursued in preparing
this proposal. A copy of Regent McGowan's statement is on file in the Office of
the Secretary of the University. She noted that the president and other administrators had obtained legal opinions and had also assured the Regents that they
personally believe this proposal to be in the best interest of the University in its
mission of training health care professionals, and that she intended to support
the proposal. However, Regent McGowan emphasized that she "did not intend to
give one inch on the constitutional responsibility of the Board of Regents to exercise on behalf of the people of Michigan fll fiduciary and legal responsibilities for
the actions of this university." She noted that if in the future she had any
concerns as to whether the Michigan Health Corporation would impede that
oversight responsibility, she would not hesitate to assure "appropriate
alterations."
Regent Power expressed support for Regent McGowan's comments and for
the establishment of the corporation as a means for enabling the University to
continue to carry out its basic mission of education, research, and service. Regent
Varner also supported the proposition, but expressed concerns about the
Regents' ability to provide adequate oversight, given that the bylaws only call for
annual meetings. She requested that quarterly reports be provided to the
Regents during the initial period of the corporation's establishment.
President Duderstadt observed that in the early stages of the development
of M-Care, the Board of Regents received reports at least quarterly as well as any
time important decisions were involved. Similarly, more frequent reporting to
the Board is appropriate and is planned during the early years of the Michigan
Health Corporation, until such time as the Regents decide that less frequent
reporting will suffice.
Regent Deitch reported that over the past several months the Regents had
had extensive dialogue with leaders of the administration about this venture, and
that the administration had responded forthrightly to all concerns expressed by
the Regents. He noted that the University "intends to go out and be extraordinarily competitive and extraordinarily creative" in maintaining the excellence
with which it has long been associated, and that the Regents are "absolutely
united" and "absolutely confident" behind the leadership of the institution.
Regent Brown also expressed support for the proposal, while observing that
the basic reason for it is to serve the educational needs of students in the health
care field.


133




December Meeting, 1994


There being no further comments, the vote was taken, and the motion to
establish the Michigan Health Corporation was approved unanimously. The
Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Michigan Health Corporation are
included with the Regents Conmmunication on file in the Office of the Secretary of
the University.
Student Representation on the Board of Regents
Regent Waters stated that he had intended to offer a resolution to have a
member of the student body serve as an ex officio member of the Board of
Regents, but that he was withdrawing the proposal at this time, with the
understanding that the issue would be on the agenda at the February 1995 meeting. He invited Ms. Julie Neenan, president of the Michigan Student Assembly,
to the table to discuss the issue of student representation on the Board of
Regents.
Ms. Neenan reported that this notion had been placed before the students at
the MSA election the preceding March and had been approved by 97 percent of
the students who voted. Ms. Neenan addressed some of the concerns that had
been raised, including questions of constitutionality and of the possibility that
other constituencies would also seek representation on the Board. She also
pointed out that many other universities around the state and nation have
students represented on their boards.
Regent McFee complimented Ms. Neenan on her presentation and said she
was looking forward to discussing this issue when it comes up on the agenda in
1995. President Duderstadt observed that there appeared to be strong interest
among the Regents in improving the Board's dialogue with the student body and
in providing additional opportunities for input. Ms. Neenan thanked Regent Waters for bringing this issue before the Board.
Minutes
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved the minutes of the meeting of November 17, 1994.
Consent Agenda
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports on investments, plant extension, litigation, and personnel-labor relations. He commented
on the recently reported bankruptcy of Orange County, California, which was
reported in the media to be related to the county's use of derivatives and leverage
as investment vehicles. Executive Vice President Womack observed that these
tools were not to blame; rather the mistake was in adopting an inappropriately
risky investment strategy that was entirely at odds with the purpose of the fund.
He explained that the University's use of derivatives and leverage is appropriate
in the context of its entire investment strategy, which employs diversification as
a key means of decreasing risk.


134




December Meeting, 1994


Following some discussion about investment strategies, Vice President Neal
submitted reports of projects established and summaries of a selection of current
research for the month of November 1994.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear submitted the report of
voluntary support and announced that the Campaign for Michigan had reached a
level of $706 million.

Retirement Memoirs
Allan R. Emery, professor of chemistry at the University of MichiganDearborn, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1994, after a
most productive career as a teacher, researcher, and computer specialist.
Professor Emery received his B.A degree from Ohio Wesleyan University in
1951, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry from the University of Michigan in 1953 and 1957, respectively. From     1958-60, he was employed by the
Mobil Oil Corporation, where he began programming computers to perform
various calculations related to the kinetics of hydrocarbon reactions.
In 1960, Professor Emery arrived at the University's newly-established
Dearborn campus as an assistant professor of chemistry. His first assignment
was to establish the academic program in chemistry and to outfit the chemistry
laboratories with appropriate apparatus and instrumentation. He then turned
his attention toward introducing computer usage into the laboratories, particularly into the physical chemistry laboratory. He was promoted to associate
professor in 1964 and professor in 1968.
Professor Emery's interests in computer technology led to his involvement
in the early development of the Michigan Terminal Systems (MTS) during a
sabbatical leave in 1966.   Following the leave, Professor Emery continued
working with the MTS system half-time until 1969 and was instrumental in the
installation of the first MTS remote batch station on the Dearborn campus.
From 1969-88, Professor Emery held several increasingly responsible positions at
the UM-Ann Arbor Computing Center. As assistant director (1969-72), he
devoted much time to the expansion of the center's physical facilities, including
all building phases of the then new Computing Center. As associate director
(1972-77), acting director (1977-78), and then deputy director (1979-88), he
helped further develop the physical facilities, expand the hardware facilities,
formulate and implement policies for improvement of computing services for
both mainframe and personal computers, and review financial plans for the
Computing Center.


144




December Meeting, 1994


In 1989, Professor Emery rejoined the faculty at the University of MichiganDearborn, where he has continued implementation of computer usage in both introductory general chemistry courses and advanced physical chemistry laboratory experiments.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physical chemist for his dedicated
service by naming Allan R. Emery professor emeritus of chemistry.
William C. Kelly, C. Scott Turner Professor of Geological Sciences and
former vice president for research, retired from active faculty status on August
31, 1994, after a highly productive career as a teacher, researcher, and
administrator.
Professor Kelly received his AB. degree in 1951 from Columbia College and
his AM. and Ph.D. degrees in 1953 and 1954, respectively, from Columbia
University. He served briefly as an instructor at Hunter College and then joined
the U.S. Army Operations Research Office, where he served from 1954-56.
Professor Kelly came to the University of Michigan in 1956 as an instructor in
geology and mineralogy. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1958, associate professor in 1962, and professor in 1967. He was appointed the C. Scott
Turner Professor of Geological Sciences in 1983. Professor Kelly served as chair
of the Department of Geology and Mineralogy from 1978-81 and as interim director of the Institute of Science and Technology from 1986-87. He was appointed
associate vice president for research in January 1989 and interim vice president
for research in July 1989. He served as vice president for research from 1990-93.
Throughout his career, Professor Kelly was noted for his imaginative and
thorough research. He undertook major studies of tin deposits in Bolivia,
tin-tungsten deposits in Portugal, copper deposits in Michigan, and gold-telluride
deposits in Colorado. He also developed innovative research methods, including
the analysis of fluid inclusion contents by electron microbeam methods. His
work has been widely recognized by his peers through many awards, including
the prestigious Penrose Award of the Society of Economic Geologists.
Professor Kelly also excelled as a scientific citizen and teacher. He served
the Society of Economic Geologists in a succession of posts, culminating in the
presidency in 1984. He was advisor or co-advisor for 37 master's degree and 27
Ph.D. students, many of whom went on to success in industry, academia, and
government. Perhaps the best indication of the esteem in which he is held is the
fact that 25 of his former students, from the U.S., Canada, Venezuela, and Switzerland, came to a recent dinner in honor of his retirement.
The Regents now salute his achievements by naming William C. Kelly vice
president emeritus for research and C. Scott Turner Professor Emeritus of
Geological Sciences.
Jack L. Kostyo, professor of physiology in the Medical School, will retire
from active faculty status on December 31, 1994, after a long and productive
career.
A native of Ohio, Professor Kostyo received his AB. degree from Oberlin
College in 1953 and his Ph.D. degree from Cornell University in 1957. He
pursued further research training at Harvard University, and in 1959 he joined
the faculty of Duke University as assistant professor of physiology. He was
promoted to associate professor in 1961 and professor in 1966. In 1968, he


145




December Meeting, 1994


moved to Emory University, where he served eleven years as professor and chair
of the Department of Physiology.
In 1979, Professor Kostyo joined the University of Michigan as professor
and chair of the Department of Physiology. As department chair, he played a key
role in developing strength in new areas of cellular physiology. Since 1986, he
has served as professor of physiology and associate director of the Michigan
Diabetes Research and Training Center. A dedicated teacher, Professor Kostyo's
enormous breadth of knowledge in endocrinology contributed to his insightful
and comprehensive lectures, which were always exceptionally well received. His
interest in teaching also led to his involvement in the National Board of Medical
Examiners.
Professor Kostyo's research concerns the action of growth hormone on its
target cells, particularly muscle and fat, and its role in metabolic alterations
associated with diabetes. He is a world renowned expert on structure-function
relationships in the growth hormone molecule, and he also developed a unique
animal model to study the diabetogenic effects of growth hormone. Professor
Kostyo is a recipient of the Endocrine Society's Ernest Oppenheimer Memorial
Award and received an honorary M.D. degree from the University of Gbteborg.
He has played leadership roles in a number of scientific societies, including the
American Physiological Society and the Endocrine Society, and he served as
editor of the journal Endocrinology.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated
service by naming Jack L. Kostyo professor emeritus of physiology.
William  P. Malm, professor of music (music history/musicology), will
retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1994.
Professor Malm studied at Northwestern University, earning his B.M.
degree in music composition in 1949 and his M.M. degree in 1950. He then
served for one year as an instructor at the University of Illinois, followed by
military service as an instructor at the U.S. Naval School of Music in
Washington, D.C. (1951-53). After another year as a free-lance pianist and
composer in New York City, Professor Maim continued his graduate education at
UCLA, where he received his Ph.D. degree in ethnomusicology in 1959 and
served as a lecturer in music from 1958-60. He came to the University of Michigan as an assistant professor of music in 1960; he was promoted to associate
professor in 1963 and professor in 1966.
In 1966, Professor Malm received the University's Henry Russel Award.
Many other awards and grants followed, including support from the American
Council of Learned Societies, the Rockefeller Foundation, Exxon Foundation,
Japan Foundation, and several substantial subventions from the National
Endowment for the Humanities. Professor Maim held distinguished visiting
professorships at Baylor University (1977), the University of California at
Berkeley (1981), and the University of Iowa (1982), and has lectured at countless
institutions of higher learning in this country and abroad. He was awarded
Northwestern University's Alumni Merit Award in 1986, and was honored by
alumni of the University of Michigan School of Music that same year.
In addition to dozens of published articles, Professor Maim is the author of
six major books, among which Music Cultures of the Pacific, the Near East, and
Asia (Prentice-Hall, 1966; second edition, 1977), also translated into Japanese


146




December Meeting, 1994


and Spanish, must be regarded as especially influential. A new dimension was
added to Professor Malm's distinguished scholarship and teaching in 1980, when
he was appointed director of the Stearns Collection of Musical Instruments.
With typical elan, he brought the collection from the sidelines to center stage in
the life of the University community.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming William P. Malm
professor emeritus of music (music history/musicology).
Joseph N. Payne, professor of mathematics education, will retire from
active faculty status on December 31, 1994, after 37 years of service to the
University of Michigan.
Professor Payne received his B.S. degree from Roanoke College in 1949 and
his M.Ed. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Virginia in 1951 and 1955,
respectively.  He taught mathematics and science in secondary schools in
Virginia, Alabama, and Wisconsin from 1949-56 and was a visiting lecturer at the
University of Wisconsin from 1956-57. Professor Payne came to the University
of Michigan in 1957 as assistant professor in the School of Education and teacher
of mathematics at the University School. He was promoted to associate professor
in 1961 and professor in 1964. From 1975-76, he served as program manager in
mathematics, education directorate, National Science Foundation.
Within the School of Education, Professor Payne taught courses in elementary and middle school mathematics education and conducted research in mathematics instruction. He worked extensively with undergraduates and graduate
students, and received consistently excellent student evaluations. His committee
service included the School of Education Executive Committee and the Senate
Advisory Committee on University Affairs (chair, 1969-70). Most recently, he
has served as the university coordinator for the Carpenter Professional Development School, an outgrowth of the Michigan Partnership for New Education.
This project involves working with public school teachers and students and with
University students to research and develop innovative instructional methods,
which are then put to use in the classroom.
Throughout his career, Professor Payne has been very active in professional
organizations, has consulted widely, and has been a frequent presenter at conferences and workshops. His recent scholarly publications include co-authorship of
chapters in Research Ideas for the Classroom: Early Childhood Mathematics,
edited by R. Jensen (Macmillan, 1993), and Mathematics for the Young Child
(NCTM, 1990). In 1959, Professor Payne co-authored (with A. Coxford) the
Algebra I and Algebra II series for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich; the books were
revised several times, most recently in 1990.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Joseph N. Payne
professor emeritus of mathematics education.
Tahir M. Rizki, professor of zoology in the Department of Biology, will
retire from active faculty status on December 31, 1994, following 33 years of
active service.
After receiving his B.S. (1944) and M.S. (1946) degrees in his native India,
Professor Rizki studied at Columbia University, from which he received his
Ph.D. degree in 1953. Following postdoctoral research appointments at Dartmouth College and Yale University, he was a faculty member at Reed College


147




December Meeting, 1994


from 1956-61. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as associate professor of zoology in 1961, and was promoted to professor in 1964. He has also been
a member of the University's Cancer Institute since 1986.
Professor Rizki has taught introductory and advanced courses, at both the
undergraduate and graduate level. Most of his teaching involved genetics; he
showed special skill in explaining not only basic genetics, but in showing how
genetic analysis illuminates fundamental processes in cellular and developmental
biology. Forty honors undergraduates, nine doctoral students, and several postdoctoral fellows studied under his direction.
Throughout his career, Professor Rizki collaborated closely in research with
his wife, Rose M. Rizki, who retired as a research scientist in the Department of
Biology in 1992. More than half of his 129 research publications are co-authored
with Rose Rizki. Their long collaboration is regarded with great respect both
inside and outside the department.
Professor Rizki's studies embraced a broad range of topics, extending from
the morphology and inter-specific competition to the biochemistry, cell biology,
development, and physiology of the celebrated fruit-fly, Drosophila. He is an
authority on blood cells, the genesis of melanotic tumors, and the insect's fat
body, which is somewhat analogous to the vertebrate liver. His recent research
on the mechanism by which a virus-like entity overcomes a host insect's defense
mechanisms opens new concepts of immune reactions in living organisms.
In appreciation of his many contributions, the Regents now salute this
faculty member by naming Tahir M. Rizki professor emeritus of zoology.
Stephen J. Tonsor, professor of history, retired from active faculty status
on August 31, 1994, following a long and active career as a teacher and writer.
Born in 1923 in Jerseyville, Illinois, he attended the University of Illinois
where, after interrupting his studies for three years of military service, he
received his AB. degree in 1948. He then studied at the universities of Zurich
(1948-49) and Munich (1953-54) and received his Ph.D. degree in history at the
University of Illinois in 1955.
Professor Tonsor joined the University of Michigan as an instructor in
history in 1954. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1959, associate
professor in 1964, and professor in 1971. The Distinguished Teacher Award he
received in 1962 attests to his success and devotion to teaching at all levels, from
undergraduate introductory surveys to upper-level courses, to graduate courses.
Professor Tonsor also guided a number of graduate students in their pursuit of
doctoral degrees in European intellectual and cultural history of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
In addition to his work as a scholar, Professor Tonsor has for some time
been well known in the broader community outside the University. In scores of
articles and reviews, he has addressed both academic and nonacademic
audiences, sometimes separately and sometimes simultaneously. The numerous
themes he has treated-youth and education, the meaning of equality, religion,
historiography, culture, and others-have resonated widely and brought Professor Tonsor broad recognition. In 1972-73, he was the senior visiting research
fellow at the Hoover Institution, in 1969-72 he was consultant to the President's
Council of Economic Advisers, and for many years he has been closely associated


148




December Meeting, 1994


with the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. Since 1970,
he has been associate editor of Modern Age.
The Regents now salute this distinguished historian for his dedicated service
by naming Stephen J. Tonsor professor emeritus of history.
Memorial Statements
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death on October 22, 1994, of Paul KI Garlick, assistant professor
of mathematics at the University of Michigan-Flint.
Professor Garlick was born in Highland Park, Michigan, on November 1,
1938. He received his B.A. degree from Oakland University in 1963 and his
Ph.D. degree from New Mexico State University in 1974. He joined the faculty of
the University of Michigan-Flint in 1969.
As a mathematician, Paul was an algebraist, but his real specialty was problems. Throughout his career, he contributed interesting problems and ingenious
solutions in many branches of mathematics, in publication as well as in conversation with colleagues. His love of problems also inspired many students. In addition to his regular teaching duties, Paul spent countless hours preparing high
school and university students for a variety of mathematical problem-solving
competitions.
Paul's contributions to faculty governance were characterized by a deep
concern for the University of Michigan-Flint and uncanny insight into the
practical effects of complex proposals. A perennial member of the Nominating
Committee, he knew the faculty as well as anyone and had the essential feel for
people that that job requires.
His colleagues will long remember his unique view of life and incomparable
sense of humor. As we mourn his loss, our condolences go to his wife Inge, and
his sons, Xan, Thor, and David.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death on November 28, 1994, of Mark Stuart Roth, associate
professor of internal medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology.
Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on November 14, 1955, Dr. Roth received
his M.D. degree from the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1981. Later in that
year, he came to the University of Michigan, where he pursued post-graduate
training in internal medicine (1981-84) and in the subspecialties of hematology
and medical oncology (1984-86). In 1986, he was appointed to the faculty of the
Department of Internal Medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology as an
instructor. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1988 and then to associate
professor with tenure in 1993.
Dr. Roth specialized in the molecular genetics of cancer and was a pioneer in
the application of novel molecular technologies (e.g. the "polymerase chain reaction") to the detection of minimal residual tumors. By this approach, he was able
to identify individuals at high risk for relapse of their cancers (e.g. the recurrence
of leukemia after bone marrow transplantation) in advance of the usual signs
and symptoms of cancer recurrence. His development of sensitive molecular
assays to predict early relapse in high risk patients may make it possible to target
these individuals for aggressive and potentially curative forms of therapy.


149




December Meeting, 1994


As a leader in this new field of molecular medicine, Dr. Roth was the recipient of major grant awards from the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense (Breast Cancer Initiative), the American Cancer Society, and the
Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan. He was the author of 27 published articles in the peer-reviewed medical literature, 4 book chapters, and numerous abstracts. At the time of his death, he was editing a book on the subject
of the molecular diagnosis of cancer (to be published posthumously). Dr. Roth
was a member of the American Society of Hematology and the Central Society
for Clinical Research; he was a scientific and medical consultant for the Blood
Center of Southeastern Wisconsin.
In addition to his scientific achievements, Dr. Roth was a talented and
highly respected clinical specialist (a "doctor's doctor" who was chosen by his
peers as their personal physician), and a mainstay of the University Hospitals'
Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Program. Moreover, he was widely recognized as being among the department's best medical educators serving as clinical
mentor for medical students and physician trainees.
Despite the pressures of his busy academic life, Dr. Roth was a devoted
father to his children, Sarah and Daniel, and to his wife Janet. An avid sports
enthusiast, he always found time to be coach and cheerleader for his children's
many athletic activities. Active in community service, Dr. Roth spent part of his
vacations serving as a volunteer physician at "Camp Catch-A-Rainbow," a camp
for children with cancer, and also served on the medical advisory board of the
Children's Leukemia Foundation (1990-91).
Mark will be remembered as a dear friend, an uncompromising family man,
a loyal faculty colleague, a compassionate and trusted doctor, an inspiring
teacher, and a "rising star" physician-scientist whose sudden and premature
death at age 39 is a profound and incalculable loss. As we mourn his death, our
condolences go to his wife Janet, his son Daniel, and his daughter Sarah.

December Meeting, 1994


Resolution in Honor of Regent Paul W. Brown
President Duderstadt observed that three individuals would be ending their
official association with the Board of Regents at the conclusion of this meeting,
and called first on Regent Baker, who read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend their deep
appreciation and warmest personal regards to their colleague and
friend, Paul W. Brown, as he concludes 24 years of distinguished
service as a member of the Board of Regents.
Paul Brown's ties to both the state and the University are strong
and deep. He grew up in Detroit and earned both his bachelor's and
J.D. degrees from the University in 1956 and 1961, respectively. He
then settled in northern Michigan, where for over 30 years he has
balanced a successful legal career in Petoskey and his position as
chair of Arnold Transit Company in Mackinac Island with major
contributions in the area of public service.
During the 24 years of his service as Regent, Paul Brown
witnessed extraordinary changes in the University and had a major
role in directing its responses to challenges arising both within the
institution itself and in the society it serves. Merely to list them
suggests the demanding nature of the role he has so ably fulfilled.
They include issues associated with the Black Action Movement, the
debate over investments in South Africa, controversies over DNA and
classified research, the Replacement Hospital Project and
development of the Medical Center, economic recession, diminution
of state support for higher education, and the expansion and
rebuilding of the central campus. In addition, he has been an
informed and clear voice on matters of intercollegiate athletics and
an advocate for the concerns of citizens of northern Michigan.
He and his wife, the former Linda Margaret (Meg) Hyatt, met
while both were students at the University; they were married in
1961. Meg and their four children, Lynn, Katie, Marlee (UM, 1988),
and Bing (UM    class of 1996), have over the years shared in
important ways Paul's work for and devotion to the University of
Michigan.
The Regents thus salute Paul Brown for his devoted career as a
Regent and his exemplary dedication to the University's values. The
Regents trust that he will continue to serve his beloved university in
other ways as they name Paul W. Brown Regent Emeritus of the
University of Michigan.
There followed a round of applause. Regent Brown th ed thked  e Regents for
the resolution and introduced his wife, Meg Brown, who, he noted, had always
been supportive of his efforts on behalf of the University. He observed that it had


156




December Meeting, 1994


been a privilege to have served as a Regent for the past 24 years and to have been
associated with the executive officers and staff, and he looked forward to continuing to being helpful wherever he could.
Resolution in Honor of James L. Waters
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend their warm
thanks and appreciation to their friend and valued colleague, James
L. Waters, as he concludes 24 years of dedicated service as a member
of the Board of Regents.
From the early years of his association with the University of
Michigan, Jim Waters has taken an active leadership role in matters
related to racial and cultural diversity. A native of Dowagiac, he
graduated from  Western Michigan University in 1967 and then
enrolled in the University of Michigan Law   School. There, he
assumed leadership roles as a member of the student board of
directors in 1968-69, chair of the Black Law School Student Alliance
in 1969-70, and a leader of the Black Action Movement (BAM). He
received his J.D. degree in 1970 and currently heads his own
thriving law practice in Muskegon: the James L. Waters Law Firm.
During his service as Regent, Jim Waters has helped shape the
University's responses to a great many educational and social issues.
These include efforts to expand minority enrollment; the debate over
investments in South Africa; major growth in the University
Hospitals and the Medical Center; ethical controversies surrounding
DNA, classified research, and guarantees of nondiscrimination; and
the continuing struggle to secure for the University a level of funding
commensurate with its mission. In all of his work on these matters,
Jim has been a particularly influential spokesperson on matters of
social justice and diversity.
Jim has been married to his high school sweetheart, the former
Nancy Finley, since 1959, and she has been a strong supporter of his
efforts on behalf of the University. Their son, Mark, led no doubt by
his parents' wise counsel, also attended the University of Michigan,
graduating in 1983.
The Regents wish him   Godspeed as he continues his work
toward the achievement of equity and social justice for all of the
state's citizens. In recognition of his steadfast devotion to the
University over the past 24 years, the Regents now name James L.
Waters Regent Emeritus of the University of Michigan.
There followed a round of applause, after which Regent Waters noted that it
had been a pleasure and an honor to have served on the Board of Regents. He
thanked the Michigan Democratic Party for having given him the opportunity to


157




December Meeting, 1994


serve and noted that he and Regent Brown had campaigned together four times
and that he would miss serving with him on the Board. He stated that he would
always have an interest in the University of Michigan, especially in the area of
student issues, minorities, women, and labor relations, and would continue his
relationship with the University.
Comments by Regent Baker
Regent Baker observed that he had worked with both Regents Brown and
Waters for 22 years and that they were "good and honorable men". He recalled
their having watched each other's children grow up and noted that Regent
Brown's wise and quiet judgment had been helpful to the University many times.
He related a personal anecdote about comments he had made during the time of
BAM II regarding the poor preparation for college provided by inner-city high
schools, when Regent Waters and former Vice President Henry Johnson had
been the only two people at the University who had made it a point to tell him
they agreed with him.
Resolution in Honor of Harold R. Johnson
Referring to Secretary Johnson, President Duderstadt recalled all of the
roles he had served at the University over the years, and noted that he would
now be beginning his retirement furlough. He called on Regent McGowan, who
read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan salute Harold R.
Johnson as he steps down from his role as interim secretary of the
university. In this position, he has served the University with the
same dedication and skill that he has brought to other posts he has
held throughout his long and distinguished career. Professor of
social work and of health education and health behavior, director of
the Institute of Gerontology, dean of the School of Social Work,
special counsel to the president-wherever he has served, Harold has
brought to his work an acute intelligence and a gift for solving
organizational problems. In postponing his retirement furlough to
accept the secretary's job, he placed the University's needs and
welfare above his own, displaying the commitment to community
service that has marked his career from the beginning.
The   communities  that  have   benefited  from  Harold's
considerable skills have been many and varied, including organized
labor in Canada and the United States, community service
organizations in Detroit, the world-wide community of the aging
served by the Institute of Gerontology, and finally the scholarly
community of the School of Social Work and all of the individuals
and agencies who gained from that faculty's research and their
development of methods for the delivery of social services.


158




December Meeting, 1994


When he came to the Fleming Building in 1993 after his long
and meritorious service as dean of the School of Social Work, Harold
surely did not imagine that he would be pressed into service as
secretary of the university. Not only did he accept the call, but he has
served the Regents admirably, sharing the wisdom gathered from his
long service in the University and the sagacity developed over his
lifetime of involvement in the political world.
Now the Regents, speaking both in their own right and on
behalf of the University of Michigan community, thank Harold R.
Johnson for his thoughtful and devoted service throughout his
career, and especially as interim secretary of the university. As he
finally begins his retirement furlough, the Regents express their hope
and belief that the coming years will bring him not merely
well-deserved leisure, but continuing opportunities to exercise the
considerable gift for service to others that has been his trademark.
Following a round of applause, Secretary Johnson thanked the Regents for
their kind words.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Carmen Crosby, student and president of the board of directors of the
Ann Arbor Tenants Union (AATU), Amelia Tuminaro, student and member of
the board of directors of the AATU, Jonathan Freeman, member of MSA and
Jim Schaafsma, secretary of the AATU board of directors, all in favor of a
proposed MSA student fee increase for the Ann Arbor Tenants Union; and Craig
Greenberg and Jessie Halliday, students, regarding student representation on
the Board of Regents.
Presentation: University Outreach (Educational/Service) Programs
Vice President Harrison observed that the University is a leader in providing community service to the citizens of the state, and to hhlilght some of the
programs, introduced Jeffrey Lehman, dean of the Law School. Dean Lehman
described the Program in Legal Assistance for Urban Communities as an outstanding example of how theory and practice can work together. This clinical
program is designed to involve law students in the provision of technical assistance to community based organizations in Detroit. He introduced Rochelle
Lento, clinical assistant professor of law and executive director of the program.
Professor Lento described the work of the program, after which Kim Easter,
Franz Herbert, Michelle Askew, and Michael Tennbush, students involved in the
program, described their experiences.
Next, Paula Allen-Meares, dean of the School of Social Work, described the
importance of community service programs, and introduced Charlene Johnson,
executive director of the Michigan Neighborhood Partnership Program, and
Susan Ronko, a student intern in the program. Ms. Johnson and Ms. Ronko
described the program and how it benefits all who are involved with it. Ms. Johnson also showed a videotape giving highlights of the program's accomplishments.


159




December Meeting, 1994

provided in subsection (2).
(2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal, after stopping before entering the crosswalk on the near side
of the intersection or at a limit line when marked or, if
none, then before entering the intersection, shall be privileged to make a right turn from a one-way or two-way
street into a two-way street or into a one-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the right turn, or a left turn
from a one-way or two-way street into a one-way street
carrying traffic in the direction of the left turn, unless prohibited by sign, signal, marking, light, or other traffic control device. The vehicular traffic shall yield the right of
way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk

traffic control device or any railroad sign or signal. Every such prohibited sign,
signal or marking is hereby declared to be a nuisance and the Director of Public
Safety or the Director's written designee is hereby empowered to remove the
same or cause it to be removed without notice. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection upon private property adjacent to streets of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that can not be mistaken for traffic signs or
signals.
(7) Emerging from Alley or Private Way. The driver of a vehicle
about to enter or cross a street from an alley, private road or driveway shall

right of way to the vehicle on the right, provided, however, where signs bearing
the message "Yield Right of Way" are erected upon the approach to an intersection, a driver approaching such sign shall slow to a reasonable speed for existing
conditions of traffic and visibility, yielding the right of way to all traffic on the
intersecting street which is so close as to constitute an immediate hazard. The
driver of any vehicle traveling at an unlawful speed shall forfeit any right of way
which the driver might otherwise have hereunder.
(11)   Right of Way - Left Turn. The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left shall yield the right of way to any vehicle

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1995


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, February 16, 1995
The Regents met at 10:45 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Homing, McFee, McGowan, Newman, and
Power. Interim Secretary Jensen was also present, as were Provost Whitaker and
Vice President Harrison. Regents Deitch and Varner, Executive Vice President
Womack, Vice Presidents Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal, and Chancellors Nelms
and Renick were absent.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called on Regent McGowan, who made the following
motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(f) and 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in
closed session on February 16, 1995, in the Regents' Room, for the
purposes of reviewing the specific contents of applications for
employment for which the candidates have requested confidentiality
[Sec. 8(f)]; and considering material exempt from discussion or
disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act [Sec. 8(h)].
Such exempt material consists of a written opinion from the Board's
legal counsel.
Regent Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then continued in executive session.
Public Meeting
The Regents met at 1:35 p.m. in the Regents Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Homing, McFee, McGowan, Newman, and
Power. Interim Secretary Jensen was also present, as were Provost Whitaker and
Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal, and Chancellors Nelms
and Renick. Regents Deitch and Varner and Executive Vice President Womack
were absent. Associate Vice President Chandler Matthews attended in place of
Executive Vice President Womack.
President Duderstadt welcomed Regents Andrea Fischer Newman and
Daniel D. Homing to their first Regents' Meeting. He observed that the
Regents' Meetings were being restructured so that the Thursday afternoon
sessions would focus on a discussion of key strategic issues facing the University
and the Friday morning sessions would be reserved for the regular business
meeting. At the beginning of the Thursday afternoon sessions, the president,
provost, and chief financial officer would make brief reports on the state of the
University to set the tone for subsequent discussions.


207




February Meeting, 1995


President's Report to the Board
President Duderstadt stated that "today, the University of Michigan is
better, stronger, more diverse, and more exciting than at any time in recent
history." He then proceeded to substantiate those comments with data about the
University's top rankings in various measures of academic excellence, its fmaancial health, the diversity of its students, faculty and staff, and the rebuilding of
the physical plant. The president then reviewed the major challenges facing the
University, focusing on those posed by changing priorities at the federal level,
decreasing levels of state support, and assaults on university autonomy. He
concluded by noting some of the specific "challenges of the moment" which the
Regents will have to think through and deal with in the months to come.
Provost's Report to the Board
Student Academic Services. Provost Whitaker began with a review of
major improvements in student academic services that have been introduced by
Laura Patterson, the university registrar, as well as efforts that are underway to
further enhance student services.  He commended the registrar, who was
present, for the leadership she has exhibited in improving the registration
process, making it easier for students to access their own academic records and
other computerized information, and generally streamlining a variety of
procedures.
Governor's Budget Proposal. Provost Whitaker reported that the governor had proposed an across-the-board increase of 3 percent for all universities,
but had targeted three institutions to receive additional funding. The three institutions had been targeted according to their "Carnegie classification," rather than
according to their mission, programmatic offerings, student body, etc., which are
the factors upon which the University of Michigan believes funding should be
based. Under the Carnegie classification groupings, Michigan State had been
targeted to receive $300 more per student in additional funding, Western Michigan University would receive $200 more per student, and Grand Valley State
University would receive $100 more per student than the other state universities.
Provost Whitaker displayed charts illustrating a 20-year history of state
appropriations to the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Michigan State
University, and Wayne State University. If the governor's recommendation were
to be approved, Michigan State and Wayne State would both receive more money
per fiscal year equated student than UM-Ann Arbor, in addition to the higher
percentage increase that Michigan State would receive. This is in contrast to
what has been the pattern in the past.
President Duderstadt commented that enrollment at the UM Ann Arbor
campus is now larger than that of Michigan State. For the past 20 years, when
enrollment at MSU was higher than the UM enrollment, the appropriation per
student at the Ann Arbor campus was higher, and the opposite was the case
when UM enrollment was higher. But the method of calculating the appropriations was consistent and both institutions cooperated in their dealings with the
legislature. The current proposal, which would increase the ULM's appropriation


208




February Meeting, 1995


by $8 million and MSU's by $18 million, would break the long-standing equilibrium by introducing competition among public higher education institutions and
would raise a significant public policy issue.
A discussion followed, during which the Regents and president and provost
commented on various aspects of the governor's proposal.
Value Centered Management. Provost Whitaker gave a presentation on
value centered management, which is a method of internal budget allocation that
the University is going to use to replace the current method, which is based on
incremental budgeting. Under the new method, there are two funds, one fund
consisting of revenue generated by the unit, and the other being revenue
allocated to the unit from the unrestricted fnmds of the institution.
Provost Whitaker displayed diagrams illustrating the old and new budgeting
methods. He observed that the proposal had been widely disseminated and
discussed at the University, and two major concerns had been expressed. One is
that a unit might do low quality activities just for the purpose of generating a lot
of revenue; the other is that this system might discourage the pursuit of interdisciplinary activity. Provost Whitaker described how these situations might be
addressed, noting that in other universities that have adopted this system, these
problems have not arisen.
An implementation plan has been devised and is underway. Provost
Whitaker concluded by noting that this system gives the University a way to
manage change in a way not possible with the current system. Discussion then
ensued among the Regents. Regent Power requested that the provost report
back to the Regents about the two potential problem areas of interdisciplinary
activity and low quality activities. He also urged that units be given some type of
incentive for taking extra effort and for perhaps offering programs that don't
necessarily lead to a degree.
Following further discussion, there was a five minute break at 3:15 p.m.
Corporation for Public Broadcasting
The meeting reconvened at 3:20 p.m. Vice President Harrison introduced
Mr. Jim Gaver, station manager/director of programming for WFUM-TV; Ms.
Diane Parker, business manager for WFUM-TV; Mr. Joel Seguine, manager of
WUOM; and Mr. Lewis Morrissey, director of special projects in the Office of the
Vice President for University Relations. These individuals gave a presentation
on the history of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), as well as how
the program operates both on a national basis and with respect to the University
of Michigan's public television and radio stations. They also described how the
stations would be impacted if federal support for CPB were to be eliminated, in
view of the fact that WFUM-TV currently receives 23 percent of its budget from
CPB and Michigan Radio (WUOM/WFIUM/ WVGR) receives 15 percent of its operating budget from CPB. There followed a discussion about the University's
public television and public radio stations.


209




February Meeting, 1995


Public Comments
At 4:00 p.m., the Regents met in the Anderson Room of the Michigan Union
and heard comments from the following people on the topics indicated: Craig
Greenberg, Ryan Fringer, and Kristen Nimelli, students, in support of a
proposed fee increase to fund renovation of the Health Services building; Donma
Burnside, student, on the high cost of tuition; Aaron Williams, citizen, on the
issues of a student regent and the Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities; Anne M. Ellison and Pamela Short, students, on the Statement
of Student Rights and Responsibilities; Leslie Baxter, Ifeoma Okwumabua, David
M. Garcia, and Kiarma Cheatom, students, in support of a proposed fee increase
to fund renovation of the Michigan Union; Brian Elliott, student, on student
representation on the Board of Regents; and Vincent Keene, student, on freedom
of speech issues surrounding the Jake Baker case.
Following Public Comments, the meeting recessed until the next day.
Friday, February 17, 1995
The Regents met at 9:45 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Homing, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Varner. Interim Secretary Jensen was also present, as
were Provost Whitaker, Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal,
and Chancellors Nelms and Renick. Executive Vice President Womack was
absent; Associate Vice President Chandler Matthews attended in his stead.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Regent
Power, who made the following statement:
Statement by Regent Power
Regent Power read from a prepared statement, a copy of which is on file in
the office of the secretary of the university. He pointed out that the composition
of the Board has changed, with five new members in the past six years, and
noted that the Board has been considering a number of possible changes in the
way in which it operates.
The organization and sequencing of the meetings has already been changed
so that at the Thursday afternoon session, the Board now receives regular reports from the president, provost, CFO, and other executive officers on broad
subjects of concern to the University of Michigan community, which allows discussion by the Board prior to policy-making and voting.
The Regents are also considering changes in the format of Public Comments
and changes in the structure of the Board itself. He stated that for the time
being, the Regents will not elect a chair and pointed out that the term "senior Regent" appears in the Bylaws only with reference to that person's responsibility
for presiding over meetings when the president is absent. He also noted that the
only authority vested in the Regents is when they act as a Board, as opposed to
individually and announced that the Board is considering adopting a structure of
governance committees.


210




February Meeting, 1995


President Duderstadt commented that he and the other executive officers
appreciate the work that the Board has done in rethinking how it can provide the
strong leadership needed by the University, and that the officers are committed
to helping the Board in any way they can in working through these issues and
putting in place the new structures.
1995-96 Residence Hall and Family Housing Rates
Vice President Hartford reported that the student-staff rate committees had
met and had unanimously approved a recommendation for an average increase
of 5.1 percent for residence halls and 5.6 percent for family housing apartments,
and she described how the increases would be allocated. Regent Varner moved
approval of an average rate increase of 5.1 percent for residence halls and 5.6
percent for apartments, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent
McFee seconded the motion.
Vice President Hartford pointed out that part of the increase would be used
to improve the technology available in residence halls, which is very important to
the living-learning communities philosophy. Following some discussion about
residence hall occupancy rates, the proportions of different room types available
to students, and other issues related to residence halls, the vote was taken and
the motion to approve the recommended rate increases for residence halls and
family apartments was approved unanimously.
WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM         and WFUM-TV Audited Financial Reports
for Fiscal Year ended June 30, 1994 and Statements of Support, Revenue and Expenditures (Operating Fund) for Years Ended June 30, 1994
and 1993
Vice President Harrison pointed out that the television station's financial
report is favorable, but the radio station's is not. He noted that the radio station
has entered into a strategic planning process and restructuring. As of the
summer, it will have reduced its full-time staff size by 10 percent, and further
reductions are planned. Everything about the radio stations is being reviewed,
and a more complete report would be forthcoming as the year progresses.
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved adoption of the audited financial reports for WUOM/
WVGR/WFUM-FM and WFUM-TV for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.
Joel D. Tauber Manufacturing Institute
President Duderstadt announced that Mr. Joel D. Tauber had made a
financial commitment of $5 million to fund the Joel D. Tauber Manufacturing
Institute, to be jointly administered by the School of Business Administration
and the College of Engineering. Provost Whitaker described the purpose of the
institute. Regent Deitch moved approval of the establishment of the Joel D.
Tauber Manufacturing Institute, commenting on the leadership Mr. Tauber has
shown and the contributions he has made throughout his career. Regent
Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

Retirement Memoirs
Ziyaeddin A. Akcasu, professor of nuclear engineering and macromolecular science and engineering, retired from active faculty status on December 31,
1994, after an outstanding career.
Professor Akcasu received his M.S. degree from the Technical University of
Istanbul, Turkey, in 1948 and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan
in 1963. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1963 as assistant professor and was promoted to associate professor in 1965 and professor in 1968.
An extremely prolific researcher with an international reputation, Professor
Akcasu has authored over 95 articles and has contributed greatly to the fields of
nuclear reactor dynamics and statistical mechanics. His achievements in reactor
dynamics and noise analysis served as a foundation for the industry to begin to
understand the concept of stability in reactor operation. In the field of statistical
mechanics, Professor Akcasu is best known for improving our understanding of
the dynamics of polymer solutions. He was a principal in the development of the
generalized hydrodynamic equations and studied time correlations in simple
fluids. In 1984, Professor Akcasu and colleagues formulated the dynamics of
multi-component polymer solutions, which has been widely used since then in
the interpretation of light and neutron scattering experiments on such systems.
The formulation of a new method for studying the dynamics of multi-component
polymer mixtures has contributed significantly to the dynamics of polymer melts.
His achievements were recently recognized by his being honored with a symposium in his name at the 1994 American Chemical Society meeting.
Widely recognized as an excellent teacher, many of Professor Akcasu's
former students occupy key positions in science and industry in every corer of
the world. He has earned the College Excellence in Teaching Award and last
year was named outstanding teacher of the year by students in the Department
of Nuclear Engineering.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his outstanding contributions by naming Ziyaeddin A Akcasu professor emeritus of nuclear engineering
and macromolecular science and engineering.
Rolf G. Freter, professor of microbiology, retired from active faculty status
on January 31, 1995, after a most productive career as a teacher and researcher.
A native of Hamburg, Germany, Professor Freter received his Ph.D. degree
in microbiology from Goethe University in Frankfurt in 1951 and completed a
postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Chicago in 1954. He joined the
faculty at Loyola University as an instructor in microbiology in 1954 and was
promoted to assistant professor in 1956. Professor Freter moved to Jefferson
Medical College in Philadelphia as an assistant professor of microbiology in 1957
and was promoted to associate professor in 1959.


242




February Meeting, 1995


In 1965, Professor Freter came to the University of Michigan as professor of
microbiology in the Medical School. He contributed strength and vision to the
Department of Microbiology's teaching and research programs. During his
tenure at the University, Professor Freter taught various microbiology courses to
undergraduate, graduate, and medical students. He served on the editorial
boards of four prestigious medical research journals and was a reviewer on a
variety of study sections for the National Institutes of Health.
Professor Freter's major research interest is the microecology and local
immunity in the intestine. His imaginative and persistent research efforts have
resulted in the publication of 85 articles in scientific journals and 13 book chapters and monographs.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service by naming Rolf G. Freter professor emeritus of microbiology.
Paul W. Gikas, M.D., professor of pathology and assistant dean for admissions in the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on December 31,
1994.
A native of Lansing, Dr. Gikas received both his AB. (1950) and M.D.
(1954) degrees from the University of Michigan. After completing a rotating
internship at Philadelphia General Hospital in 1955, he undertook a year of
residency training at the University of Michigan. He served with the U.S. Army
Medical Corps in Virginia from 1956-58, after which he returned to the University of Michigan to complete his residency.
Dr. Gikas joined the University of Michigan faculty as an instructor in the
Department of Pathology in 1959. He was promoted to assistant professor in
1963, associate professor in 1966, and professor in 1969. He also served at the
Veterans Administration Hospital as chief of the laboratory service (1960-68),
part-time staff pathologist (1968-83), and consultant (1983-present). Within the
Department of Pathology, he has served as director of the Clinical Electron
Microscopy Unit (1977-82); director of the Residency Training Program
(1980-82); and director of the Autopsy Service (1983-87). From 1982-88, Dr. Gikas was faculty representative for intercollegiate athletics to the Big Ten
Conference and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). During that
time, he served on several NCAA and Big Ten committees which addressed such
issues as drug abuse, alcohol awareness, drug testing, and safety standards.
Since 1990, Dr. Gikas has also served the Medical School as assistant dean for
admissions.
Dr. Gikas is an expert in the areas of renal pathology, urologic pathology,
electron microscopy, and autopsy pathology. He has played an important role in
the education of pathology residents, is the author of numerous scientific articles
and book chapters, and continues to participate actively in professional societies.
His many years of dedicated teaching, as well as his highly effective role as a
clinician in the Department of Pathology, represent enduring contributions that
will have an impact for years to come.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Paul W. Gikas
professor emeritus of pathology.

February Meeting, 1995


John H. Stephenson, Catherine B. Heller Professor of Art and former
acting dean of the School of Art, retired from active faculty status on December
31, 1994.
Professor Stephenson received his B.A degree from Iowa State University
in 1952 and his M.F.A degree from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1958. He
joined the faculty of the former College of Architecture and Design as an instructor in 1959 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1962, associate professor
in 1964, and professor in 1968. He was named Catherine B. Heller Professor of
Art in 1989. Professor Stephenson was also awarded an honorary doctorate from
Grand Valley State University in 1993.
During his tenure, Professor Stephenson taught beginning, intermediate,
advanced, and graduate ceramics and also participated in teaching courses in
two- and three-dimensional design in the freshman program. His dedication to
teaching and his rapport with students has resulted in a number of his students
having achieved high visibility in the field of ceramic art. Over the course of his
career, Professor Stephenson also taught at many other institutions in the
United States and abroad.
Professor Stephenson's research has gone beyond the boundaries of classical
tradition and opened up a contemporary approach to American ceramics. He has
received grants to travel and work in Japan and to study large scale ceramic
sculpture, explore ceramics and mixed media, and to study the use of color in
three dimensions. Professor Stephenson has participated in numerous workshops and symposia and in major exhibitions which traveled across the nation
and abroad. In 1965, he was awarded the city of Faenza (Italy) gold medal in
Concorso Internationale della Ceramica D'Arte. His work is included in major
private, corporate, and public collections, including the Everson Museum in
Syracuse, New York; the Cranbrook Museum of Art in Bloomfield Hills; the
Detroit Institute of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City;
and the Faenza Museum in Italy.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming John H. Stephenson the Catherine B. Heller Professor Emeritus of Art.
Memorial Statement
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death on December 30, 1994, of Joan M. Keevil, associate professor
of dentistry.
Professor Keevil was born in Detroit, Michigan, on April 21, 1937. She
received her B.S. degree in dental hygiene in 1959, her M.P.H. degree in health
education in 1964, and her Ph.D. degree in higher education (administration) in
1973, all from the University of Michigan. She joined the faculty of the University of Michigan School of Dentistry as an instructor in 1966. She was promoted
to assistant professor in 1973 and associate professor in 1977. Professor Keevil
also served as assistant to the dean from 1973-90.
She was committed to the dental profession, which she served as teacher,
lecturer, author, and administrator. Professor Keevil was mentor and friend to
many. She also served as an active member of the University's Women's
Research Club.   Her memberships in professional societies included the


244




February Meeting, 1995


American Association of Dental Schools, American Association of Public Health
Dentistry, the American Dental Hygienists Association, the Michigan Dental Hygiene Association, the Washtenaw District Dental Hygiene Society, Omicron
Kappa Upsilon, and the Sigma Phi Alpha Dental Hygiene Honor Society.
Joan Keevil left an enduring mark on her students and colleagues, both
through her professional accomplishments and her personal qualities of modesty,
dedication, and quiet dignity. We mourn the loss of this distinguished scholar
and teacher, and our condolences go to her mother, Ivy Isabel, her sister, Diane
Sweeney, and her niece, Stacy Sweeney.
Degrees. Provost Whitaker submitted final degree lists for December 1994
commencements and changes to previously approved degree lists.
Henry Russel Award. Brinkley Messick, associate professor of anthropology, and Khalil Najafi, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer
science, were recommended as recipients of the Henry Russel Award for 1995.
Consent Agenda Approved. On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by
Regent Power, the Regents unanimously approved the consent agenda.
Semi-Annual Report for Designated Fund, Auxiliary Activities Fund,
and Expendable Restricted Fund
The Regents received the Semi-Annual Report for the Designated Fund,
Auxiliary Activities Fund, and Expendable Restricted Fund for the six month
periods ending December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993. Regent Power raised
the question as to whether it was really necessary for the Regents to receive this
report. Following some discussion, it was decided that a systematic review of all
reports should be prepared for the Board to determine whether they are of consequence, and if not, a recommendation should be made that they be discontinued.
It was decided that this semi-annual report should be included in that review.
Alternative Asset Investments (CMD Realty Investment Fund II, L.P.)
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of $10 million to CMD Realty Investment
Fund II, L.P., recognizing that the University's pro rata share of the fees will
increase its capital commitment above the $10.0 million level and pending
favorable review of the documents for their legal acceptability by the general
counsel's office.
Angell/Haven Hall Connector Project
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a revised budget and authorized award of a construction
contract to the Walbridge Aldinger Company. Regent Newman abstained from
voting due to a conflict of interest.


245




February Meeting, 1995


University Health Service, Michigan Union, Michigan League, and
North Campus Commons
Regent McGowan moved approval of $26,500,000 in renovation projects for
the University Health Service, the Michigan Union, the Michigan League, and
North Campus Commons, as described in the Regents Communication. Regent
Deitch seconded the motion. Following some discussion, the vote was taken and
the motion was approved unanimously.
School of Social Work Building Project
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved the revised budget for the School of Social Work Building
and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding a construction contract,
providing the project is within the budget.
University of Michigan Medical Center East Medical Campus Primary
Care Facility Project
President Duderstadt called on Mr. Douglas Hanna, University architect, to
present the proposed design of the East Medical Campus Primary Care Facility.
Mr. Hanna displayed maps indicating the site location and site plan for the facility, and described the access plan for the complex and the facility itself. He then
used schematic drawings to show the proposed floor plan, noting that the objectives were that the building should be easy to find and easy to find one's way
around. It should be friendly, welcoming, and human-scaled, with a residential
character. He concluded his presentation by unveiling a drawing of the building's exterior and describing how all of the features fit with the objectives that
the planners had in mind for the building.
There followed a lengthy discussion, during which several Regents expressed concerns about the proposed design. Mr. Hanna observed that the
architects had received input from a variety of sources and had worked hard to
develop the residential feel, noting that patients have found the residential
quality of the Briarwood health care facilities much more appealing than the
more institutional buildings at the Medical Center. Regent Power observed that
some Regents did not feel that the proposed design met this objective as well as it
might have.
Regent Deitch expressed concern about the process of architect selection and
design development and suggested that as a policy matter, the Regents examine
the optimum point in the design development process at which the Regents'
input can be considered most effectively. It was noted that since this would be
the first building in what will be a very large complex and would therefore set the
tone for future development of the site, it was important that the Regents feel
comfortable with it.
Following further discussion, it was decided to delay moving forward with
the design until such time as other facade alternatives could be presented, which
it was hoped could occur at the March meeting. Regent Newman reinforced
Regent Deitch's concern about the process, so that a means could be found to


246




February Meeting, 1995


avoid such a situation from happening in the future. President Duderstadt
cautioned against the Regents' getting involved in the process any earlier than
currently is the case, but agreed that a review of the process would be helpful.
He pointed out that this particular case was different from most, because it is the
first in a major new campus development which will set the tone for future
buildings.
University Hospital Emergency Department Expansion and Reorganization
On a motion by Regent Homing, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
unanimously approved expansion and renovation of the University Hospital
Emergency Department as described in the Regents Communication, submission
of a Certificate of Need application to the Michigan Department of Public Health,
and the appointment of Albert Kahn Associates, Inc., as project architect for the
design.
University of Michigan Hospitals Department of Radiology Renovation
for Image Management and Commun     ications System
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Horning, the Regents
unanimously approved a project for purchase and installation of a new image
management and communications system and necessary renovations in the
Department of Radiology, as described in the Regents Communication.
Purchase and Co-Development of a Replacement Inpatient Pharmacy
Computer System
Regent Power moved, Regent Horing seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, purchase and co-development of a Mediware Inpatient Pharmacy System, as described in the Regents Communication.

unanimously approved the following renovation projects: 1) Dennison Building
VAV retrofit; 2) South Quadrangle Tunnel expansion joint replacements; 3)
Parking Services 1995 annual maintenance program; 4) North Campus roadway
reconstruction; 5) completion of space for OSEH chemical transfer facility in
Medical Science Research Building III; and 6) relocation of the Facial Cosmetic
Surgery Clinic.

Arbor Treatment Center Board of Directors.
Purchasing Agreement with Valley View Farm
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved entering into a purchasing agreement with Valley View
Farm. Because the owner of Valley View Farm, Douglas D. Doop, is also a
University of Michigan employee, this agreement falls under the state of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Valley View
Farm.
2.   The terms of the contract include that Valley View Farm provide services,

The contract period begins March 1, 1995, and will continue for 34 months
through December 31, 1997, with an option to renew the contract up to two
consecutive one-year periods, providing service is satisfactory and agreement can
be reached on price, terms, and conditions. Annual price reviews are acceptable;
however they cannot exceed 5 percent of the original pricing or the Consumer
Price Index (CPI), whichever is lower.
Purchasing Contract with Rebus Planning Associates, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved a purchasing contract with Rebus Planning Associates,
Inc. Because the owner of Rebus Planning Associates, Inc., Samuel J. Meisels, is
also a University employee, this contract falls under the state of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance
with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the purchase contract will be the Regents of the University of
Michigan and Rebus Planning Associates, Inc.
2.   The terms of the contract to support three University of Michigan research
grants include the purchase of the following from Rebus Planning Associates,
Inc.: 120 Work Sampling Reference sets @ $4,800 and 5,565 Student Materials

3.   Dr. Meisels' pecuniary interest arises from his position as owner of Rebus
Planning Associates, Inc.


248




February Meeting, 1995


UM-Ann Arbor Infrastructure Maintenance Fee (IMF)
Regent McFee moved approval of an increase of $35 per term in the existing
infrastructure maintenance fee, effective Spring term 1995, to provide the funds
necessary to cover the cost of debt service for the renovation of the University
Health Service Building, the Michigan Union, the Michigan League, and North
Campus Commons. Regent Varner seconded the motion.
In the discussion that followed, Regent McFee expressed her support of the
fee. Regent Baker observed that since its inception, the fee had risen from $50 to
the proposed $185, and that he objected both to the increase and to the purpose
of the fee, noting that it is turning into a fixed cost of attending the University.
President Duderstadt responded that historically, these costs had been assumed
by the state, but that the state was no longer allocating funds for this purpose.
Further discussion ensued on the purpose of the infrastructure maintenance
fee. Regent Newman commented that only a portion of the University's budget
comes from the state and wondered why we always look to the students to fund
increased costs when the University receives funds from a variety of sources. She
questioned whether the University's management of its funds could be improved
or whether public/private partnerships could be introduced to reduce the reliance
on student fees.
Regent Deitch stated that he is absolutely in support of the fee increase,
since the Regents have the fiduciary responsibility to see that the physical plant
meets the needs of the people served by the institution. He also believes that
students as well have a moral obligation to ensure that there are first class
facilities for both present and future generations, and this fee can be viewed as
students' contribution to that.
Regent Power observed that the old paradigm of running a public university
is changing, and that other ways need to be found to achieve the resource base
needed to maintain the University's excellence. He believes that the current
Board and successor Boards have a responsibility to explore the notion of a transformation and an altered paradigm for running a great research university. He
supports the fee, but believes that time is running out on the institution's ability
to function according to the existing paradigm.
Regent Newman stated that she would not support the fee because she has
not received answers to her questions about why it is necessary in the context of
the overall budget.
Following further discussion, the vote was taken, and the motion to increase
the infrastructure maintenance fee by $35 per term was approved, with Regents
Deitch, Homing, McFee, Power, and Varner in favor, and Regents Newman and
Baker opposed. Regent McGowan was not present when the vote was taken.

MARCH MEETING, 1995


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, March 16, 1995
The Regents met at 1:30 p.m. in the Music Room at the Henry Ford EstateFair Lane. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch,
Homing, McFee, McGowan, Newman, and Varner. Secretary Jensen, Executive
Vice President Womack, and Provost Whitaker were also present, as were Vice
Presidents Harrison, Hartford, and Kinnear and Chancellors Nelms and Renick.
Vice President Neal was absent; Regent Power arrived at about 3:00 p.m.
President's Report
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and expressed to Chancellor Renick the Regents' appreciation for his campus' hosting of the Regents'
Meeting. He then presented his report, which focused on two issues: the various
rankings of the quality of the University's academic programs and the alliances
that have been forming among American universities to grapple with the issue of
institutional change.
Rankings of Quality. President Duderstadt observed that there are a
number of publications that rate higher education institutions on various measures and focused on the annual U.So News and World Report issue that ranks
America's best colleges, particularly with respect to undergraduate education.
He observed that while the University of Michigan's overall ranking was 21st, it
ranked 9th in academic quality, and that the weight given to some of the measures used to determine the overall rankings (student selectivity and financial
resources per student) are biased against large public institutions.  Some
important attributes are not even considered when compiling the rankings, such
as breadth and diversity of programs and resources such as libraries, computers,
laboratories, etc.
The graduate school rankings reveal the same disparities as the undergraduate rankings, with academic quality higher than overall rankings in most
programs. President Duderstadt observed that all of the surveys confirm that
the University of Michigan ranks, along with Harvard, Stanford, and Berkeley,
among the finest universities in the world in most areas. This is the case despite
the fact that our expenditures per student are one-third that of Harvard and
Stanford and that the University of Michigan receives one-half the level of state
appropriation received by the University of California at Berkeley.
Vice President Harrison and Provost Whitaker elaborated on various aspects of the rankings and agreed that they are biased against large public
institutions.
Instttittional Change. President Duderstadt reported that the Big Ten
universities have made significant commitments to cooperative ventures such as
merging their library systems. They are also setting up conferences to study the


251




March Meeting, 1995


impact of technology on instruction, the relationship between the federal government and higher education institutions with regard to research, and all of the
issues surrounding the "faculty contract" (faculty appointments, tenure, promotion, retirement, etc.). He observed that he has just assumed the chairmanship
of the Big Ten and also discussed other alliances that are being formed to cope
with changes that are occurring nation-wide in higher education.
Provost's Report
Dean Searches. Provost Whitaker updated the Regents on the status of
the four dean searches currently underway and noted that an additional search
would be starting in the next few months,
Budget. Provost Whitaker observed that the federal government currently
provides $55 million in indirect costs related to federal research contracts. The
reimbursement rate is being renegotiated and will probably be less than the
current rate.
Tuition. Provost Whitaker reported that no proposals have been prepared
at this point, but that the challenge is to keep the strong commitment to
affordability and accessibility, while maintaining the quality that is the
University's trademark.
Regent Newman commented that in the event that a tuition increase were
to be recommended in July, she would like to be briefed far in advance about the
reasons that a tuition increase would be required to make up any shortfall.
State appropriation. Regent Varner questioned how the University
planned to respond to the fact that the state legislature was probably going to
treat the state institutions differently with respect to appropriations, which
would result in less favorable treatment for the University of Michigan and more
favorable treatment for Michigan State University. It was also noted that the
higher education appropriations committee had just voted to reduce the University's appropriation by an additional $8.3 million because the out-of-state enrollment had exceeded 30 percent.
Provost Whitaker explained how the in-state/out-of-state enrollment calculations are arrived at during the admissions process and President Duderstadt
explained how the committee had erred in arriving at the $8.3 million figure.
There was further discussion about the complexities involved in maintaining the
legislature's 30/70 in-state/out-of-state ratio. It was noted that limiting the
number of out-of-state students had negative effects on the other state institutions because the recent decrease in the number of Michigan high school graduates has decreased the available pool for all state institutions.
Provost Whitaker observed that in response to the legislature's actions, the
University now needs to ensure that each legislator has the appropriate information about all of the issues involved. He also responded to other questions raised
by the Regents and said that he would be reporting in future months with more
details about the status of the 1995-96 budget currently being prepared.


252




March Meeting, 1995


Vice President Harrison observed that federal legislators are currently
contemplating changes in federal student financial aid that would be quite
detrimental to students.
Chief Financial Officer's Report
Executive Vice President Womack gave a presentation on the status of the
following nine projects, all of which are expected to be completed within the next
24 months: Angell Hall Renovation; Angell/Haven Connector; East Engineering
Building Renovation; C.C. Little Building Renovation; Randall Laboratory
Addition; Harold T. and Vivian B. Shapiro Library Addition and Renovation;
Engineering Center Building; Integrated Technology Instruction Center; Hospital Cancer and Geriatrics Centers and North Entrance Parking Structure. These
projects represent a total cost of $260 million, one of the largest construction
programs in the University's history.
Regent McFee said that it would be helpful to have a summary of these projects prepared, which would break down the cost and source of funding for each
one.
Internships and Cooperative Learning at the UM-Dearborn
President Duderstadt called on Chancellor Renick to introduce a presentation on the internship and co-op programs at the UM-Dearborn. He recognized
Mr. Dennis Drean, Ms. Patricia Jones, and Ms. Charlotte Whitney, who administer the programs on the Dearborn campus, and then introduced four panelists to
describe their experiences with the program. The panelists included Ms. Amy
Kurczewski, Ms. Marlene Konkoly, and Ms. Cheryl Bringley, students who had
completed intern or co-op placements at area businesses and found them
extremely valuable, and Mr. John Bundridge, director of human resources at
Deloitte Touche, who spoke of how the program benefits businesses who participate in it.
Following the presentations, the panelists responded to questions and comments from the Regents.
Personnel Appointment
Because the Regents were meeting on the Dearborn campus, Chancellor
Renick requested that the Regents consider his request for approval of the
appointment of Susan C. Skramstad as vice-chancellor for institutional
advancement at this time. On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents unanimously approved the appointment of Susan C.
Skramstad as vice chancellor for institutional advancement at the University of
Michigan- Dearborn.
Living/Learning Communities on the Ann Arbor Campus
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Hartford to lead a discussion
of issues surrounding student housing. These issues include aging facilities; the
different needs of the current generation of students; developing closer ties to
academic units; strategic planning for the next century; food/dining services in


253




March Meeting, 1995


the halls; and development of a sense of community in the halls. Vice President
Hartford called on Mr. David Foulke, interim director of housing, and Mr. David
Schoem, assistant dean for undergraduate education in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, to lead a discussion of these issues.
Mr. Schoem described the various living/learning programs already in place,
as well as plans under consideration for enhancing the living/learning experiences for all students. He, Mr. Foulke, and Vice President Hartford then
responded to questions and comments by the Regents about residence halls and
living/learning programs.
There followed a 20-minute break, after which the meeting reconvened to
hear Public Comments at 4:10 p.m.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Vimcent Keenan and Anne Marie
Ellison, students, on the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities.
The meeting then adjourned until the following dayo
Friday, March 17, 1995
The Regents met at 9:40 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Jensen and Provost Whitaker were also
present, as were Executive Vice President Womack, Vice Presidents Harrison,
Hartford, Kinnear and Neal, and eal,  Chancellors Nelms and Renick.
Annual Report of Investments
President Duderstadt called on Executive Vice President Womack, who
called on Ms. Maggie Blakelock of Cambridge Associates and Mr. Norman
Herbert, university treasurer, to present the report of investments for the year
ending December 31, 1994.
Mr. Herbert reported that 1994 was an unrewarding year in the public
markets, which underscored the need for the University's strategy of investing a
significant portion of its long-term funds in alternative assets which are not
correlated with stocks and bonds. Nevertheless, 1994 investment results for the
University's funds were solid, with a -1.8 percent return for the University Endowment Fund (UEF); -2.1 percent and -2.0 percent, respectively, for the Donor
Pooled Income Fund and separately managed Charitable Remainder Trusts; 0.8
percent for the University Investment Pool; and 0.1 percent for Veritas.
Mr. Herbert called on Ms. Blakelock, who distributed discussion materials
from Cambridge Associates, Inc., to which she referred in her remarks. She
stated that her two objectives were to review the University's investment strategy and details of the 1994 performance and to discuss a proposal for a new
investment opportunity.


254




March Meeting, 1995


Ms. Blakelock reviewed the strategies with respect to asset allocation,
common stock management, and alternative assets. She reported that the value
of the endowment on December 31, 1994, was $1.115 billion, which was up
$255.6 million from the previous year. She highlighted major investment
changes that had been made during the past year and compared the University's
equity performance with the S&P 500 and with other indicators. She pointed out
that the returns for alternative assets were above those of the S&P 500, while
common stock managers underperformed the S&P 500 and the bond markets
had a very disappointing year. However, for the past four years, the University's
average annual returns of 12 percent per year had outperformed the market
benchmark by 140 basis points per year.
Following some discussion about the University's investment performance
and strategies, Ms. Blakelock turned to a discussion of emerging market debt.
Emerging Markets Debt Investments
Ms. Blakelock noted that the Regents had before them an action request for
the appointment of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo as investment manager for
emerging markets debt. She noted that Latin American countries are the greatest sources of emerging market debt investments and observed that Brady bonds
are the most liquid segment of emerging market debt. She described Brady
bonds and further described the investment rationale, risks, and current market
environment for emerging market debt and responded to questions from the
Regents.
Regent Baker commented that he was not persuaded that with respect to
Mexico, the benefits would outweigh the risks of this type of investment. He also
pointed out that the dollar was at risk at this time. There were other comments
related to the risks involved in investing in this type of market. Ms. Blakelock
noted that the emerging markets team at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo is quite
experienced in this area. Regent Power observed that this proposal is about
emerging market debt, a class of investments; it is not about investing in Mexico
per se.
Following further discussion, Regent Newman moved the appointment of
Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Company as investment manager for emerging markets debt. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved by a
vote of seven to one, with Regent Baker opposed.
UM Hospitals Comparative Statistic Report
Mr. John Forsyth, executive director of University of Michigan Hospitals,
presented the UM Hospitals Comparative Statistic Report for the fiscal year
ending 1993-94. This report covered three major components of financial
performance (profitability, liquidity, and capital structure), as well as patient
activity, while comparing the Hospitals' performance to the average for three
types of hospitals (Standard & Poor's "AA" rated hospitals, teaching hospitals,
and all hospitals) for the past five years' average and for FY 1993-94. The UM
Hospitals' performance was favorable in nearly ever measure.


255




March Meeting, 1995


Leasing Agreement with Plymouth Road Partnership
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously authorized the University's entering into a two year renewable
assumption of lease agreement with Plymouth Road Partnership. Because Dr.
Gena R. Pahucki is both a fill partner in the Plymouth Road Partnership and a
University of Michigan employee (clinical associate in the Medical School), this
agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Plymouth Road
Partnership, partly owned by Dr. Pahucki.
2.   Terms of the contract: The duration of the contract is two (2) years. The medical office is located at 3250 Plymouth Road, Suite 201, Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The rental rate is $16.50 per square foot, $19,734 annually. The medical center
will lease the space and place appropriate clerks, medical office assistants,
nurses, and physicians necessary to provide primary care services.
3.   Dr. Pahucki's pecuniary interest arises from her partial ownership of Plymouth
Road Partnership. Plymouth Road Partnership is receiving revenues generated
by the leasing of the property to the University.
Leasing Agreement with Chelsea Internal Medicine Partnership
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved an assumption of lease agreement with Chelsea Internal
Medicine Partnership. This agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict
of Interest Statute, because two of the partners in the partnership, Dr. Steven A
Yarows and Dr. Martin P. Gleespen, are also clinical instructor faculty members
in the University's Medical School. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Chelsea Internal
Medicine Partnership, owned by Dr. Yarows and Dr. Gleespen.

On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved an agreement between the University of Michigan and
Michigan Public Health Institute (MPHI), under which MPHI will purchase testing services to be performed by a faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry. Because two members of the board of directors of MPHI, Alan W. Steiss and
Robert Gray, are also University of Michigan employees, this agreement falls
under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.       The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement will be the University of Michigan and MPHII.
2.   Terms of the agreements will be consistent with University policy regarding
routine testing. The testing project is proposed over a 16-month period at a

no compensation directly from MPHI.
UMMC East Medical Campus Primary Care Facility Project
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Doug Hanna to lead a
discussion that would give the architect some direction in revising the design of
the facility.
In response to a question from Regent Newman, Mr. Hanna noted that at
the point that architectural renderings are presented to the Regents, only 15 percent of the design activity has taken place. At that point, if refinements are
necessary, charges usually aren't increased.  However, if major changes are
required, additional fees would be involved.
Mr. Hanna began by displaying the rendering that had been presented the
previous month and reviewed the design criteria. He then displayed computer
generated graphics of how the building would look from different vantage points
and reviewed the renderings of the site plan for Zone 1 of the East Medical
Campus.
Regents Newman and McGowan pointed out that since the purpose of this
discussion was to obtain input into the type of building the Regents would like to
see, there was little value in reviewing the building that the Regents had already
expressed their dissatisfaction with.


257




March Meeting, 1995


Regent Deitch expressed that one of the criteria for any building should be
"make it great." He observed that the current administration could take great
pride in the building and rebuilding that has been taking place on the campus in
recent years. As major builders and developers, the University needs to have
building designs that will withstand the test of time in terms of aesthetic appeal.
With the University's buying power and commitment to excellence, it ought to
search out the best architects and the architects with whom it already has
relationships and demand the greatness in that area that we demand in every
other area. He concluded that this particular building does not meet that
standard, and he doesn't support it. In response to a question, he stated that
this project should be started over again.
Mr. Forsyth observed that the Medical Center needs to be able to compete
on cost; and that the time frame envisioned for this building is about 20 years,
after which it would be replaced. The Medical Center's concerns about cost
effectiveness have had an influence on the design.
Regent Deitch responded that he was not yet convinced that there is a clear
trade-off between good design and cost. His opinion was that the current design
is reminiscent of a "speculative, suburban, medical center building." But the fact
that the building was also a part of one of the world's great institutions led him
to the belief that "we might be able to do better."
Regent Baker concurred, noting that this building was to be the first of six,
setting the standard for all of them; therefore, if there was dissatisfaction with
this one, there would also be with the others. As is true with the North Campus
and the current Medical Campus, it is important to have a plan for unity in the
materials, colors, and overall scheme before the first building is designed.
Regent McGowan observed that "great design does not necessarily need to
incur great cost." As this building is the symbol of the commitment the University is making to medical training and patient care, she said that "we should
expect the same priority, the same pride, the same excellence, and the same
commitment to excellence of service from the symbol as to the service delivered."
President Duderstadt concluded the discussion by requesting that some
alternative designs be developed and that the architects be challenged to create a
significant piece of architecture.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Regent Baker requested that the direct quotation of Regent
Power's remarks in the minutes of the February 1995 meeting be revised so as to
summarize the remarks according to the Regents' policy, rather than quoting
them in their entirety. Regent Power seconded the motion, stating that the
minutes should reflect that the entire remarks are on file in the Office of the
Secretary. The motion was approved unanimously.
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports on investments, plant extension, litigation, and personnel-labor relations. Regent McFee
reiterated her request for a summary document listing all current construction

projects, their costs, and funding sources, noting that this, combined with a
video, would serve also as a good public relations piece.
Vice President Neal submitted reports of projects established and summaries of a selection of current research for the month of February 1995.
Statement by Regent Baker. Regent Baker read from a prepared statement about a symposium          to be held April 19, 1995, sponsored by the University
of Michigan and the Smithsonian Institution, whose purpose is to examine the
issues surrounding the Enola Gay Exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution. A
copy of the remarks is on file in the Office of the Secretary.
Regent Baker observed that there had been a bitter dispute between Smithsonian archivists and Veterans groups about how to portray the issues surrounding  the   decision   to  drop   atomic   weapons on       Japan    in  1945   as part of the
Smithsonian's exhibit of the Enola Gay bomber which had dropped the atomic
bombs. The University has planned a symposium                  to explore and discuss those
issues.
Regent Baker observed that historians and scholars often disagree about the
ramifications of given historical events.         In the case of World War II, however,
forces were held at bay and defeated which would have destroyed freedom                   "as we
knew   it then and know it now," and the people who fought in that war also have
strongly held views.       Regent Baker requested that veterans groups and their
supporters be provided fill access to and full participation in the symposium.
Regent Deitch left the meeting at this point, at 11:10 a.m.
Voluntary support. Vice President Kinnear submitted the report of gifts
received for the month of February 1995.

School of Business Administration Facilities Improvement Project
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Douglas Hanna, who
presented the plans for this addition to the existing Executive Residence and
renovation of several areas within the business school complex. The programs to
be accommodated include expansion of the number of Executive Residence guest


270




March Meeting, 1995


rooms, housing for the William Davidson Institute, and new classrooms and
administration areas for the executive education program. Mr. Hanna displayed
the site plan, schematic designs for each floor and a rendering of the proposed
building.
Regent McGowan inquired about whether the number of parking spaces in
the Hill Street structure would need to be increased to accommodate the greater
capacity being added to the Executive Residence facilities. It was noted that the
majority of people who attend executive education programs do not drive themselves to the complex.. Following some discussion, it was decided to determine
whether the business school parking structure had the capacity for expansion
should that be necessary and to bring this information back to the Regents.
Mr. Hanna then displayed a model of the proposed addition.  Regent
McGowan expressed the hope that the area reserved for trash containers would
be inset so that they would be hidden from view on Hill Street to the extent
possible.
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the design of the School of Business Administration
Facilities Improvement Project.

On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
approved a revision to Regents' Bylaw Section 3.05.        The text of the revised
bylaw follows:

The executive vice president and chief financial officer, or the executive vice
president's written designee, shall have authority to accept all gifts to the University in
the form of money and securities or in any other form, whether for the benefit of the
entire institution or any of its subdivisions. All gifts must be reported to the president
and the Board in a manner recommended by the executive vice president and chief
financial officer and approved by the president and the Board.
No gift for building purposes nor any gift whose maintenance will add to the
ordinary operating budget of the University shall be accepted without express
permission of the Board.
Each gift is accepted subject to the general policy of the Board that the wishes of
the donors with respect to their gifts shall be loyally observed, so long as in the opinion
of the Board such wishes do not conflict with the proper administration of the University under changes that may develop in the course of time.

APRIL MEETING, 1995


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, April 20, 1995
The Regents met at 1:45 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horing, McFee, McGowan, Newman,
Power, and Varner. Secretary Jensen, Executive Vice President Womack, and
Provost Whitaker were also present, as were Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford,
and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick. Vice President Kinnear was
absent.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and recognized Regent
Varner, who made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended
by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed
session on April 20, 1995, to consider material exempt from
discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information
Act [Sec. 8(h)]. Such exempt material consists of a written opinion
from the Board's legal counsel.
Regent Baker seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
President's Report
President Duderstadt commented on the state appropriations process that
he said has been portrayed incorrectly as a battle between the University of
Michigan and Michigan State University. He stated that the University does not
oppose the larger than average increases being proposed for Michigan State,
Grand Valley State, and Western Michigan universities; rather, he believes that
the state should increase appropriations in excess of the inflation rate to all
universities, since all have shared in the losses of the recent past. He observed
that over the past seven years, the erosion in state support compared to inflation
has resulted in a loss of $35 million in the University's base appropriation. The
University of Michigan supports the current proposal that would provide
increases of a minimum of six percent to the twelve other public universities,
while still sustaining the additional increases for Michigan State, Western Michigan, and Grand Valley State.
President Duderstadt reviewed the history of state finding for higher education, which has eroded significantly over the past 20 years. This has resulted in
higher reliance on tuition increases to make up the difference. He observed that
all state universities had experienced declines in the number of Michigan
residents enrolled compared with ten years ago, with declines at Michigan and
Wayne State averaging between 300 and 350 per year, and the declines at Michigan State averaging over 3,000 students. The reason for this decline is a 15


273




April Meeting, 1995


percent (25,000 students) decline in the number of Michigan high school graduates. He stated that the University of Michigan is "first and foremost a public
university serving this state," and it remains solidly committed to educating
instate students.
Following some comments by the Regents, the President turned to Provost
Whitaker to present the Provost's Report.
Provost's Report
Provost Whitaker commented on the status of each of the four dean
searches currently either underway or in the planning stages. These include the
School of Public Health, Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, the
College of Pharmacy, and the College of Engineering. He then reviewed some of
the awards that have been received by various faculty and some noteworthy
accomplishments of students and faculty during the past several months within
the various schools and colleges.
Resolution in Honor of Men's and Women's Swimming and Diving
Teams
President Duderstadt introduced the men's and women's swimming and
diving teams and coaches, who were in attendance. He reported that the men's
team had won the NCAA championship and the women had come in a close
second. These teams "epitomize all that's great about Michigan athletics," he
noted, with their outstanding athletic and academic accomplishments.
Men's coach Jon Urbanchek acknowledged the boost that the building of
Canham Natatorium had made to the swimming program and recognized also
the contributions of all involved with the men's and women's swimming
program. He observed that the recognition by the Regents is the biggest the
teams have received.
The president called on Regent Homing, who read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend the
Michigan men's and women's swimming and diving teams and
coaches for their extraordinary success during the 1994-95 season.
The men's team won the 1995 NCAA national swimming and
diving title, becoming the first Michigan team to win an NCAA title
since the men's basketball team won it in 1989. This outstanding
team  swept the championship meet awards, with Coach Jon
Urbanchek winning the 1995 NCAA Swimming Coach of the Year
award and swimmer Tom Dolan being named 1995 NCAA
Swimmer of the Year. Tom Dolan won all three individual events in
which he participated, setting American and NCAA records in each,
while captain Gustavo Borges won his 10th NCAA title in four years.


274




April Meeting, 1995


The men's swimming and diving program holds more NCAA titles
than any other varsity-level sport at Michigan.
The Michigan women's swimming and diving team, which
finished a close second at the NCAA national championships, did
what no other team has done before by becoming the first team other
than Stanford, Texas, or Florida to finish in the top three since the
championships began in 1982. Women's coach Jim Richardson won
his second NCAA Swimming Coach of the Year award, while senior
co-captain Alecia Humphrey, a twelve-time All-American, set a Big
Ten record by winning three NCAA titles. Alecia has held both Big
Ten backstroke records since her freshman year and won all eight
100 and 200 backstroke Big Ten titles in her four years at Michigan.
At the finals, the Michigan women's team set eleven Big Ten
Conference and thirteen Michigan records, with freshman Talor
Bendel being responsible for seven of them.
To quote Coach Richardson, "Each team seeks its own destiny."
These outstanding teams and coaches have certainly achieved theirs.
The Regents take great pride in saluting the men's and women's
swimming and diving teams and coaches for their strong and
continuing contributions to the Michigan athletic tradition.
There followed a round of applause.
Chief Financial Officer's Report
Executive Vice President Womack reported on the University's M-Quality
efforts. He distributed a list of some of the M-Quality activities that are
currently underway, noting that over 100 teams are at work on campus. He
observed that M-Quality allows problems to be attacked and solved by the people
who know the most about them. Executive Vice President Womack also reported
on compliments he had received recently from a dean and others on the quality
of work performed by staff members in the business and finance area, and noted
that this is a reflection of the change in culture and increasing sensitivity to
customers that has developed as a result of the M-Quality effort.
Regent Varner recalled having toured the exhibits at the M-Quality Expo in
the fall. She and Regent Baker asked Executive Vice President Womack to
convey their praise to staff members for their dedication to the principles of
M-Quality.
Institute of Public Policy Studies
Provost Whitaker called to the table Professor Ned Gramlich, director of the
Institute of Public Policy Studies, to comment on a proposal to change the status
of the Institute of Public Policy Studies. Regent Power made the following
motion:
1.  That the Institute of Public Policy Studies (IPPS) be reconstituted
as the School of Public Policy under the administrative direction of


275




April Meeting, 1995


a dean, and that the title of the current director be changed
accordingly.
2.   That faculty members who currently hold teaching appointments
in IPPS be reclassified with instructional titles rather than as
research scientists (this provision does not imply any change in the
location of tenure in cases where individuals have already acquired
tenure, or are on tenure track, in units other than IPPS).
3.   That the Institute's externally constituted executive committee be
discontinued and the internal program committee form the School
of Public Policy's first executive committee to function in accordance with the internal bylaws developed by IPPS in 1991 and
amended in 1992.
4.   That the Regents repeal Section 13.01 of the Regents' Bylaws and
approve the following description of the School of Public Policy
Executive Committee for inclusion as Section 11.23 of the Regents'
Bylaws:
Sec. 11.23. The School of Public Policy Executive Committee
The executive committee shall consist of the dean and four members of the faculty
to be appointed by the Board on recommendation by the president. The appointed
members shall hold office for two years and shall not be eligible for reappointment
until after the lapse of one year. The terms shall be staggered so as to provide
continuity of membership. The dean shall chair the committee. The governing faculty
is authorized to arrange for student participation in meetings of the executive committee in an advisory capacity. A student participant shall be selected annually in
accordance with procedures approved by the governing faculty.
5.   That this plan be given effect on July 1, 1995.
Regent McGowan seconded the motion. Professor Gramlich pointed out
that this change will be both budget neutral and tenure neutral. In response to
questions from the Regents, Professor Gramlich explained that this change will
not affect the tenure status of current faculty members associated with IPPS.
Rather the tenure of current faculty members would remain with them when
they are transferred to the School of Public Policy.
Professor Gramlich commented about how Michigan's School of Public
Policy will fit in with other such schools nationally. He also gave examples of
service to the state by current and former IPPS faculty members and students.
Following further comments, the vote was taken and Regent Power's motion was
approved unanimously.
Regent Deitch took note of the large number of students who had attended
the meeting to express their concerns about the Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities.
The meeting then recessed, at about 3:00 p.m., to meet in executive session.


276




April Meeting, 1995


Public Comments
The meeting reconvened in the Michigan Union at 4:00 p.m. and heard
comments from the following people, on the topics indicated: Aaron Williams,

Friday, April 21, 1995
The Regents met at 9:45 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Homing, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Jensen, Executive Vice President
Womack, and Provost Whitaker were also present, as were Vice Presidents
Harrison, Hartford, and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick.    Vice
President Kinnear was absent; Associate Vice President Roy Muir attended in
his stead.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and announced that
several personnel actions were to be considered prior to consideration of the
regular agenda.
Dean of the School of Public Health. Provost Whitaker announced the
recommendation of Noreen Clark as dean of the School of Public Health, effective September 1, 1995. He called on Professor Clark, who was in attendance at
the meeting. Professor Clark thanked the Regents for her appointment and
briefly discussed her goals for the School of Public Health.
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the appointment of Noreen M. Clark as dean of the
School of Public Health.
Associate Vice President for University Relations. Vice President
Harrison announced his recommendation for the appointment of Cynthia H.
Wilbanks as associate vice president for university relations. On a motion by
Regent Baker, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents unanimously approved
the appointment of Cynthia H. Wilbanks as associate vice president for university relations.
Secretary of the University. President Duderstadt announced the
recommendation of Roberta R. Palmer as secretary of the university. On a
motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents approved
the appointment of Roberta R. Palmer as secretary of the university. Regent
Baker abstained from voting, noting that he was enthusiastic about the


277




April Meeting, 1995


appointment and his reasons for abstaining were unrelated to the person selected
for the position.
CESF Report - Ann Arbor Campus
President Duderstadt called on Associate Professor Thomas Toon, chair of
the Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF). Professor Toon
reported that this year, the committee was not making specific recommendations
on the size of proposed salary increases for faculty. Rather, the committee
observed that the administration and the faculty need to do a better job of
communicating on issues of the economic status of the faculty. Professor Toon
stressed the importance of receiving faculty input before decisions are made
about economic issues.  The committee has proposed the formulation of a
campus-wide faculty compensation policy on salary that "defines and affirms the
future roles of the faculty and the administration of the University."
There followed some discussion, during which the Regents and the president expressed their appreciation for the committee's efforts and expressed the
desire to work with faculty on compensation issues.
Budget Outlook
Provost Whitaker gave a presentation describing the "best guess" budget
outlook at this point in time for the 1995-96 fiscal year. The budget assumptions
were based on the University's receiving a 3 percent increase and on the
proposed $8.5 million loss in funding not being sustained in the Senate.
Provost Whitaker's projections call for a revenue increase of 0.6 percent
(from $7.25M to $7.29M) and a budget deficit of $25.42M on the expense side.
He said that each 1.0 percent increase in state appropriation yields $2.8M, while
each 1.0 percent increase in gross tuition revenue yields $3.66M. On the expense
side, each 1.0 percent increase in the general operating budget equals almost $5.0
million. The goal is to present a balanced budget, with some increases in revenue and some increases in expenses.
Provost Whitaker displayed a chart illustrating the annual percentage
increase in total General Fund revenue since 1980; this has ranged from 10.0
percent in 1980 to 12.0 percent in 1986 to less than 4.0 percent in 1993. To fund
the budget he just described would require a 4.1 percent increase, which would
be the lowest budget in 15 years, except for 1993, when there was no salary
program.
In response to a question from Regent Newman, Provost Whitaker reported
that budget cutting has been occurring for the past three years in order to fund
salary programs. Regent Power observed that program discontinuation guidelines are complicated and make it difficult for the University to manage the
budget process. Provost Whitaker said that there has been some discussion
about changing those guidelines to make them less cumbersome, and that if
there was support from the Board, he would pursue that more vigorously.
Regent Power responded that it would make sense for the Board to have tools in
place to deal with budget disasters that might occur, rather than having to react


278




April Meeting, 1995


to such crises after they happen. Regent Newman suggested that methods for
cutting costs, as well as reallocating costs, ought to be considered.
President Duderstadt responded that the M-Quality effort is significantly
reducing costs and improving quality. However, M-Quality does not provide a
means for questioning whether there are major activities at the University that
should be stopped because they don't meet current priorities. While the University can certainly benefit from further cost reduction and productivity increase
efforts, it has already been shown to be among the most efficiently operated institutions in the country. These facts only affect the margin, however; Regent
Power's suggestions will require a much more considered study of whether the
University can afford to do all of the things it is currently doing. There is no
existing mechanism that allows an examination of these issues, nor is there an
existing process or procedure that allows the University to take action if it is
decided that some activities are no longer viable.
In light of this, Regent Power urged that the executive officers "consider,
consult, and propose to the Board a less cumbersome, more timely, and less
ambiguous process for program discontinuation and change than we now have."
Provost Whitaker responded that the officers will begin considering this, with
fill consultation from faculty.
Regent Deitch commented that finding new sources of revenue generation is
also important. He observed that there are a lot of opportunities for enhancing
revenue that can be tapped by shifting the paradigm and recognizing new realities. Provost Whitaker responded that Value Centered Management is one tool
that allows the University to take advantage of these opportunities.
Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities
Vice President Hartford expressed her appreciation to Ms. Julie Neenan,
1994-95 president of Michigan Student Assembly, for her hard work and significant accomplishments during the past year. There followed a round of applause.
She then introduced Mr. Flint Wainess, newly-elected president of Michigan
Student Assembly.
Vice President Hartford first called the Regents' attention to the quarterly
report of judicial activity arising from the Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities that was being submitted as an information item. She also
noted that she had submitted an amended Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities (hereinafter referred to as "the Statement"), per the Regents'
action of February 1994.
Vice President Hartford observed that the Statement had received a lot of
criticism, and although she was not wedded to this particular version of it, there
was no question that there was both philosophical and legal justification for
having some sort of campus code of conduct in place. She offered this statement
as an example of a code, but said that she was open to direction from the
Regents.


279




April Meeting, 1995


Regent McGowan acknowledged both the concerns about the code that had
been expressed by students and the advice of Vice President Hartford that it was
necessary to have some kind of statement in place. She therefore offered the
following motion: that the Board of Regents ask the vice president for student
affairs to begin again by drafting a statement of values and a separate statement
of a process which will facilitate the resolution of differences. The process should
emphasize education. She emphasized that constitutional issues are not under
question or consideration and asked that Vice President Hartford draft a "clear,
concise statement which suggests an understandable and fair process for resolving alleged infractions; and that it be made less legalistic and less ponderous
[than the current statement]." Further, she suggested that in drafting the new
document, Vice President Hartford consult with elected Michigan Student
Assembly representatives and others that they determine and that in the Fall of
1995 the resulting statement, representing her best efforts and those of student
leaders, be recommended to the Board as a permanent policy. Until that time,
the current interim statement shall apply. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Regent Baker stated that he disagrees with Regent McGowan's assessment
of the constitutionality of conduct codes. He quoted from remarks he had made
in 1992, which in turn had quoted from a letter written by Professor Carl Cohen
which had expressed the views that the code proposed at that time would have
had the effect of silencing speech and expression and be in conflict with the U.S.
Constitution. He further quoted from his 1992 statement about a classroom
incident in which speech that was contained in a homework assignment had
been criticized by a teaching assistant and had had the effect of causing a student
to drop the course.
Regent Baker opined that attempting to control conduct leads to control of
speech. He reviewed each of the amendments to the Statement that he had
suggested in 1992, asking Vice President Hartford whether these suggestions had
been incorporated into the current interim code. Vice President Hartford
responded in each case to Regent Baker's specific queries. Vice President
Hartford observed that the Policy on Discriminatory Harassment had been abolished and further stated that the current interim code contains "a passionate
defense of a student's constitutional right to free speech," as would any future
versions.
Regent Deitch made it clear that none of the Regents want to have a speech
code; the first amendment guarantee of free speech will be protected under any
statement approved by the Regents. He emphasized that the University is a
community that depends on values of civility, collegiality, and respect for certain
values. The final revision of the code should be a simple statement of norms and
values and expectations of the people who freely choose to be part of this community. The approach to take when dealing with standards that have been violated
should emphasize mediation and conciliation by peers.
In response to a question from Regent Newman, Regent Baker said that the
point of the comments of Professor Cohen that he had quoted from was that
conduct codes, improperly written, can be speech codes, because they do affect
speech. He also stated that he is opposed to almost all codes, except the


280




April Meeting, 1995


statement in Regents' Bylaws giving the president authority to maintain health,
diligence, and order among the students (Bylaw 2.01). The simpler the code, the
better, according to Regent Baker.
Regent Newman emphasized that students holding the positions of president of MSA and the leaders of MSA's Human Rights Commission and student
civil liberties board should play key roles in the redrafting of the statement.
Regent McFee pointed out that a university is a transitional place for
students between parent-dominated home environments and participation as
adults in the working world. A code needs to have an educational emphasis
because its purpose is not to control students, but to help them make this
transition. She emphasized Regent McGowan's focus in her motion that a code
should be simple, understandable, and that there should be student involvement
in its enforcement.
Regent Deitch stated that when the new statement comes back to the Board
in the fall, that will be the end of the process. A code will be adopted at that time,
so he advised all concerned that if they don't participate in the process, a code
will be adopted without their participation.
In response to comments about the code revision process from Mr. Wainess,
Regent Deitch stated that Vice President Hartford has the complete support of
the Board of Regents. When it comes back to the Regents, they "will get it done."
Regent Power reviewed the history of how the current interim code came to
be, noting that 1) the original participation of some students was insincere, as
they believed there should be no code at all; 2) at the time an original draft was
brought to the Board, some Regents confused its purpose, as a code of conduct
applying to people who choose to be members of an academic community, with
that of a legal system; and 3) some students believed that if they were recalcitrant, the University would end up not adopting a code. He emphasized that
"there will be a code," either one developed by a consultative process managed by
Vice President Hartford, or one developed by the Board.
The vote was then taken on Regent McGowan's motion, and it was
approved on a vote of seven to one, with Regent Baker opposed.
Regent Power commended the behavior of the students who had attended
the previous day's meeting and public comments session, noting that as a result,
the Regents had proceeded to conduct their business, but "listened hard" to the
students.
Regent McFee observed that under Ms. Neenan's leadership, MSA had
adopted a cooperative, collaborative approach on issues, rather than an adversarial approach, and that this had resulted in a win-win situation for everyone.
Minutes
Regent Baker moved approval of the minutes of the meetings of February
and March, 1995, with the addition on the February meeting minutes that the


281




April Meeting, 1995


views expressed by Regent Power with regard to changes being contemplated in
the way the Board operates were his own personal remarks. The other Regents
stated that they wished to associate themselves with Regent Power's remarks.
The vote was then taken and the minutes of the meetings of February and
March 1995 were approved on a vote of seven to one, with Regent Baker opposed.
Consent Agenda
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports of investments, plant extension, litigation, personnel-labor relations, and non-competitive
purchases over $2,000.         Vice President Neal submitted reports of projects established and summaries of a selection of current research for the month of March
1995. He pointed out that the Report of Projects Established is in a new                        format
that compares the number and value of awards with those figures for the prior
year to date.
Voluntary Support. Associate Vice President Muir submitted the report
of gifts received for the month of March 1995.

Retirement Memoirs
Roger E. Davis, professor of psychology in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts and research scientist in the Mental Health Research
Institute, Medical School, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1994,
after a productive career as a neuroscientist.
Born in Wisconsin, Professor Davis received his B.S. degree (zoology) and
his M.S. degree (fisheries studies) from the University of Michigan in 1954 and
his Ph.D. degree (zoology) from the University of Wisconsin in 1961. He joined
the University of Michigan as a research associate in the Department of Fisheries
in 1961 and became an instructor in physiology in the Department of Zoology in
1963. From 1964-66, he served as a postdoctoral fellow and assistant research
zoologist at the Mental Health Research Institute (MHRI), where he worked on
biochemical correlative behavior in goldfish. During that time, he participated in
important experiments that led to the conclusion that a protein synthesis was
required for the formation of long-term memory. He was promoted to associate
research psychobiologist in 1966, associate professor of psychology in 1969,
research psychobiologist in 1971, and professor of psychology in 1974.
Continuing as a behavioral neuroscientist, Professor Davis worked on fish
behavior, making important contributions to fish anatomy as well. His laboratory served as a research setting for biopsychology graduate students. Together
with Professor R. G. Northcutt, he edited the two-volume series, Fish Neurobiology, published by the University of Michigan Press in 1983. Professor Davis'
avocation as an artist enriched the neuroscience community. His meeting posters and reprint card designs contributed to the cohesiveness of the interdisciplinary programs housed in the Neuroscience Building and the Mental Health
Research Institute.

April Meeting, 1995


The Regents now salute this distinguished educator and scientist for his
dedicated service by naming Roger E. Davis professor emeritus of psychology and
research scientist emeritus.
Otto Z. Sellinger, research scientist in the Mental Health Research
Institute and research scientist in the Department of Psychiatry, Medical School,
retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1993, after a productive career
in neurochemical research.
Born in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, Dr. Sellinger received his primary education in
Rome and his S.B. degree in quantitative biology in 1954 at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. He received his Ph.D. degree in biochemistry in 1958 at
Tulane University, to which he returned as an assistant professor of biochemistry and medicine following two postdoctoral NIH fellowship years in Rome with
E. B. Chain (Nobel Laureate, 1945) and in Louvain, Belgium, with C. de Duve
(Nobel Laureate, 1974). He came to the University of Michigan in 1965 as an
associate research pharmacologist at the Mental Health Research Institute,
rising to the rank of research scientist in 1969.
Dr. Sellinger made many contributions to neurochemistry, among them an
understanding of methionine and glutamine metabolism in relation to seizure
activity. He is also well known for his techniques for methods for isolation of
neuronal and glial cells from brain tissue. Most recently, he studied carboxylmethylation of proteins in relation to aging. He has participated in many professional societies, including service as a member of the Council of the American
Society for Neurochemistry and the membership committee of the International
Society of Neurochemistry. He was a Fulbright Visiting Research Professor at
the School of Medicine in Montevideo, Uruguay, an Organization of American
States fellow in Brazil, and a National Academy of Sciences lecturer in Yugoslavia. He was a UNESCO lecturer in Venezuela and was awarded a Fogarty International Health Scientist Award to the Claude Bernard University in Lyon,
France. Because of his remarkable facility in languages, Dr. Sellinger often
lectured in the language of the country he was visiting when abroad.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scientist by naming Otto
Sellinger research scientist emeritus.

Regent McFee moved that the University participate in the Distribution
Management Service offered by the Common Fund's companion organization,
Endowment Advisors, Inc., with Warburg, Pincus Counsellors, Inc., as the
investment manager. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Estate of Helen Weber - Real Estate
The Regents were informed that Executive Vice President Womack had
approved the sale of a parcel of land located in Section 24, Ely Township,
Marquette County, Michigan. This parcel had been bequeathed in the will of
Helen F. Weber in 1973.
Vacant Lot in Lakewood Shores, losco County, Michigan
Regent Newman moved the following: that the University sell a vacant lot
in Lakewood Shores, north of Oscoda, Michigan, by participating in an auction,
as described in the Regents Communication, with a minimum bid amount of
$500, recognizing that the sale price may be less than the appraised value, and
that in the event an offer of $500 or more is not received, the property will be
listed for sale. Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Naming of the Visitors Center
On a motion by Regent Homing, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved naming the Visitors Center in honor of Frederick G. L.
Huetwell. Regent Baker commented that Mr. Bruce Cook, from Owasso, had
made an initial gift to fund a conceptual study for such a center, and he
suggested that at the appropriate time, the Cook family also be recognized for
their contributions to this facility.
UM-Dearborn General Campus Renovation Project Phase II Addition

Regents unanimously approved the UM-Dearborn General Campus Renovation
Project Phase II Addition and authorized the appointment of Sims Varner and
Associates, Inc., as architect.
Tennis Center
Executive Vice President Womack called on Mr. Fred Mayer, university
planner. Mr. Mayer gave a presentation that included renderings of the site plan
and schematic diagrams of the design for the tennis facility. Following some
discussion, Regent Power moved approval of the design and authorized soliciting
bids and awarding a construction contract, providing the contract value is within


295




April Meeting, 1995


the approved budget. Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved renovation projects at the following sites: E. H. Kraus
Building; Cooley Building; and Industrial and Operations Engineering Building.
UMMC Expansion of Primary Care Network in Ann Arbor and Saline
Regent Baker moved approval of two projects to allow expansion of the
Medical Center's primary care network: a site in Saline at the corner of Maple
Road and Woodland Drive and a site in western Ann Arbor at 4810 Jackson
Road (both as described in the Regents Communication).       Regent Deitch
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
UMMC Off-Site Occupational Health Facility
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the leasing, modification and furnishing of a facility on
Saline-Ann Arbor Road for use as an occupational health facility, as described in
the Regents Communication.
UMMC Surgical Clinic at Livonia
Regent Varner moved approval of leasing, modifying, and equipping space
in the building currently occupied by the University of Michigan Surgery Center
to accommodate a surgical clinic, as described in the Regents Communication.
Regent Horning seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Leasing Agreement with Dong-Soo Kim and Sook-Hee Kim
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved a leasing agreement with Dong-Soo Kim, M.D., and SookHee Kim. Because both of the Kims are also University employees, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following

296




April Meeting, 1995


Research Agreement with Therapeutic Systems Research Laboratories (TSRL)
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved a research agreement with Therapeutic Systems Research
Laboratories (TSRL). Because the chair and principal stockholder of TSRL
(Gordon Amidon) and three employees of TSRL (John Crison, Jae Seung Kim,
and Sally Choe) are also employees of the University of Michigan, this agreement
falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and TSRL, Inc.
2.  The terms of the agreement conform to University policy. The amount of the
subcontract to the University is $31,000. The period of performance is six
months. The University employees who will perform the University's research
have no connection with TSRL.
3.  The pecuniary interest of the University employees who are also associated
with TSRL arises out of their association with TSRL. None of these employees
are involved in performance of the agreement.
UMMC East Medical Campus Primar CaCare Facility Project
President Duderstadt called on Executive Vice President Womack to bring
back to the table the East Medical Campus Primary Care Facility Project that
had been tabled at the last Regents' Meeting. Executive Vice President Womack
noted that the only change in the action request from the one presented in
March is an increase in the project budget from $26,660,000 to $28,160,000.
Mr. Doug Hanna presented a new recommended option for this project. He
displayed the original recommendation for reference, along with a rendering of
the new recommended option, showing front, side, and rear elevations and the
perspective of the building as approached from the front. He described in detail
the proposed changes from the original, which include moving the stair elements,
changing the roof pitch, rotating the entrance canopy 45 degrees, rotating the
roof structure over the atrium 45 degrees, changing the columns to brick and
limestone, and not associating the clock tower with this design at this time.
Regent Power moved approval of the revised design for the East Medical
Campus Primary Care Facility Project, the revised budget of $28,160,000, the
construction strategy for expediting the schedule, and authorization for soliciting
bids and awarding construction contracts for the five packages, as described in
the Regents' Communication submitted at the March 1995 Regents' Meeting.
Regent Newman seconded the motion.
There followed some discussion in which Regents McFee and Power
expressed appreciation for the patience and speed with which Mr. Hanna and his
associates had prepared a revised design and renderings to present to the
Regents. Regent Baker commented that it was "first class work" that remedied a
number of issues that had been raised about the original design. The vote was
then taken, and the motion was approved unanimously.


297




April Meeting, 1995


Comments about Associate Vice President Chandler Matthews
Executive Vice President Womack observed that this would be the last meeting Associate Vice President Matthews would attend, as he would be retiring
after 25 years of service. He stated that Associate Vice President Matthews had
been a close and valued associate of his and of his two immediate past predecessors, and that he would be greatly missed. There followed a round of applause,
after which Associate Vice President Matthews thanked the Board for their
support over the years. Regent Baker expressed the Regents' appreciation to
Associate Vice President Matthews for all of his years of service.
Shady Trails Camp
Regent McGowan noted that during the previous day's Public Comments'
session former campers and counselors had made moving comments about the
planned closing of Shady Trails Camp for children with communicative disorders. She asked Provost Whitaker to comment about the situation.
Provost Whitaker reported that the camp had been run by the University
since the late 1960s, and that last summer, it had served about 104 campers at a
cost of about $400,000. Campers' families contribute about $55,000 in fees, and
the balance has to be made up either by General Fund allocations or by findraising. Some of the funds raised for the camp had come from the state, and the
state had announced in December 1994 that it was withdrawing its support. The
camp's director could not find a way to raise the money supplied by the state.
Three different alternative programs will be held during the summer of 1995
that will serve a total of about 50 children: two in Ann Arbor at the University's
Communicative Disorders Clinic, and one for children who attend the Detroit
public schools at the schools' camp on North Lake in Chelsea.
Provost Whitaker pointed out that the Shady Trails Camp was a service
program, not connected with the University's educational or research missions.
However, these children will continue to be served, with plans underway to serve
even more children in coming years. Regent McFee commented that the camping experience was very important to the children, and she hoped that this would
be able to be continued. Provost Whitaker responded that the camp's director
was hoping to find a way to provide a camping experience.
Adjournment
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting will be held on May 18 and 19, 1995. Regents' expenses for the month
of March 1995 totaled $1,212.24.
Interim Secretary of the University

MAY MEETING, 1995


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, May 18, 1995
The Regents met at 10:15 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan,
Newman, and Power. Secretary Jensen, Executive Vice President Womack, and
Provost Whitaker were also present, as were Vice Presidents Harrison and
Hartford. Regent Varner, Vice Presidents Kinnear and Neal and Chancellors
Nelms and Renick were absent.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and recognized Regent
Homing, who made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed session on
May 18, 1995, to consider material exempt from discussion or disclosure
by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act [Sec. 8(h)]. Such exempt
material consists of a written opinion from the Board's legal counsel.
Regent McGowan seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The Regents then proceeded to meet in executive session.
The meeting reconvened in public session at 1:50 p.m. in the Regents'
Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Homing,
McFee, McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Jensen, Provost
Whitaker, and Executive Vice President Womack were also present, as were Vice
Presidents Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and
Renick.
President's Report
Federal Budget Outlook. President Duderstadt commented on the
implications that the current efforts to balance the federal budget will have on
the University's budget. Current projections call for a 30 percent reduction in the
basic research budget over the course of the next several years. Major agencies,
including the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and Transportation, are targeted for elimination and a new, cabinet-level department of science is being proposed. Major funding agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF),
will also share in the budget cuts, including the proposed elimination of an entire
directorate in the social and behavioral sciences in the NSF. This is of great
concern to the University of Michigan, with its status as a national leader in
social science research. Other agencies having to do with engineering and
computer science have also been targeted for deep cuts. Cuts in Medicare and
student financial aid also have grave implications for higher education. This


299




May Meeting, 1995


volatile, rapidly changing environment has enormous implications for research
universities such as the University of Michigan.
State Appropriations Outlook. At the state level, President Duderstadt
observed that recent proposals have been encouraging, offering the first appropriations increases above the inflation rate in five years. In addition, the previously proposed funding reductions related to the University of Michigan's
instate/out-of-state enrollment ratio have been restored by the House Appropriations Committee. These proposals now are slated for action by the Senate Appropriations Committee and then will continue through the approval process. He
observed that the efforts of friends and alumni around the state have been of
enormous benefit in trying to improve the budget outlook, as have the help of
President David Adamany of Wayne State University and President William
Shelton of Eastern Michigan University.
Intercollegiate Athletics. President Duderstadt observed that there had
been considerable publicity in the previous few weeks over an incident that had
led to the resignation of head football coach Gary Moeller. He said that both he
and athletic director Joe Roberson had agreed with Coach Moeller's decision to
resign. He noted that his primary responsibility in intercollegiate athletics is his
concern for the integrity of the University's programs and for the welfare of the
student athletes involved in them. He commended the Board of Regents for its
strong support and Mr. Roberson for the courage and skill with which he
handled the incident. He noted that Mr. Lloyd Carr had been named interim
coach but that the search for the permanent coach was expected to be concluded
at the end of the 1995 season. He conveyed his strongest possible support for
Coach Carr and the rest of the coaching staff as they proceed with the upcoming
fall season.
Regent Baker expressed his gratitude to the governor and the legislature for
their support for the University in the latest round of budget negotiations.
Provost's Report
Provost Whitaker observed that a faculty tenure committee had prepared a
document on the meaning of tenure, and that the Senate Assembly had recently
adopted this document as an expression of its view of the meaning of tenure.
Provost Whitaker had expressed to the Senate Assembly his concerns that the
document focused more intently on privileges than on responsibilities, and that it
was this document, rather than the existing statement on appointment and
promotion of faculty, that reflected their position on this issue. The latter
document, "Qualifications for Appointment and Promotion in the Several
Faculties of the University of Michigan," had been adopted by the Board of
Regents in 1935 and revised in 1954. Provost Whitaker emphasized his belief
that the Regents are the ultimate authority on the meaning of tenure at the
University of Michigan based on the 1935/1954 document, especially in light of
the fact that the document recently adopted by Senate Assembly "dramatically
enlarges the privilege of tenure well beyond that concerned with academic
freedom."


300




May Meeting, 1995


Provost Whitaker compared the language of both documents in the area of
expectations for teaching and scholarship as faculty mature, noting that the recently adopted document makes a very weak statement about the responsibility
of being a faculty member. He informed the Regents that the administration intends to follow the document adopted by the Regents in 1954 as its understanding of the meaning of tenure, because in his view it provides a more balanced
view of responsibility and privilege.
Regent Power observed that tenure is currently an issue at universities
around the country. He said he has reviewed the University's 1935/1954 tenure
document and offered the following observations: 1) Over the next several years,
cuts expected in the federal research budget are going to cause a significant
challenge to the University as it tries to manage its costs by not building costs in
as fixed budget items; 2) the purpose of tenure was to try to protect academic
freedom, not to build in fixed costs for labor.
Regent McFee agreed, stating that Provost Whitaker's position is entirely
appropriate and that the University should continue with its present policy with
respect to tenure. She noted that it is the Regents that establish tenure policies,
and until such time as the Regents make a change, the policy currently in place
will remain the guiding one.
Chief Financial Officer's Report
Executive Vice President Womack introduced Randy Harris, associate vice
president for finance, who gave a presentation on the new Mcard program. The
Mcard will combine an identification card with such features as a bank debit
card, long distance calling card, library card, meal plan card, and entry card to
University buildings and sports facilities. Other features will be added in the
future as the technology becomes available.
Following the presentation, Associate Vice President Harris and Executive
Vice President Womack responded to questions from the Regents about the
Mcard program.
Proposed FY1996 Clinical Delivery System's Operating Budget
President Duderstadt called on Mr. John Forsyth, executive director of
University of Michigan Hospitals, to present the first proposed operating budget
for the Clinical Delivery System. Mr. Forsyth began by reviewing the FY1995
forecast of actual expenses for year end, noting that it was about 6.1 percent over
budget on the revenue side and 8.6 percent over budget on the expenditure side.
There is projected a total operating margin of 6.8 percent and excess revenue
over expenses of 7.2 percent ($67,598,000). He showed figures demonstrating the
Hospitals' strong financial viability compared to other AA rated hospitals. He
reviewed the Hospitals' response to the changing health care environment since
1984, showing how these responses had produced extremely favorable outcomes
in terms of the prominence of the Hospitals and Medical School in various
comparative measures of excellence.


301




May Meeting, 1995


Mr. Forsyth then explained the new Clinical Delivery System, which is the
centerpiece of University of Michigan Health System. Other components of the
Health System include the Michigan Health Corporation, a joint venture vehicle
which was approved by the Regents in December, and M-Care. He described the
Clinical Delivery System in terms of its vision, the projected 1996 budget, and the
integrated clinical revenue distribution plan which will distribute net operating
revenue to the Clinical Delivery System and the Medical School and its clinical
departments. FY 1996 budget assumptions include "financial re-engineering"; a
$28.0 million undefined cost effectiveness program; enhanced academic support;
increased clinic visits and decreased admissions with a flat length of stay; a selffunded competitive salary program; increased "managed care"; a 4.2 percent
overall average rate increase; and a margin objective of 5.9 percent. The proposed
FY 1996 operating budget consists of total operating revenue of $901,786,000;
total operating expenses of $882,172,000, an operating margin of $19,614,000,
and excess revenue over expenses of $55,330,000.
Mr. Forsyth concluded by noting that significant challenges will continue in
the future as the alignment of the Clinical Delivery System with physicians in the
Medical School will create a fundamental change in how care is delivered in the
University of Michigan Medical Center.
Dean Giles Bole commented on the challenges posed by the new Clinical
Delivery System from the perspective of the Medical School. Regent McFee
moved approval of the proposed FY 1996 University of Michigan Clinical Delivery System's operating budget, including a recommended average rate increase
of 4.2 percent. Regent Homing seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
There followed some discussion about negotiations that are to occur
between the University of Michigan and three other area health systems within
the next six months as to whether it would be desirable, feasible, and in the best
interests of all parties to pursue collaboration in several areas (see "Clinical
Delivery System Integration" below). Mr. Forsyth stated that the Regents would
be kept informed on a regular basis as these discussions proceed.
Lease Agreement with Dr. Ihsan Ui Haq (901 N. Macomb Street,
Monroe)
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved a lease agreement between the University of Michigan
and Dr. Ihsan Ui Haq, involving a medical office building located at 901 North
Macomb Street, Monroe, Michigan. Because Dr. Haq is also a University of
Michigan employee, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Dr. Ihsan Ui
Haq.
2.  Terms of the contract: The duration of the contract is seven years. The University will lease the property located at 901 North Macomb Street, Monroe,
Michigan. The medical office facility is 10,424.5 square feet, at a rental rate of


302




May Meeting, 1995


$14.00 per square foot, $145,943.04 annually (for year one starting June 1,
1995, with a 3 percent inflation cost added for each subsequent year) plus the
Tenant's pro rata share of the Landlord's operating expenses for each calendar
year during the term of the lease. The medical center will place clericals,
medical office assistants, nurses, and physicians to provide necessary primary
care services to the community.
3.   Dr. Haq's pecuniary interest arises from ownership of the building. Dr. Haq will
receive revenues generated by the leasing of the property to the University.
Lease Agreement with Dr. Ihsan Ui Haq (3749 N. Dixie Highway,
Monroe)
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved a leasing agreement between the University of Michigan
and Dr. Ihsan Ui Haq, involving a medical office building located at 3749 North
Dixie Highway, Monroe, Michigan. Because Dr. Haq is also a University of Michigan employee, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Dr. Ihsan Ui
Haq.
2.   Terms of the contract: The duration of the contract is seven years. The University will lease the property located at 3749 North Dixie Highway, Monroe,
Michigan. The medical office facility is 3,000 square feet, at a rental rate of
$14.00 per square foot, $42,000.00 annually (for year one starting June 1, 1995,
with a 3 percent inflation cost added for each subsequent year) plus the
Tenant's pro rata share of the Landlord's operating expenses for each calendar
year during the term of the lease. The medical center will place clericals,
medical office assistants, nurses, and physicians to provide necessary primary
care services to the community.
3.   Dr. Haq's pecuniary interest arises from ownership of the building. Dr. Haq will
receive revenues generated by the leasing of the property to the University.
Clinical Delivery System Integration
The Regents received information about an agreement that has been
reached by Daughters of Charity National Health System-East Central (DCNHSEC); Mercy Health Services (MHS); Michigan Health Corporation (MHC) and
the University of Michigan Medical Center (UMMC) to focus on opportunities for
collaboration in four specific areas: 1) Improving the efficiency and effectiveness
of clinical delivery systems; 2) development of a state-wide managed care strategy
and integration of related delivery, administrative, and financial resources, short
of integration of assets; 3) health sciences education at the undergraduate and
graduate levels; and 4) health services research. Detailed information is provided
in the Regents Communication.
Williamsburg Properties
Mr. Forsyth presented this proposal to acquire five medical office buildings
and an additional lot in the Briarwood Mall area of Ann Arbor. The University
has been leasing the buildings for about ten years as a satellite site for a Medical
Center family practice clinic, which has been a very successful ventureo The


303




May Meeting, 1995


purchase of the existing buildings and the proposed expansion, he explained,
demonstrates the Medical Center's long-term commitment to provide high
quality, cost effective care in the community, and will pay for itself in 11 years.
Regent Deitch moved the following: 1) that the University acquire the
existing Williamsburg properties at a price of $9.875 million, subject to the terms
outlined in the Regents Communication; 2) that the University acquire lot 10,
including two buildings to be constructed by Beachum & Roeser at a cost of $2.8
million, as described, adjusted for any increases in labor and material costs since
Beachum & Roeser's March 1995 proposal and subject to the terms outlined
above; and 3) a $400,000 contingency for any modifications or upgrades which
may be required for the two buildings to be built on lot 10. Regent Horming
seconded the motion.
Regent McGowan asked if and when the City of Ann Arbor had been notified of the proposed purchase of the Williamsburg properties. Vice President Harrison replied that discussions had been held with city officials, including the
mayor and several council members, two days before. He said he had given them
a community impact statement, and they appreciated that as well as having been
informed in advance of the University's impending action. City officials had,
however, expressed concern about the impact of the loss in tax revenue. Mr.
Forsyth pointed out that many of the patients using the clinics come from
communities outside of Ann Arbor, so this creates a significant positive economic
impact that could offset the loss of property tax revenue.
At the request of Regent McGowan it was decided to delay action on the
motion until the following morning, during which time the Regents would have
had an opportunity to review the community impact statement that had been
shared with city officials and community leaders.
940 Maiden Lane, Ann Arbor
Regent Deitch moved that the University acquire the property at 940
Maiden Lane at a price of $168,400, subject to satisfactory completion of environmental due diligence, using hospital funds to complete the purchase. Regent
Varner seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting recessed at 3:40 p.m., reconvening at 4:00 p.m. to meet in
executive session.
Friday, May 19, 1995
The Regents met at 9:10 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman,
Power, and Varner. Secretary Jensen, Executive Vice President Womack, and
Provost Whitaker were aso present, als were Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford,
Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick,


304




May Meeting, 1995


Minutes
On a motion by Regent Baker seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved the minutes of the April 1995 meeting.
Consent Agenda
Reports. Executive Vice President Womack submitted reports of investments, plant extension, litigation, and personnel-labor relations and commented
on  the current state of the financial markets. Vice President Neal submitted
reports of projects established and summaries of a selection of current research
for the month of April 1995. It was noted that proposals were being made at the
federal level that could eliminate significant amounts of federally-fumded
research currently carried out at the University of Michigan and other research
universities.
Voluntary Support. Vice President Kinnear submitted the report of voluntary support for the month of April 1995, noting that it had been a recordsetting year in the area of voluntary support. He also pointed out that more than
half of the gifts received by the University are from            out-of-state, and noted that
these donors often comment that "if we are going to continue to                      support the
University, then we hope that you are not going to limit the chances of our
children going to Michigan." Following some discussion, it was decided that the
issue of bequests and other forms of support be presented as a discussion topic,
perhaps at the July meeting.

Personnel Actions. Provost Whitaker submitted personnel reports including the annual recommendations for promotions to the ranks of professor,
associate professor, and assistant professor. He described the process by which
candidates are reviewed for promotion. Of the 135 recommendations from            the
Ann Arbor campus, 37 cases, or 30.4 percent, are women. At the request of
Regent McGowan, Provost Whitaker agreed to provide more information as to
how the increase in the number of women'is distributed among the schools and
colleges.
Provost Whitaker responded to further questions from the Regents about
the promotion process and expectations for tenure, and then reviewed several
specific cases. Chancellor Renick submitted three promotion recommendations,
and Chancellor Nelms submitted ten.

May Meeting, 1995


Retirement Memoirs. Provost Whitaker submitted twenty retirement
memoirs.
Ronald E. Austin, senior associate librarian, retired from the University
Library on December 31, 1994.
A native of Pennsylvania, Mr. Austin earned his AB. degree from the
College of Wooster in 1953, his B.D. degree from Yale University Divinity School
in 1956, and his A.M.L.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1961. He
joined the staff at the University of Michigan in 1967 as a catalog librarian.
During his 27-year career, Mr. Austin contributed to a range of library units
and projects that formed a microcosm of the larger changes taking place in the
organization of research libraries. Ever cognizant of the need for sensible change,
he was recently commended for his efforts in the 1970s to automate the library
card catalog files.
In 1981, Mr. Austin assumed responsibility for collection development and
campus service in French, Spanish, and Italian history and literature, an assignment greatly enhanced by his language facility and diligent work ethic. He recently assumed responsibility for Latin American selection and management of
the Graduate Library's reference collection. He also maintained strong relationships with faculty and graduate students, who consistently extolled his responsiveness and knowledge of the collections. Mr. Austin's expertise is also
evidenced by his article in Collection Management ("An Evaluation of a Blanket
Order Plan for French Publications") in 1988 and recently in College and Research Libraries titled "Indexing Price Trends of French Academic Books in the
Humanities and Social Sciences."
Ron Austin has made an enduring contribution to the campus. His highly
productive work style, commitment to excellent service, and broad range
understanding of the library have supported a generation of campus scholars and
created an excellent foundation for future support and service.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian by naming Ronald E.
Austin senior associate librarian emeritus.
Sylvester E. Berki, professor of health services management and policy,
will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1995.
Professor Berki received his B.S. degree from Columbia University in 1957
and his M.A degree from Yale University in 1958. From 1963-67, he served as
assistant professor at Cornell University. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1967 as a lecturer in the Department of Medical Care Organization and
was promoted to associate professor in 1971 and to professor in 1977. Professor
Berki served as chair of the Department of Medical Care Organization from
1980-86. During this period, he secured Kellogg Foundation support to enable
the department's health services organization and policy program to become a
reality.
Professor Berki taught health economics in the Department of Medical Care
Organization and later in the Department of Health Services Management and
Policy and also designed and taught a health economics course for students in
the Medical School. His 1972 book, Hospital Economics, is widely regarded as
one of the important foundations upon which the study of health economics has
been built. He has been a visiting professor at the University of Washington and


320




May Meeting, 1995


has been a guest lecturer at several institutions in China. At the invitation of the
Chinese minister of public health, he participated in health administration and
education workshops in Shanghai and Beijing.
Professor Berki's research interests included "Evaluating Community
Health Networks," a project funded by the Bureau of Health Services Research,
DHEW. His research on DRGs prompted an invitation to participate in presentations at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. He has served as a consultant to a
number of government and private agencies, and during 1988-89 he served on
the Michigan Governor's Task Force on Access to Health Care.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Sylvester E. Berki
professor emeritus of health services management and policy.
Raymond P. Canale, professor of civil and environmental engineering,
will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1995.
Professor Canale received his B.S. degree in civil engineering in 1964 and
his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in sanitary engineering in 1966 and 1968, respectively, all from Syracuse University. He joined the University of Michigan faculty
in 1968 as an assistant professor and was promoted to associate professor in 1972
and professor in 1977. He is also a registered professional engineer in Michigan.
In the area of teaching, Professor Canale developed major new courses at
both undergraduate and graduate levels. The College of Engineering adopted his
course on computational methods as a required course in numerical methods for
many of its departments. He also developed and taught a two-course sequence in
stream, lake, and estuarine analysis at the graduate level. Professor Canale
authored six textbooks on numerical and computer methods and two on aquatic
ecosystems and biological waste treatment. He is also a technical reviewer for
eighteen influential journals.
In his research, Professor Canale concentrated on limnology and mathematical modeling. He contributed over 100 technical papers, reports, and lectures
and authored or co-authored 8 books in these fields. He also serves internationally as a consultant and expert witness in cases involving all aspects of water
quality. In 1987, Professor Canale was named by the American Society for Engineering Education as co-recipient of the Meriam/Wiley Distinguished Author
Award for contributing two outstanding texts on computing and numerical
methods for engineering students. These texts, with the accompanying software
packages, were adopted by over 100 engineering programs in the United States
and reached an international market.
The Regents now salute this distinguished engineer, researcher, and practitioner for his contributions by naming Raymond P. Canale professor emeritus of
civil and environmental engineering.
James N. Cather, professor of zoology, will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 1995, following 37 years of service.
Professor Cather earned his B.S. (1954) and M.S. (1955) degrees at Southern Methodist University and his Ph.D. degree (1958) at Emory University. He
joined the faculty in 1958 as an instructor of zoology and was promoted to
assistant professor in 1960, associate professor in 1965, and professor in 1973. In
1975, Professor Cather was appointed chair of the Department of Experimental


321




May Meeting, 1995


Biology, a subdivision of the newly created Division of Biological Sciences formed
when botany and zoology merged in 1975. He also served as associate chair of the
division and as acting chair for one year. In 1983, he was appointed associate
dean for facilities in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, a post he
held for five years. Later, he was named director of the Office of International
Programs, where for four years he traveled widely, visiting students and faculty
at sites of the Michigan programs.
An outstanding teacher, Professor Cather participated in large undergraduate courses in embryology and comparative anatomy and, together with the late
Professor George W. Nace, inaugurated a new course in experimental embryology. For his excellence in teaching, he received the Class of 1923 Award in 1964.
During his career, Professor Cather taught a variety of different undergraduate
and graduate courses and seminars and also taught and conducted research at a
number of universities and marine laboratories. Ten graduate students working
in his laboratory received the Ph.D. degree, and he served on about 100 doctoral
committees.
Professor Cather's research focused on the development of molluscs. By the
experimental techniques of cell injury, cell deletion, and cell fusion, he altered the
normal course of development to study the mechanisms of tissue and organ
differentiation. His publications and those of his graduate students attest to his
valuable contributions in his field.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
James N. Cather professor emeritus of zoology.
Kuei Chuang, professor of electrical engineering and computer science,
will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1995.
Professor Chuang received his B.S.E. degree in 1950 from National Taiwan
University and his M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees in 1952 and 1958, respectively, from
the University of Michigan. As a graduate student, he conducted research at the
University of Michigan's Engineering Research Institute, Servomechanisms
Laboratory, and Willow Run Laboratory, in addition to teaching at Wayne State
University. He joined the faculty as assistant professor of electrical engineering
in 1959; he was promoted to associate professor in 1962 and professor in 1969.
Professor Chuang's research and teaching focused on energy conversion and
feedback control systems. He was actively involved in the department's educational program from his earliest days on the faculty, and he was particularly
noted for his ability to establish a good relationship with his students. He
contributed significantly to the revision and updating of all the control courses
taught at the University and introduced the teaching of Markovian stochastic
control problems in the United States. Professor Chuang's teaching skills were
widely recognized. He received the Tau Beta Pi Outstanding Teacher Award in
1978, the Eta Kappa Nu Teacher-of-the-Year Award in 1982, and the Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science Teaching Excellence Award in 1994. Professor Chuang also served for several years as undergraduate counselor in the electrical engineering program.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his distinguished career by
naming Kuei Chuang professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer
science.

population programs.
Beginning in 1972, Professor Finkle turned his attention to the United
Nations' emerging role in the regulation of rapid population growth. He received
a Rockefeller Foundation grant to study the role of specialized agencies of the
United Nations in the population field. It was in this period that he began to
examine population policy as a function of politics rather than as an outgrowth of
demographics. Through research on international agencies and developing
countries, Professor Finkle demonstrated that while demographers, economists,
and other technical specialists have influence, politics and ideology, as much as
demographic analysis, drive population policy.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Jason L. Finkle
professor emeritus of population planning.

A-133 Reports and Schedules and a summary of recommendations for the year
ended June 30, 1994, together with the University responses.
In response to a question from Regent Power about the cost of complying
with federal reporting requirements, Vice President Neal stated that interest in
reducing the reporting requirements has been expressed in Congress. Executive
Vice President Womack noted that complying with these reporting requirements
requires the employment of significant numbers of auditing staff.
Alternative Asset Investments
Regent McFee moved that $20.0 million of the Long Term Portfolio be committed to Multinational/Emerging Markets Energy Fund, L.P., pending favorable review of the documents for their legal acceptability by the general counsel's

invested in the Acquisition Fund and $5.92 million will be invested in the
Exploration Fund. She further recommended that the Board authorize the establishment of a subsidiary Cayman Islands corporation, should it prove to be
needed.
Executive Vice President Womack stated that there remain some unanswered questions about unrelated business income, and if these cannot be
resolved, this investment will not proceed. He then responded to a question from
Regent Baker about this investment. Regent Baker pointed out that the exploration fund investment involves a higher risk than other energy investments the
University has made. He seconded Regent McFee's motion, and it was approved
unanimously.

Amendment to University Retirement Plan
Regent McFee moved approval of a change in the retirement plan, effective
July 1, 1995, to permit participants to elect to receive up to 100 percent of their
accumulations as a lump sum         retirement or, for former University staff
members, at age 55. Following some discussion, the motion was approved on a
vote of 7 to 1, with Regent Baker voting no.
North Campus Bell Tower
Regent McFee moved approval of the revised budget for the North Campus
Bell Tower and authorized award of a construction contract to Ellis-Don Michigan, Inc. It was explained that a number of factors contributed to the project's


335




May Meeting, 1995


being over budget, but that the donor would be underwriting the increased costs.
The motion was approved unanimously.
CC.e Little Pharmacy Project
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Homing, the Regents
unanimously approved an increase in budget for programmatic renovations in
the C.C. Little Building and authorized the award of a construction contract to
Ellis-Don Michigan, Inc., involving the subcontractors listed in the Regents
Communication.
Parking Fees
Executive Vice President Womack observed that a large increase in staff
paid parking fees beginning in 1990 had eliminated a majority of the backlog of
deferred maintenance and allowed for the addition of many safety improvements.
Therefore, only a modest increase in fees would be required for the next five
years.
Following some discussion, Regent Varner moved to authorize an increase
in the faculty/staff paid parking fees by 3.5 percent for each of the next five years:
1995-96 through 1999-00. Regent McFee seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
Medical Science I A Wing Infrastructure and Laboratory Remodeling
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Horing, the Regents
unanimously approved a project involving infrastructure and laboratory
remodeling of the A Wing of the Medical Science I Building, as described in the
Regents Communication.
Medical Science I A Wing Infrastructure and Laboratory Remodeling
Financing
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
adopted the following Resolution authorizing the Medical Science Building I A
Wing Infrastructure and Laboratory Remodeling as an approved project in the
Hospital Revenue Bonds, Medical Service Plan Revenue Bonds and Medical Service Plan Refunding Bonds and decreasing the authorization size for the bond issue from $222,200,000 to $220,000,000.
RESOLUTION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AMENDING RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE AND DELIVERY
OF HOSPITAL REVENUE BONDS AND MEDICAL SERVICE PLAN REVENUE
BONDS, AND PROVIDING FOR OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO
WHEREAS, on September 24, 1993, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer") adopted its Resolution Authorizing the Issuance and Delivery of
Hospital Revenue Bonds and Medical Service Plan Revenue Bonds, and Providing for
Other Matters Relating Thereto, which Resolution was amended on December 17,
1993, February 18, 1994, September 19, 1994, October 20, 1994, and December 15,
1994 (as amended, in the "Resolution"); and


336




May Meeting, 1995


WHEREAS, it is necessary and desirable to further amend the resolution as
provided herein:
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Regents of the University
of Michigan, as follows:
1.  The second "Whereas" clause of the Resolution is hereby amended to include within the definition and description of the "Projects", "the renovation and remodeling of laboratory and support space in Medical Science Building I, including
related furnishings and equipment and building infrastructure upgrades".
2.  The eighth "Whereas" clause of the Resolution is hereby amended by

Renovations
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the following renovation projects: 1) off-site expansion of
the UMH Outpatient Chronic Hemodialysis Project; 2) UMH operating rooms/
wall/corner/door protection; 3) Integrated Technology Instruction Center (ITIC)
basement completion; 4) Law Library Rare Book Room Project; 5) a fire safety
project in the Legal Research Building; 6) completion of research laboratories in
the Willard Henry Dow Building; 7) renovation of the North Campus Waste
Transfer Facility; 8) conversion of a number of miscellaneous buildings to key
card access; and 9) renovations in the UM-Dearborn Engineering Laboratory
Building.
UM-Dearborn General Campus Renovation Project Phase II
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent McGowan, the
Regents unanimously approved the budget and authorized issuing the project for
bids and awarding a construction contract, providing the project is within
budget.
UM-Dearborn Environmental Interpretive Center
Chancellor Renick reported that the Environmental Interpretive Center has
been designated as one of twelve projects to be funded by gifts through the
MCampaign.
There followed a discussion in response to Regent Baker's question as to
why it is necessary to pledge student fee revenues to secure the funding. He


337




May Meeting, 1995


observed that in general, he does not approve of student fees being pledged unless a building has a specific student purpose. Executive Vice President Womack
explained that this is the only method possible for funding projects with an
academic purpose. It was also emphasized that the payment in this instance will
ultimately be from gifts; this is merely a device used to finance the construction
cash flow requirements.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the proposed site for the University of MichiganDearborn Environmental Interpretive Center.
Operation of a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) by the University of Michigan Medical Center (UMMC)
Executive Vice President Womack informed the Regents that the UMMC is
initiating the development of a preferred provider organization product that will
be marketed to self-insured employers in the local community.
Regent Deitch commented that Hospitals' Executive Director John Forsyth
is a member of the board of Preferred Providers of Michigan, which is one of the
potential vendors for this PPO. He asked that a legal opinion be obtained as to
the possible conflict of interest created by this situation. Executive Vice President
Womack stated that the general counsel had issued an opinion on this matter
before Mr. Forsyth joined this board. Before the University would contract with
this or any other organization in which a potential conflict exists, the same rules
would apply to him that would apply to any University employee with regard to
conflicts of interest. Regent Deitch asked to see a copy of the opinion.
Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and Therapeutic Systems Research Laboratories (TSRL)
On a motion by Regent McFee, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved an agreement between the University of Michigan and
TSRL, under which TSRL will subcontract with the University of Michigan to
perform a portion of the work for a project granted to TSRL by the U.S. Department of Defense. Because several University employees (Gordon Amidon, John
Crison, Jae Seung Kim, and Sally Choe) are also either employees or officers of
TSRL, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement will be the University of Michigan and TSRL. The
University employees who will perform the University's research efforts have
no connection with TSRL.
2.  The terms of the agreement conform to University policy. The amount of the
subcontract to the University is $21,790; the period of performance is six
months.
3.  The pecuniary interest of the individuals disclosed arises solely by virtue of
their employment or other relationship with TSRL.


338




May Meeting, 1995


Purchasing Agreement between the University of Michigan and Integrated Sensing Systems, Inc. (ISSYS)
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved a purchasing agreement between the University of Michigan and ISSYS. Because two University of Michigan faculty members, Kensall D.
Wise and Khalil Najafi, also are members of the board of directors and shareholders in ISSYS, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and ISSYS.
2.   The terms of the proposed agreement are acceptable and conform to University
policy. No work will be performed by the University under this agreement.
3.   Neither of the disclosed individuals will receive compensation from the
University or from ISSYS from this agreement. Their sole pecuniary interest
arises from their equity ownership in ISSYS.
4.   The cost of the contract to the University is $492,150; the period of performance is 18 months.
Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and Matrigen, Inc.
Vice President Neal reported that this agreement is expected to serve as a
model for other such agreements that might occur in the future. President
Duderstadt suggested that Dr. Steven Goldstein, one of the founders of Matrigen
and a University faculty member, be invited to come to the next meeting for a
more thorough discussion of this topic.
Vice President Neal described the nature of the project to be undertaken as
a result of the proposed agreement. Regent Newman suggested that the whole
notion of the University's policies in the area of intellectual property, technology
transfer, and related issues be presented as an area of discussion. President
Duderstadt suggested that this discussion be integrated with the discussion of
Matrigen.
Regent Power moved approval of the University's entering into a research
agreement with Matrigen, Inc. Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously. Because several University faculty members (Steven
Goldstein, Jeffrey Bonadio, and Robert Levy) are also founders and owners of
45-50 percent of the outstanding stock of Matrigen, this agreement falls under
the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Matrigen, Inc.
2.   Terms of the agreement will be consistent with University policy regarding research contracts. Intellectual property rights will be governed by the terms of
the license agreement. The research project is proposed over a twelve month period at a total cost of $927,883. The budget includes $624,296 of direct costs and
$303,587 of indirect cost. Collection of $222,269 of the indirect cost will be deferred for five years from the start of the project. This deferment will allow


339




May Meeting, 1995


sufficient direct cost to be available to conduct the project within the funding
limitations of Matrigen and its investors.
3.   The founders will not receive direct compensation, beyond their equity shares,
from Matrigen but will have a portion of their University effort supported by
this research project (Bonadio, 80%, and Goldstein and Levy, 20% each).
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and
Matrigen, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Horning, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved a license agreement between the University of Michigan
and Matrigen, Inc. Because the co-inventors of the technologies to be licensed
(Dr. Jeffrey Bonadio, Dr. Steven A     Goldstein, and Dr. Robert J. Levy-"the
Founders") are both University employees and founders and equity owners of
Matrigen, this agreement falls under the state of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement will be the University of Michigan and Matrigen, Inc.,
a company in which Drs. Bonadio, Goldstein, and Levy hold an equity interest.
2.   Contract terms: The contracts to be completed between the University and
Matrigen include the license to be executed as well as documents covering stock
transfers and related matters. A sponsored research contract between the
University and Matrigen is the subject of a separate Regents Communication
(see "Research Agreement between the University of Michigan and Matrigen,
Inc.," above).
3.   The terms of the exclusive license agreement include the following
The license will provide the University with a modest royalty (1.5 to 2.0%) of
Matrigen's net sales and its sublicensee's net sales of products, a small portion
(5%) of any sublicensee advance payments, and at least a 21% equity interest in
Matrigen, to be calculated after Matrigen has obtained at least $250,000 in
outside investment funding (all equity interest conveyed to the University will
be kept by the treasurer in accordance with the University's standard practices
for stock holdings);
The University will retain ownership of the technologies and patents, granting
an exclusive commercialization license to Matrigen. The University will retain
internal research use rights, the right to convey the standard governmental
license, and commercialization rights in certain fields of use which are optioned
to or under negotiation with private corporate research sponsors.
Matrigen will use reasonable efforts to develop products, obtain governmental
approvals, and make the benefits of products available to the public.
No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University
employees, is obligated under the license agreement.
Drs. Bonadio's, Goldstein's, and Levy's (the Founders) pecuniary interest
arises from their equity ownership interest in Matrigen, Inc. In accordance with
the University Policy on Intellectual Property, they will waive any personal participation in the sharing of revenues received by the University from Matrigen.
(The non-founder inventors will share in such revenues in accordance with University policy, on a pro rata basis under a sharing agreement ratified by all
inventors.)

May Meeting, 1995


1995-96 University Health Service Fee
Regent McGowan moved approval of an increase of $4.50 per student per
term for the 1995-96 University Health Service Fee. Regent Deitch seconded the
motion.
Regent Baker observed that this fee had increased by about 5 percent per
year for the past ten years and questioned the logic of comparing health care
costs for this healthy, young cohort of individuals with those of the general
population. He stated his objection to this fee increase.
Regent Newman stated she was not prepared to vote for the fee increase
without understanding why it was necessary for the University to maintain a
separate health care facility for students under the auspices of the vice president
for student affairs when it already had a separate medical center. President
Duderstadt responded that most college campuses do maintain separate health
care facilities for students and that these are much cheaper to operate than
medical centers.
Following further discussion, the vote was taken and the motion to increase
the University Health Service fee by $4.50 per student per term was approved,
with Regents Deitch, Homing, McFee, McGowan, Power, and Varner in favor
and Regents Baker and Newman opposed. The new fee will be $101.00 per
student per term.
Regents' Meeting Schedule for 1996
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
approved the following schedule of meetings for 1996

JUNE MEETING, 1995


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, June 15, 1995
The Regents met at 9:10 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman, and
Power. Secretary Jensen, Executive Vice President Womack, Provost Whitaker,
and Vice President Harrison were also present. Regents Deitch and Varner
arrived shortly after the start of the meeting. Vice Presidents Hartford, Kinnear,
and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick were absent.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and recognized Regent
McFee, who made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(h) of the Open Meetings Act, as amended
by 1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed
session on June 15, 1995, for the purpose of considering a periodic
personnel evaluation of an employee who has requested confidentiality [Sec. 8(a)]; and considering material exempt from discussion or
disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act [Sec. 8(h)].
Such exempt material consists of a written opinion from the Board's
legal counsel.
Regent Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The Regents then proceeded to meet in executive session.
The meeting reconvened in public session at 1:50 p.m. in the Regents'
Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Horning, McFee,
McGowan, Newman, Power, and Varner. Secretary Jensen, Executive Vice President Womack, and Provost Whitaker were also present, as were Vice Presidents
Harrison, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick. Regent Deitch
arrived shortly after the start of the meeting; Vice President Hartford arrived at
about 3:00 p.m.
Retirement Memoir for Henry Johnson
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and observed that former
Vice President Henry Johnson was in attendance. He noted that although Mr.
Johnson had been honored by the Regents several years previously when
stepping down from his post as vice president for community relations, he was
now retiring from the University and the Regents were adopting a resolution
naming him vice president emeritus. President Duderstadt expressed once again
the University's deep appreciation for Vice President Johnson's extensive service
during some very difficult times and wished him well in the years ahead.


343




June Meeting, 1995


Regent Baker moved adoption of the retirement memoir for Henry Johnson;
Regent McFee seconded the motion. Regent Baker commented on Vice President
Johnson's outstanding service, noting that this recognition was important both
for Mr. Johnson and for the University. The vote was then taken, and the motion
was approved unanimously. There followed a round of applause.
President's Report
President Duderstadt updated the Regents on alliances that have been
formed among the 3200 American higher education institutions. Among these
are the "One Dupont Circle group," consisting of the American Council of Education (ACE), the American Association of Universities (AAU), and the National
Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC). These
are the traditional alliances in which universities come together to work on
higher education issues.
Over the past few years, several new, different alliances have formed. He
pointed out that the Big Ten Conference, which includes 11 institutions, is first
and foremost an academic conference. The provosts of these institutions belong
to the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC). He was recently named
chair of the Council of Ten, which consists of the presidents of all of the universities in the Big Ten Conference. These institutions have decided to join their
libraries together into a single library with joint acquisitions. Learning technologies activities will also be tied together in these institutions, so that students at
all of them can take classes and faculty can teach classes using distance learning
techniques. Other alliances have formed to focus on international development
activities, federal relations, research finding issues, and the "faculty contract".
He also described the Tanner Group, which consists of both public and private
institutions.
Besides the alliances among like institutions, he reported that other alliances are forming among dissimilar institutions. For instance, the University of
Michigan is exploring closer collaboration with the state's community college system and networks with small liberal arts colleges. Universities are also coming
together world- wide in a structure known as the "co-laboratory." Finally, learning alliances have been formed between colleges and universities and
knowledge-based corporations, such as Time-Warner, Microsoft, and Disney.
Provost's Report
Provost Whitaker updated the Regents on the searches currently underway
for the deans of the College of Pharmacy, the Rackham School of Graduate
Studies, the School of Natural Resources and Environment, and the College of
Engineering. He said that his next report would describe efforts that are being
made to improve the first year experience for UM   students. Noting that
affirmative action policies have been subject to much discussion and criticism in
recent months, he observed th  t e problem is how to maintain a commitment
to diversity, even though the tools might change.


344




June Meeting, 1995


Chief Financial Officer's Report
Executive Vice President Womack gave a report on the restructuring of administrative processes throughout the institution. The Strategic Data Planning
Project involves a complete rethinking of the way problems have been historically
attacked, through a procedure known as "process area management." It strives
to "eliminate policies, processes, and procedures that don't add value" to the
system. He described the structure being used to accomplish the goals of this
project, among which are to better serve students, faculty, staff, and the
community through innovation and improvement of processes.
University of Michigan Alumni Association
President Duderstadt introduced Mssrs. Steve Grafton and Bob Peterson,
and Regent Emeritus Tom Roach, executive director, immediate past president,
and president, respectively, of the University of Michigan Alumni Association.
Mr. Roach reported that a high priority for the coming year would be to increase
the association's legislative advocacy program so as to create a favorable atmosphere for the University with the state legislature. He also emphasized the Association's important role in fiudraising.
Mr. Peterson described the search process that had led to the appointment
of Mr. Grafton as president of the Alumni Association. He observed that in addition to the activities mentioned by Mr. Roach, another of the association's priorities is to serve alumni as members of the University community on a life-long
basis. In particular, this involves recognizing the needs of graduates as they face
the challenges of the changing career environment; this involves a life-long
commitment on the part of the association.
Mr. Grafton described the strategic planning process that had been undertaken by the Alumni Association, resulting in the adoption of a new mission
statement. He reviewed the mission statement and associated goals. He reported
that the Alumni Association, in cooperation with the Information Technology Division, has developed a World Wide Web page, "Michigan On-Line," to help keep
alumni in touch electronically, and then proceeded to demonstrate the features of
this page to the assembly.
Regent Emeritus Roach concluded the presentation by asking the Regents
how the Alumni Association could help the Regents "maintain and enhance the
excellence that is the University of Michigan."
There followed a brief discussion about the Alumni Association. Regent
Power recommended that the Regents meet with the Alumni Association on a
more regular basis.
The Challenge of the Changing Federal Environment
The Regents then heard presentations from Mr. Tom Butts, associate vice
president for university relations, Ms. Judith Harper, interim director of the
Office of Financial Aid, and Mr. Albert Hermsen, assistant director of the Office
of the Financial Aid, on the impact of proposed changes in student financial aid


345




June Meeting, 1995


programs on University of Michigan students, and from Vice President Neal and
Mr. Robert Samors, government relations officer in the Office of the Vice President for Research, on proposed changes in federal research funding.
Student Financial Aid. Mr. Butts gave a presentation describing the
federal budget process and reviewed the changes that are being proposed in each
of the existing federal student grant and loan programs. Ms. Harper described
the impact that each of the proposals would have on students at the University of
Michigan. She also described the advantages of the Federal Direct Student Loan
Program, noting that it had worked very successfully at the University of
Michigan.
Research Funding. Vice President Neal reported that the University is
presenting the argument in Washington that support of higher education and
research is in the best interest of the nation. He described the importance of
research funding at the University of Michigan, noting that the salaries of some
researchers and faculty members are paid by research grants. These grants also
provide financial aid for student workers in laboratories and offices, as well as
finding for equipment, travel, and other research-related expenses.
Vice President Neal and Mr. Samors then gave a presentation illustrating
the effect that proposed changes in federal research funding would have on the
University of Michigan. They also described the federal relations activities of the
Office of the Vice President for Research and described the activities of the Council on Institutional Cooperation (CIC).
Regent McFee commented that she believed it was time to accept the fact
that finding for research grants will be reduced; however, it will not be eliminated and the competition for grants will become more fierce and political than
ever. If the University is to maintain its dominant position in receiving federal
grants, the faculty must continue to submit grant proposals that are strong, with
a high value to society, and the University must continue to strengthen its supportive efforts in the award decision process.
Regarding the subject of financial aid, Regent McFee noted that programs
that began as assistance for students with dire need have now become a way of
life for a majority of students. She believes that incentives should be found to
help families save money for college, rather than to rely so heavily on financial
aid and borrowing.
President Duderstadt noted that Congress has not yet begun to address the
real problem, which is how to cope with the massive amount of money being
spent on entitlements. He believes that "we have lost the capacity to invest in
our future, and to make the commitment to our future that past generations
have made for us."
Regarding student financial aid, Regent Varner observed that there are
many families that don't have the means to be able to save money to send their
children to college, and their children should not be sacrificed to straighten out
the entitlements situation. She added that it is unfair for children of poor


346




June Meeting, 1995


families to have to face the kinds of cuts and reductions that have been proposed
in order to get through school.
President Duderstadt responded that the University of Michigan has a long
tradition of not allowing economic need to deprive talented students of the
opportunity to get an education. Regardless of actions taken on the federal level,
it is important for the University to keep its commitment to meet the financial
need of all resident undergraduate students. Regent McFee expressed agreement
with this commitment, noting that due to the possibility that actions taken in
Washington will affect the University's ability to continue to fulfill that obligation, it is important to continue to search for ways to improve the plights of families so that fewer of them will need financial aid.
There followed a five minute recess, after which the meeting continued with
the public comments session.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Flint Wainess, president of MSA and Scott Sandler, member of MSA,
on student representation on the Board of Regents; and Vincent Keenan, vice
chair of the Student Rights Commission, updating the Board on the commission's concerns with progress on the revision of the Statement of Student Rights
and Responsibilities.
Following Public Comments, the Regents continued to meet in executive
sessiono
Friday, June 16, 1995
The Regents met at 9:15 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Deitch, Horning, McFee, McGowan, Newman,
and Power. Secretary Jensen, Executive Vice President Womack, and Provost
Whitaker were also present, as were Vice Presidents Harrison, Hartford, Kinnear, and Neal and Chancellors Nelms and Renick. Regent Varner was absent.
Higher Education Appropriations Bill. President Duderstadt called the
meeting to order and announced that the Michigan state legislature had
approved the higher education appropriations bill for 1995-96. He expressed
gratitude to legislators for having provided an additional $18.8 million in
one-time funding to public institutions, while modifying constructively language
having to do with the state's public universities' obligation to provide undergraduate education to academically qualified citizens. These actions are responsive to the interests of higher education, while they reflect a commitment to
higher education that is important to the future.
The president also pointed out the newly revised undergraduate admissions
bulletin which had been distributed to the Regents.


347




June Meeting, 1995


UM-Dearborn Faculty Senate Budget Committee Report
Professor Donald Anderson presented the annual report of the UMDearborn Faculty Senate Budget Committee. He pointed out that the campus
has improved in terms of national rankings using AAUP figures. However, according to HEIDI statistics, while assistant professors' salaries are very competitive, those for associate and full professors are not. This is even more pronounced
when compared against institutions that do not offer engineering programs.
Professor Anderson also raised the issue of salary compression, which is especially apparent when comparing the difference in average salary for assistant
and associate professors. He concluded by observing that historically, faculty
salaries do seem to improve when this issue is given high priorit y by the
administration.
Michigan Student Assembly Audit Report
Vice President Hartford invited MSA executive officers Flint Wainess and
Sam Goodstein to the table. She noted that Plante & Moran had conducted a
review of MSA financial matters and submitted the audited financial report and
management letter for the year ended December 31, 1994. Vice President Hartford observed that MSA continues to improve its fiscal management and oversight and has been very cooperative in working with the auditors.
Michigan Student Assembly Fee Assessments
The originally submitted Regents Communication requests approval of an
increase of $0.25 per student per term for MSA and for maintaining the current
fees of $3.93 per student per term for Student Legal Services (SLS) and $1.00 per
student per term for school/college governments. Mr. Wainess announced that on
the recommendation of MSA, Vice President Hartford was now recommending
an increase of $0.23 per student per term for SLS, to be held in escrow and distributed to SLS in November 1995 contingent upon approval of a student
referendum to increase the fee by that amount.
Vice President Hartford observed that SLS employs permanent, fall-time
staff who have not received raises in three years and who do not receive fringe
benefits. This has been an ongoing problem for MSA, and while the current
proposal would help alleviate the immediate problem, it would not solve the
long-range dilemma about funding for Student Legal Services.
Regent Power commented that while MSA alone has the authority to determine its own spending priorities, once MSA sets up an organization like SLS
with permanent, fill-time employees, MSA has an obligation to act like a responsible employer.
Regent Power moved approval of the following fee assessments: $2.94 per
student per term for MSA, $4.16 per term for SLS (to be held in escrow and
distributed to SLS in November 1995 only if a student referendum is approved
allowing for an increase of $0.23 per student per term in the MSA fee cap), and

June Meeting, 1995


$1.00 per student per term for school/college governments. Regent Newman
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Student Representation at Regents' Meetings
Regent McFee commented that there had been ongoing discussions among
members of the Board and MSA representatives about improving communications between the Regents and students. She moved adoption of the following
resolution, which she had developed in cooperation with Mr. Flint Wainess.
Regents' Resolution
WHEREAS, the University of Michigan Board of Regents
recognizes the value and importance of understanding and responding to the views of the University's students as expressed by their
elected representatives in the Michigan Student Assembly (MSA);
and
WHEREAS, the Regents are also cognizant of the need for a
more formal and regular means of communicating with students
than has existed heretofore;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the executive officers of MSA be invited to submit monthly reports to the Board of Regents, to be included in the Regents' monthly packet;
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the president of MSA,
or the president's authorized representative, be provided designated
seating during public meetings in the Regents' Room; be available
for direct communication initiated by the Regents; and be afforded
bi-annual opportunities to address the Regents regarding specific
student concerns.
Regent Newman seconded the motion.
Regent McGowan observed that she was surprised by this resolution, both
because it varied significantly from earlier discussions, and because it was being
brought forth at a time when students were absent from campus. She also
commented that Mr. Wainess had been quoted in the Michigan Daily on June
14, 1995, as being skeptical about this proposal and that yesterday had expressed
"wholehearted support" during the Public Comments session. However, given
that he was the popularly-elected student representative she was supportive of
the recommendation, both in its substance and on the timing.
Mr. Wainess responded to Regent McGowan's concerns, noting that what he
had meant to imply was that this resolution would be a good resource to have in
place and it would be worthwhile to try it.
Regent Power clarified that this resolution would not be a "foot in the door"
to be expanded, but rather is a plan that would be set in place. Mr. Wainess concurred with that assessment.

Vice President Hartford thanked Mr. Wainess for following up on the efforts of
past MSA presidents Craig Greenberg and Julie Neenan.

Personnel Actions. Provost Whitaker pointed out the recommendation of
Robert Weisbuch as interim dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies. Chancellors Renick and Nelns submitted several personnel recommendations. President Duderstadt pointed out the recommendation for Bernard
Machen, dean of the School of Dentistry, as interim provost effective September
1,1995.
Regent Baker requested that Dean Machen's appointment be considered
separately from the consent agenda.
Regent Baker moved approval of all of the personnel actions except for the
appointment of Dean Machen. Regent McGowan seconded that motion, and it
was approved unanimously.

June Meeting, 1995


Appointment of J. Bernard Machen as Interim Provost
Regent McGowan moved approval of the appointment of J. Bernard Machen
as interim provost and vice president for academic affairs, effective September 1,
1995. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Regent Baker read from a prepared statement, a copy of which is on file in
the Office of the Secretary of the University. He stated his intention to vote
against the confirmation of Dr. Machen as interim provost because he had hoped
that Provost Whitaker would have agreed to remain in his position until the new
provost is in place. He also was voting against the appointment because in his
judgment, Dr. Machen had not answered fully and completely questions that he
had posed to Dr. Machen when he had reported to the Regents on the results of
the Bylaw 14.06 Implementation Task Force, which Dr. Machen had chaired.
The purpose of that task force had been to make recommendations on the
implementation with regard to certain University benefits and policies of the
Regents' revision of its nondiscrimination bylaw (Bylaw 14.06) to include sexual
orientation. Regent Baker had not agreed with the Task Force's recommendation
and had spoken against it. Regent Baker stated that during the meeting at which
the task force recommendation had been discussed, he had asked several questions of Dr. Machen which had not been answered fully and completely. Regent
Baker wanted to emphasize that because Regents are elected officials charged
with setting institutional policy and oversight of policy implementation, "any
question asked by any Regent [of any university administrator or employee] deserves a fiull and complete answer."
Regent McGowan responded that at the meeting in question, Dr. Machen
had answered as best he could the questions that had been put to him. She
observed that "when any University employee takes on a difficult task,
approaches it as fairly as possible..., and reaches a conclusion that people can
understandably differ on..., that individual should not suffer any consequences...
[from the Regents] for that service and the outcome."
Regent Deitch expressed his support for Regent McGowan's remarks, noting
that Dr. Machen is "a University citizen of great distinction,... who shows his
continuous dedication to the University... by accepting this position." He said
that he was delighted that Dr. Machen had agreed to accept this position and
that the University was lucky to have him on its faculty.
Regent Power observed that the willingness of members of the University
community to take on extra duties is one of the things that makes it a remarkable institution. When people take on extra duties that involve struggling with
difficult problems and then bring their views to the Board, "the fact that one or
more Regents may disagree with these views should not be an excuse for carrying
out a vendetta against the individual who led to them."
Regent Horning commented that although he had been personally opposed
to the bylaw change, it was a Board decision, and it would be unfair to penalize a
person who was charged with carrying out that Board decision. He expressed his
wholehearted support for Dean Machen's appointment.

June Meeting, 1995


Regent Baker responded that his comments were only directed to the need
for Regents to receive fifil and complete answers to questions, and his intent was
not to punish anyone.
Regent McGowan reiterated that it is inappropriate for any Regent to penalize an individual for performing a public service, just because the Regent
disagreed with the results of that public service.
Regent Newman expressed her agreement with Regent Horning's comments, noting that the Board made the decision, not the task force led by Dr.
Machen. Even though she was opposed to the bylaw change, it is wrong to
penalize someone for serving on a task force.
The vote was then taken, and the motion to appoint Bernard Machen as
interim provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, effective
September 1, 1995, was approved on a vote of seven to one, with Regent Baker
opposed.
